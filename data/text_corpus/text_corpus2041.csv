10205,direct seeded planting pattern is considered as a practicable substitute to transplanting planting pattern because it has the advantages of saving labor low input cost high water use efficiency and easy to manage however the comparison between different direct seeded rice oilseed rape rotation systems and traditional transplanting rice transplanting oilseed rape rotation system ttr tpo has rarely been studied in this study the annual yield water consumption water use efficiency and economic benefits of different rice oilseed rotation systems were compared during the rice and oilseed rape growing seasons from 2018 to 2020 our results show that the average annual yield and water consumption of wet direct seeded rice direct seeded oilseed rape rotation system wdsr dso and wet direct seeded rice transplanting oilseed rape rotation system wdsr tpo were significant higher than that of ttr tpo and ttr dso annual yield of dry direct seeded rice direct seeded oilseed rape rotation system ddsr dso and ttr tpo was similar but the water consumption of ddsr dso was reduced by 22 6 on an average than that of ttr tpo irrigation water use efficiency wuei and net economic return of ddsr dso were the highest which were 72 3 and 15 2 higher than ttr tpo respectively on the contrary wuei and net economic return was similar between wdsr dso wdsr tpo and ttr tpo traditional transplanting rice direct seeded oilseed rape rotation system ttr dso here we show that ddsr dso is an alternative to ttr tpo in central china due to higher wuei and net economic return less water consumption and similar annual yield in addition wdsr dso and wdsr tpo may be suitable for regions where water levels are high for soil puddling during land preparation and rainfall is sufficient in the rice growth season keywords rice oilseed rape rotation system irrigation water use efficiency net economic return rice oilseed rape water consumption 1 introduction rice is the second largest cereal crop in china and 32 of the total grain output and more than 50 of the people take rice as staple food nbs 2019 oilseed rape is the largest oil crop in china and occupies nearly one third of the world s rapeseed planting area and total production which can provide 5 2 million tons of high quality edible rapeseed oil every year for china h z wang et al 2007 rice oilseed rape rotation is a kind of paddy upland rotation cropping pattern in which rice and oilseed rape are alternately planted on the same land in an orderly manner wang et al 2011 rice oilseed rape rotation system have obvious advantages including high annual yield per unit land area land use efficiency light and temperature utilization rate and economic benefits and it is of great significance to ensure food and edible oil security production of china in limited land huang et al 2014 the differences of root system fertilizer and water requirement between rice and oilseed rape can regulate soil fertility improve soil structure and soil ecological environment li et al 2012 moreover rotation planting can reduce or eliminate the pathogens in the soil and reduce the occurrence of diseases larkin et al 2010 therefore rice oilseed rape rotation is a high yielded and high efficiency environment friendly agricultural rotation planting system in recent years the problems are at growth stages b wang et al 2007 soil fertility decline pu et al 2012 and low economic benefits cong et al 2019 have seriously restricted the development of traditional transplanting rice transplanting oilseed rape rotation system ttr tpo and which resulting in the reduction of planting area of rice oilseed rape rotation in the yangtze river basin from 6 324 million hectares in 2015 to 5 869 million hectares in 2019 in addition ttr tpo has long growth period high labor intensity high production cost and low economic benefit which cannot meet the requirements of modern agricultural development therefore a lightened simplified and high efficient rice oilseed rape rotation system is necessary compared with the traditional transplanting planting pattern mechanical transplanting and direct seeding are two main light simplified culture patterns among them the mechanical transplanting culture pattern needs seedling raising process and high level of land preparation and there are some problems such as serious transplanting shock and low root development or plant adjustment after seedling transplanting jin et al 2020 on the contrary compared with the traditional transplanting planting pattern the direct seeding planting pattern got rid of the process of seedling raising and transplanting and has the advantages of saving labor water and seedling field etc farooq et al 2011 therefore the direct seeding planting pattern is a lighten and simplified cropping pattern conforming to the contemporary agricultural development previous research indicated that direct seeded rice dsr has emerged as an attractive and practicable alternative to traditional transplanting rice ttr which including dry direct seeded rice ddsr and wet direct seeded rice wdsr liu et al 2015 sun et al 2015 tao et al 2016 this system involves the direct sowing of dry and sprouted rice seeds by hand or machine which has been proposed to save energy and suitable for rice mechanized planting up to now more than 28 of total rice cultivation area is under dsr system and the ratio is increasing gradually in china zhang et al 2012 and many researches have compared the performance of greenhouse gases emission water and nitrogen use efficacy crop yield and soil properties between dsr and ttr ahmad et al 2009 huang et al 2011 kumar et al 2016 wang et al 2017 compared with ttr the greenhouse gases emission and global warming potential were considerably decreased in ddsr and wdsr and the water productivity was significantly increased in ddsr and wdsr tao et al 2016 wassmann et al 2004 additionally liu et al 2015 indicated that ddsr reduced the water consumption by 15 3 and increased the nitrogen use efficiency for grain by 15 7 compared with ttr many studies indicated that the grain yield of wdsr and ddsr furnished similar or even higher than that of ttr ali et al 2006 wang et al 2017 furthermore soil aeration oxygen content ion exchange capacity and nutrient content of dsr were higher than ttr and soil structure was better than ttr zou et al 2003 so direct seeded rice is a high yielded and high efficiency lightened and simplified cultivation mode alternative to ttr as the largest oilseed rape producer china occupies 23 3 of the global oilseed rape cultivation area and contributes 22 2 of the global oilseed rapeseed production fao 2010 the reaches of the yangtze river is the largest oilseed rapeseed belt in the world and the planting area and yield account for about 90 of the total amount in china yin et al 2010 there are two oilseed rape cultivation patterns direct seeded oilseed rape dso and transplanting oilseed rape tpo at present each cultivation patterns accounts for 50 of the total planting area respectively in the reaches of the yangtze river h z wang et al 2007 among them tpo has the disadvantages of large labor force high labor intensity and low planting efficiency with the increase of labor costs and the loss of rural labor force the cultivation method of tpo has been unable to adapt the current oilseed rape production wang et al 2014 compared with tpo dso simplified the cultivation process reduced labor and decreased the cost of oilseed rape production increased the yield resource use efficiency economic benefit and shorted the growth duration kuai et al 2018 wang et al 2011 in addition dso avoids the transplanting shock and promotes the development of root system singh and singh 2014 overall dso is a more efficient and light simplified cultivation method compared with tpo considering the advantages of dsr and dso direct seeded rice direct seeded oilseed rape rotation system dsr dso might be a promising rotation system in central china however there is a lack of systematic research on the comparison between different direct seeded rice oilseed rape rotation systems and ttr tpo fig 1 therefore the objectives of the current study were 1 to compare the differences in growth duration annual yield irrigation water use efficiency and economic benefits between different direct seeded rice oilseed rape rotation systems and ttr tpo 2 to select a high yield and high efficiency rice oilseed rape rotation system suitable for planting in central china and 3 to provide feasibility analysis for rice oilseed rape rotation in central china so as to better guide the production of rice oilseed rape rotation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiments were carried out during rice and oilseed rape growing seasons from 2018 to 2020 in hegang village 32ยบ12 n 112ยบ36 e zhangjiaji town xiangyang county total nitrogen n available phosphorus potassium and organic matter in the upper 20 cm of soil before rice planting were 0 13 13 2 mg kg 1 90 0 mg kg 1 and 18 14 g kg 1 respectively in 2018 while in 2020 the total nitrogen n available phosphorus potassium and organic matter were recorded as 0 12 15 09 mg kg 1 79 78 mg kg 1 17 36 g kg 1 respectively two hybrid rice cultivars liangyou6326 and hanyou73 were selected as planting material the average value of the two varieties was used to analyze the rice data owing to the performance of the two rice varieties was basically the same while one oilseed rape cultivar huayouza 62 a brassica napus hybrid oilseed rapeseed was selected as planting material three rice planting patterns ddsr wdsr and ttr and two oilseed rape cultivation methods dso and tpo were laid out in randomized complete block design rcbd under split plot arrangement with four replications three different rice cultivation methods ddsr wdsr and ttr and two oilseed rape culture methods were combined to compose six rice oilseed rape rotation systems ddsr dso ddsr tpo wdsr dso wdsr tpo ttr dso and ttr tpo fig 1 there were 24 plots in rice growth season and the area of each plot was 60 m2 10 m 6 m and there are 48 plots in oilseed rape growth season the area of each plot was 30 m2 5 m 6 m in the plots of ddsr wdsr and dso dry seeds were manually sown in rows and row to row distance was maintained about 30 cm the seed rate of direct seeded rice and direct seeded oilseed rape were 30 kg ha 1 and 4 5 kg ha 1 respectively oilseed rape seedlings were thinned at the 5th leaf stage and the planting density was guaranteed to be 20 plants m 2 in ddsr and wdsr plots the dry rice seeds were sown on 3th june and 23th may in 2018 and 2019 respectively in ttr plots the sowing of rice seeds in nursery bed was done on 8th june and 22th may and seedlings were transplanted on 25nd june and 15nd june at a hill spacing of 30 0 13 3 cm with two seedlings per hill respectively in 2018 and 2019 after harvesting of rice the sowing of oilseed rape seeds in nursery bed was done on 12th october and 4th october and seedlings 30 day old were transplanted at a hill spacing of 30 0 16 5 cm with one seedling per hill in 2018 and 2019 respectively 2 2 water and fertilizer management in ddsr plot the land was dry ploughed and harrowed without puddling and rainfall was used as the main irrigation source and the extra irrigation was conducted as according to the soil water potential during the whole growth period of rice in wdsr plots the soil was flooded plowed harrowed and puddled there was no water layer on the surface of soil when sowing irrigation was carried out one week after sowing and then the water layer was maintained at 3 10 cm until one week before harvest in ttr plot the soil was flooded plowed harrowed and puddled a 1 3 cm water layer was kept during the first week after transplanting and then the flooded water was kept at the same level with 5 10 cm water depth until one week before harvest after rice harvest dry tillage and dry land preparation were adopted due to sufficient rainfall dso and tpo were rain fed in the whole growth period until harvest in rice growth season fertilizer management of ddsr and wdsr were the same as that for ttr all the treatments were fertilized with 150 90 120 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o all the p2o5 33 n and 50 k2o were applied as basal fertilizers the remaining n dose was equally split at mid tillering and panicle initiation stages while the remaining k2o was top dressed at panicle initiation stage the zinc was applied as basal dose at 5 kg ha 1 in the form of zinc sulfate at the same time in oilseed rape growth season fertilizer management of dso was the same as that for tpo all the treatments were fertilized with 200 90 120 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o all the p2o5 60 n and 75 k2o were applied as basal fertilizers the remaining n dose was equally split at overwintering and bolting stages while the remaining k2o was top dressed at bolting stage boron fertilizer 11 b was applied as basal dose at 15 kg ha 1 weeds were removed manually and diseases and insects were intensively controlled in all plots 2 3 data recorded 2 3 1 weather data the meteorological data including maximum and minimum temperature average temperature and rainfall and solar radiation during the period of study were collected from a weather observatory aws800 campbell scientific inc usa near the experimental field meteorological data were recorded from may 10 2018 to may 10 2020 including the daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and rainfall fig 2 during the whole rice growing season the total rainfall was 200 5 mm and 162 1 mm and daily average temperature was 26 8 and 26 5 respectively in 2018 and 2019 among them the rainfall mainly focused on july and august in 2018 fig 2b and june and july in 2019 fig 2d whereas the high temperature daily maximum temperature 35 c occurred more frequently in 2018 fig 2a than that in 2019 fig 2c furthermore rice suffered relatively long term high temperature stress at flowering stage in 2019 than that of in 2018 during the whole oilseed rape growing season the total rainfall was 177 8 and 208 8 mm daily average temperature was 9 59 and 10 6 and effective accumulated temperature was 2041 7 and 2368 7 respectively in 2019 and 2020 2 3 2 soil and water irrigation data soil samples were collected one day before land preparation from five different points with 0 20 cm depth from each plot and mixed well about 500 g soil sample was taken and dried at room temperature ground and then passed through a 2 mm sieve for further soil analysis the ph organic matter alkali hydrolyzed n available p and k were determined according to the method of bao 1999 the soil water potential of ddsr plot was measured by the soil water potential instrument jz trsii beijing jiuzhou sheng xin technology co ltd which was measured after every 7 days to determine whether ddsr should be irrigated or not and irrigation was conducted when soil water potential was lower than 30 kpa however at panicle initiation stage pi stage irrigation was conducted when soil water potential was lower than 15 kpa moreover the irrigation amount of each plots were accurately recorded by the installed water meter which was used to measure the water use efficiency of rice oilseed rape and rice oilseed rape rotation system the irrigation water use efficiency wuei was calculated according to formulas fernรกndez et al 2020 1 wue i kg m 3 yield per unit area kg irrigation water use amount per unit area m 3 however since the rape season was rain fed without irrigation its wuei is 0 additionally when calculating the wuei of rice oilseed rape rotation system the annual yield was the sum of rice yield and rape equivalent yield 2 3 3 growth analysis and yield measurement of rice and oilseed rape each plot was sampled at mid of tillering stage pi heading stage hd and maturity stage ms for growth analysis of rice among them 0 6 m2 plant samples were taken from each plot of ddsr and wdsr and 12 plants 0 48 m2 were taken from ttr then the number of tillers leaf area by leaf area meter li 3100 li cor inc lincoln ne usa and aboveground biomass were measured at the same time six plants 0 25 m2 were sampled from each plot at seedling stage ss bolting stage bs flowering stage fs and fully ripened stage fr for oilseed rape growth analysis root dry weight leaf area and aboveground biomass were measured as according to the method of determination in rice in the ms of rice and fr of oilseed rape the representative area with the same growth trend was selected as the yield measurement area in the middle of each plot among them 4 8 m2 2 4 2 m plant samples were taken for dso ddsr and wdsr plot and 2 4 m 8 rows wide and 2 m long 15 hills for ttr and tpo after harvesting the rice was threshed manually and dried in the sun then the impurities and empty shriveled grains were removed by air separation machine after the grains were placed in the room until the moisture absorption balance of the grains the total weight of grain was weighed with a balance 0 01 g and the moisture content of the grain was determined by the grain moisture meter pm 8188 a japan repeated for 3 times and the average value was taken finally grain yield was adjusted to standard moisture content 0 14 g h2o g 1 and 0 09 g h2o g 1 fresh weight for rice and oilseed rape respectively energy analysis investigations have been undertaken worldwide to compare different farming systems and crop rotations among others variables hรผlsbergen et al 2001 moreno et al 2011 calorific values of rice grain and oilseed rapeseed were 16 80 and 17 92 mj kg 1 respectively chen et al 2000 chen 2011 oilseed rape yield equivalent was calculated as 2 oilseed rape yield equivalent yield of oilseed rape 1 792 1 680 3 annual yield oilseed rape yield equivalent rice yield 2 3 4 economic benefits record the annual expenditure of agricultural materials such as seed pesticide chemical fertilizer irrigation ploughing the whole field and machinery use as well as the labor input such as sowing fertilization spraying pesticide and irrigation etc at the same time the unit price of labor the purchase price of oilseed rape and rice and the seed price were understood at current year which used to calculate and analyze the economic benefits of each rotation system for economic analysis we widely adopted definitions of revenue and costs thus we considered the economic return as the yield market value of rice and oilseed rape for the economic costs we considered include variable costs vc and fixed costs fc among them the vc were defined by production unit as the costs that varied with the outputs or the returns fernรกndez et al 2020 in this study vc included raw material costs seed fertilizer and pesticides and labor costs irrigation programming sowing or planting harvesting and phytosanitary treatments additionally the fc accounted for the costs that remained unchanged irrespective of the output level for a time period of one year in our study the fc mainly include the machinery costs which were associated with ploughing irrigation and harvesting 4 net economic return total economic return fc vc 2 3 5 data analysis using excel 2010 microsoft office to organize data and data were analyzed by analysis of variance using statistix 9 0 analytical software tallahassee fl usa the differences between treatments were separated using the least significance difference lsd test at the 0 05 0 01 and 0 001probability levels graphical representation of the data was performed using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 comparison of whole system growth duration and annual yield under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems the overall performance of annual growth duration was ddsr dso wdsr dso ttr dso ddsr tpo wdsr tpo ttr tpo the same trends were observed between two years table 1 furthermore the average whole growth duration in 2018 2019 was 14 days shorter than that of in 2019 2020 while the rice and oilseed rape growth duration in 2018 2019 were 8 days and 5 days shorter than that of in 2019 2020 respectively different rice oilseed rape rotation planting systems had significant effects on rice yield oilseed rape yield and annual yield table 2 the annual yield of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo was the highest which was significantly higher than that of ttr dso and ttr tpo the same trends was observed between 2018 and 2019 and 2019 2020 in rice growth season the yield of wdsr was significantly higher than that of ddsr and ttr the same trends was observed in two years among them the rice yield in wdsr was 10 23 and 9 25 t ha 1 which was significantly higher than that in ddsr 9 52 and 8 28 t ha 1 and ttr 9 21 and 8 29 t ha 1 during 2018 and 2019 respectively in oilseed rape growth season the yield of ddsr dso was the highest and which was significantly higher than that of other rotation systems in 2019 in addition the average yield of rice season oilseed rape season and annual system in 2018 2019 were significantly higher than those in 2019 2020 and increased by 11 7 7 7 and 10 9 respectively 3 2 comparison of total water consumption and wuei under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems the annual water consumption mainly showed wdwr dso and wdsr tpo ttr dso and ttr tpo ddsr dso and ddsr tpo the trend was consistent between two years table 3 the average total water consumption of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo were increased by 18 6 and 14 5 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 compared with ttr tpo respectively on the contrary the average total water consumption of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo decreased by 24 7 and 25 3 than ttr tpo in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively in addition the total water consumption in rice season was showed that wdsr ttr ddsr which was consistent in two years compared with the ttr the total water consumption of wdsr in rice season increased by 19 6 and 17 1 on the contrary the total water consumption of ddsr in rice season decreased by 29 0 and 29 8 respectively in 2018 and 2019 furthermore there were significant differences in wuei of rice season and whole system under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems fig 3 the wuei of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo was significantly higher than that of other rice oilseed rape rotation systems which was consistent in two years fig 3b however since the rape season was rain fed without irrigation its wuei is 0 while wuei of ddsr was increased by 94 2 and 84 6 in 2018 65 1 and 61 8 in 2019 respectively as compared with wdsr and ttr fig 3a 3 3 comparison of economic benefits under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems there were significant differences in total economic costs under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems showing wdsr tpo wdsr dso ttr tpo ttr dso ddsr tpo ddsr dso the trend was consistent between two years table 4 at the same time obvious differences in variable costs vc and fixed costs fc were also observed under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems among them the total raw materials costs were in the sequence of ddsr dso and wdsr dso ddsr tpo and wdsr tpo ttr dso and ttr tpo additionally the total labor costs were showed that ttr tpo wdsr tpo ttr dso wdsr dso ddsr tpo ddsr dso furthermore total machinery costs was indicated that ddsr dso and ddsr tpo significantly lower than other rotation systems in summary the total economic cost of ddsr dso was the least mainly resulting from the total labor costs and machinery cost was significantly lower than other rice oilseed rape rotation systems compared with ttr tpo the total labor cost and the machinery cost of ddsr dso was decreased by 46 8 and 13 2 respectively ddsr dso has the highest net economic return and the same performance was observed in two years table 4 the net economic return of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo was increased by 22 6 12 3 and 7 8 5 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively as compared with ttr tpo the net economic return of wdsr dso was significantly higher than ttr tpo in 2018 2019 but there was no significant difference in 2019 2020 meanwhile there was no significant difference on the net economic return between wdsr tpo and ttr tpo in 2018 2019 on the contrary the net economic return of wdsr tpo was significantly higher than ttr tpo in 2019 2020 3 4 growth analysis of rice and oilseed rape under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems different rice planting patterns had significant effects on number of tillers lai and aboveground biomass of rice at different growth stages and the overall performance was wdsr ddsr ttr fig 4 among them the aboveground biomass and lai of ddsr and wdsr were significantly higher than that of ttr at each growth period the trend was basically the same in two years except that there was no significant difference in aboveground biomass between ddsr and ttr in 2019 fig 4 a b c d additionally the results showed that the number of tillers in the early growth stage was wdsr ddsr ttr but there was no significant difference at maturity stage and the two year trend was the same fig 4e f the ratio of productive tiller of wdsr ddsr and ttr were 44 6 66 15 83 25 and 47 9 49 9 57 8 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 4 e f different rice oilseed rape rotation systems had significant effects on root dry weight and aboveground biomass of oilseed rape fig 5 among them the aboveground biomass of oilseed rape under ddsr dso was the highest but there was no significant difference among other rotation systems moreover the trend was the same in two years the root dry weight of dso was significantly higher than that of tpo at each growth period and the trend was basically the same in two years 4 discussion the differences in annual yield rice season and oilseed rape season yields between 2019 and 2020 and 2018 2019 maybe closely related to the meteorological conditions between two years among them the average yield of rice in 2019 is significantly lower than in 2018 which may be related to the decrease of seed setting rate caused by high temperature at flowering stage in 2019 table 2 and fig 2 it is also consistent with the results of previous studies that high temperature at flowering stage significantly reduced rice yield lawas et al 2018 shi et al 2008 the yield of oilseed rape in 2020 was significantly lower than in 2019 which may be related to the total rainfall and effective accumulated temperature in 2020 was 208 8 mm and 2368 7 which are higher than in 2019 177 8 mm and 2041 7 respectively the relationship between meteorological factors in the yangtze river basin and oilseed rape yield were analyzed the results showed that rainfall and effective accumulated temperature were negatively correlated with winter oilseed rape yield cong et al 2019 therefore the difference of average annual yield between two years may be closely related to high temperature in rice at flowering stage and rainfall and effective accumulated temperature in oilseed rape growth season with the aggravation of global climate change the impact of climate change on rice oilseed rape rotation planting system will be further explored it is of guiding significance for how to obtain high and stable yield of rice and rape under the rotation system and it is also of great significance to ensure the safe production of grain and edible oil in the world in this study the root dry weight aboveground biomass and yield of oilseed rape under ddsr dso and ddsr tpo were higher than that of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo table 2 and fig 1 5 moreover our results showed that the nitrate nitrogen and urease activities of ddsr were significantly higher than those of wdsr and ttr fig s1 previous studies showed that the higher the nitrate nitrogen content and urease activity in the soil the stronger the soil nitrogen supply capacity the more conducive to the growth of subsequent crops and the improvement of yield nyborg and malhi 1989 therefore the difference in root dry weight aboveground biomass and yield of oilseed rape between ddsr dso ddsr tpo and wdsr dso wdsr tpo may resulted from the soil properties was changed between ddsr and wdsr soil microbes are considered to be an indicator of soil quality and play an important role in mediating soil ecosystem functioning sharma et al 2010 the changes in microbial communities may be linked to plant growth and productivity she et al 2018 wang et al 2018 previous studies indicated that different rice planting patterns had significant effects on soil microbial communities which affected soil physical and chemical properties and subsequent crop yields dai et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 the fungi glomeromycota and chytridiomycota were significantly impacted by crop rotation which play a key role in soil aggregation formation and stabilization and cellulose degradation guo et al 2020 moreover the crop rotations wheat rice wheat soybean and wheat corn greatly alter microbial physiology diversity and community structure wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 therefore the differences of soil microbial community among different rice oilseed rape rotation systems need to be further explored ddsr dso had the best performance on the total water consumption wuei and net economic return and the annual yield of ddsr dso was higher than that of in ttr tpo tables 2 3 and fig 3 which could be used as an alternative to ttr tpo in central china on one hand the annual wuei of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo was significantly higher than that of other rotation systems which mainly resulted from the annual water consumption of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo was significantly lower than other rice oilseed rape rotation systems fig 3b table 3 moreover owing to oilseed rape is mainly rain fed the difference of annual water consumption between different rotation systems is mainly caused by the difference of water consumption on soil preparation and irrigation in rice season table 3 previous studies indicated that the water consumption of ddsr during land preparation and irrigation were significantly lower than wdsr and ttr and wuei of ddsr was significantly higher than wdsr and ttr tao et al 2016 furthermore it was consistent with the results of this study fig 3a table 3 at the same time root development is affected by soil water content or water irrigation amount kato and okami 2010 the root growth in ddsr was much more vigorous than that in both ttr liu et al 2015 previous study indicated that ddsr could increase drought tolerance of rice by promoting root elongation under the aerobic soil conditions as compared with ttr henry et al 2011 wang et al 2017 further the lodging resistance of dso was stronger than tpo which owing to the root system of dso distributes in deeper soil layer b wang et al 2007 therefore compared with the ttr tpo ddsr dso could also reduce lodging risk and has good yield stability in addition previously reported results showed that rice establishment method has significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions ch4 and n2o and global warming potential wang et al 2017 some studies also indicates that greenhouse gas emissions and global warming potential gwp from ddsr was significantly lower than that from wdsr and ttr liu et al 2015 tao et al 2016 weller et al 2015 therefore compared with ttr tpo ddsr dso could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and gwp on the other hand the net economic return of ddsr dso was significantly higher than ttr tpo furthermore the total economic input of ddsr dso was significantly lower than that of ttr tpo table 4 compared with ttr tpo ddsr dso has lower labors cost mainly including the cost of sowing or transplanting but had more seed and pesticide input seed consumption and weed control are always two important factors that restrict the development of direct seeded planting patterns the main reason for the large amount of seeds consumption in the direct seeded planting pattern was the low seedling survival rate previous studies have showed that seed coating and seed priming are two important techniques to solve the problem of low emergence rate of direct seeded seeds ashraf and foolad 2005 nie et al 2020 wang et al 2016 reported that selenium priming and salicylic acid priming could significantly improve the germination rate of direct seeded rice seeds under growth chamber and field conditions it is also reported that pelleting treatments with cao2 significantly increased seed germination and seedling growth of dsr under water logging conditions compared with other pelleted seeds without cao2 and naked seeds mei et al 2017 secondly the high weeds growth is another important factor limiting the development of direct seeded planting patterns many studies had been carried out on weed control under direct seeded planting mode the results showed that sensor based mechanical weed control technology gene editing technology alternative tillage and crop establishment system technology were effective control technologies of weeds kumaran et al 2020 machleb et al 2020 pittelkow et al 2012 therefore it is very significant to introduce effective pre sowing seed treatment technology and weed control technology to further improve the annual yield and net economic return of ddsr dso finally although the economic benefits and wuei of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo are lower than that of ddsr dso their annual yields were the highest which were significantly higher than those of ttr tpo and ttr dso table 3 fig 3 on one hand the season of high annual yield of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo were the yield of wdsr was significantly higher than that of ddsr and ttr as compared with ddsr dso table 2 in addition previous studies showed that the yield of wdsr was significantly higher than ddsr and ttr mainly due to its aboveground biomass lai and number of total spikelets per unit area was significantly higher that of ddsr and ttr tao et al 2016 which was basically consistent with this study fig 4 on the other hand the low wue and economic benefits of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo were mainly caused by the high irrigation volume and frequent irrigation times as compared with ttr dso ttr tpo and ddsr dso tables 2 3 when the rainfall in rice growth season is sufficient the irrigation times and irrigation input of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo will be reduced and the economic benefits will be improved therefore wdsr dso and wdsr tpo could be used as an alternative to ttr tpo or ttr dso when the rainfall is sufficient in the rice growth season 5 conclusion there were significant differences in annual yield water consumption wuei and economic benefits of rice season and whole system under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems the average annual yield and water consumption of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo were significant higher than that of ttr tpo and ttr dso in addition wuei and net economic return was similar between wdsr dso wdsr tpo and ttr tpo ttr dso therefore wdsr dso and wdsr tpo could also be used as an alternative to ttr tpo when the rainfall is sufficient in the rice growth season in addition annual yields of ddsr dso and ttr tpo were similar but the water consumption of ddsr dso was reduced by 22 6 on an average than that of ttr tpo furthermore wuei and net economic return of ddsr dso were the highest which were 30 7 and 15 2 higher than ttr tpo respectively additionally compared with ttr tpo ddsr dso could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and gwp considering of annual yield water consumption wuei net economic return global warming potential or greenhouse gas emissions and yield stability ddsr dso was an alternative to ttr tpo in central china nevertheless in order to further improve the annual yield and economic benefits of ddsr dso effective weed control and pre sowing seed treatment technology is very necessary meanwhile the oilseed rape yield after ddsr was significantly higher than that of after wdsr which resulting from the nitrate nitrogen and urease activities of ddsr were significantly higher than those of wdsr and ttr the changes of microbial community in soil might be related with the differences in crop performances among different rice oilseed rape rotation systems so the differences in soil microbial community among different rice oilseed rape rotation systems need to be addressed in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science

10205,direct seeded planting pattern is considered as a practicable substitute to transplanting planting pattern because it has the advantages of saving labor low input cost high water use efficiency and easy to manage however the comparison between different direct seeded rice oilseed rape rotation systems and traditional transplanting rice transplanting oilseed rape rotation system ttr tpo has rarely been studied in this study the annual yield water consumption water use efficiency and economic benefits of different rice oilseed rotation systems were compared during the rice and oilseed rape growing seasons from 2018 to 2020 our results show that the average annual yield and water consumption of wet direct seeded rice direct seeded oilseed rape rotation system wdsr dso and wet direct seeded rice transplanting oilseed rape rotation system wdsr tpo were significant higher than that of ttr tpo and ttr dso annual yield of dry direct seeded rice direct seeded oilseed rape rotation system ddsr dso and ttr tpo was similar but the water consumption of ddsr dso was reduced by 22 6 on an average than that of ttr tpo irrigation water use efficiency wuei and net economic return of ddsr dso were the highest which were 72 3 and 15 2 higher than ttr tpo respectively on the contrary wuei and net economic return was similar between wdsr dso wdsr tpo and ttr tpo traditional transplanting rice direct seeded oilseed rape rotation system ttr dso here we show that ddsr dso is an alternative to ttr tpo in central china due to higher wuei and net economic return less water consumption and similar annual yield in addition wdsr dso and wdsr tpo may be suitable for regions where water levels are high for soil puddling during land preparation and rainfall is sufficient in the rice growth season keywords rice oilseed rape rotation system irrigation water use efficiency net economic return rice oilseed rape water consumption 1 introduction rice is the second largest cereal crop in china and 32 of the total grain output and more than 50 of the people take rice as staple food nbs 2019 oilseed rape is the largest oil crop in china and occupies nearly one third of the world s rapeseed planting area and total production which can provide 5 2 million tons of high quality edible rapeseed oil every year for china h z wang et al 2007 rice oilseed rape rotation is a kind of paddy upland rotation cropping pattern in which rice and oilseed rape are alternately planted on the same land in an orderly manner wang et al 2011 rice oilseed rape rotation system have obvious advantages including high annual yield per unit land area land use efficiency light and temperature utilization rate and economic benefits and it is of great significance to ensure food and edible oil security production of china in limited land huang et al 2014 the differences of root system fertilizer and water requirement between rice and oilseed rape can regulate soil fertility improve soil structure and soil ecological environment li et al 2012 moreover rotation planting can reduce or eliminate the pathogens in the soil and reduce the occurrence of diseases larkin et al 2010 therefore rice oilseed rape rotation is a high yielded and high efficiency environment friendly agricultural rotation planting system in recent years the problems are at growth stages b wang et al 2007 soil fertility decline pu et al 2012 and low economic benefits cong et al 2019 have seriously restricted the development of traditional transplanting rice transplanting oilseed rape rotation system ttr tpo and which resulting in the reduction of planting area of rice oilseed rape rotation in the yangtze river basin from 6 324 million hectares in 2015 to 5 869 million hectares in 2019 in addition ttr tpo has long growth period high labor intensity high production cost and low economic benefit which cannot meet the requirements of modern agricultural development therefore a lightened simplified and high efficient rice oilseed rape rotation system is necessary compared with the traditional transplanting planting pattern mechanical transplanting and direct seeding are two main light simplified culture patterns among them the mechanical transplanting culture pattern needs seedling raising process and high level of land preparation and there are some problems such as serious transplanting shock and low root development or plant adjustment after seedling transplanting jin et al 2020 on the contrary compared with the traditional transplanting planting pattern the direct seeding planting pattern got rid of the process of seedling raising and transplanting and has the advantages of saving labor water and seedling field etc farooq et al 2011 therefore the direct seeding planting pattern is a lighten and simplified cropping pattern conforming to the contemporary agricultural development previous research indicated that direct seeded rice dsr has emerged as an attractive and practicable alternative to traditional transplanting rice ttr which including dry direct seeded rice ddsr and wet direct seeded rice wdsr liu et al 2015 sun et al 2015 tao et al 2016 this system involves the direct sowing of dry and sprouted rice seeds by hand or machine which has been proposed to save energy and suitable for rice mechanized planting up to now more than 28 of total rice cultivation area is under dsr system and the ratio is increasing gradually in china zhang et al 2012 and many researches have compared the performance of greenhouse gases emission water and nitrogen use efficacy crop yield and soil properties between dsr and ttr ahmad et al 2009 huang et al 2011 kumar et al 2016 wang et al 2017 compared with ttr the greenhouse gases emission and global warming potential were considerably decreased in ddsr and wdsr and the water productivity was significantly increased in ddsr and wdsr tao et al 2016 wassmann et al 2004 additionally liu et al 2015 indicated that ddsr reduced the water consumption by 15 3 and increased the nitrogen use efficiency for grain by 15 7 compared with ttr many studies indicated that the grain yield of wdsr and ddsr furnished similar or even higher than that of ttr ali et al 2006 wang et al 2017 furthermore soil aeration oxygen content ion exchange capacity and nutrient content of dsr were higher than ttr and soil structure was better than ttr zou et al 2003 so direct seeded rice is a high yielded and high efficiency lightened and simplified cultivation mode alternative to ttr as the largest oilseed rape producer china occupies 23 3 of the global oilseed rape cultivation area and contributes 22 2 of the global oilseed rapeseed production fao 2010 the reaches of the yangtze river is the largest oilseed rapeseed belt in the world and the planting area and yield account for about 90 of the total amount in china yin et al 2010 there are two oilseed rape cultivation patterns direct seeded oilseed rape dso and transplanting oilseed rape tpo at present each cultivation patterns accounts for 50 of the total planting area respectively in the reaches of the yangtze river h z wang et al 2007 among them tpo has the disadvantages of large labor force high labor intensity and low planting efficiency with the increase of labor costs and the loss of rural labor force the cultivation method of tpo has been unable to adapt the current oilseed rape production wang et al 2014 compared with tpo dso simplified the cultivation process reduced labor and decreased the cost of oilseed rape production increased the yield resource use efficiency economic benefit and shorted the growth duration kuai et al 2018 wang et al 2011 in addition dso avoids the transplanting shock and promotes the development of root system singh and singh 2014 overall dso is a more efficient and light simplified cultivation method compared with tpo considering the advantages of dsr and dso direct seeded rice direct seeded oilseed rape rotation system dsr dso might be a promising rotation system in central china however there is a lack of systematic research on the comparison between different direct seeded rice oilseed rape rotation systems and ttr tpo fig 1 therefore the objectives of the current study were 1 to compare the differences in growth duration annual yield irrigation water use efficiency and economic benefits between different direct seeded rice oilseed rape rotation systems and ttr tpo 2 to select a high yield and high efficiency rice oilseed rape rotation system suitable for planting in central china and 3 to provide feasibility analysis for rice oilseed rape rotation in central china so as to better guide the production of rice oilseed rape rotation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiments were carried out during rice and oilseed rape growing seasons from 2018 to 2020 in hegang village 32ยบ12 n 112ยบ36 e zhangjiaji town xiangyang county total nitrogen n available phosphorus potassium and organic matter in the upper 20 cm of soil before rice planting were 0 13 13 2 mg kg 1 90 0 mg kg 1 and 18 14 g kg 1 respectively in 2018 while in 2020 the total nitrogen n available phosphorus potassium and organic matter were recorded as 0 12 15 09 mg kg 1 79 78 mg kg 1 17 36 g kg 1 respectively two hybrid rice cultivars liangyou6326 and hanyou73 were selected as planting material the average value of the two varieties was used to analyze the rice data owing to the performance of the two rice varieties was basically the same while one oilseed rape cultivar huayouza 62 a brassica napus hybrid oilseed rapeseed was selected as planting material three rice planting patterns ddsr wdsr and ttr and two oilseed rape cultivation methods dso and tpo were laid out in randomized complete block design rcbd under split plot arrangement with four replications three different rice cultivation methods ddsr wdsr and ttr and two oilseed rape culture methods were combined to compose six rice oilseed rape rotation systems ddsr dso ddsr tpo wdsr dso wdsr tpo ttr dso and ttr tpo fig 1 there were 24 plots in rice growth season and the area of each plot was 60 m2 10 m 6 m and there are 48 plots in oilseed rape growth season the area of each plot was 30 m2 5 m 6 m in the plots of ddsr wdsr and dso dry seeds were manually sown in rows and row to row distance was maintained about 30 cm the seed rate of direct seeded rice and direct seeded oilseed rape were 30 kg ha 1 and 4 5 kg ha 1 respectively oilseed rape seedlings were thinned at the 5th leaf stage and the planting density was guaranteed to be 20 plants m 2 in ddsr and wdsr plots the dry rice seeds were sown on 3th june and 23th may in 2018 and 2019 respectively in ttr plots the sowing of rice seeds in nursery bed was done on 8th june and 22th may and seedlings were transplanted on 25nd june and 15nd june at a hill spacing of 30 0 13 3 cm with two seedlings per hill respectively in 2018 and 2019 after harvesting of rice the sowing of oilseed rape seeds in nursery bed was done on 12th october and 4th october and seedlings 30 day old were transplanted at a hill spacing of 30 0 16 5 cm with one seedling per hill in 2018 and 2019 respectively 2 2 water and fertilizer management in ddsr plot the land was dry ploughed and harrowed without puddling and rainfall was used as the main irrigation source and the extra irrigation was conducted as according to the soil water potential during the whole growth period of rice in wdsr plots the soil was flooded plowed harrowed and puddled there was no water layer on the surface of soil when sowing irrigation was carried out one week after sowing and then the water layer was maintained at 3 10 cm until one week before harvest in ttr plot the soil was flooded plowed harrowed and puddled a 1 3 cm water layer was kept during the first week after transplanting and then the flooded water was kept at the same level with 5 10 cm water depth until one week before harvest after rice harvest dry tillage and dry land preparation were adopted due to sufficient rainfall dso and tpo were rain fed in the whole growth period until harvest in rice growth season fertilizer management of ddsr and wdsr were the same as that for ttr all the treatments were fertilized with 150 90 120 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o all the p2o5 33 n and 50 k2o were applied as basal fertilizers the remaining n dose was equally split at mid tillering and panicle initiation stages while the remaining k2o was top dressed at panicle initiation stage the zinc was applied as basal dose at 5 kg ha 1 in the form of zinc sulfate at the same time in oilseed rape growth season fertilizer management of dso was the same as that for tpo all the treatments were fertilized with 200 90 120 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o all the p2o5 60 n and 75 k2o were applied as basal fertilizers the remaining n dose was equally split at overwintering and bolting stages while the remaining k2o was top dressed at bolting stage boron fertilizer 11 b was applied as basal dose at 15 kg ha 1 weeds were removed manually and diseases and insects were intensively controlled in all plots 2 3 data recorded 2 3 1 weather data the meteorological data including maximum and minimum temperature average temperature and rainfall and solar radiation during the period of study were collected from a weather observatory aws800 campbell scientific inc usa near the experimental field meteorological data were recorded from may 10 2018 to may 10 2020 including the daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and rainfall fig 2 during the whole rice growing season the total rainfall was 200 5 mm and 162 1 mm and daily average temperature was 26 8 and 26 5 respectively in 2018 and 2019 among them the rainfall mainly focused on july and august in 2018 fig 2b and june and july in 2019 fig 2d whereas the high temperature daily maximum temperature 35 c occurred more frequently in 2018 fig 2a than that in 2019 fig 2c furthermore rice suffered relatively long term high temperature stress at flowering stage in 2019 than that of in 2018 during the whole oilseed rape growing season the total rainfall was 177 8 and 208 8 mm daily average temperature was 9 59 and 10 6 and effective accumulated temperature was 2041 7 and 2368 7 respectively in 2019 and 2020 2 3 2 soil and water irrigation data soil samples were collected one day before land preparation from five different points with 0 20 cm depth from each plot and mixed well about 500 g soil sample was taken and dried at room temperature ground and then passed through a 2 mm sieve for further soil analysis the ph organic matter alkali hydrolyzed n available p and k were determined according to the method of bao 1999 the soil water potential of ddsr plot was measured by the soil water potential instrument jz trsii beijing jiuzhou sheng xin technology co ltd which was measured after every 7 days to determine whether ddsr should be irrigated or not and irrigation was conducted when soil water potential was lower than 30 kpa however at panicle initiation stage pi stage irrigation was conducted when soil water potential was lower than 15 kpa moreover the irrigation amount of each plots were accurately recorded by the installed water meter which was used to measure the water use efficiency of rice oilseed rape and rice oilseed rape rotation system the irrigation water use efficiency wuei was calculated according to formulas fernรกndez et al 2020 1 wue i kg m 3 yield per unit area kg irrigation water use amount per unit area m 3 however since the rape season was rain fed without irrigation its wuei is 0 additionally when calculating the wuei of rice oilseed rape rotation system the annual yield was the sum of rice yield and rape equivalent yield 2 3 3 growth analysis and yield measurement of rice and oilseed rape each plot was sampled at mid of tillering stage pi heading stage hd and maturity stage ms for growth analysis of rice among them 0 6 m2 plant samples were taken from each plot of ddsr and wdsr and 12 plants 0 48 m2 were taken from ttr then the number of tillers leaf area by leaf area meter li 3100 li cor inc lincoln ne usa and aboveground biomass were measured at the same time six plants 0 25 m2 were sampled from each plot at seedling stage ss bolting stage bs flowering stage fs and fully ripened stage fr for oilseed rape growth analysis root dry weight leaf area and aboveground biomass were measured as according to the method of determination in rice in the ms of rice and fr of oilseed rape the representative area with the same growth trend was selected as the yield measurement area in the middle of each plot among them 4 8 m2 2 4 2 m plant samples were taken for dso ddsr and wdsr plot and 2 4 m 8 rows wide and 2 m long 15 hills for ttr and tpo after harvesting the rice was threshed manually and dried in the sun then the impurities and empty shriveled grains were removed by air separation machine after the grains were placed in the room until the moisture absorption balance of the grains the total weight of grain was weighed with a balance 0 01 g and the moisture content of the grain was determined by the grain moisture meter pm 8188 a japan repeated for 3 times and the average value was taken finally grain yield was adjusted to standard moisture content 0 14 g h2o g 1 and 0 09 g h2o g 1 fresh weight for rice and oilseed rape respectively energy analysis investigations have been undertaken worldwide to compare different farming systems and crop rotations among others variables hรผlsbergen et al 2001 moreno et al 2011 calorific values of rice grain and oilseed rapeseed were 16 80 and 17 92 mj kg 1 respectively chen et al 2000 chen 2011 oilseed rape yield equivalent was calculated as 2 oilseed rape yield equivalent yield of oilseed rape 1 792 1 680 3 annual yield oilseed rape yield equivalent rice yield 2 3 4 economic benefits record the annual expenditure of agricultural materials such as seed pesticide chemical fertilizer irrigation ploughing the whole field and machinery use as well as the labor input such as sowing fertilization spraying pesticide and irrigation etc at the same time the unit price of labor the purchase price of oilseed rape and rice and the seed price were understood at current year which used to calculate and analyze the economic benefits of each rotation system for economic analysis we widely adopted definitions of revenue and costs thus we considered the economic return as the yield market value of rice and oilseed rape for the economic costs we considered include variable costs vc and fixed costs fc among them the vc were defined by production unit as the costs that varied with the outputs or the returns fernรกndez et al 2020 in this study vc included raw material costs seed fertilizer and pesticides and labor costs irrigation programming sowing or planting harvesting and phytosanitary treatments additionally the fc accounted for the costs that remained unchanged irrespective of the output level for a time period of one year in our study the fc mainly include the machinery costs which were associated with ploughing irrigation and harvesting 4 net economic return total economic return fc vc 2 3 5 data analysis using excel 2010 microsoft office to organize data and data were analyzed by analysis of variance using statistix 9 0 analytical software tallahassee fl usa the differences between treatments were separated using the least significance difference lsd test at the 0 05 0 01 and 0 001probability levels graphical representation of the data was performed using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 comparison of whole system growth duration and annual yield under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems the overall performance of annual growth duration was ddsr dso wdsr dso ttr dso ddsr tpo wdsr tpo ttr tpo the same trends were observed between two years table 1 furthermore the average whole growth duration in 2018 2019 was 14 days shorter than that of in 2019 2020 while the rice and oilseed rape growth duration in 2018 2019 were 8 days and 5 days shorter than that of in 2019 2020 respectively different rice oilseed rape rotation planting systems had significant effects on rice yield oilseed rape yield and annual yield table 2 the annual yield of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo was the highest which was significantly higher than that of ttr dso and ttr tpo the same trends was observed between 2018 and 2019 and 2019 2020 in rice growth season the yield of wdsr was significantly higher than that of ddsr and ttr the same trends was observed in two years among them the rice yield in wdsr was 10 23 and 9 25 t ha 1 which was significantly higher than that in ddsr 9 52 and 8 28 t ha 1 and ttr 9 21 and 8 29 t ha 1 during 2018 and 2019 respectively in oilseed rape growth season the yield of ddsr dso was the highest and which was significantly higher than that of other rotation systems in 2019 in addition the average yield of rice season oilseed rape season and annual system in 2018 2019 were significantly higher than those in 2019 2020 and increased by 11 7 7 7 and 10 9 respectively 3 2 comparison of total water consumption and wuei under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems the annual water consumption mainly showed wdwr dso and wdsr tpo ttr dso and ttr tpo ddsr dso and ddsr tpo the trend was consistent between two years table 3 the average total water consumption of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo were increased by 18 6 and 14 5 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 compared with ttr tpo respectively on the contrary the average total water consumption of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo decreased by 24 7 and 25 3 than ttr tpo in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively in addition the total water consumption in rice season was showed that wdsr ttr ddsr which was consistent in two years compared with the ttr the total water consumption of wdsr in rice season increased by 19 6 and 17 1 on the contrary the total water consumption of ddsr in rice season decreased by 29 0 and 29 8 respectively in 2018 and 2019 furthermore there were significant differences in wuei of rice season and whole system under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems fig 3 the wuei of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo was significantly higher than that of other rice oilseed rape rotation systems which was consistent in two years fig 3b however since the rape season was rain fed without irrigation its wuei is 0 while wuei of ddsr was increased by 94 2 and 84 6 in 2018 65 1 and 61 8 in 2019 respectively as compared with wdsr and ttr fig 3a 3 3 comparison of economic benefits under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems there were significant differences in total economic costs under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems showing wdsr tpo wdsr dso ttr tpo ttr dso ddsr tpo ddsr dso the trend was consistent between two years table 4 at the same time obvious differences in variable costs vc and fixed costs fc were also observed under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems among them the total raw materials costs were in the sequence of ddsr dso and wdsr dso ddsr tpo and wdsr tpo ttr dso and ttr tpo additionally the total labor costs were showed that ttr tpo wdsr tpo ttr dso wdsr dso ddsr tpo ddsr dso furthermore total machinery costs was indicated that ddsr dso and ddsr tpo significantly lower than other rotation systems in summary the total economic cost of ddsr dso was the least mainly resulting from the total labor costs and machinery cost was significantly lower than other rice oilseed rape rotation systems compared with ttr tpo the total labor cost and the machinery cost of ddsr dso was decreased by 46 8 and 13 2 respectively ddsr dso has the highest net economic return and the same performance was observed in two years table 4 the net economic return of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo was increased by 22 6 12 3 and 7 8 5 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively as compared with ttr tpo the net economic return of wdsr dso was significantly higher than ttr tpo in 2018 2019 but there was no significant difference in 2019 2020 meanwhile there was no significant difference on the net economic return between wdsr tpo and ttr tpo in 2018 2019 on the contrary the net economic return of wdsr tpo was significantly higher than ttr tpo in 2019 2020 3 4 growth analysis of rice and oilseed rape under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems different rice planting patterns had significant effects on number of tillers lai and aboveground biomass of rice at different growth stages and the overall performance was wdsr ddsr ttr fig 4 among them the aboveground biomass and lai of ddsr and wdsr were significantly higher than that of ttr at each growth period the trend was basically the same in two years except that there was no significant difference in aboveground biomass between ddsr and ttr in 2019 fig 4 a b c d additionally the results showed that the number of tillers in the early growth stage was wdsr ddsr ttr but there was no significant difference at maturity stage and the two year trend was the same fig 4e f the ratio of productive tiller of wdsr ddsr and ttr were 44 6 66 15 83 25 and 47 9 49 9 57 8 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 4 e f different rice oilseed rape rotation systems had significant effects on root dry weight and aboveground biomass of oilseed rape fig 5 among them the aboveground biomass of oilseed rape under ddsr dso was the highest but there was no significant difference among other rotation systems moreover the trend was the same in two years the root dry weight of dso was significantly higher than that of tpo at each growth period and the trend was basically the same in two years 4 discussion the differences in annual yield rice season and oilseed rape season yields between 2019 and 2020 and 2018 2019 maybe closely related to the meteorological conditions between two years among them the average yield of rice in 2019 is significantly lower than in 2018 which may be related to the decrease of seed setting rate caused by high temperature at flowering stage in 2019 table 2 and fig 2 it is also consistent with the results of previous studies that high temperature at flowering stage significantly reduced rice yield lawas et al 2018 shi et al 2008 the yield of oilseed rape in 2020 was significantly lower than in 2019 which may be related to the total rainfall and effective accumulated temperature in 2020 was 208 8 mm and 2368 7 which are higher than in 2019 177 8 mm and 2041 7 respectively the relationship between meteorological factors in the yangtze river basin and oilseed rape yield were analyzed the results showed that rainfall and effective accumulated temperature were negatively correlated with winter oilseed rape yield cong et al 2019 therefore the difference of average annual yield between two years may be closely related to high temperature in rice at flowering stage and rainfall and effective accumulated temperature in oilseed rape growth season with the aggravation of global climate change the impact of climate change on rice oilseed rape rotation planting system will be further explored it is of guiding significance for how to obtain high and stable yield of rice and rape under the rotation system and it is also of great significance to ensure the safe production of grain and edible oil in the world in this study the root dry weight aboveground biomass and yield of oilseed rape under ddsr dso and ddsr tpo were higher than that of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo table 2 and fig 1 5 moreover our results showed that the nitrate nitrogen and urease activities of ddsr were significantly higher than those of wdsr and ttr fig s1 previous studies showed that the higher the nitrate nitrogen content and urease activity in the soil the stronger the soil nitrogen supply capacity the more conducive to the growth of subsequent crops and the improvement of yield nyborg and malhi 1989 therefore the difference in root dry weight aboveground biomass and yield of oilseed rape between ddsr dso ddsr tpo and wdsr dso wdsr tpo may resulted from the soil properties was changed between ddsr and wdsr soil microbes are considered to be an indicator of soil quality and play an important role in mediating soil ecosystem functioning sharma et al 2010 the changes in microbial communities may be linked to plant growth and productivity she et al 2018 wang et al 2018 previous studies indicated that different rice planting patterns had significant effects on soil microbial communities which affected soil physical and chemical properties and subsequent crop yields dai et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 the fungi glomeromycota and chytridiomycota were significantly impacted by crop rotation which play a key role in soil aggregation formation and stabilization and cellulose degradation guo et al 2020 moreover the crop rotations wheat rice wheat soybean and wheat corn greatly alter microbial physiology diversity and community structure wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 therefore the differences of soil microbial community among different rice oilseed rape rotation systems need to be further explored ddsr dso had the best performance on the total water consumption wuei and net economic return and the annual yield of ddsr dso was higher than that of in ttr tpo tables 2 3 and fig 3 which could be used as an alternative to ttr tpo in central china on one hand the annual wuei of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo was significantly higher than that of other rotation systems which mainly resulted from the annual water consumption of ddsr dso and ddsr tpo was significantly lower than other rice oilseed rape rotation systems fig 3b table 3 moreover owing to oilseed rape is mainly rain fed the difference of annual water consumption between different rotation systems is mainly caused by the difference of water consumption on soil preparation and irrigation in rice season table 3 previous studies indicated that the water consumption of ddsr during land preparation and irrigation were significantly lower than wdsr and ttr and wuei of ddsr was significantly higher than wdsr and ttr tao et al 2016 furthermore it was consistent with the results of this study fig 3a table 3 at the same time root development is affected by soil water content or water irrigation amount kato and okami 2010 the root growth in ddsr was much more vigorous than that in both ttr liu et al 2015 previous study indicated that ddsr could increase drought tolerance of rice by promoting root elongation under the aerobic soil conditions as compared with ttr henry et al 2011 wang et al 2017 further the lodging resistance of dso was stronger than tpo which owing to the root system of dso distributes in deeper soil layer b wang et al 2007 therefore compared with the ttr tpo ddsr dso could also reduce lodging risk and has good yield stability in addition previously reported results showed that rice establishment method has significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions ch4 and n2o and global warming potential wang et al 2017 some studies also indicates that greenhouse gas emissions and global warming potential gwp from ddsr was significantly lower than that from wdsr and ttr liu et al 2015 tao et al 2016 weller et al 2015 therefore compared with ttr tpo ddsr dso could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and gwp on the other hand the net economic return of ddsr dso was significantly higher than ttr tpo furthermore the total economic input of ddsr dso was significantly lower than that of ttr tpo table 4 compared with ttr tpo ddsr dso has lower labors cost mainly including the cost of sowing or transplanting but had more seed and pesticide input seed consumption and weed control are always two important factors that restrict the development of direct seeded planting patterns the main reason for the large amount of seeds consumption in the direct seeded planting pattern was the low seedling survival rate previous studies have showed that seed coating and seed priming are two important techniques to solve the problem of low emergence rate of direct seeded seeds ashraf and foolad 2005 nie et al 2020 wang et al 2016 reported that selenium priming and salicylic acid priming could significantly improve the germination rate of direct seeded rice seeds under growth chamber and field conditions it is also reported that pelleting treatments with cao2 significantly increased seed germination and seedling growth of dsr under water logging conditions compared with other pelleted seeds without cao2 and naked seeds mei et al 2017 secondly the high weeds growth is another important factor limiting the development of direct seeded planting patterns many studies had been carried out on weed control under direct seeded planting mode the results showed that sensor based mechanical weed control technology gene editing technology alternative tillage and crop establishment system technology were effective control technologies of weeds kumaran et al 2020 machleb et al 2020 pittelkow et al 2012 therefore it is very significant to introduce effective pre sowing seed treatment technology and weed control technology to further improve the annual yield and net economic return of ddsr dso finally although the economic benefits and wuei of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo are lower than that of ddsr dso their annual yields were the highest which were significantly higher than those of ttr tpo and ttr dso table 3 fig 3 on one hand the season of high annual yield of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo were the yield of wdsr was significantly higher than that of ddsr and ttr as compared with ddsr dso table 2 in addition previous studies showed that the yield of wdsr was significantly higher than ddsr and ttr mainly due to its aboveground biomass lai and number of total spikelets per unit area was significantly higher that of ddsr and ttr tao et al 2016 which was basically consistent with this study fig 4 on the other hand the low wue and economic benefits of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo were mainly caused by the high irrigation volume and frequent irrigation times as compared with ttr dso ttr tpo and ddsr dso tables 2 3 when the rainfall in rice growth season is sufficient the irrigation times and irrigation input of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo will be reduced and the economic benefits will be improved therefore wdsr dso and wdsr tpo could be used as an alternative to ttr tpo or ttr dso when the rainfall is sufficient in the rice growth season 5 conclusion there were significant differences in annual yield water consumption wuei and economic benefits of rice season and whole system under different rice oilseed rape rotation systems the average annual yield and water consumption of wdsr dso and wdsr tpo were significant higher than that of ttr tpo and ttr dso in addition wuei and net economic return was similar between wdsr dso wdsr tpo and ttr tpo ttr dso therefore wdsr dso and wdsr tpo could also be used as an alternative to ttr tpo when the rainfall is sufficient in the rice growth season in addition annual yields of ddsr dso and ttr tpo were similar but the water consumption of ddsr dso was reduced by 22 6 on an average than that of ttr tpo furthermore wuei and net economic return of ddsr dso were the highest which were 30 7 and 15 2 higher than ttr tpo respectively additionally compared with ttr tpo ddsr dso could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and gwp considering of annual yield water consumption wuei net economic return global warming potential or greenhouse gas emissions and yield stability ddsr dso was an alternative to ttr tpo in central china nevertheless in order to further improve the annual yield and economic benefits of ddsr dso effective weed control and pre sowing seed treatment technology is very necessary meanwhile the oilseed rape yield after ddsr was significantly higher than that of after wdsr which resulting from the nitrate nitrogen and urease activities of ddsr were significantly higher than those of wdsr and ttr the changes of microbial community in soil might be related with the differences in crop performances among different rice oilseed rape rotation systems so the differences in soil microbial community among different rice oilseed rape rotation systems need to be addressed in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science

10206,the present study investigated if partial reduction of shoot dry matter during early vegetative growth phase of chickpea crop cv pba seamer saves sub soil water for reproductive growth and grain filling of the crop grown at 9 diverse environments the environments were created by a combination of 3 sites emerald hermitage and kingaroy 3 planting windows environments 1 2 3 at each site with and without supplementary irrigation the effects of environments on canopy management partial reduction in shoot dry matter vs control and irrigation treatments on the water uptake by roots crop growth and yield performance and yield components were investigated crops in the planting windows en 1 2 3 experienced variable environments at each site days to 50 flowering and crop maturity reduced progressively from en 1 to en 3 at the three sites the environment had significant effect on shoot biomass yield and hi at the three sites p 0 01 or p 0 0001 environments had bigger effects on crop that partial reduction in shoot biomass prs the prs at early vegetative phase resulted in a 25 reduction in radiation intercepted but rapid compensatory growth that followed resulted in minimal effect on shoot biomass and yield the hi varied from 0 18 in en 1 at kingaroy to 0 5 in en 2 at emerald there was a trend for an increase in hi from en 1 to en 3 at all sites the response to irr computed as the difference in peak shoot biomass and yield between the irr and rf treatments was the highest at hermitage and the least at emerald site vapour pressure deficit during reproductive phase accounted for the majority of variation in shoot biomass response to irrigation r2 0 66 p 0 001 for total dry matter and r2 0 46 p 0 01 for yield the environments had a significant effect on radiation use

efficiency 1 introduction approximately 90 of world s chickpea cicer arietinum l is grown as a cool season food legume crop between the latitudes 20 and 40 croser et al 2003 kumar and abbo 2001 the crop is generally grown on receding soil moisture conditions where terminal drought is one of the major constraints for the productivity of the crop krishnamurthy et al 1999 lake et al 2016 deep rooting trait has been proposed for improving genetic tolerance of chickpea to terminal drought zaman allah et al 2011 while genotypic variability for deep rooting trait has been explored extensively there have been limited studies on canopy management during early growth phase to limit crop water use to ensure water availability for reproduction and grain filling zaman allah et al 2011 any reduction in the aboveground portion of plant affects photosynthetic capacity of the plant thus affecting source sink relationship depending on the crop stage beadle 1985 siddique and sedgley 1985 showed that removing less productive lateral basal branches had no effect of shoot biomass but increased harvest index of chickpea by 31 in mediterranean type of environment slower canopy development in de branched crop was associated with lower water use during pre flowering phase siddique and sedgley 1985 with moderate yield improvement under terminal drought situation beuerlein et al 1971 have reported similar increase in seed yield due to removal of branches in soybean plants with increased seed yields attributed to greater light interception during flowering and higher seed per m2 of leaf area partial defoliation during flowering resulted in a reduction in leaf area and it had minimal influence in seed yield or hi in chickpea iqbal et al 2012 li et al 2010 while 50 defoliation during pod development phase resulted in significant reduction of shoot dry matter and yield pandey 1984 the effect of defoliation on the compensatory growth of chickpea collin et al 2000 is dependent on the environment and the crop growth stage when the defoliation is imposed iqbal et al 2012 continuous defoliation by 25 50 or 75 of chickpea starting from first flower until physiological maturity in subtropical environment resulted in significant reduction in yield and resulted in inability of the crop to compensate for lost leaf area sheldrake et al 1978 in contrast some studies concluded that de topping during pre flowering phase could be a profitable practice for chickpea growers baloch and zubair 2010 reducing foliage during early stages of chickpea crop growth could increase number of branches while restricting profuse vegetative growth nipping practice in chickpea could have twofold advantage on one hand nipping at early growth stage of chickpea could improve yield while on the other hand this practice would provide an opportunity for resource poor farmers to obtain green fodder for their livestock defoliation reduces the photosynthetic capacity of plants temporarily but the compensatory growth during recovery phase allocates more carbon to the aboveground biomass depending on the environment some studies reported that following defoliation root growth is reduced while leaf regrowth is accelerated due to the increase in the re allocation of reserves from root to shoot ourry et al 1988 various mechanisms have been proposed for compensatory growth such as higher photosynthetic rate of regrown foliage higher stomatal conductance and delayed senescence striker et al 2008 however there is limited information on the effect of partial removal of shoot dry matter during early vegetative phase on the shoot dry matter radiation and water use efficiencies harvest index yield and seed quality of chickpea in diverse environments the present study investigates if partial reduction of shoot dry matter during early vegetative growth phase saves sub soil water for reproduction and grain filling of the crop in diverse environments the effect of canopy management on the water uptake by roots crop growth and yield performance of chickpea is investigated under nine diverse environments in queensland australia 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites field experiments were implanted in the 2017 winter season apr to nov at the department of agriculture and fisheries daf research facilities located at emerald agricultural college 23 3 s 148 1 e hermitage 28 2 s 152 1 e and kingaroy 26 6 s 151 9 e research stations in queensland australia these locations represented typical chickpea production environments in cereal legume based cropping systems at emerald and hermitage soils were 150 cm deep brown hermitage or black emerald vertisols while at kingaroy the soil was 100 cm deep red ferrosol the details of sowing and harvesting dates max and min t radiation in crop rainfall dates and amounts of irrigation applied in each environment at each site are presented in tables 1 and 2 2 2 experimental design and crop management seed of cultivar pba seamer obtained from the australian chickpea breeding programme was used at all sites a starter dose of a commercial formulation of zinc n 11 0 p 21 8 s 4 0 and zn 1 0 at the rate of 30 kg ha at emerald and hermitage and 50 kg ha at kingaroy was incorporated into the soil at the time of planting as part of a standard practice the crop was planted on non limiting table 2 conditions in three sowing windows at 50 cm row spacing rsp at the three sites appropriate plant protection practices were implemented at the three sites at all the three trial sites the trial was laid out as a split split plot design with three sowing dates en 1 2 3 as main plots irrigation irr and rainfed rf treatments as sub plots and two canopy management treatments i e partial reduction of shoot dry matter mechanically prs and control con as sub sub plots with three replications rep a 10 m buffer with pba seamer was sown at 50 cm row spacing to separate the irr and rf treatments each sub plot was 12 m long and 4 m wide a plant population of approximately 30 4 plants m2 was maintained in all sites at hermitage the irrigation was applied using a drip system operated by a pressure pump while at emerald and kingaroy an overhead sprinkler irrigation system was used at hermitage two drip lines of 12 m length containing 120 drippers per plot were laid out each dripper in the drip line emitted 1 1 l of water per hr amount of water delivered for each irrigation was calculated as pump time in hr emitting rate dripper hr number of drippers per plot at emerald and kingaroy the irrigation amount was estimated by multiplying a pre calibrated rate mm hr for the overhead system with the period of each irrigation the canopy management treatments were applied at 42 days after sowing the prs treatment was implemented by slashing top 15 cm of shoot foliage using a hand held mower 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 solar radiation interception photosynthetically active solar radiation par above and below the canopy at the ground level were simultaneously recorded at three random spots in each plot at hermitage emerald and kingaroy sites on specified days during the growing season table 1 the measurements were made using a ceptometer accupar model lp 80 decagon devices usa on clear days between 11 30 and 13 00 h the fractional par intercepted f on a given day was calculated as the ratio of the radiation measured below the canopy at the ground level to the incident par measured above the canopy eq 1 eq 1 f r i n r where f fractional par intercepted by the crop mj m2 inr incident par r par measured at the bottom of the crop canopy 2 3 2 radiation use efficiency rue the radiation use efficiency for total shoot dry matter ruedm was computed as the ratio of peak shoot dry matter g m2 and cumulative par intercepted ri mj m2 by the crop sinclair et al 1992 for each plot using eq 2 peak shoot dry matter psb was recorded prior to any leaf senescence when 50 of pods on a plant were mature however timing of the desiccation before final harvest varied between environments table 1 eq 2 rue dm g mj psb g m 2 cumulative ri mj m 2 the radiation use efficiency for grain yield rue yld

r where f was the fractional radiation intercepted at the psb and สinr was the cumulative incident par from emergence e to psb 2 3 3 soil moisture content soil moisture content was measured at 25 cm 45 cm 65 cm 85 cm 105 cm and 125 cm depths using a neutron moisture probe 503 dr hydroprobe cpn international at emerald and cpn 503 elite hydroprobe instrotek inc at hermitage sites aluminium tubes of 150 cm length and 50 mm dia were installed in centre rows of sub subplots when the crop was 20 day old and capped to protect from rain and dust two access tubes one between the plants in the row and the other in the middle of rows were installed in each sub sub plot to examine the effect of canopy management prs and con treatments on the capture of soil water in addition three extra access tubes were installed in the uncropped area in the edges of the experimental site for the calibration of neutron probe the neutron moisture probe nmp was calibrated by regressing the gravimetric soil water content measured at different depths at three or four times during the season against the neutron moisture probe readings the nmp readings accounted for 84 and 78 of variation in soil moisture content at emerald and hermitage sites respectively rachaputi et al 2015 the soil moisture was recorded from 4 leaf stage at 4 5 day intervals until crop desiccation the nmp measurements were also made before and after each irrigation in irrigated treatment or rainfall event the total water extracted at each phenophase was calculated as indicated in eq 5 eq 5 w e x d 1 d 6 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 where wex was the water extracted from 125 cm soil profile at a given phenophase d1 and d6 were the depths e1 and e2 were plant available water content pawc in the soil measured at event 1 and e3 and e4 were pawc at event 2 and so on the soil moisture content in the top 0 10 cm layer was simultaneously sampled gravimetrically the data was converted into volumetric units and added to the 25 cm depth reading made by the neutron moisture probe total volume of water extracted from 125 cm soil profile was calculated by summing the six depths the total water extracted for each phenophase was calculated as the sum of water extracted at the events within a given phenophase 2 3 4 peak shoot biomass the peak shoot biomass psb was recorded when 50 pods on plants in plot were mature plants for psb were hand harvested at the ground level from one m2 area in each plot and plant count recorded the harvested plants were dried in a fan forced oven at 80 c for 48 h before recording shoot leaves stems pods grains dry weight 2 3 5 grain yield the plot area excluding the area harvested for peak shoot biomass was measured and the final yield was assessed when 90 of plants in a plot had around 80 mature pods plants were desiccated by applying a foliar spray of glyphosate at 2 l ha 5 7 days before machine harvesting the grain samples collected from the harvester were cleaned to remove any extraneous matter and dried to 10 moisture content before weighing 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted for each site for the psb yield and harvest index using a split split design using r software r core team 2018 analysis of water extraction was done for each phenophase separately for each site comparison among means were done using tukey s test tukey 1949 the association between the growth variables was analysed using regression approach graphs were developed using sigma plot 10 0 systat software san jose ca and r software 3 results 3 1 weather details of planting and harvest dates en 1 2 3 crop duration days irrigation mm and days after sowing das at which fractional intercepted radiation dasfri was measured at each site are presented in table 1 it was apparent that crop duration and days to 50 flowering reduced progressively from en 1 to en 3 at the three sites i e emerald hermitage and kingaroy crops in the planting windows en 1 2 3 experienced highly variable environments across all sites in crop weather during the pre flowering and post flowering phases of chickpea var pba seamer grown in en 1 2 and 3 at the 3 sites are presented in table 2 at emerald maxt and mint ranged from 25 8 c to 28 7 c and 10 2 12 6 c during pre and post flowering periods in en 1 and en 2 respectively however in the post flowering phase of en 3 the maxt and mint raised to 30 8 and 14 8 c mean daily radiation progressively increased from 15 2 in en 1 21 1 mj m2 day in en 3 the cumulative radiation during post flowering phase was consistently higher than that in the pre flowering phase at all sites except for en 2 and en 3 at hermitage there was also progressive increase in vpd in en 1 to en 3 at all sites for instance vpd during post flowering phase increased from 2 4kpa in en 1 3 1kpa in en 3 at emerald from 2 0kpa to 2 2 at hermitage and from 2 2kpa to 2 5kpa at kingaroy sites the in crop rain was highly variable across sites but generally post flowering phase received more rain compared to pre flowering phase at hermitage and kingaroy sites but in crop rain was generally less at emerald in en 1 and en 2 but there was 165 mm rain in en 3 the mean cumulative thermal time from sowing to maturity across three ens was 1885 405 days at emerald 2195 169 days at hermitage and 2108 199 days at kingaroy 3 2 peak shoot dry matter yield and hi the fig 1 presents the mean effects of environments en 1 en 2 and en 3 and irrigation treatments irr and rf on peak shoot biomass psb of chickpea pba seamer at each of the three sites environmental effect was significant with psb progressively declining from en 1 to en 3 in both irrigated irr and rainfed rf treatments at emerald and hermitage sites but psb was significantly reduced in en 2 at kingaroy in both rf and irr treatments due to severe dry spell for 2 months during early reproductive phase supplementary fig 1 environments accounted for most variation in psb at emerald and kingaroy p 0 001 and hermitage p 0 01 table 3 at emerald irr treatment had minimal effects on psbs within each of the three ens although psb declined steadily from 7 5 t ha to 6 0 t ha and 4 0 t ha in en 1 en 2 and en 3 respectively fig 1 table 3 at hermitage the psb was the highest in en 1 and en 2 10 t ha in irr treatment however psb declined to 9 t ha and 7 5 t ha in en 2 and en 3 respectively the rf treatment resulted in a significant reduction up to 60 in psb compared to irr treatment in all the three ens at hermitage at kingaroy psb declined significantly in rf treatments in en 2 compared to en 1 and en 3 demonstrating significant effect of environment the grain yield was highly variable across ens at the three sites fig 1 table 3 at emerald yields declined significantly p 0 001 in en 3 compared to en 1 but yields were the highest in en 2 compared to en 1 and en 3 suggesting that en 2 was most optimal for planting chickpea for this site at hermitage yields of 3 t ha were maintained under irr treatment in all the three environments the irr treatment in general resulted in higher grain yield compared to rf treatment in most ens at all sites however at hermitage and kingaroy yields in rf treatment were the lowest in en 1 and en 2 1 t ha and highest 2 t ha in en 3 the hi varied from 0 18 in en 1 at kingaroy to 0 5 in en 2 at emerald there was a trend for an increase in hi from en 1 to en 3 at all sites the mean hi increased from 0 32 en 1 to 0 41 en 3 at emerald 0 33 en 1 to 0 41 en 2 at hermitage and 0 18 en 1 to 0 27 en 3 at kingaroy data not presented it is worth noting that despite high peak shoot biomass hi was lowest in en 1 at kingaroy however further analysis of daily weather data at this site suggested that there was a 6 weeks of severe dry spell during early reproductive stage mid september to mid october followed by 131 mm of rain in 3days period followed by bright sunshine close to maturity this event severely affected reproductive development in en 2 at kingaroy there was a negative relationship between cumulative incident radiation and hi across ens fig 2 r2 0 38 p 0 001 3 3 effects of environment irrigation canopy management the environment had significant effect on psb yield and hi at all sites p 0 01 or p 0 001 table 3 irrigation ir also had significant effect on psb and yield at all sites p 0 001 but hi was affected by ir only at kingaroy site p 0 001 the canopy management treatment significantly affected grain yield only at emerald p 0 001 and psb p 0 01 at kingaroy where there was a significant reduction in psb in en 2 compared to en 1 or en 3 table 3 the en ir interaction was significant for psb yield and hi at kingaroy and significant for psb at hermitage table 3 3 4 response to irrigation the response to irr computed as the difference in peak shoot biomass psb and yield between the irr and rf treatments was the highest at hermitage and the least at emerald site fig 3 at hermitage the yield response to irrigation was the highest up to 2 t ha in en 1 but steadily declined in en 2 1 5 t ha and en 3 1 25 t ha however the yield response to irrigation amongst ens varied from 0 25 to 0 75 t ha at emerald while at kingaroy yield response was the highest in en 2 1 1 25 t ha but less than 0 5 t ha in en 1 and en 3 further analysis of the environmental factors underpinning the variable response to irrigation across ens revealed that vapour pressure deficit vpd during reproductive phase accounted for the majority of variation in psb response to irrigation r2 0 66 p 0 001 for psb fig 4 and r2 0 91 p 0 001 for yield at hermitage and emerald supplementary fig 2 3 5 radiation interception and radiation use efficiency the reduction in fractional radiation interception f because of the canopy management treatments in all ens excepting en 3 at hermitage is presented in fig 5 it was clear that there was a reduction f up to 25 in prs treatment initially followed by rapid recovery in most ens the differences between control and prs treatments disappeared as the crops reached maturity at emerald the crops in both control and partial reduction in shoot biomass prs treatments were intercepting close to 100 by 1250 gdd with minimal difference between irr and rf treatments at hermitage and kingaroy f reached 80 in both canopy management treatments in irr treatment only but in rf treatment f was 50 60 there was a trend for reduction in f beyond 1250 gdd at both the sites although the reduction in f was more pronounced after 1250 gdd in en 2 at kingaroy due to severe dry spell which caused leaf senescence there was a significant positive relationship between cumulative par intercepted and peak shoot biomass psb across diverse environments fig 6 however radiation use efficiency g mj was much lower at kingaroy compared to emerald and hermitage sites the rues for biomass was 0 74 g mj r2 0 97 p 0 001 for emerald and hermitage and 0 54 g mj r2 0 95 p 0 001 for kingaroy and the rue for yield was 0 28 g mj r2 0 95 p 0 01 for emerald and hermitage and 0 15 g mj r2 0 98 p 0 001 for kingaroy 3 6 water extraction patterns the effects of canopy management treatments on temporal patterns of water extraction by chickpea was measured under irrigated and rainfed treatments only in en 2 and en 1 at emerald and hermitage sites figs 7 and 8 at emerald during the pre flowering phase the water extraction pattern was similar between the irr and rainfed treatments as well as the canopy management treatments fig 7 however during the post flowering phase plants under irrigated treatment extracted more water up to 75 cm depth compared in rainfed treatment in both canopy management treatments it was also clear that at emerald plants in control treatment extracted more water up to 110 cm rooting depth in both irrigated and rainfed conditions compared to those in pbr treatment where active water extraction was limited to 50 cm depth only fig 7 at hermitage there was rapid extraction of water to a depth of 60 cm in both irrigated and rainfed treatments in pre flowering phase although plants in rainfed conditions extracted 80 mm more water from 60 cm depth compared with plants in irrigated treatment which extracted 40 mm from the same depth fig 8 however during the post flowering phase there was more water extraction up to 50 cm depth in pbr treatment compared to control in both irrigated and rainfed conditions there were no differences between irrigated and rainfed conditions below 50 cm depth in control treatment however in pbr treatment more water was extracted in irrigated treatment up to 60 cm depth after which irrigated treatment extracted more water compared to rainfed treatment up to 125 cm depth the evapo transpiration et by chickpea crop under the two canopy management practices control and pbr and under irrigated and rainfed conditions was measured at emerald and hermitage sites table 4 the total et by the crop differed significantly between emerald and hermitage but the differences between control and pbr treatments at a given site were less pronounced for instance at emerald pbr treatment extracted 3 mm and 17 mm less water under irr and rain fed conditions compared to control respectively the water use efficiency wue for peak shoot biomass and grain yield differed significantly between sites with the mean wue values for pbs being higher at emerald 22 6 kg ha mm compared to 15 6 kg ha mm at hermitage table 4 the mean wue for yields were 9 1 and 5 7 kg ha mm at emerald and hermitage respectively 3 7 yield components the yield components were measured at kingaroy and hermitage sites and at hermitage they were measured only at en 1 and en 2 table 5 the irrigation had a significant effect on most of the yield components excepting for hundred seed weight hsw at both sites table 5 sites had significant effect on all yield components for instance plant height pht and plant height to first pod pht1p were significantly higher at kingaroy compared to hermitage however there was a trend for progressive reduction in pht from en 1 to en 3 under irrigated treatment at kingaroy but not at hermitage the number of primary branches pbr per plant were significantly less under rf and irr treatments at kingaroy compared to hermitage there was a trend for increased pbr under irr treatment at hermitage however the total pod number tp and total seed number tsn were generally higher with irr treatment compared to rf at both sites but hermitage site tended to have higher tp and tsn than kingaroy site interestingly the number of seeds aborted tsa per plant were significantly higher at kingaroy compared to hermitage site and the tsa were significantly higher in irr than the rf treatment at both the sites the hundred seed weight hsw was significantly higher at hermitage compared to kingaroy and irr treatment had only small effect on hsw at both sites 4 discussion because of the indeterminate growth habit of chickpea the reproductive growth and development and physiological maturity occur simultaneously in different parts of the plant along with vegetative growth saxena 1984 a thorough understanding of the response of the crop growth and development to environmental factors is thus critical to interpret the crop s performance across environments the most important environmental factors affecting chickpea growth and development are temperature siddique and sedgley 1985 photoperiod summerfield et al 1991 upadhyay et al 1994 ellis et al 1994 and soil moisture saxena et al 1990 terminal drought is one of the major constraints for chickpea productivity in semi arid tropics krishnamurthy et al 2010 and extensive root growth has been suggested as the desirable genotypic trait that could contribute to seed yield under terminal drought conditions kashiwagi et al 2005 subbarao et al 1995 turner et al 2001 however genotypic strategies that save water during early vegetative growth phase for use during reproductive and grain filling phase could be equally critical zaman allah et al 2011 many studies focussed on the genotypic traits contributing to yield under water deficit but effects on temporal patterns of water use on crop phenological development have not been reported in chickpea lake et al 2016 our study quantified temporal variation in environmental variables and their effect on crop growth and development in nine diverse environments 4 1 phenology we considered each sowing date as an environment which involved a combination of various environmental components which is an approach that is more comprehensive intensive experiments using growth chambers with environmental control are needed to tease out effects of the individual variables environments had significant effect on crop phenology by hastening the onset of 50 flowering at hermitage and kingaroy and maturity at the three sites table 1 time to 50 flowering was hastened by 15 days and 22 days at hermitage and kingaroy respectively while time to 50 flowering unaffected at emerald this could be due to indeterminate growth habit of chickpea influencing source sink balance depending on the temperature and soil moisture availability resulting in significant effects on vegetative growth crop maturity and yield lawlor et al 2001 li et al 2010 roberts et al 1985 found that rate of progress towards flowering is a linear function of mean temperature with no interaction with photoperiod our study showed that crop maturity was accelerated from en 1 to en 3 by 24 days 36 days and 15 days at emerald hermitage and kingaroy sites respectively table 1 these changes in crop maturity could be due to combined increases in temperature variations in soil moisture vpd and radiation from en 1 to en 3 kanchan and bhatia 2014 observed similar effects of elevated temperature 4 2 crop growth the peak shoot biomass was reduced from en 1 to en 3 by 44 21 and 4 at emerald hermitage and kingaroy sites respectively despite the reduction in peak shoot biomass the yield reduction occurred only at emerald site by 41 but not at hermitage and kingaroy sites temperatures above 30 c in en 3 at emerald might have affected reproductive processes devasirvatham et al 2012 summerfield et al 1984 and high vpd 3kpa during the reproductive phase might have resulted in stomatal closure leading to reduced transpiration affecting water uptake by the crop under irrigated condition lobell et al 2013 sadras et al 2015 indeed the negative relationship between biomass response to irrigation and vpd during reproductive phase of the crop fig 4 supports this observation increasing temperatures of the growing environment managed by sowing date resulted in a progressive reduction in lai by 62 psb by 32 and seed yield by 46 salih et al 2018 temperatures above 15 c caused flower and pod abortion in parts of the indian subcontinent and australia clarke 2001 srinivasan et al 1998 4 3 response to irrigation environments had profound effect on chickpeas response to irrigation for instance at emerald where the temperature and vpd increased from en 1 to en 3 response to irrigation progressively reduced in both canopy management treatments while at hermitage the response to irrigation was significantly higher in the three environments compared to emerald because of lower temperatures and vpd at hermitage although the response to irrigation reduced steadily from en 1 to en 3 fig 3 at kingaroy minimal response to irrigation in en 1 and en 3 could be due to different reasons leaf senescence due to severe dry spell spanning en 3 followed by 282 mm rain during the final stages of crop growth resulted in minimal response to irrigation 4 4 canopy management the present study contributes to the current understanding on the physiological responses of chickpea to canopy management partial biomass reduction and control and elaborates how canopy management treatments influence crop growth and source sink relations under diverse environmental conditions as shown in fig 5 partial reduction in shoot biomass during early vegetative phase by around 25 may accelerate photosynthetic capacity of rest of the canopy resulting in rapid compensatory growth iqbal et al 2012 and accelerate sink metabolism by remobilizing carbon and nitrogen reserves khan et al 2007 paul and foyer 2001 canopy management practices like defoliation iqbal et al 2012 nipping or cutting back baloch and zubair 2010 or removal of basal branches siddique and sedgley 1985 implemented during vegetative phase had either no effect or positive effect on yield in the present study there were minimal effects of canopy management practices on yield in all the environments at the three sites 4 5 water use efficiency sites had significant effects on evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue table 4 at emerald the et was lower and wue for peak shoot biomass psb and grain yield was higher while at hermitage et was higher but wue was lower for psb and yield the increase in the seasonal et outweighed the increase in the crop yield thus resulting in relatively lower water use efficiency at hermitage there were no significant effects of canopy management treatments on wue at both sites table 4 the wue for psb and grain yield values reported in the current study 3 5 10 4 kg grain ha mm are comparable to number of studies reported for chickpea angadi et al 2008 gan et al 2009 miller et al 2001 between 5 and 10 kg grain ha mm the variation in wue observed at the two sites in the current study could be due to environment management interactions 4 6 water extraction patterns environment had profound effect on water extraction pattern at emerald where the temperature and vpd were about 27 c and 2 4kpa respectively during pre flowering phase there was little difference between treatments in water extraction however at hermitage amount of water extracted in control treatment during pre flowering period 80 mm was significantly higher than partial shoot biomass reduction prs treatment 50 mm supporting the hypothesis that the canopy reduction during early vegetative phase reduces water use by the crop thus saving water however there was greater water extraction during reproductive phase at both sites although extraction depth varied between sites and treatments in the present study water extraction was observed up to 110 cm depth in control compared to 75 cm in pbr treatment at emerald however at hermitage which had higher rainfall water extraction during pre flowering stage was from 60 cm depth in control compared to 125 cm in pbr treatment however most of the water used came from top 0 40 cm anwar et al 2000 higher water extraction in irrigated treatment at hermitage resulted in higher yield as observed in earlier studies anwar et al 2000 oweis and hachum 2003 4 7 yield components several studies reported relationships between yield and yield components with an aim of identifying stable genetic trait s for use in the chickpea crop improvement programmes gรผler et al 2001 arshad et al 2003 some studies reported significant genotype environment g e interactions for yield components in chickpea arshad et al 2003 bakhsh et al 2006 however there is limited information about the environmental factors underpinning the observed g e interaction in yield components the current study investigated the effects of two canopy management treatments control and partial biomass reduction and two water treatments supplementary irrigation and rainfed in nine diverse environments created by 3 different dates of sowing at 3 locations on the yield components at kingaroy and hermitage sites table 5 higher plant height height to first pod at kingaroy could be associated with weather components lower radiation and higher rainfall during the growing seasons or soil n status namvar et al 2011 high seed abortion at kingaroy in both rf and irr treatments compared to hermitage could be due to leaf senescence caused due to 11 17 lower radiation due to persistent overcast followed by 34 47 higher rainfall during the active seed filling phase this situation may also have resulted in lower 100 seed weight at kingaroy daily mean temperatures during post flowering period were above 15 c in all environments ruling out the possibility of low temperature being a cause for seed abortion croser et al 2003 5 conclusions environments had significant effect on crop phenology by hastening the onset of 50 flowering at hermitage kingaroy and crop maturity at the three sites the peak shoot biomass was reduced from en 1 to en 3 by 44 21 and 4 at emerald hermitage and kingaroy sites respectively the variation in rainfall and vpds with in the environments had profound effect on chickpea s response to irrigation partial reduction in shoot biomass prs treatment during early vegetative phase resulted in a 25 reduction in photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy but rapid compensatory growth following the psb treatment led to closing of the gap between two canopy management treatments environment also had a profound effect on water extraction pattern during at pre and post flowering phases the study suggested that the effects of partial reduction in shoot biomass had minimal effects on crop growth and yield in all environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10206,the present study investigated if partial reduction of shoot dry matter during early vegetative growth phase of chickpea crop cv pba seamer saves sub soil water for reproductive growth and grain filling of the crop grown at 9 diverse environments the environments were created by a combination of 3 sites emerald hermitage and kingaroy 3 planting windows environments 1 2 3 at each site with and without supplementary irrigation the effects of environments on canopy management partial reduction in shoot dry matter vs control and irrigation treatments on the water uptake by roots crop growth and yield performance and yield components were investigated crops in the planting windows en 1 2 3 experienced variable environments at each site days to 50 flowering and crop maturity reduced

that partial reduction in shoot biomass prs the prs at early vegetative phase resulted in a 25 reduction in radiation intercepted but rapid compensatory growth that followed resulted in minimal effect on shoot biomass and yield the hi varied from 0 18 in en 1 at kingaroy to 0 5 in en 2 at emerald there was a trend for an increase in hi from en 1 to en 3 at all sites the response to irr computed as the difference in peak shoot biomass and yield between the irr and rf treatments was the highest at hermitage and the least at emerald site vapour pressure deficit during reproductive phase accounted for the majority of variation in shoot biomass response to irrigation r2 0 66 p 0 001 for total dry matter and r2 0 46 p 0 01 for yield the environments had a significant effect on radiation use

efficiency 1 introduction approximately 90 of world s chickpea cicer arietinum l is grown as a cool season food legume crop between the latitudes 20 and 40 croser et al 2003 kumar and abbo 2001 the crop is generally grown on receding soil moisture conditions where terminal drought is one of the major constraints for the productivity of the crop krishnamurthy et al 1999 lake et al 2016 deep rooting trait has been proposed for improving genetic tolerance of chickpea to terminal drought zaman allah et al 2011 while genotypic variability for deep rooting trait has been explored extensively there have been limited studies on canopy management during early growth phase to limit crop water use to ensure water availability for reproduction and grain filling zaman allah et al 2011 any reduction in the aboveground portion of plant affects photosynthetic capacity of the plant thus affecting source sink relationship depending on the crop stage beadle 1985 siddique and sedgley 1985 showed that removing less productive lateral basal branches had no effect of shoot biomass but increased harvest index of chickpea by 31 in mediterranean type of environment slower canopy development in de branched crop was associated with lower water use during pre flowering phase siddique and sedgley 1985 with moderate yield improvement under terminal drought situation beuerlein et al 1971 have reported similar increase in seed yield due to removal of branches in soybean plants with increased seed yields attributed to greater light interception during flowering and higher seed per m2 of leaf area partial defoliation during flowering resulted in a reduction in leaf area and it had minimal influence in seed yield or hi in chickpea iqbal et al 2012 li et al 2010 while 50 defoliation during pod development phase resulted in significant reduction of shoot dry matter and yield pandey 1984 the effect of defoliation on the compensatory growth of chickpea collin et al 2000 is dependent on the environment and the crop growth stage when the defoliation is imposed iqbal et al 2012 continuous defoliation by 25 50 or 75 of chickpea starting from first flower until physiological maturity in subtropical environment resulted in significant reduction in yield and resulted in inability of the crop to compensate for lost leaf area sheldrake et al 1978 in contrast some studies concluded that de topping during pre flowering phase could be a profitable practice for chickpea growers baloch and zubair 2010 reducing foliage during early stages of chickpea crop growth could increase number of branches while restricting profuse vegetative growth nipping practice in chickpea could have twofold advantage on one hand nipping at early growth stage of chickpea could improve yield while on the other hand this practice would provide an opportunity for resource poor farmers to obtain green fodder for their livestock defoliation reduces the photosynthetic capacity of plants temporarily but the compensatory growth during recovery phase allocates more carbon to the aboveground biomass depending on the environment some studies reported that following defoliation root growth is reduced while leaf regrowth is accelerated due to the increase in the re allocation of reserves from root to shoot ourry et al 1988 various mechanisms have been proposed for compensatory growth such as higher photosynthetic rate of regrown foliage higher stomatal conductance and delayed senescence striker et al 2008 however there is limited information on the effect of partial removal of shoot dry matter during early vegetative phase on the shoot dry matter radiation and water use efficiencies harvest index yield and seed quality of chickpea in diverse environments the present study investigates if partial reduction of shoot dry matter during early vegetative growth phase saves sub soil water for reproduction and grain filling of the crop in diverse environments the effect of canopy management on the water uptake by roots crop growth and yield performance of chickpea is investigated under nine diverse environments in queensland australia 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites field experiments were implanted in the 2017 winter season apr to nov at the department of agriculture and fisheries daf research facilities located at emerald agricultural college 23 3 s 148 1 e hermitage 28 2 s 152 1 e and kingaroy 26 6 s 151 9 e research stations in queensland australia these locations represented typical chickpea production environments in cereal legume based cropping systems at emerald and hermitage soils were 150 cm deep brown hermitage or black emerald vertisols while at kingaroy the soil was 100 cm deep red ferrosol the details of sowing and harvesting dates max and min t radiation in crop rainfall dates and amounts of irrigation applied in each environment at each site are presented in tables 1 and 2 2 2 experimental design and crop management seed of cultivar pba seamer obtained from the australian chickpea breeding programme was used at all sites a starter dose of a commercial formulation of zinc n 11 0 p 21 8 s 4 0 and zn 1 0 at the rate of 30 kg ha at emerald and hermitage and 50 kg ha at kingaroy was incorporated into the soil at the time of planting as part of a standard practice the crop was planted on non limiting table 2 conditions in three sowing windows at 50 cm row spacing rsp at the three sites appropriate plant protection practices were implemented at the three sites at all the three trial sites the trial was laid out as a split split plot design with three sowing dates en 1 2 3 as main plots irrigation irr and rainfed rf treatments as sub plots and two canopy management treatments i e partial reduction of shoot dry matter mechanically prs and control con as sub sub plots with three replications rep a 10 m buffer with pba seamer was sown at 50 cm row spacing to separate the irr and rf treatments each sub plot was 12 m long and 4 m wide a plant population of approximately 30 4 plants m2 was maintained in all sites at hermitage the irrigation was applied using a drip system operated by a pressure pump while at emerald and kingaroy an overhead sprinkler irrigation system was used at hermitage two drip lines of 12 m length containing 120 drippers per plot were laid out each dripper in the drip line emitted 1 1 l of water per hr amount of water delivered for each irrigation was calculated as pump time in hr emitting rate dripper hr number of drippers per plot at emerald and kingaroy the irrigation amount was estimated by multiplying a pre calibrated rate mm hr for the overhead system with the period of each irrigation the canopy management treatments were applied at 42 days after sowing the prs treatment was implemented by slashing top 15 cm of shoot foliage using a hand held mower 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 solar radiation interception photosynthetically active solar radiation par above and below the canopy at the ground level were simultaneously recorded at three random spots in each plot at hermitage emerald and kingaroy sites on specified days during the growing season table 1 the measurements were made using a ceptometer accupar model lp 80 decagon devices usa on clear days between 11 30 and 13 00 h the fractional par intercepted f on a given day was calculated as the ratio of the radiation measured below the canopy at the ground level to the incident par measured above the canopy eq 1 eq 1 f r i n r where f fractional par intercepted by the crop mj m2 inr incident par r par measured at the bottom of the crop canopy 2 3 2 radiation use efficiency rue the radiation use efficiency for total shoot dry matter ruedm was computed as the ratio of peak shoot dry matter g m2 and cumulative par intercepted ri mj m2 by the crop sinclair et al 1992 for each plot using eq 2 peak shoot dry matter psb was recorded prior to any leaf senescence when 50 of pods on a plant were mature however timing of the desiccation before final harvest varied between environments table 1 eq 2 rue dm g mj psb g m 2 cumulative ri mj m 2 the radiation use efficiency for grain yield rue yld was computed using eq 3 eq 3 rue yld g mj grain yield g m 2 cumulative ri mj m 2 where cumulative ri mj m2 was the cumulative par intercepted by the canopy that was calculated as eq 4 ri f e p s b i n r where f was the fractional radiation intercepted at the psb and สinr was the cumulative incident par from emergence e to psb 2 3 3 soil moisture content soil moisture content was measured at 25 cm 45 cm 65 cm 85 cm 105 cm and 125 cm depths using a neutron moisture probe 503 dr hydroprobe cpn international at emerald and cpn 503 elite hydroprobe instrotek inc at hermitage sites aluminium tubes of 150 cm length and 50 mm dia were installed in centre rows of sub subplots when the crop was 20 day old and capped to protect from rain and dust two access tubes one between the plants in the row and the other in the middle of rows were installed in each sub sub plot to examine the effect of canopy management prs and con treatments on the capture of soil water in addition three extra access tubes were installed in the uncropped area in the edges of the experimental site for the calibration of neutron probe the neutron moisture probe nmp was calibrated by regressing the gravimetric soil water content measured at different depths at three or four times during the season against the neutron moisture probe readings the nmp readings accounted for 84 and 78 of variation in soil moisture content at emerald and hermitage sites respectively rachaputi et al 2015 the soil moisture was recorded from 4 leaf stage at 4 5 day intervals until crop desiccation the nmp measurements were also made before and after each irrigation in irrigated treatment or rainfall event the total water extracted at each phenophase was calculated as indicated in eq 5 eq 5 w e x d 1 d 6 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 where wex was the water extracted from 125 cm soil profile at a given phenophase d1 and d6 were the depths e1 and e2 were plant available water content pawc in the soil measured at event 1 and e3 and e4 were pawc at event 2 and so on the soil moisture content in the top 0 10 cm layer was simultaneously sampled gravimetrically the data was converted into volumetric units and added to the 25 cm depth reading made by the neutron moisture probe total volume of water extracted from 125 cm soil profile was calculated by summing the six depths the total water extracted for each phenophase was calculated as the sum of water extracted at the events within a given phenophase 2 3 4 peak shoot biomass the peak shoot biomass psb was recorded when 50 pods on plants in plot were mature plants for psb were hand harvested at the ground level from one m2 area in each plot and plant count recorded the harvested plants were dried in a fan forced oven at 80 c for 48 h before recording shoot leaves stems pods grains dry weight 2 3 5 grain yield the plot area excluding the area harvested for peak shoot biomass was measured and the final yield was assessed when 90 of plants in a plot had around 80 mature pods plants were desiccated by applying a foliar spray of glyphosate at 2 l ha 5 7 days before machine harvesting the grain samples collected from the harvester were cleaned to remove any extraneous matter and dried to 10 moisture content before weighing 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted for each site for the psb yield and harvest index using a split split design using r software r core team 2018 analysis of water extraction was done for each phenophase separately for each site comparison among means were done using tukey s test tukey 1949 the association between the growth variables was analysed using regression approach graphs were developed using sigma plot 10 0 systat software san jose ca and r software 3 results 3 1 weather details of planting and harvest dates en 1 2 3 crop duration days irrigation mm and days after sowing das at which fractional intercepted radiation dasfri was measured at each site are presented in table 1 it was apparent that crop duration and days to 50 flowering reduced progressively from en 1 to en 3 at the three sites i e emerald hermitage and kingaroy crops in the planting windows en 1 2 3 experienced highly variable environments across all sites in crop weather during the pre flowering and post flowering phases of chickpea var pba seamer grown in en 1 2 and 3 at the 3 sites are presented in table 2 at emerald maxt and mint ranged from 25 8 c to 28 7 c and 10 2 12 6 c during pre and post flowering periods in en 1 and en 2 respectively however in the post flowering phase of en 3 the maxt and mint raised to 30 8 and 14 8 c mean daily radiation progressively increased from 15 2 in en 1 21 1 mj m2 day in en 3 the cumulative radiation during post flowering phase was consistently higher than that in the pre flowering phase at all sites except for en 2 and en 3 at hermitage there was also progressive increase in vpd in en 1 to en 3 at all sites for instance vpd during post flowering phase increased from 2 4kpa in en 1 3 1kpa in en 3 at emerald from 2 0kpa to 2 2 at hermitage and from 2 2kpa to 2 5kpa at kingaroy sites the in crop rain was highly variable across sites but generally post flowering phase received more rain compared to pre flowering phase at hermitage and kingaroy sites but in crop rain was generally less at emerald in en 1 and en 2 but there was 165 mm rain in en 3 the mean cumulative thermal time from sowing to maturity across three ens was 1885 405 days at emerald 2195 169 days at hermitage and 2108 199 days at kingaroy 3 2 peak shoot dry matter yield and hi the fig 1 presents the mean effects of environments en 1 en 2 and en 3 and irrigation treatments irr and rf on peak shoot biomass psb of chickpea pba seamer at each of the three sites environmental effect was significant with psb progressively declining from en 1 to en 3 in both irrigated irr and rainfed rf treatments at emerald and hermitage sites but psb was significantly reduced in en 2 at kingaroy in both rf and irr treatments due to severe dry spell for 2 months during early reproductive phase supplementary fig 1 environments accounted for most variation in psb at emerald and kingaroy p 0 001 and hermitage p 0 01 table 3 at emerald irr treatment had minimal effects on psbs within each of the three ens although psb declined steadily from 7 5 t ha to 6 0 t ha and 4 0 t ha in en 1 en 2 and en 3 respectively fig 1 table 3 at hermitage the psb was the highest in en 1 and en 2 10 t ha in irr treatment however psb declined to 9 t ha and 7 5 t ha in en 2 and en 3 respectively the rf treatment resulted in a significant reduction up to 60 in psb compared to irr treatment in all the three ens at hermitage at kingaroy psb declined significantly in rf treatments in en 2 compared to en 1 and en 3 demonstrating significant effect of environment the grain yield was highly variable across ens at the three sites fig 1 table 3 at emerald yields declined significantly p 0 001 in en 3 compared to en 1 but yields were the highest in en 2 compared to en 1 and en 3 suggesting that en 2 was most optimal for planting chickpea for this site at hermitage yields of 3 t ha were maintained under irr treatment in all the three environments the irr treatment in general resulted in higher grain yield compared to rf treatment in most ens at all sites however at hermitage and kingaroy yields in rf treatment were the lowest in en 1 and en 2 1 t ha and highest 2 t ha in en 3 the hi varied from 0 18 in en 1 at kingaroy to 0 5 in en 2 at emerald there was a trend for an increase in hi from en 1 to en 3 at all sites the mean hi increased from 0 32 en 1 to 0 41 en 3 at emerald 0 33 en 1 to 0 41 en 2 at hermitage and 0 18 en 1 to 0 27 en 3 at kingaroy data not presented it is worth noting that despite high peak shoot biomass hi was lowest in en 1 at kingaroy however further analysis of daily weather data at this site suggested that there was a 6 weeks of severe dry spell during early reproductive stage mid september to mid october followed by 131 mm of rain in 3days period followed by bright sunshine close to maturity this event severely affected reproductive development in en 2 at kingaroy there was a negative relationship between cumulative incident radiation and hi across ens fig 2 r2 0 38 p 0 001 3 3 effects of environment irrigation canopy management the environment had significant effect on psb yield and hi at all sites p 0 01 or p 0 001 table 3 irrigation ir also had significant effect on psb and yield at all sites p 0 001 but hi was affected by ir only at kingaroy site p 0 001 the canopy management treatment significantly affected grain yield only at emerald p 0 001 and psb p 0 01 at kingaroy where there was a significant reduction in psb in en 2 compared to en 1 or en 3 table 3 the en ir interaction was significant for psb yield and hi at kingaroy and significant for psb at hermitage table 3 3 4 response to irrigation the response to irr computed as the difference in peak shoot biomass psb and yield between the irr and rf treatments was the highest at hermitage and the least at emerald site fig 3 at hermitage the yield response to irrigation was the highest up to 2 t ha in en 1 but steadily declined in en 2 1 5 t ha and en 3 1 25 t ha however the yield response to irrigation amongst ens varied from 0 25 to 0 75 t ha at emerald while at kingaroy yield response was the highest in en 2 1 1 25 t ha but less than 0 5 t ha in en 1 and en 3 further analysis of the environmental factors underpinning the variable response to irrigation across ens revealed that vapour pressure deficit vpd during reproductive phase accounted for the majority of variation in psb response to irrigation r2 0 66 p 0 001 for psb fig 4 and r2 0 91 p 0 001 for yield at hermitage and emerald supplementary fig 2 3 5 radiation interception and radiation use efficiency the reduction in fractional radiation interception f because of the canopy management treatments in all ens excepting en 3 at hermitage is presented in fig 5 it was clear that there was a reduction f up to 25 in prs treatment initially followed by rapid recovery in most ens the differences between control and prs treatments disappeared as the crops reached maturity at emerald the crops in both control and partial reduction in shoot biomass prs treatments were intercepting close to 100 by 1250 gdd with minimal difference between irr and rf treatments at hermitage and kingaroy f reached 80 in both canopy management treatments in irr treatment only but in rf treatment f was 50 60 there was a trend for reduction in f beyond 1250 gdd at both the sites although the reduction in f was more pronounced after 1250 gdd in en 2 at kingaroy due to severe dry spell which caused leaf senescence there was a significant positive relationship between cumulative par intercepted and peak shoot biomass psb across diverse environments fig 6 however radiation use efficiency g mj was much lower at kingaroy compared to emerald and hermitage sites the rues for biomass was 0 74 g mj r2 0 97 p 0 001 for emerald and hermitage and 0 54 g mj r2 0 95 p 0 001 for kingaroy and the rue for yield was 0 28 g mj r2 0 95 p 0 01 for emerald and hermitage and 0 15 g mj r2 0 98 p 0 001 for kingaroy 3 6 water extraction patterns the effects of canopy management treatments on temporal patterns of water extraction by chickpea was measured under irrigated and rainfed treatments only in en 2 and en 1 at emerald and hermitage sites figs 7 and 8 at emerald during the pre flowering phase the water extraction pattern was similar between the irr and rainfed treatments as well as the canopy management treatments fig 7 however during the post flowering phase plants under irrigated treatment extracted more water up to 75 cm depth compared in rainfed treatment in both canopy management treatments it was also clear that at emerald plants in control treatment extracted more water up to 110 cm rooting depth in both irrigated and rainfed conditions compared to those in pbr treatment where active water extraction was limited to 50 cm depth only fig 7 at hermitage there was rapid extraction of water to a depth of 60 cm in both irrigated and rainfed treatments in pre flowering phase although plants in rainfed conditions extracted 80 mm more water from 60 cm depth compared with plants in irrigated treatment which extracted 40 mm from the same depth fig 8 however during the post flowering phase there was more water extraction up to 50 cm depth in pbr treatment compared to control in both irrigated and rainfed conditions there were no differences between irrigated and rainfed conditions below 50 cm depth in control treatment however in pbr treatment more water was extracted in irrigated treatment up to 60 cm depth after which irrigated treatment extracted more water compared to rainfed treatment up to 125 cm depth the evapo transpiration et by chickpea crop under the two canopy management practices control and pbr and under irrigated and rainfed conditions was measured at emerald and hermitage sites table 4 the total et by the crop differed significantly between emerald and hermitage but the differences between control and pbr treatments at a given site were less pronounced for instance at emerald pbr treatment extracted 3 mm and 17 mm less water under irr and rain fed conditions compared to control respectively the water use efficiency wue for peak shoot biomass and grain yield differed significantly between sites with the mean wue values for pbs being higher at emerald 22 6 kg ha mm compared to 15 6 kg ha mm at hermitage table 4 the mean wue for yields were 9 1 and 5 7 kg ha mm at emerald and hermitage respectively 3 7 yield components the yield components were measured at kingaroy and hermitage sites and at hermitage they were measured only at en 1 and en 2 table 5 the irrigation had a significant effect on most of the yield components excepting for hundred seed weight hsw at both sites table 5 sites had significant effect on all yield components for instance plant height pht and plant height to first pod pht1p were significantly higher at kingaroy compared to hermitage however there was a trend for progressive reduction in pht from en 1 to en 3 under irrigated treatment at kingaroy but not at hermitage the number of primary branches pbr per plant were significantly less under rf and irr treatments at kingaroy compared to hermitage there was a trend for increased pbr under irr treatment at hermitage however the total pod number tp and total seed number tsn were generally higher with irr treatment compared to rf at both sites but hermitage site tended to have higher tp and tsn than kingaroy site interestingly the number of seeds aborted tsa per plant were significantly higher at kingaroy compared to hermitage site and the tsa were significantly higher in irr than the rf treatment at both the sites the hundred seed weight hsw was significantly higher at hermitage compared to kingaroy and irr treatment had only small effect on hsw at both sites 4 discussion because of the indeterminate growth habit of chickpea the reproductive growth and development and physiological maturity occur simultaneously in different parts of the plant along with vegetative growth saxena 1984 a thorough understanding of the response of the crop growth and development to environmental factors is thus critical to interpret the crop s performance across environments the most important environmental factors affecting chickpea growth and development are temperature siddique and sedgley 1985 photoperiod summerfield et al 1991 upadhyay et al 1994 ellis et al 1994 and soil moisture saxena et al 1990 terminal drought is one of the major constraints for chickpea productivity in semi arid tropics krishnamurthy et al 2010 and extensive root growth has been suggested as the desirable genotypic trait that could contribute to seed yield under terminal drought conditions kashiwagi et al 2005 subbarao et al 1995 turner et al 2001 however genotypic strategies that save water during early vegetative growth phase for use during reproductive and grain filling phase could be equally critical zaman allah et al 2011 many studies focussed on the genotypic traits contributing to yield under water deficit but effects on temporal patterns of water use on crop phenological development have not been reported in chickpea lake et al 2016 our study quantified temporal variation in environmental variables and their effect on crop growth and development in nine diverse environments 4 1 phenology we considered each sowing date as an environment which involved a combination of various environmental components which is an approach that is more comprehensive intensive experiments using growth chambers with environmental control are needed to tease out effects of the individual variables environments had significant effect on crop phenology by hastening the onset of 50 flowering at hermitage and kingaroy and maturity at the three sites table 1 time to 50 flowering was hastened by 15 days and 22 days at hermitage and kingaroy respectively while time to 50 flowering unaffected at emerald this could be due to indeterminate growth habit of chickpea influencing source sink balance depending on the temperature and soil moisture availability resulting in significant effects on vegetative growth crop maturity and yield lawlor et al 2001 li et al 2010 roberts et al 1985 found that rate of progress towards flowering is a linear function of mean temperature with no interaction with photoperiod our study showed that crop maturity was accelerated from en 1 to en 3 by 24 days 36 days and 15 days at emerald hermitage and kingaroy sites respectively table 1 these changes in crop maturity could be due to combined increases in temperature variations in soil moisture vpd and radiation from en 1 to en 3 kanchan and bhatia 2014 observed similar effects of elevated temperature 4 2 crop growth the peak shoot biomass was reduced from en 1 to en 3 by 44 21 and 4 at emerald hermitage and kingaroy sites respectively despite the reduction in peak shoot biomass the yield reduction occurred only at emerald site by 41 but not at hermitage and kingaroy sites temperatures above 30 c in en 3 at emerald might have affected reproductive processes devasirvatham et al 2012 summerfield et al 1984 and high vpd 3kpa during the reproductive phase might have resulted in stomatal closure leading to reduced transpiration affecting water uptake by the crop under irrigated condition lobell et al 2013 sadras et al 2015 indeed the negative relationship between biomass response to irrigation and vpd during reproductive phase of the crop fig 4 supports this observation increasing temperatures of the growing environment managed by sowing date resulted in a progressive reduction in lai by 62 psb by 32 and seed yield by 46 salih et al 2018 temperatures above 15 c caused flower and pod abortion in parts of the indian subcontinent and australia clarke 2001 srinivasan et al 1998 4 3 response to irrigation environments had profound effect on chickpeas response to irrigation for instance at emerald where the temperature and vpd increased from en 1 to en 3 response to irrigation progressively reduced in both canopy management treatments while at hermitage the response to irrigation was significantly higher in the three environments compared to emerald because of lower temperatures and vpd at hermitage although the response to irrigation reduced steadily from en 1 to en 3 fig 3 at kingaroy minimal response to irrigation in en 1 and en 3 could be due to different reasons leaf senescence due to severe dry spell spanning en 3 followed by 282 mm rain during the final stages of crop growth resulted in minimal response to irrigation 4 4 canopy management the present study contributes to the current understanding on the physiological responses of chickpea to canopy management partial biomass reduction and control and elaborates how canopy management treatments influence crop growth and source sink relations under diverse environmental conditions as shown in fig 5 partial reduction in shoot biomass during early vegetative phase by around 25 may accelerate photosynthetic capacity of rest of the canopy resulting in rapid compensatory growth iqbal et al 2012 and accelerate sink metabolism by remobilizing carbon and nitrogen reserves khan et al 2007 paul and foyer 2001 canopy management practices like defoliation iqbal et al 2012 nipping or cutting back baloch and zubair 2010 or removal of basal branches siddique and sedgley 1985 implemented during vegetative phase had either no effect or positive effect on yield in the present study there were minimal effects of canopy management practices on yield in all the environments at the three sites 4 5 water use efficiency sites had significant effects on evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue table 4 at emerald the et was lower and wue for peak shoot biomass psb and grain yield was higher while at hermitage et was higher but wue was lower for psb and yield the increase in the seasonal et outweighed the increase in the crop yield thus resulting in relatively lower water use efficiency at hermitage there were no significant effects of canopy management treatments on wue at both sites table 4 the wue for psb and grain yield values reported in the current study 3 5 10 4 kg grain ha mm are comparable to number of studies reported for chickpea angadi et al 2008 gan et al 2009 miller et al 2001 between 5 and 10 kg grain ha mm the variation in wue observed at the two sites in the current study could be due to environment management interactions 4 6 water extraction patterns environment had profound effect on water extraction pattern at emerald where the temperature and vpd were about 27 c and 2 4kpa respectively during pre flowering phase there was little difference between treatments in water extraction however at hermitage amount of water extracted in control treatment during pre flowering period 80 mm was significantly higher than partial shoot biomass reduction prs treatment 50 mm supporting the hypothesis that the canopy reduction during early vegetative phase reduces water use by the crop thus saving water however there was greater water extraction during reproductive phase at both sites although extraction depth varied between sites and treatments in the present study water extraction was observed up to 110 cm depth in control compared to 75 cm in pbr treatment at emerald however at hermitage which had higher rainfall water extraction during pre flowering stage was from 60 cm depth in control compared to 125 cm in pbr treatment however most of the water used came from top 0 40 cm anwar et al 2000 higher water extraction in irrigated treatment at hermitage resulted in higher yield as observed in earlier studies anwar et al 2000 oweis and hachum 2003 4 7 yield components several studies reported relationships between yield and yield components with an aim of identifying stable genetic trait s for use in the chickpea crop improvement programmes gรผler et al 2001 arshad et al 2003 some studies reported significant genotype environment g e interactions for yield components in chickpea arshad et al 2003 bakhsh et al 2006 however there is limited information about the environmental factors underpinning the observed g e interaction in yield components the current study investigated the effects of two canopy management treatments control and partial biomass reduction and two water treatments supplementary irrigation and rainfed in nine diverse environments created by 3 different dates of sowing at 3 locations on the yield components at kingaroy and hermitage sites table 5 higher plant height height to first pod at kingaroy could be associated with weather components lower radiation and higher rainfall during the growing seasons or soil n status namvar et al 2011 high seed abortion at kingaroy in both rf and irr treatments compared to hermitage could be due to leaf senescence caused due to 11 17 lower radiation due to persistent overcast followed by 34 47 higher rainfall during the active seed filling phase this situation may also have resulted in lower 100 seed weight at kingaroy daily mean temperatures during post flowering period were above 15 c in all environments ruling out the possibility of low temperature being a cause for seed abortion croser et al 2003 5 conclusions environments had significant effect on crop phenology by hastening the onset of 50 flowering at hermitage kingaroy and crop maturity at the three sites the peak shoot biomass was reduced from en 1 to en 3 by 44 21 and 4 at emerald hermitage and kingaroy sites respectively the variation in rainfall and vpds with in the environments had profound effect on chickpea s response to irrigation partial reduction in shoot biomass prs treatment during early vegetative phase resulted in a 25 reduction in photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy but rapid compensatory growth following the psb treatment led to closing of the gap between two canopy management treatments environment also had a profound effect on water extraction pattern during at pre and post flowering phases the study suggested that the effects of partial reduction in shoot biomass had minimal effects on crop growth and yield in all environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10207,this study evaluates four groundwater management plans to increase the understanding of how local governance and collective action can be effectively implemented to manage irrigation withdrawals in kansas the results of our analysis demonstrate five key lessons that highlight the challenges of collective action efforts to manage common pool resources in a developed country setting first the four management plans generally follow ostrom s design principles for collective action however there are important areas particularly boundaries and allocations definition where the management plans could be improved to better align with ostrom s design principles second a majority of farmers agree that action is needed to reduce the rate of aquifer depletion but management plans have not substantially reduced water use third management plans that allow for voluntary participation have not received more support than those that require mandatory compliance perhaps due to the classic free rider problem fourth there is no clear evidence that heterogeneous benefits from management explain support within a management area fifth groundwater users generally perceive that they have an acceptable level of information our analysis highlights the significant challenges facing successful collective action efforts to manage water in the usa and that the efforts are most likely to be successful when they are small scale mandatory and involve users in the formation process keywords ogallala aquifer collective action local governance irrigation aquifer depletion 1 introduction the high plains aquifer hpa in the central united states also known as ogallala aquifer is one of the largest aquifers in the world the aquifer underlies portions of eight states from south dakota to texas this area is one of the primary agricultural regions in the country where land use is dominated by irrigated agriculture however extraction of groundwater at rates that exceed natural recharge has led to persistent aquifer depletion particularly in the central and southern portions of the hpa e g scanlon et al 2012 steward and allen 2016 mcguire 2017 this unsustainable path of groundwater extraction is especially true in western kansas where the agricultural economy critically depends on the ogallala aquifer steward and allen 2016 project that by 2060 under a business as usual scenario only 18 of the original aquifer saturated thickness will remain in west central kansas and 27 in southwest kansas the impact of reductions in water use on future aquifer level has some uncertainty steward et al 2013 estimate that reducing water use by about 80 is needed to sustain the aquifer while butler et al 2016 2018 estimate that a reduction of only 21 33 would sustain the aquifer in western kansas local governance institutions that collectively manage the aquifer have been developed in kansas as a potential solution to promote water conservation for example drysdale and hendricks 2018 find that farmers in sheridan county in northwest kansas substantially reduced groundwater extraction by forming a local enhanced management area lema to impose a restriction on themselves drysdale and hendricks 2018 note that this lema had the broad support of the local irrigators based on records from meeting minutes in this paper we study the design and support for four different local management efforts in kansas including the sheridan county lema the conventional theory of the commons states that even though users would benefit from collectively managing the aquifer each user has an incentive to not participate in collective management managing a common pool groundwater resource is particularly difficult because it is not observable and it is hard to understand its boundaries meinzen dick 2018 however there exists significant empirical evidence showing that users might cooperate to design implement and monitor rules for the appropriate use of the resource and to avoid the tragedy of the commons ostrom 2002 in this context ostrom 1990 proposed eight design principles that facilitate collective action the empirical studies of these principles are challenging due to the complexity of the common pool resources and data scarcity to perform statistical analysis smith 2016 instead most studies use qualitative analysis of case studies to evaluate the design principles e g cox et al 2010 baggio et al 2016 another related perspective is that collective action and management rules regarding common pool resources emerge when their social benefits exceed their social costs and transaction costs demsetz 1967 coase 1960 recognized that transaction costs to adopt new institutional rules could be high and that they could affect users willingness to participate in collective action more recently ayres et al 2018 find that transaction costs associated with defining and enforcing property rights limit agreement on groundwater rights or management plans even in critically overdrafted basins cody et al 2015 show how reduced transaction costs enable irrigators in san luis valley of colorado to create a groundwater subdistrict to collectively reduce groundwater use the objective of our study is to increase the understanding of how local governance and collective action can be effectively implemented to manage irrigation withdrawals in a developed country context we need to better understand under what conditions irrigators support groundwater management plans and how current governance could be modified to facilitate collective action to manage the aquifer we consider collective action and local governance concepts in a complex setting where groundwater users government agencies and other stakeholders interact to obtain common objectives it is typical that self governed systems where resource users are actively involved in designing collective management plans also include rules made by local regional national or international authorities ostrom 2002 smith et al 2017 and shalsi et al 2019 show how irrigators working together with government agencies improved groundwater management and resource conditions to accomplish our objective we evaluate four collective management plans that are either proposed or recently implemented in southwest sw northwest nw and in wichita county wc of kansas this evaluation is based on the eight design principles proposed by ostrom 1990 we also analyze key variables such as aquifer conditions or user heterogeneity that affect groundwater users willingness to support collaborative local management our study provides insights to the scientific community water managers and policymakers about the prospects for users to successfully manage common pool resources in a developed country 2 policy background for the study region the state of kansas adopted the prior appropriation doctrine in 1945 which embodies the concept of first in time first in right prior appropriation requires groundwater appropriators to obtain a permit from the state engineer to extract water the permit authorizes the annual amount of water that can be extracted and the place of use the date that the permit is authorized defines the priority of the right with older rights having seniority this system of priority is relevant under water scarcity conditions if pumping by a junior water right holder impairs the ability of a senior water right holder to exercise its right then the junior can be required to reduce withdrawals the system of priority has had a minimal impact on avoiding overlapping wells that lead to a significant drawdown in many areas edwards 2016 given the inability of the state to control the depletion problem five groundwater management districts gmds were established in 1972 they have authority from the division of water resources kansas department of agriculture dwr kda to act on the behalf of local water users the board of directors is elected local stakeholders with an interest in promoting regional economic welfare the gmds have developed management programs to improve the management of groundwater such as well spacing requirements and closing the district to further drilling but the gmds had never restricted water use on existing wells before 2013 in 2012 the kansas legislature authorized local enhanced management areas lemas the lema is a tool that gives the board of directors of gmds the authority to implement corrective measures for water conservation for a particular region a lema must include clear geographic boundaries corrective measures e g limits on the amount of water pumped compliance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms a lema may also allow other types of measures that provide flexibility in water use such as allowing trading of water right within the lema the plan requires the approval of the gmd board of directors and the state s chief engineer the approval process includes public hearings the lema requires mandatory compliance of irrigators within the management area even if the irrigator was not supportive of the lema kda monitors and enforces the lema water conservation areas wcas were authorized by the kansas legislature in 2015 a wca allows a water right owner or group of owners the opportunity to develop a management plan to reduce total withdrawals while allowing additional flexibility in the use of water the wca requires purely voluntary participation of irrigators and does not require approval by the gmd board but must be approved by the chief engineer wcas may implement water restrictions among participants that are enforced by the state but any water users can choose to be excluded from the wca in this paper we evaluate four cases of local governance and collective action efforts shown in fig 1 that are in various stages of development in the southwest sw region local water rights owners in northern finney and kearny counties considered different ways to reduce the rate of decline in the aquifer a steering committee was formed to propose options for a proposed lema a survey was conducted by the kda in 2017 to better understand irrigators views towards a potential lema versus purely voluntary reductions in water use the survey results were unfavorable towards a lema and no lema proposal in the area has moved towards implementation the second management effort that we evaluate is the district wide lema in northwest nw kansas that began in 2018 1 1 https agriculture ks gov divisions programs dwr managing kansas water resources local enhanced management areas gmd4 district wide lema this district wide lema sets a 5 year allocation for pumping where the allocation is defined for each township approximately 6 miles 6 miles in the district the lema was ultimately approved and implemented in 2018 but was not without controversy in june 2018 a group of water right owners petitioned for judicial review of the lema in district court to challenge the lema orders and the validity of its statutory provisions the district court upheld the lema order in october 2019 but the decision may be appealed the third management area is the sheridan 6 lema contained within the boundary of the district wide lema in the nw region in a portion of sheridan and thomas counties the sheridan 6 lema s first allocation period was 2013 2017 and a new allocation was approved for the 2018 2022 period 2 2 https agriculture ks gov divisions programs dwr managing kansas water resources local enhanced management areas sheridan county 6 lema the allocation in the sheridan 6 lema is more stringent than the district wide lema but only the more stringent allocation is relevant to farmers minutes from meetings of the sheridan 6 lema indicate broad support for the plan but we have no data on which individuals might not support the plan therefore we only discuss this collective action effort when we evaluate the ostrom s design principles the impacts of the sheridan 6 lema on producer irrigation decisions have been examined in detail by drysdale and hendricks 2018 and deines et al 2019 the fourth management area that we consider is the wc wca 3 3 https agriculture ks gov divisions programs dwr managing kansas water resources wca some water rights owners in wc voluntarily joined together to create a plan to reduce water use with a collective desire to sustain their community by conserving groundwater resources a small group worked together to create the plan and then recruited water users in the county to voluntarily join the effort wc is in a portion of the aquifer that is highly depleted with little saturated thickness remaining fig 1 one management effort that we do not analyze in detail given that we do not have a measure of support is the 2014 proposed district wide gmd 1 lema in west central kansas the proposal was for a six year allocation where the allocations were defined as 20 reduction from historical use the board of directors decided to put the gmd 1 lema up for a vote by water right owners even though the legislation does not require a vote of water users the lema proposal did not receive a majority of votes and was not implemented we know the vote count in each county but not the vote of each water user wc is within gmd 1 and the wca was proposed after the failure of the gmd 1 lema 3 data in each case study we have a measure of support for the management plan across different users except for sheridan 6 lema in the sw area we have results from a survey conducted by kda in 2017 to elicit feedback about a potential lema the cover letter was signed by the manager of the gmd and it was stated the results of the survey would be shared with the local steering committee and the gmd board of directors therefore while the survey is a stated preference survey it has strong consequentiality so that users have an incentive to respond honestly vossler et al 2012 the survey was mailed to all water users within the proposed lema boundary there were 70 survey responses returned from 465 water users for a response rate of about 15 in the nw area we do not have information on which users supported the district wide lema but we do have information on some users who actively opposed the lema in particular we collect the names of the individuals or entities that filed a lawsuit to challenge the legality of the district wide lema we also obtained data on the allocations of each water right under the lema from kda a limitation of these data is that there are likely individuals that opposed the lema but did not participate in the lawsuit however it is still insightful to examine if the characteristics of those filing the lawsuit differed systematically from the rest of the water users in the wc area we collected the names and water right numbers that voluntarily enrolled in the wca from the wca agreements that were posted online these data are unique because they represent revealed preferences on willingness to participate in a voluntary management plan for all three of these datasets water right numbers are available which allow us to match them with data from the water information management and analysis system wimas the wimas data contain information for each water right on attributes of the water right e g priority date historical use and location in kansas all water rights are required to report their water use we also merge hydrologic data obtained from kansas geological survey to the wimas data at the section level as defined by the public land survey system plss we also supplement the data above with qualitative data we reviewed groundwater users testimonies from public meetings held in the process of approving the district wide lema in gmd 4 we also reviewed the documents that define the management plans and meeting minutes for the district wide lema sheridan 6 lema and wc wca since there are formal documents to define the rules in these areas 4 methods and analytical framework we evaluate the four cases following the eight design principles for long term institutions for collective action proposed by ostrom 1990 we also identify factors that affect the irrigators willingness to participate in collective action to effectively manage the aquifer the key issue is to understand how resource and user attributes affect the perceived benefits and costs following ostrom 2002 we observe that each groundwater user i compares the net benefits under the old rules bo with the expected benefits under the new rules bn d i b n i b o i where d i is the user s incentive to support the new rules if d i 0 for some users then they consider three costs initial costs of time and effort spent organizing and agreeing under the new rules c1 short term costs of operating in the new conditions c2 and long term costs of monitoring and maintaining new rules c3 hence user i will invest time and effort to implement new institutions if the incentive to change exceeds the sum of the expected costs d i c 1 i c 2 i c 3 i in our setting irrigators are extracting groundwater from a shared aquifer expected benefits under the old rules bo reflect the stream of profits under the existing prior appropriations doctrine expected benefits under the new rules bn of reduced allocations could be larger than under the old rules if the allocations correct the spatial externality of pumping on neighboring wells under the new rules the farmer could sacrifice some profits in the short run for greater profits in the long run the difference in expected benefits d i could differ across groundwater users due to aquifer and soil conditions for example areas with greater hydraulic conductivity and lower recharge have greater expected benefits from management edwards 2016 areas with too large of a saturated thickness may also have smaller gains from management because the negative impacts of excess depletion are not imminent and areas with too small of a saturated thickness may also have smaller gains from management because there is little aquifer to preserve foster et al 2017 differences in expected benefits could also differ across users due to different preferences for example users may also differ in how they discount future benefits some users may value preserving the lifestyle of farming for future generations more than others costs of management are also likely to differ across users users likely differ in their willingness to organize or attend meetings where the new rules are discussed i e c1 differs across users contracting costs arise during the initial phase when users negotiate the new rules and when these costs are high users are less likely to agree on pumping controls ayres et al 2018 the public good nature of the collective action efforts and the existence of significant differences in the perceived benefits and costs of the users imply that c1 is endogenous for instance users who have a large benefit from management i e a large d i may be willing to invest more time and effort in organizational efforts i e a larger c1 i to overcome non contributors and provide the management system in the short term irrigators must learn and adopt new strategies to use less water for production c2 the cost of managing these new operating conditions might differ across irrigators given different production costs and farm characteristics the costs of monitoring and maintaining the new rules c3 is fairly low in our setting because governance structures are already in place to monitor and enforce the new rules all irrigation water rights in these regions are required to have meters and report their water use to the state annually 5 main lessons to organize our discussion of results from evaluating these four case studies we highlight five main lessons each lesson is supported by either quantitative or qualitative analysis with the available data lesson 1 the four management plans generally follow ostrom s design principles for collective action but there are some weaknesses in the design for a complex system design principle 1 clearly defined boundaries clearly defined boundaries should state who can access the resource and which users are subject to the rules of the management plan the kansas water appropriation act requires groundwater users to obtain a right to extract water so that the users of the resource system are clear both the lema and wca plans establish clear geographic boundaries which help users to understand which water rights are subject to the management plan and what their allocations would be under the plan while the boundaries of the management plans are clear they are not without controversy the boundary proposed for a lema in the sw area was defined by aquifer conditions and natural hydrologic boundaries however 55 of the survey respondents indicated that they did not agree with the proposed lema boundary most of those who did not agree with the boundary wrote comments that the entire gmd should be included instead of only the small region in the nw area the proposed district wide lema has definite boundaries for the allocations defined by townships within the district using township boundaries for the allocations was one of the most frequently discussed points during the public hearings those testifying in opposition to the plan argued that the boundaries were not hydrologic and that more analysis was required to better define the boundaries some also argued that township boundaries were too crude and smaller areas were required to sufficiently consider the difference in aquifer conditions within the gmd the sheridan 6 lema is contained within the boundary of the district wide lema in the nw region but the sheridan 6 is more restrictive than the district wide lema the boundaries of the sheridan 6 lema as well as the process by which they were defined were extensively discussed by gmd 4 kansas geological survey kgs and local stakeholders during the public hearing before the idea of a sheridan 6 lema was conceived the boundary had been defined by the gmd to define a high priority area based upon sound and well developed hydrologic data therefore water users did not have to negotiate the boundary definition by themselves in general a challenge with defining boundaries is that the aquifer does not have strict boundaries due to lateral flows of the groundwater the management plans in the nw and sw areas create situations where a user on one side of the road may have allocations that significantly reduce water use while a user across the road does not have stringent allocations even though they both have similar aquifer conditions allowing the allocations to vary in a spatially smooth manner could help alleviate these concerns but a disadvantage is that a spatially smooth algorithm is not likely to be as transparent there is a tradeoff in using hydrologic versus political boundaries on the one hand defining boundaries based on hydrology e g a boundary of an aquifer implies that changes in water use within the management area have minimal hydrologic impact outside of the area so that there are small externalities but the hydrologic boundary may not align well with how people interact with each other an advantage of defining boundaries based on political boundaries e g a county is that there are other governance and social systems already operating that can be utilized to coordinate water users a disadvantage of using political boundaries is that aquifers do not follow political boundaries so there will by hydrologic externalities design principle 2 congruence the second design principle implies that the benefits should be proportional to the costs imposed by the rules across users and the rules should be based on local conditions ostrom 2002 in other words the rules should be viewed as fair the lema proposal in the sw area states that water right owners will be provided a 5 year allocation the steering committee set a goal of reducing water use by 11 and defined three alternative allocation options 1 limit water allocation to 85 of recent historical average annual water use 2006 2015 2 limit water allocation to the minimum of 90 of recent historical average annual water use 2006 2015 or 58 of the water right annual authorized quantity or 3 limit all water allocations to 50 of their water right annual authorized quantity table 1 shows the survey results where water users were asked to rank their preferences of the allocation options of the 30 usable responses to the question we can observe that defining allocations based solely on authorized quantity was the least popular 10 but there is pretty even split between the other two options some written comments on the survey stated that they did not like reductions based on historical use because the options supported the wrong attitude of use it or lose it moreover we could not find a clear correlation between the most preferred option and the higher allocation roughly 34 of users in the sw area stated that they preferred an alternative method to the three listed most of the comments among these respondents can be summarized as follows use a different set of years to determine historical use use a smaller percent reduction in water use from authorized quantity or use a uniform allocation across all water rights one thing that is clear from the survey is that there is no broad agreement about how to define allocations the district wide lema in the nw area defined allocations based on a township s average rate of depletion and net irrigation requirement for corn 4 4 a map of the allocations per authorized acre can be accessed at http gmd4 org the allocation for each township differs by precipitation regions with less precipitation receive larger allocations and by the rate of aquifer depletion regions with slower rates of depletion receive larger allocations however the allocations were questioned during the second public hearing and also by those irrigators who are filing a lawsuit against the lema they mostly argue that the implementation of the lema ignores prior appropriations doctrine and could constitute a takings of a property right some testimonies also argued that the allocations should be even more localized to the section level 1 mile 1 mile rather than township level 6 miles 6 miles one sign of a lack of congruence would be if those users that filed the lawsuit were the ones facing the most stringent allocations this does not seem to be the case table 2 shows that only 9 of the water rights that filed the lawsuit have an allocation that is more 10 of a decrease from their historical water use a similar proportion among those that did not file the lawsuit somewhat surprisingly 82 of the water rights have an allocation greater than historical water use among those that filed the lawsuit in the sheridan 6 lema case all water rights were provided with 55 in per authorized acre for the five year lema period authorized acres were defined as the maximum number of acres irrigated in a single year between 2007 and 2010 irrigators could use their 55 acre inch allocation with flexibility as needed using more water in dry years while saving water in wet years when full irrigation is not needed they could also seek temporary transfers of allocations between water rights within the sheridan 6 boundary an advantage of the sheridan 6 lema is that the region is relatively small so all users face roughly the same hydrologic soil and climatic conditions the similarity of conditions within the region was conducive for a simple uniform allocation of 55 in per authorized acre the allocations in the wc area define an allocation for each well over a seven year period that is based on a percent reduction from use for the period 2009 2015 those that enrolled in the wca committed to reduce water use by roughly 30 an advantage of this method is that everyone is required to reduce their water use by the same percent which some view as fair another reason for people to promote a reduction based on historical use is that it implicitly accounts for differences in aquifer conditions that affect well capacities i e the rate at which water can be extracted if every user is extracting the maximum possible based on their well capacity then reductions from historical use simply reflect differing aquifer conditions however concerns are also raised that reductions from historical use penalize voluntary water conservation in the past and promote a mindset of use it or lose it design principle 3 collective choice arrangements the third design principle refers to the relationship between the governing system and users in particular users should be able to participate in making and modifying the rules the involvement of water users in the process of making policies or management plans is essential to the overall acceptance of the policy s implementation and results guerrero et al 2008 shalsi et al 2019 d agostino et al moreover users face lower transaction costs when they have a significant level of autonomy to create and modify institutional arrangements and to enforce the rules ostrom 2009 the sw area has conducted informational public meetings to share information about the proposed lema and they also post information on a website 5 5 https kfl2017 weebly com meetings html the survey carried out in the sw area that we use in this paper was another tool to collect irrigators opinions on potential solutions to the declining aquifer in the nw area two rounds of informational meetings were held before the board of directors officially submitted the district wide lema proposal to the state as part of the legal process of approving the lema two public hearings were held 6 6 the objective of the initial hearing is to determine that three necessary conditions hold there exists a need for water conservation the public interest requires corrective controls provisions and the geographic boundaries are reasonable the second hearing addresses the corrective controls the chief engineer makes a decision whether to approve the lema proposal after the hearings or could return the plan to the gmd to incorporate recommended revisions from the testimonies of the second public hearing in the nw area some irrigators expressed that they did not have a sufficient level of involvement in the creation of the lema proposal they argued that the board of directors did not represent water right owners thoughts and that the board made little effort to involve water users in the process some water users stated that they were not aware of the specific details contained in the plan because of the incomplete information and poor quality of the public informational meetings the process for the district wide lema in the nw area is in contrast to the sheridan 6 lema for the sheridan 6 lema we find a record of 13 meetings beginning in november 2008 where all water users in the area could participate and help influence the final plan a formal lema proposal was not submitted until july 16 2012 in the wc area irrigators voluntary decide to participate in the management plan the wca rules were formed by a sub group of local water users however it is unclear to us how much input from the broader users was sought and whether or not the proposal was modified as a result of such input design principle 4 monitoring successful collective management requires regular monitoring of resource conditions and user behavior there already exists a robust set of monitoring wells throughout the region to monitor aquifer conditions in all four cases monitoring of water use is already occurring under the current legal framework because users are required to annually report their water use to kda to ensure that they did not exceed the authorized pumping in all four areas users are required to have meters to give an accurate accounting of water extracted and all management plans rely on metered water use to monitor allocations design principle 5 graduated sanctions the fifth design principle is that sanctions or penalties should depend on the seriousness of the violation we see a stark contrast in the penalty structure of the wca in the wc area to the district wide lema and sheridan 6 lema in the nw area table 3 the sanctions in the wc area follow the design principle as the penalty increases according to the severity of the violation intuitively the penalty is calculated per acre foot exceeding the allocation all monetary penalties are remitted to the wca board of directors which could use those funds only for water conservation and community improvements it is the board of directors who notify a wca participant of any alleged violation in the wca in contrast the penalty matrix for the nw lema and sheridan 6 lema is less graduated and less intuitive in the wca suspension of the water right only occurs after the third violation in the nw lema and sheridan 6 lema a suspension occurs on the first violation if the violation is greater than 4 acre feet to put this into perspective average historical pumping in this region is 157 acre feet so 4 acre feet is a relatively small violation setting the penalty in dollars per day of violation is also much less intuitive than a simple dollars per acre foot penalty the penalty of 1000 per day of violation is derived from the maximum penalty under the kansas water appropriation act it also seems that the penalties under the lema are paid to kda and may not be used for water conservation efforts in the nw area design principle 6 conflict resolution mechanisms conflicts and disagreement about how to interpret a set of rules to manage a common pool resource arise easily cox et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to establish a mechanism to resolve conflicts the district wide nw lema and sd 6 lema provide an appeals process regarding eligible acres and the water allocation in the case of the wca in the wc area there were three options for a farmer to determine historical use first they could simply use the seven year historical average second they could exclude years with zero from the calculation third they could conduct a flow test to determine the rate at which water can be extracted times 135 days the three options provided some flexibility in determining the allocated quantity rather than only a single rule design principle 7 minimal recognition of rights to organize design principle 7 states that external government agencies do not challenge the right of local resource users to create and organize their own institutions the lema and wca statutes passed by the state of kansas were critical in providing the legal support to organize and develop recognized plans these statutes were also critical for initiating collective action efforts in kansas and serve as a model for other states design principle 8 nested enterprises design principle 8 applies when common pool resources are components of a larger system in kansas the lateral flow of groundwater is relatively slow so aquifer depletion is a localized problem however the region is all connected as a part of the high plains aquifer nested enterprises allow small groups of users to have influence on rules within their region but these small groups are nested within larger organizations the sheridan 6 lema wc wca and sw lema are all composed of a relatively small group of users with similar resource concerns that are organized within a larger gmd that are under the dwr kda the exception to a nested enterprise is the nw district wide lema where the rules were established by the gmd board of directors without the formation of small groups to influence rules within their respective regions of the gmd importantly the gmds were established within the larger legal system of prior appropriations therefore a lema or wca cannot increase the water right allocations of any water right and priority can still be exercised if a lema provides allocations greater than a water right s annual authorized quantity then the authorized quantity is binding rather than the allocation senior water right users are also still legally entitled to the ability to file an impairment complaint against neighboring junior water rights under the priority system lesson 2 a majority of farmers agree that action is needed to reduce the rate of aquifer depletion but management plans have not substantially reduced water use with the exception of the sheridan 6 lema as table 4 shows most irrigators believe that groundwater should be conserved through some type of management plan based on the survey results in the sw area we can observe that 88 of water users and 92 of water rights support the lema or would participate in a wca but no action has been taken yet a particular challenge is that only 53 of water users and 33 of water rights supported the lema making it difficult to justify moving forward with the lema no large wca has occurred in the region even though 69 of water users and 81 of water rights said they would participate in a wca this is perhaps because of the free rider problem of voluntary agreements and the survey had little consequentiality in terms of participating in a wca that could have created hypothetical bias so although many users in the region support management to reduce water use no reduction has been achieved in the sw area since the lema has not been implemented table 5 in nw the district wide lema was implemented in 2018 but some of the irrigators filed a lawsuit against it at least 5 of water users and 7 of the water rights in gmd 4 oppose the proposed district wide lema since they filed the lawsuit admittedly we do not have a great measure of how many water users supported the district wide lema but at least relatively few were willing to join the lawsuit gmd 4 implemented its district wide lema but we find that the allocations only reduce water use by 2 2 compared to historical water use 2009 2015 in the district table 5 in contrast drysdale and hendricks 2018 find that the sheridan 6 lema decreased water use by 26 table 5 as we already mentioned a district wide lema in west central kansas was proposed in 2014 by the gmd 1 the lema proposal failed because users in most of the counties voted against the lema however in wc a majority of water users 62 supported a lema based on the votes even though a majority of water users in wc supported a management plan little conservation has occurred so far table 5 the low reduction in water use is because the participation in the voluntary wca only includes 9 of the water users and 7 of the water rights lesson 3 management plans that allow for voluntary participation have not received more support than those that require mandatory participation according to our results in table 4 more water users prefer a lema 53 than a wca 35 in the sw area and as stated previously the willingness to participate in a wca may be overstated in the survey given the evidence from revealed preferences that a large wca does not exist in the region today the preference for mandatory can be seen more clearly in wichita county where 62 of water users voted for a mandatory plan lema but only about 9 of users enrolled in a voluntary plan wca the failure of the wca in wc to get sufficient enrollment has led to current discussions about forming a lema in wc not the entire gmd for a five year period 2021 2025 7 7 see http www gmd1 org lema html for more details lesson 4 there is no clear evidence that heterogeneous benefits from management explain support within a management area table 6 shows how aquifer conditions differ between those water users that support or oppose management plans within each management area hydraulic conductivity is a measure of the rate of lateral flows of the aquifer areas with larger hydraulic conductivity are expected to have larger benefits from management we find the expected sign in wc that is statistically significant but the opposite signs in the sw and nw where nw is also statistically significant there are no significant differences in the rate of aquifer depletion i e the change in saturated thickness or current saturated thickness we would expect benefits from management increase with well density only in the wc area we observe that density of wells is significantly larger among those that support therefore we find no systematic differences in aquifer attributes based on whether irrigators support management while aquifer conditions within the management area are not related with support it could be that these management areas are forming in areas where the gains from management are largest in general for example saturated thickness levels in nw fall within the range of depletion estimated by foster et al 2017 where farmers obtain higher benefits from water conservation efforts table 7 shows how the characteristics of the irrigators differ between those who support and those who oppose the management efforts in each area the first row of each panel shows the average water right number of each group where a smaller water right number indicates a more senior water right we hypothesize that more senior water right holders are more likely to oppose the management plan because they can protect their right based on seniority and none of the management plans differentiate allocations by seniority however the results do not support this hypothesis since the difference is not statistically significant for any area and those opposed are more junior on average for the sw and nw areas the second row of each panel shows the intensity of irrigation i e the amount of water applied per acre in the sw and nw areas the difference is the opposite of expected users who apply more water are more likely to support management but the differences are not statistically significant in the wc area those that enrolled in the wca historically used significantly more water than those that did not enroll this makes sense in the wc area because the allocations in the wca are defined as a percent reduction from historical use so larger water users received a larger allocation the third row in each panel shows total acres irrigated for the water user i e a measure of irrigated farm size those that filed the lawsuit in the nw area manage significantly more irrigated acres but we get the opposite result for sw and wc areas when we analyze the sw region we find that farmers who oppose the lema are on average larger than those who support it farmers who oppose the lema manage on average 937 irrigated acres while those who support it manage on average 501 irrigated acres however farmers who oppose the wca are smaller than those who support it they manage on average 453 and 1276 irrigated acres respectively therefore we can observe that either in sw and wc areas farmers who support management plans that require voluntary participation wca are on average larger in terms of irrigated acres than those who oppose them lesson 5 groundwater users generally perceive that they have an acceptable level of information it is important to have information available at a low cost about the aquifer and the consequences of any proposed management plan when users do not share a common understanding of the resource system it could be difficult to agree on a collective management plan the expected costs of collective action are lower when users have a common understanding of the resource s characteristics and how their actions affect each other ostrom 2009 the survey in the sw area asked if users have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the local aquifer conditions and their own groundwater use to make an informed response to the lema proposal of the 43 usable responses to the question 72 said they have sufficient knowledge examining the written comments following this question did not indicate any common concerns about a lack of information about the resource gmd 4 in the nw area conducted two informational meetings in each county before the board of directors approved a formal lema plan to inform users about the proposal these meetings allow users to discuss the plan and exchange information as part of the development process public informational meetings were also held before the wca in the wc area began and the governance of the wca requires annual meetings of the membership to update their water management policies these public meetings provide an opportunity for users to develop a common understanding 6 discussion and conclusions lesson 1 analyzes how well collective action efforts in a developed country context align with ostrom s design principles we find that the management plans are in general consistent with the design principles but there are important areas where the management plans could be improved the boundaries of management areas could have a better hydrologic rationale that is understood by water users allocations could have smoother differentiation at boundaries to avoid equity and hydrologic externality concerns the method of assigning allocations is especially controversial and deserves substantial discussion among users to determine a method that is deemed fair by a majority of users a suggestion is that gmds could conduct surveys to better understand the method of assigning allocations that is preferred by most users public meetings are useful but the discussion is often dominated by a few individuals and may not reflect the majority view transaction costs associated with finding agreement on the rules might explain why many regions have struggled to effectively adopt restrictions to manage the aquifer a small group i e the board of directors using feedback from a survey to construct a management plan could reduce these transaction costs yet allow users to feel like they had input lesson 2 shows that even though a majority of farmers agree that action is needed to reduce groundwater use minimal reductions have been achieved so far only the sheridan 6 lema achieved a large reduction in water use the nw district wide lema implemented a plan that results in little reduction in use perhaps to avoid opposition to a more stringent plan the sw area achieve no reduction in use because they could not get sufficient support to implement the lema and the wca in wc achieved little reduction in use because few water rights enrolled the smaller scale of the sheridan 6 lema compared with the other plans might facilitate agreement by users on boundaries allocation rules monitoring and enforcement as the management area becomes larger in scale it is less likely that groundwater users effectively communicate coordinate and interact to develop a plan to manage the aquifer therefore we suggest management plans may be more effective if they use separate plans within a district based on the localized input of users we also observed that users need significant involvement in the formation process of a management plan a practical suggestion is to elicit feedback from as many users as possible this can slow the time to implement a plan and require substantial effort by leadership but increase support for the management plan among users it will also be important to study the changes in profitability in areas that have implemented more stringent restrictions reducing uncertainty about the change in net benefits from reduced water use could increase support for management plans specific information about how the management plan is likely to impact aquifer levels could also increase support from lesson 3 we learn that management plans that allow for voluntary participation have not received more support than those that require mandatory compliance a barrier to getting sufficient voluntary participation in a wca is the well known free rider problem farmers decide to not participate in the wca to obtain benefits from the collective efforts of others without contributing to the costs mandatory compliance is necessary to address the free rider problem it is especially interesting to note that after the lack of enrollment in the wc wca users in the same region have pursued a mandatory lema that is in the process of approval at the time of this writing if approved the wc lema is expected to decrease water use by roughly 25 this lesson suggests that purely voluntary collective action efforts are not sufficient in a developed country context so local governance is required to make significant improvements in resource conditions lesson 4 states that there is no clear evidence that heterogeneous benefits from management explain support within a management area support for management differed across users within the same system and we could not find a clear set of characteristics of those users who support or oppose each plan unobserved factors like ideological differences are likely to explain why some users support the management plans and other do not therefore policymakers cannot look only at differences in biophysical characteristics as explaining differences in support but also need to understand the underlying ideological differences of users and if seeking to garner larger support they need to try to appeal to some of these different ideological preferences an important area for future research is to measure some of these differences in demographics and ideology finally lesson 5 indicates that groundwater users generally perceive that they have an acceptable level of information this result does not mean that users have enough information it only states that users perceive they have enough information we cannot generalize this result beyond kansas as different hydrologic systems have different levels of complexity additionally we are not able to test if the users engage in collective action because they truly have a firm understanding of the aquifer conditions or if they are biased in their level of understanding and ability to make projections in the future while users perceive they have enough information there are still likely benefits from reducing uncertainty about the economic and hydrologic impacts of reduced water use this work analyzes collective action efforts in kansas using a general framework from elinor ostrom s pioneering work our results provide valuable insights for policymakers in developed country contexts we find that the complexity of the physical and social systems make it difficult to achieve successful collective action however there has been success in kansas for efforts that are small scale mandatory and involve local users in the formation process

10207,this study evaluates four groundwater management plans to increase the understanding of how local governance and collective action can be effectively implemented to manage irrigation withdrawals in kansas the results of our analysis demonstrate five key lessons that highlight the challenges of collective action efforts to manage common pool resources in a developed country setting first the four management plans generally follow ostrom s design principles for collective action however there are important areas particularly boundaries and allocations definition where the management plans could be improved to better align with ostrom s design principles second a majority of farmers agree that action is needed to reduce the rate of aquifer depletion but management plans have not substantially reduced water use third management plans that allow for voluntary participation have not received more support than those that require mandatory compliance perhaps due to the classic free rider problem fourth there is no clear evidence that heterogeneous benefits from management explain support within a management area fifth groundwater users generally perceive that they have an acceptable level of information our analysis highlights the significant challenges facing successful collective action efforts to manage water in the usa and that the efforts are most likely to be successful when they are small scale mandatory and involve users in the formation process keywords ogallala aquifer collective action local governance irrigation aquifer depletion 1 introduction the high plains aquifer hpa in the central united states also known as ogallala aquifer is one of the largest aquifers in the world the aquifer underlies portions of eight states from south dakota to texas this area is one of the primary agricultural regions in the country where land use is dominated by irrigated agriculture however extraction of groundwater at rates that exceed natural recharge has led to persistent aquifer depletion particularly in the central and southern portions of the hpa e g scanlon et al 2012 steward and allen 2016 mcguire 2017 this unsustainable path of groundwater extraction is especially true in western kansas where the agricultural economy critically depends on the ogallala aquifer steward and allen 2016 project that by 2060 under a business as usual scenario only 18 of the original aquifer saturated thickness will remain in west central kansas and 27 in southwest kansas the impact of reductions in water use on future aquifer level has some uncertainty steward et al 2013 estimate that reducing water use by about 80 is needed to sustain the aquifer while butler et al 2016 2018 estimate that a reduction of only 21 33 would sustain the aquifer in western kansas local governance institutions that collectively manage the aquifer have been developed in kansas as a potential solution to promote water conservation for example drysdale and hendricks 2018 find that farmers in sheridan county in northwest kansas substantially reduced groundwater extraction by forming a local enhanced management area lema to impose a restriction on themselves drysdale and hendricks 2018 note that this lema had the broad support of the local irrigators based on records from meeting minutes in this paper we study the design and support for four different local management efforts in kansas including the sheridan county lema the conventional theory of the commons states that even though users would benefit from collectively managing the aquifer each user has an incentive to not participate in collective management managing a common pool groundwater resource is particularly difficult because it is not observable and it is hard to understand its boundaries meinzen dick 2018 however there exists significant empirical evidence showing that users might cooperate to design implement and monitor rules for the appropriate use of the resource and to avoid the tragedy of the commons ostrom 2002 in this context ostrom 1990 proposed eight design principles that facilitate collective action the empirical studies of these principles are challenging due to the complexity of the common pool resources and data scarcity to perform statistical analysis smith 2016 instead most studies use qualitative analysis of case studies to evaluate the design principles e g cox et al 2010 baggio et al 2016 another related perspective is that collective action and management rules regarding common pool resources emerge when their social benefits exceed their social costs and transaction costs demsetz 1967 coase 1960 recognized that transaction costs to adopt new institutional rules could be high and that they could affect users willingness to participate in collective action more recently ayres et al 2018 find that transaction costs associated with defining and enforcing property rights limit agreement on groundwater rights or management plans even in critically overdrafted basins cody et al 2015 show how reduced transaction costs enable irrigators in san luis valley of colorado to create a groundwater subdistrict to collectively reduce groundwater use the objective of our study is to increase the understanding of how local governance and collective action can be effectively implemented to manage irrigation withdrawals in a developed country context we need to better understand under what conditions irrigators support groundwater management plans and how current governance could be modified to facilitate collective action to manage the aquifer we consider collective action and local governance concepts in a complex setting where groundwater users government agencies and other stakeholders interact to obtain common objectives it is typical that self governed systems where resource users are actively involved in designing collective management plans also include rules made by local regional national or international authorities ostrom 2002 smith et al 2017 and shalsi et al 2019 show how irrigators working together with government agencies improved groundwater management and resource conditions to accomplish our objective we evaluate four collective management plans that are either proposed or recently implemented in southwest sw northwest nw and in wichita county wc of kansas this evaluation is based on the eight design principles proposed by ostrom 1990 we also analyze key variables such as aquifer conditions or user heterogeneity that affect groundwater users willingness to support collaborative local management our study provides insights to the scientific community water managers and policymakers about the prospects for users to successfully manage common pool resources in a developed country 2 policy background for the study region the state of kansas adopted the prior appropriation doctrine in 1945 which embodies the concept of first in time first in right prior appropriation requires groundwater appropriators to obtain a permit from the state engineer to extract water the permit authorizes the annual amount of water that can be extracted and the place of use the date that the permit is authorized defines the priority of the right with older rights having seniority this system of priority is relevant under water scarcity conditions if pumping by a junior water right holder impairs the ability of a senior water right holder to exercise its right then the junior can be required to reduce withdrawals the system of priority has had a minimal impact on avoiding overlapping wells that lead to a significant drawdown in many areas edwards 2016 given the inability of the state to control the depletion problem five groundwater management districts gmds were established in 1972 they have authority from the division of water resources kansas department of agriculture dwr kda to act on the behalf of local water users the board of directors is elected local stakeholders with an interest in promoting regional economic welfare the gmds have developed management programs to improve the management of groundwater such as well spacing requirements and closing the district to further drilling but the gmds had never restricted water use on existing wells before 2013 in 2012 the kansas legislature authorized local enhanced management areas lemas the lema is a tool that gives the board of directors of gmds the authority to implement corrective measures for water conservation for a particular region a lema must include clear geographic boundaries corrective measures e g limits on the amount of water pumped compliance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms a lema may also allow other types of measures that provide flexibility in water use such as allowing trading of water right within the lema the plan requires the approval of the gmd board of directors and the state s chief engineer the approval process includes public hearings the lema requires mandatory compliance of irrigators within the management area even if the irrigator was not supportive of the lema kda monitors and enforces the lema water conservation areas wcas were authorized by the kansas legislature in 2015 a wca allows a water right owner or group of owners the opportunity to develop a management plan to reduce total withdrawals while allowing additional flexibility in the use of water the wca requires purely voluntary participation of irrigators and does not require approval by the gmd board but must be approved by the chief engineer wcas may implement water restrictions among participants that are enforced by the state but any water users can choose to be excluded from the wca in this paper we evaluate four cases of local governance and collective action efforts shown in fig 1 that are in various stages of development in the southwest sw region local water rights owners in northern finney and kearny counties considered different ways to reduce the rate of decline in the aquifer a steering committee was formed to propose options for a proposed lema a survey was conducted by the kda in 2017 to better understand irrigators views towards a potential lema versus purely voluntary reductions in water use the survey results were unfavorable towards a lema and no lema proposal in the area has moved towards implementation the second management effort that we evaluate is the district wide lema in northwest nw kansas that began in 2018 1 1 https agriculture ks gov divisions programs dwr managing kansas water resources local enhanced management areas gmd4 district wide lema this district wide lema sets a 5 year allocation for pumping where the allocation is defined for each township approximately 6 miles 6 miles in the district the lema was ultimately approved and implemented in 2018 but was not without controversy in june 2018 a group of water right owners petitioned for judicial review of the lema in district court to challenge the lema orders and the validity of its statutory provisions the district court upheld the lema order in october 2019 but the decision may be appealed the third management area is the sheridan 6 lema contained within the boundary of the district wide lema in the nw region in a portion of sheridan and thomas counties the sheridan 6 lema s first allocation period was 2013 2017 and a new allocation was approved for the 2018 2022 period 2 2 https agriculture ks gov divisions programs dwr managing kansas water resources local enhanced management areas sheridan county 6 lema the allocation in the sheridan 6 lema is more stringent than the district wide lema but only the more stringent allocation is relevant to farmers minutes from meetings of the sheridan 6 lema indicate broad support for the plan but we have no data on which individuals might not support the plan therefore we only discuss this collective action effort when we evaluate the ostrom s design principles the impacts of the sheridan 6 lema on producer irrigation decisions have been examined in detail by drysdale and hendricks 2018 and deines et al 2019 the fourth management area that we consider is the wc wca 3 3 https agriculture ks gov divisions programs dwr managing kansas water resources wca some water rights owners in wc voluntarily joined together to create a plan to reduce water use with a collective desire to sustain their community by conserving groundwater resources a small group worked together to create the plan and then recruited water users in the county to voluntarily join the effort wc is in a portion of the aquifer that is highly depleted with little saturated thickness remaining fig 1 one management effort that we do not analyze in detail given that we do not have a measure of support is the 2014 proposed district wide gmd 1 lema in west central kansas the proposal was for a six year allocation where the allocations were defined as 20 reduction from historical use the board of directors decided to put the gmd 1 lema up for a vote by water right owners even though the legislation does not require a vote of water users the lema proposal did not receive a majority of votes and was not implemented we know the vote count in each county but not the vote of each water user wc is within gmd 1 and the wca was proposed after the failure of the gmd 1 lema 3 data in each case study we have a measure of support for the management plan across different users except for sheridan 6 lema in the sw area we have results from a survey conducted by kda in 2017 to elicit feedback about a potential lema the cover letter was signed by the manager of the gmd and it was stated the results of the survey would be shared with the local steering committee and the gmd board of directors therefore while the survey is a stated preference survey it has strong consequentiality so that users have an incentive to respond honestly vossler et al 2012 the survey was mailed to all water users within the proposed lema boundary there were 70 survey responses returned from 465 water users for a response rate of about 15 in the nw area we do not have information on which users supported the district wide lema but we do have information on some users who actively opposed the lema in particular we collect the names of the individuals or entities that filed a lawsuit to challenge the legality of the district wide lema we also obtained data on the allocations of each water right under the lema from kda a limitation of these data is that there are likely individuals that opposed the lema but did not participate in the lawsuit however it is still insightful to examine if the characteristics of those filing the lawsuit differed systematically from the rest of the water users in the wc area we collected the names and water right numbers that voluntarily enrolled in the wca from the wca agreements that were posted online these data are unique because they represent revealed preferences on willingness to participate in a voluntary management plan for all three of these datasets water right numbers are available which allow us to match them with data from the water information management and analysis system wimas the wimas data contain information for each water right on attributes of the water right e g priority date historical use and location in kansas all water rights are required to report their water use we also merge hydrologic data obtained from kansas geological survey to the wimas data at the section level as defined by the public land survey system plss we also supplement the data above with qualitative data we reviewed groundwater users testimonies from public meetings held in the process of approving the district wide lema in gmd 4 we also reviewed the documents that define the management plans and meeting minutes for the district wide lema sheridan 6 lema and wc wca since there are formal documents to define the rules in these areas 4 methods and analytical framework we evaluate the four cases following the eight design principles for long term institutions for collective action proposed by ostrom 1990 we also identify factors that affect the irrigators willingness to participate in collective action to effectively manage the aquifer the key issue is to understand how resource and user attributes affect the perceived benefits and costs following ostrom 2002 we observe that each groundwater user i compares the net benefits under the old rules bo with the expected benefits under the new rules bn d i b n i b o i where d i is the user s incentive to support the new rules if d i 0 for some users then they consider three costs initial costs of time and effort spent organizing and agreeing under the new rules c1 short term costs of operating in the new conditions c2 and long term costs of monitoring and maintaining new rules c3 hence user i will invest time and effort to implement new institutions if the incentive to change exceeds the sum of the expected costs d i c 1 i c 2 i c 3 i in our setting irrigators are extracting groundwater from a shared aquifer expected benefits under the old rules bo reflect the stream of profits under the existing prior appropriations doctrine expected benefits under the new rules bn of reduced allocations could be larger than under the old rules if the allocations correct the spatial externality of pumping on neighboring wells under the new rules the farmer could sacrifice some profits in the short run for greater profits in the long run the difference in expected benefits d i could differ across groundwater users due to aquifer and soil conditions for example areas with greater hydraulic conductivity and lower recharge have greater expected benefits from management edwards 2016 areas with too large of a saturated thickness may also have smaller gains from management because the negative impacts of excess depletion are not imminent and areas with too small of a saturated thickness may also have smaller gains from management because there is little aquifer to preserve foster et al 2017 differences in expected benefits could also differ across users due to different preferences for example users may also differ in how they discount future benefits some users may value preserving the lifestyle of farming for future generations more than others costs of management are also likely to differ across users users likely differ in their willingness to organize or attend meetings where the new rules are discussed i e c1 differs across users contracting costs arise during the initial phase when users negotiate the new rules and when these costs are high users are less likely to agree on pumping controls ayres et al 2018 the public good nature of the collective action efforts and the existence of significant differences in the perceived benefits and costs of the users imply that c1 is endogenous for instance users who have a large benefit from management i e a large d i may be willing to invest more time and effort in organizational efforts i e a larger c1 i to overcome non contributors and provide the management system in the short term irrigators must learn and adopt new strategies to use less water for production c2 the cost of managing these new operating conditions might differ across irrigators given different production costs and farm characteristics the costs of monitoring and maintaining the new rules c3 is fairly low in our setting because governance structures are already in place to monitor and enforce the new rules all irrigation water rights in these regions are required to have meters and report their water use to the state annually 5 main lessons to organize our discussion of results from evaluating these four case studies we highlight five main lessons each lesson is supported by either quantitative or qualitative analysis with the available data lesson 1 the four management plans generally follow ostrom s design principles for collective action but there are some weaknesses in the design for a complex system design principle 1 clearly defined boundaries clearly defined boundaries should state who can access the resource and which users are subject to the rules of the management plan the kansas water appropriation act requires groundwater users to obtain a right to extract water so that the users of the resource system are clear both the lema and wca plans establish clear geographic boundaries which help users to understand which water rights are subject to the management plan and what their allocations would be under the plan while the boundaries of the management plans are clear they are not without controversy the boundary proposed for a lema in the sw area was defined by aquifer conditions and natural hydrologic boundaries however 55 of the survey respondents indicated that they did not agree with the proposed lema boundary most of those who did not agree with the boundary wrote comments that the entire gmd should be included instead of only the small region in the nw area the proposed district wide lema has definite boundaries for the allocations defined by townships within the district using township boundaries for the allocations was one of the most frequently discussed points during the public hearings those testifying in opposition to the plan argued that the boundaries were not hydrologic and that more analysis was required to better define the boundaries some also argued that township boundaries were too crude and smaller areas were required to sufficiently consider the difference in aquifer conditions within the gmd the sheridan 6 lema is contained within the boundary of the district wide lema in the nw region but the sheridan 6 is more restrictive than the district wide lema the boundaries of the sheridan 6 lema as well as the process by which they were defined were extensively discussed by gmd 4 kansas geological survey kgs and local stakeholders during the public hearing before the idea of a sheridan 6 lema was conceived the boundary had been defined by the gmd to define a high priority area based upon sound and well developed hydrologic data therefore water users did not have to negotiate the boundary definition by themselves in general a challenge with defining boundaries is that the aquifer does not have strict boundaries due to lateral flows of the groundwater the management plans in the nw and sw areas create situations where a user on one side of the road may have allocations that significantly reduce water use while a user across the road does not have stringent allocations even though they both have similar aquifer conditions allowing the allocations to vary in a spatially smooth manner could help alleviate these concerns but a disadvantage is that a spatially smooth algorithm is not likely to be as transparent there is a tradeoff in using hydrologic versus political boundaries on the one hand defining boundaries based on hydrology e g a boundary of an aquifer implies that changes in water use within the management area have minimal hydrologic impact outside of the area so that there are small externalities but the hydrologic boundary may not align well with how people interact with each other an advantage of defining boundaries based on political boundaries e g a county is that there are other governance and social systems already operating that can be utilized to coordinate water users a disadvantage of using political boundaries is that aquifers do not follow political boundaries so there will by hydrologic externalities design principle 2 congruence the second design principle implies that the benefits should be proportional to the costs imposed by the rules across users and the rules should be based on local conditions ostrom 2002 in other words the rules should be viewed as fair the lema proposal in the sw area states that water right owners will be provided a 5 year allocation the steering committee set a goal of reducing water use by 11 and defined three alternative allocation options 1 limit water allocation to 85 of recent historical average annual water use 2006 2015 2 limit water allocation to the minimum of 90 of recent historical average annual water use 2006 2015 or 58 of the water right annual authorized quantity or 3 limit all water allocations to 50 of their water right annual authorized quantity table 1 shows the survey results where water users were asked to rank their preferences of the allocation options of the 30 usable responses to the question we can observe that defining allocations based solely on authorized quantity was the least popular 10 but there is pretty even split between the other two options some written comments on the survey stated that they did not like reductions based on historical use because the options supported the wrong attitude of use it or lose it moreover we could not find a clear correlation between the most preferred option and the higher allocation roughly 34 of users in the sw area stated that they preferred an alternative method to the three listed most of the comments among these respondents can be summarized as follows use a different set of years to determine historical use use a smaller percent reduction in water use from authorized quantity or use a uniform allocation across all water rights one thing that is clear from the survey is that there is no broad agreement about how to define allocations the district wide lema in the nw area defined allocations based on a township s average rate of depletion and net irrigation requirement for corn 4 4 a map of the allocations per authorized acre can be accessed at http gmd4 org the allocation for each township differs by precipitation regions with less precipitation receive larger allocations and by the rate of aquifer depletion regions with slower rates of depletion receive larger allocations however the allocations were questioned during the second public hearing and also by those irrigators who are filing a lawsuit against the lema they mostly argue that the implementation of the lema ignores prior appropriations doctrine and could constitute a takings of a property right some testimonies also argued that the allocations should be even more localized to the section level 1 mile 1 mile rather than township level 6 miles 6 miles one sign of a lack of congruence would be if those users that filed the lawsuit were the ones facing the most stringent allocations this does not seem to be the case table 2 shows that only 9 of the water rights that filed the lawsuit have an allocation that is more 10 of a decrease from their historical water use a similar proportion among those that did not file the lawsuit somewhat surprisingly 82 of the water rights have an allocation greater than historical water use among those that filed the lawsuit in the sheridan 6 lema case all water rights were provided with 55 in per authorized acre for the five year lema period authorized acres were defined as the maximum number of acres irrigated in a single year between 2007 and 2010 irrigators could use their 55 acre inch allocation with flexibility as needed using more water in dry years while saving water in wet years when full irrigation is not needed they could also seek temporary transfers of allocations between water rights within the sheridan 6 boundary an advantage of the sheridan 6 lema is that the region is relatively small so all users face roughly the same hydrologic soil and climatic conditions the similarity of conditions within the region was conducive for a simple uniform allocation of 55 in per authorized acre the allocations in the wc area define an allocation for each well over a seven year period that is based on a percent reduction from use for the period 2009 2015 those that enrolled in the wca committed to reduce water use by roughly 30 an advantage of this method is that everyone is required to reduce their water use by the same percent which some view as fair another reason for people to promote a reduction based on historical use is that it implicitly accounts for differences in aquifer conditions that affect well capacities i e the rate at which water can be extracted if every user is extracting the maximum possible based on their well capacity then reductions from historical use simply reflect differing aquifer conditions however concerns are also raised that reductions from historical use penalize voluntary water conservation in the past and promote a mindset of use it or lose it design principle 3 collective choice arrangements the third design principle refers to the relationship between the governing system and users in particular users should be able to participate in making and modifying the rules the involvement of water users in the process of making policies or management plans is essential to the overall acceptance of the policy s implementation and results guerrero et al 2008 shalsi et al 2019 d agostino et al moreover users face lower transaction costs when they have a significant level of autonomy to create and modify institutional arrangements and to enforce the rules ostrom 2009 the sw area has conducted informational public meetings to share information about the proposed lema and they also post information on a website 5 5 https kfl2017 weebly com meetings html the survey carried out in the sw area that we use in this paper was another tool to collect irrigators opinions on potential solutions to the declining aquifer in the nw area two rounds of informational meetings were held before the board of directors officially submitted the district wide lema proposal to the state as part of the legal process of approving the lema two public hearings were held 6 6 the objective of the initial hearing is to determine that three necessary conditions hold there exists a need for water conservation the public interest requires corrective controls provisions and the geographic boundaries are reasonable the second hearing addresses the corrective controls the chief engineer makes a decision whether to approve the lema proposal after the hearings or could return the plan to the gmd to incorporate recommended revisions from the testimonies of the second public hearing in the nw area some irrigators expressed that they did not have a sufficient level of involvement in the creation of the lema proposal they argued that the board of directors did not represent water right owners thoughts and that the board made little effort to involve water users in the process some water users stated that they were not aware of the specific details contained in the plan because of the incomplete information and poor quality of the public informational meetings the process for the district wide lema in the nw area is in contrast to the sheridan 6 lema for the sheridan 6 lema we find a record of 13 meetings beginning in november 2008 where all water users in the area could participate and help influence the final plan a formal lema proposal was not submitted until july 16 2012 in the wc area irrigators voluntary decide to participate in the management plan the wca rules were formed by a sub group of local water users however it is unclear to us how much input from the broader users was sought and whether or not the proposal was modified as a result of such input design principle 4 monitoring successful collective management requires regular monitoring of resource conditions and user behavior there already exists a robust set of monitoring wells throughout the region to monitor aquifer conditions in all four cases monitoring of water use is already occurring under the current legal framework because users are required to annually report their water use to kda to ensure that they did not exceed the authorized pumping in all four areas users are required to have meters to give an accurate accounting of water extracted and all management plans rely on metered water use to monitor allocations design principle 5 graduated sanctions the fifth design principle is that sanctions or penalties should depend on the seriousness of the violation we see a stark contrast in the penalty structure of the wca in the wc area to the district wide lema and sheridan 6 lema in the nw area table 3 the sanctions in the wc area follow the design principle as the penalty increases according to the severity of the violation intuitively the penalty is calculated per acre foot exceeding the allocation all monetary penalties are remitted to the wca board of directors which could use those funds only for water conservation and community improvements it is the board of directors who notify a wca participant of any alleged violation in the wca in contrast the penalty matrix for the nw lema and sheridan 6 lema is less graduated and less intuitive in the wca suspension of the water right only occurs after the third violation in the nw lema and sheridan 6 lema a suspension occurs on the first violation if the violation is greater than 4 acre feet to put this into perspective average historical pumping in this region is 157 acre feet so 4 acre feet is a relatively small violation setting the penalty in dollars per day of violation is also much less intuitive than a simple dollars per acre foot penalty the penalty of 1000 per day of violation is derived from the maximum penalty under the kansas water appropriation act it also seems that the penalties under the lema are paid to kda and may not be used for water conservation efforts in the nw area design principle 6 conflict resolution mechanisms conflicts and disagreement about how to interpret a set of rules to manage a common pool resource arise easily cox et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to establish a mechanism to resolve conflicts the district wide nw lema and sd 6 lema provide an appeals process regarding eligible acres and the water allocation in the case of the wca in the wc area there were three options for a farmer to determine historical use first they could simply use the seven year historical average second they could exclude years with zero from the calculation third they could conduct a flow test to determine the rate at which water can be extracted times 135 days the three options provided some flexibility in determining the allocated quantity rather than only a single rule design principle 7 minimal recognition of rights to organize design principle 7 states that external government agencies do not challenge the right of local resource users to create and organize their own institutions the lema and wca statutes passed by the state of kansas were critical in providing the legal support to organize and develop recognized plans these statutes were also critical for initiating collective action efforts in kansas and serve as a model for other states design principle 8 nested enterprises design principle 8 applies when common pool resources are components of a larger system in kansas the lateral flow of groundwater is relatively slow so aquifer depletion is a localized problem however the region is all connected as a part of the high plains aquifer nested enterprises allow small groups of users to have influence on rules within their region but these small groups are nested within larger organizations the sheridan 6 lema wc wca and sw lema are all composed of a relatively small group of users with similar resource concerns that are organized within a larger gmd that are under the dwr kda the exception to a nested enterprise is the nw district wide lema where the rules were established by the gmd board of directors without the formation of small groups to influence rules within their respective regions of the gmd importantly the gmds were established within the larger legal system of prior appropriations therefore a lema or wca cannot increase the water right allocations of any water right and priority can still be exercised if a lema provides allocations greater than a water right s annual authorized quantity then the authorized quantity is binding rather than the allocation senior water right users are also still legally entitled to the ability to file an impairment complaint against neighboring junior water rights under the priority system lesson 2 a majority of farmers agree that action is needed to reduce the rate of aquifer depletion but management plans have not substantially reduced water use with the exception of the sheridan 6 lema as table 4 shows most irrigators believe that groundwater should be conserved through some type of management plan based on the survey results in the sw area we can observe that 88 of water users and 92 of water rights support the lema or would participate in a wca but no action has been taken yet a particular challenge is that only 53 of water users and 33 of water rights supported the lema making it difficult to justify moving forward with the lema no large wca has occurred in the region even though 69 of water users and 81 of water rights said they would participate in a wca this is perhaps because of the free rider problem of voluntary agreements and the survey had little consequentiality in terms of participating in a wca that could have created hypothetical bias so although many users in the region support management to reduce water use no reduction has been achieved in the sw area since the lema has not been implemented table 5 in nw the district wide lema was implemented in 2018 but some of the irrigators filed a lawsuit against it at least 5 of water users and 7 of the water rights in gmd 4 oppose the proposed district wide lema since they filed the lawsuit admittedly we do not have a great measure of how many water users supported the district wide lema but at least relatively few were willing to join the lawsuit gmd 4 implemented its district wide lema but we find that the allocations only reduce water use by 2 2 compared to historical water use 2009 2015 in the district table 5 in contrast drysdale and hendricks 2018 find that the sheridan 6 lema decreased water use by 26 table 5 as we already mentioned a district wide lema in west central kansas was proposed in 2014 by the gmd 1 the lema proposal failed because users in most of the counties voted against the lema however in wc a majority of water users 62 supported a lema based on the votes even though a majority of water users in wc supported a management plan little conservation has occurred so far table 5 the low reduction in water use is because the participation in the voluntary wca only includes 9 of the water users and 7 of the water rights lesson 3 management plans that allow for voluntary participation have not received more support than those that require mandatory participation according to our results in table 4 more water users prefer a lema 53 than a wca 35 in the sw area and as stated previously the willingness to participate in a wca may be overstated in the survey given the evidence from revealed preferences that a large wca does not exist in the region today the preference for mandatory can be seen more clearly in wichita county where 62 of water users voted for a mandatory plan lema but only about 9 of users enrolled in a voluntary plan wca the failure of the wca in wc to get sufficient enrollment has led to current discussions about forming a lema in wc not the entire gmd for a five year period 2021 2025 7 7 see http www gmd1 org lema html for more details lesson 4 there is no clear evidence that heterogeneous benefits from management explain support within a management area table 6 shows how aquifer conditions differ between those water users that support or oppose management plans within each management area hydraulic conductivity is a measure of the rate of lateral flows of the aquifer areas with larger hydraulic conductivity are expected to have larger benefits from management we find the expected sign in wc that is statistically significant but the opposite signs in the sw and nw where nw is also statistically significant there are no significant differences in the rate of aquifer depletion i e the change in saturated thickness or current saturated thickness we would expect benefits from management increase with well density only in the wc area we observe that density of wells is significantly larger among those that support therefore we find no systematic differences in aquifer attributes based on whether irrigators support management while aquifer conditions within the management area are not related with support it could be that these management areas are forming in areas where the gains from management are largest in general for example saturated thickness levels in nw fall within the range of depletion estimated by foster et al 2017 where farmers obtain higher benefits from water conservation efforts table 7 shows how the characteristics of the irrigators differ between those who support and those who oppose the management efforts in each area the first row of each panel shows the average water right number of each group where a smaller water right number indicates a more senior water right we hypothesize that more senior water right holders are more likely to oppose the management plan because they can protect their right based on seniority and none of the management plans differentiate allocations by seniority however the results do not support this hypothesis since the difference is not statistically significant for any area and those opposed are more junior on average for the sw and nw areas the second row of each panel shows the intensity of irrigation i e the amount of water applied per acre in the sw and nw areas the difference is the opposite of expected users who apply more water are more likely to support management but the differences are not statistically significant in the wc area those that enrolled in the wca historically used significantly more water than those that did not enroll this makes sense in the wc area because the allocations in the wca are defined as a percent reduction from historical use so larger water users received a larger allocation the third row in each panel shows total acres irrigated for the water user i e a measure of irrigated farm size those that filed the lawsuit in the nw area manage significantly more irrigated acres but we get the opposite result for sw and wc areas when we analyze the sw region we find that farmers who oppose the lema are on average larger than those who support it farmers who oppose the lema manage on average 937 irrigated acres while those who support it manage on average 501 irrigated acres however farmers who oppose the wca are smaller than those who support it they manage on average 453 and 1276 irrigated acres respectively therefore we can observe that either in sw and wc areas farmers who support management plans that require voluntary participation wca are on average larger in terms of irrigated acres than those who oppose them lesson 5 groundwater users generally perceive that they have an acceptable level of information it is important to have information available at a low cost about the aquifer and the consequences of any proposed management plan when users do not share a common understanding of the resource system it could be difficult to agree on a collective management plan the expected costs of collective action are lower when users have a common understanding of the resource s characteristics and how their actions affect each other ostrom 2009 the survey in the sw area asked if users have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the local aquifer conditions and their own groundwater use to make an informed response to the lema proposal of the 43 usable responses to the question 72 said they have sufficient knowledge examining the written comments following this question did not indicate any common concerns about a lack of information about the resource gmd 4 in the nw area conducted two informational meetings in each county before the board of directors approved a formal lema plan to inform users about the proposal these meetings allow users to discuss the plan and exchange information as part of the development process public informational meetings were also held before the wca in the wc area began and the governance of the wca requires annual meetings of the membership to update their water management policies these public meetings provide an opportunity for users to develop a common understanding 6 discussion and conclusions lesson 1 analyzes how well collective action efforts in a developed country context align with ostrom s design principles we find that the management plans are in general consistent with the design principles but there are important areas where the management plans could be improved the boundaries of management areas could have a better hydrologic rationale that is understood by water users allocations could have smoother differentiation at boundaries to avoid equity and hydrologic externality concerns the method of assigning allocations is especially controversial and deserves substantial discussion among users to determine a method that is deemed fair by a majority of users a suggestion is that gmds could conduct surveys to better understand the method of assigning allocations that is preferred by most users public meetings are useful but the discussion is often dominated by a few individuals and may not reflect the majority view transaction costs associated with finding agreement on the rules might explain why many regions have struggled to effectively adopt restrictions to manage the aquifer a small group i e the board of directors using feedback from a survey to construct a management plan could reduce these transaction costs yet allow users to feel like they had input lesson 2 shows that even though a majority of farmers agree that action is needed to reduce groundwater use minimal reductions have been achieved so far only the sheridan 6 lema achieved a large reduction in water use the nw district wide lema implemented a plan that results in little reduction in use perhaps to avoid opposition to a more stringent plan the sw area achieve no reduction in use because they could not get sufficient support to implement the lema and the wca in wc achieved little reduction in use because few water rights enrolled the smaller scale of the sheridan 6 lema compared with the other plans might facilitate agreement by users on boundaries allocation rules monitoring and enforcement as the management area becomes larger in scale it is less likely that groundwater users effectively communicate coordinate and interact to develop a plan to manage the aquifer therefore we suggest management plans may be more effective if they use separate plans within a district based on the localized input of users we also observed that users need significant involvement in the formation process of a management plan a practical suggestion is to elicit feedback from as many users as possible this can slow the time to implement a plan and require substantial effort by leadership but increase support for the management plan among users it will also be important to study the changes in profitability in areas that have implemented more stringent restrictions reducing uncertainty about the change in net benefits from reduced water use could increase support for management plans specific information about how the management plan is likely to impact aquifer levels could also increase support from lesson 3 we learn that management plans that allow for voluntary participation have not received more support than those that require mandatory compliance a barrier to getting sufficient voluntary participation in a wca is the well known free rider problem farmers decide to not participate in the wca to obtain benefits from the collective efforts of others without contributing to the costs mandatory compliance is necessary to address the free rider problem it is especially interesting to note that after the lack of enrollment in the wc wca users in the same region have pursued a mandatory lema that is in the process of approval at the time of this writing if approved the wc lema is expected to decrease water use by roughly 25 this lesson suggests that purely voluntary collective action efforts are not sufficient in a developed country context so local governance is required to make significant improvements in resource conditions lesson 4 states that there is no clear evidence that heterogeneous benefits from management explain support within a management area support for management differed across users within the same system and we could not find a clear set of characteristics of those users who support or oppose each plan unobserved factors like ideological differences are likely to explain why some users support the management plans and other do not therefore policymakers cannot look only at differences in biophysical characteristics as explaining differences in support but also need to understand the underlying ideological differences of users and if seeking to garner larger support they need to try to appeal to some of these different ideological preferences an important area for future research is to measure some of these differences in demographics and ideology finally lesson 5 indicates that groundwater users generally perceive that they have an acceptable level of information this result does not mean that users have enough information it only states that users perceive they have enough information we cannot generalize this result beyond kansas as different hydrologic systems have different levels of complexity additionally we are not able to test if the users engage in collective action because they truly have a firm understanding of the aquifer conditions or if they are biased in their level of understanding and ability to make projections in the future while users perceive they have enough information there are still likely benefits from reducing uncertainty about the economic and hydrologic impacts of reduced water use this work analyzes collective action efforts in kansas using a general framework from elinor ostrom s pioneering work our results provide valuable insights for policymakers in developed country contexts we find that the complexity of the physical and social systems make it difficult to achieve successful collective action however there has been success in kansas for efforts that are small scale mandatory and involve local users in the formation process

10208,potato growth in humid climate regions is facing increasing challenges due to short period stresses in water deficit and excess however there is a lack of quantitative information on the effects of short period of water stress on potato plant growth and its implications on potato yield and tuber quality in this study we conducted a pot experiment to test the effects of short period 2weeks of water deficit and water excess respectively applied at four different potato growth stages sprouting vegetative tuberization and bulking stage on potato vegetative development and tuber yield and quality the results show that short period of water deficit overall had negative impacts while short period of water excess had slightly positive impacts on potato vegetative development and tuber yield and quality for water deficit the most sensitive periods were the vegetative and tuberization stage whereas for water excess there were mostly no significant differences between different potato growth stages although the impact of water deficit at the sprouting stage was minor it was broad and long lasting these results confirm the benefits of supplemental irrigation and suggest the low risk of over irrigation in well drained fields they further suggest that when the availability of water for irrigation is limited using water strategically during the period when potato needs water the most can maximize the benefits of supplemental irrigation keywords drought water deficit water excess potato yield tuber quality cold humid climate 1 introduction most varieties of potato have shallower and less extended roots and therefore are more sensitive to water supply than most other crops king and stark 2003 early studies on potato agronomy recognized water supply as one of the most important factors influencing potato yield and suggested that soil moisture should never be allowed to drop below 50 of the available range of moisture singh 1969 most of the studies on potato water supply were carried out in semi arid or arid regions e g west to northwest of north america where potato cropping is impossible without irrigation marra and woods 1990 king and stark 2003 the predominant water stress in semi arid or arid regions is water deficit under water deficit conditions the first response of potato plant is leaf stomatal closure epstein and grant 1973 stegman and nelson 1973 thomas et al 1976 by closing the stomata it reduces gas exchange between leaf cells and the environment so that water loss is reduced however this has a number of negative impacts such as increasing leaf temperature reducing co2 diffusion into the leaf and thus reducing photosynthesis moorby et al 1975 campbell et al 1976 ackerson et al 1977 shekhar and iritani 1979 weisz et al 1994 water deficit also reduces water pressure in plant cells without sufficient photosynthetic products starch and sugars and water pressure plant and tuber growth are restricted whereas potato growth and yield are negatively affected by short period of water deficit at any growth stage the impacts are strongest at the tuber initiation and flowering stage de lis et al 1964 stark and mccann 1992 lynch et al 1995 this leads to the strategy of drought hardening or acclimation by introducing the plant to mild water stress at an earlier stage to enhance its tolerance to water deficit drought in later stages cavagnaro et al 1971 thomas et al 1976 banik et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 while irrigation is necessary for potato cropping in semi arid and arid regions over irrigation and unexpected rainfall may cause temporary water excess king et al 2000 excessive water can also cause damage to potatoes high soil water content reduces soil temperature and prolonged period of soil water saturation results in oxygen deficiency harken and burton 1975 holder and cary 1984 these can lead to seed piece decay and delayed emergence in early potato growth stages and root damage in later stages bushnell 1956 excessive water also increases the possibility of nutrient leaching reducing fertilizer use efficiency and leading to not only plant nutrient deficiency but also elevated nutrient concentrations in ground and surface waters waddell et al 2000 woli et al 2016 it has also been reported that excessive water can increase diseases and pest infection on potato crop e g cappaert et al 1992 tuber expansion is strongly affected by water supply so that both deficit and excessive water supply can cause tuber malformation and other tuber quality issues such as pointed ends knobs brown center and hollow heart however these defects are most likely to occur when there is high fluctuation in soil water conditions which induces disruptions of normal pace for tuber expansion and creations of uneven tissue development in tubers king and stark 2003 natural conditions in humid regions such as atlantic canada ac and northeast united states of america usa are quite different from semi arid and arid regions in ac and northeast usa precipitation is generally enough for growing potato and field crops and therefore irrigation is not required to sustain a profitable potato production system as a result this area is dominated by rainfed agriculture demerchant 1983 moreover growing season is shorter crop density is generally lower and soils are also less sandy than in the west and northwest of north america given these differences the knowledge obtained from the semi arid and arid regions is not directly transferable to the humid regions marra and woods 1990 however although precipitation in this region is overall sufficient for potato growth short periods of water deficit and excess are common in fact studies have shown that water supply is one of the major limitations for potato growth and supplemental irrigation can increase potato yield and tuber quality in ac and northeast usa milburn and gartley 1988 benoit and grant 1980 1985 bรฉlanger et al 2000 2002 there are several challenges for potato irrigation under rainfed conditions first it is supplemental irrigation so that the goal is to apply sufficient water during dry periods however day to day weather in humid region is highly variable and the risk of over irrigation due to unexpected weather events is high benoit and grant 1985 this requires quantified evaluation on the impacts of both water deficit and water excess a second challenge for irrigation in this region is the lack of a reliable water source for example the landscape in ac is hilly with long and sometimes steep slopes slope gradient typically ranges from 3 to 20 fahmy et al 2010 many fields are located in uplands that are far away from surface water sources such as rivers and lakes tapping into groundwater is not only costly but also under strict scrutiny due to environmental concerns and heavy regulations one possible solution is to take advantage of the seasonal distribution of precipitation due to the cold climate there is large amount of snow accumulated in the winter in ac and northeast usa in the spring due to snowmelt there is often too much water in the field often surface and subsurface drainage systems are constructed to drain the water out currently the drainage water is mostly discharged directly to small channels streams or rivers however on a sloping field as is typical in ac water can be stored in a retention structure at the bottom of the slope and the saved water can be used for irrigation such a combination of several beneficial management practices bmp in the landscape context is termed landscape integrated soil and water conservation liswc system li 2020 in a liswc system the amount of available water for irrigation is limited determined by the storage capacity of the retention structure and the size of its catchment area the timing for using the limited water for irrigation is critical in order to maximize the benefits of irrigation on potato growth yield and tuber quality a third challenge for supplemental irrigation for potato in ac and northeast usa is economic challenge previous economic studies suggest that supplemental irrigation although can increase yield and tuber quality is not economically viable in most areas in maine and nb due to the high cost for installing and maintaining the irrigation system marra et al 1987 whitford 1993 however the situation may be different with climate change the predicted major climate change trend in atlantic canada ac is that average temperature is likely to rise whereas the direction of change in average precipitation is uncertain lemmen and warren 2004 stocker et al 2013 rising temperature will increase evapotranspiration and potentially can result in more severe water deficit in addition for both temperature and precipitation there is a high confidence that their variabilities will increase due to climate change this means that there will be more extreme weather events such as intensive rainstorms as well as longer drying periods overall it is likely that agriculture will experience less temperature stress but more severe water stress in the future in ac therefore the economic return for water supply management is expected to increase when such increase is big enough there is a potential for supplemental irrigation to be economically viable in the future in summary there is a great potential for supplemental irrigation to enhance potato growth and increase potato yield and tuber quality thereby increasing the economic returns for potato production in ac and northeast usa that requires quantitative information on the impacts of both water deficit and excess on potato growth and yield and quality although there are some studies in semi arid and arid regions on this topic the data are not directly usable in humid regions such as ac and northeast usa due to the differences in natural conditions overall there is a lack of understanding on the effects of water stress on potato growth in humid region where water stress is periodical and can be in the forms of both water deficit and water excess we hypothesize that the effect of deficit and excess soil moisture will have negative impacts on potato plant growth yield and tuber quality and the degree of the impacts is dependent upon the stage of growth at which the perturbation occurs therefore the objective for this study is to examine the effects of short period of water stress both water deficit and water excess at different stages of potato growth on potato plant vegetative development and its implications on potato yield and tuber quality the practical question we want to answer is if we have restored limited amount of surface runoff water in a retention structure when should we apply it for supplemental irrigation so that we can maximize potato yield and tuber quality while reducing the negative impacts of excessive water due to unexpected rainfall after irrigation 2 methodology 2 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted with pots in a controlled greenhouse at agriculture and agri food canada aafc s fredericton research and development centre frdc in fredericton new brunswick canada the russet burbank variety was used in the experiment because it is the most popular variety used in the province of new brunswick and worldwide the experiment was carried out with a completely randomized design three soil moisture regimes smr deficit normal and excess were examined detailed methods used for soil moisture determination are described in the following section with respect to the experimental design under deficit smr soil moisture was maintained close to the permanent wilting point pwp under normal smr soil moisture was maintained between 65 and 85 of available water content awc this is a range of soil moisture observed under normal field conditions in rainfed agriculture in ac e g bรฉlanger et al 2000 farooque et al 2019 under excess smr soil moisture was maintained to exceed field capacity fc by 10 the design uses the normal smr as the control by comparing results under deficit and excess smr to those under normal smr we can quantify the effects of water deficit and water excess on potato growth yield and tuber characteristics for the deficit and excess smrs targeted soil moisture level was imposed for a 2 week period each coincided with a potato growth stage in total four growth stages were examined stage i sprouting day 2 15 the period of time between planting and crop emergence stage ii vegetative growth day 16 29 the period of time between crop emergence and tuber initiation stage iii tuberization day 30 43 the period of time for the formation of tubers at the tips of the stolon and stage iv tuber bulking day 44 57 the period of time for the enlargement of tubers once the 2 week time period for imposing the soil moisture level ended the experimental units were brought back to the normal smr with three smrs deficit normal and excess and four growth stages sprouting vegetative growth tuberization and tuber bulking there was a total of 12 treatments all treatments were replicated four times for a total of 48 experimental units pots 2 2 soil moisture thresholds determination the soil used in this experiment was surface layer soil collected from agricultural fields in new brunswick soil texture was sandy loam the soil was filtered with a 5 mm mesh sieve to remove coarse fragments and then sterilized prior to the experiment we first determined the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp of the soil field capacity was quantified as the amount of water retained in an initially saturated soil after 2 3 days of free gravity drainage without evaporative loss this was done using cores with the pressure extraction method reynolds and topp 2008 as follows four soil cores were collected weighed and placed on the extraction plate water was added to saturate the soil in the core the plate was then placed in the pressure extractor and the pressure was set to 33kpa the soil samples were allowed to reach soil moisture equilibrium usually after 48 72 h and then were removed from the pressure extractor and weighed dried and re weighed to obtain the gravimetric moisture content 1 mc gravimetric weight of soil wet weight of soil dry weight of soil dry 2 mc volumetric mc gravimetric d b volumetric moisture content was then calculated from the gravimetric moisture content and the mean soil bulk density db of 1 25 g cm3 this resulted in a fc of 24 9 for the study permanent wilting point inferior limit of available water is represented as the amount of water retained in an initially saturated or near saturated soil after receiving a tension of 1500kpa the same pressure extraction method was used for the pwp determination the average pwp value for the experimental soil was 14 5 plant available water content awc was then calculated as 3 awc fc pwp the awc of the soil used in this study was determined to be 10 4 irrigation moisture limits 65 and 85 for the normal smr were determined based on the awc and pwp using the following equations 4 optimal upper limit oul awc 0 85 pwp 5 optimal lower limit oll awc 0 65 pwp the resulting limits were 23 3 for the oul and 21 2 for the oll 2 3 growing conditions and data collection the experiment was conducted using plastic pots 29 cm in diameter each pot was firstly filled with 10kg of the experimental soil and then 7 65 g of 17 17 17 npk granular fertilizer was added the fertilizer was mixed into the soil to prevent direct contact with the potato seed one seed piece 55 63 g seed piece of elite ii russet burbank potato with at least 3 good eyes from the apical end of the seed piece was added to each pot two kilograms of soil was then added to cover the seed piece a total of 12kg of soil per pot all pots received 550 ml of 10 52 10 npk starter fertilizer to promote growth the pots were placed on a bench in the frdc greenhouse the positions of the pots were randomized the greenhouse was set to a 16 h day photoperiod with the daytime and nighttime temperature controlled in the ranges of 20 24 c and 18 22 c respectively these conditions are similar to the natural light and temperature conditions in the growing season in nb soil moisture was monitored daily with a delta t wet sensor three readings were collected per pot to determine a mean soil moisture which was used to determine the required water inputs to maintain the smrs according to the allocated treatment for the deficit smr the pwp 14 5 was used as the threshold and water was added to the pot when the measured soil moisture fell below pwp for the normal smr the target soil moisture range was 21 2 23 3 i e between oul and oll for the excess smr water was added when the soil moisture fell below 27 4 110 of fc all irrigation was conducted manually plant emergence status was recorded daily for all pots from the date of planting until potato sprouting occurred in all pots plant flowering status was recorded in a similar fashion plant height was measured daily once the plants reached 10 cm in height at the 57th day after planting plant growth was terminated and all plant material was harvested and removed from the pot we did not wait for the potato tubers to be fully mature because the pot size became a limiting factor for tuber bulking towards the end of experiment period after harvesting the plant was cut at the root collar to separate the above ground plant material shoots and underground material including roots and tubers all tubers were removed from roots and washed counted and weighed fresh to obtain total yield the average tuber mass the number of small tubers diameter 35 mm was also counted tubers roots and shoots were dried at 55 c for 48 h to obtain shoot and root biomass and tuber dry matter content tdmc average tuber mass tuber size distribution and tdmc are commonly used indices to evaluate potato tuber quality by the industry e g canada food inspection agency cfia 2018 2 4 data analysis all data analyses were performed in r version 3 4 1 we assessed the plant vegetative development daily increase in plant height using polynomial regression in a mixed effects model using asreml for r vsn international with the smr excess normal and deficit and growth stage at which the smr was imposed sprouting vegetative growth tuberization and tuber bulking and their interactions as fixed effects plant identity experimental unit or pot was included as a random factor the temporal ar1 autocorrelation was also included to correct for the temporal correlation among residuals where significant terms were found linear contrast terms were fit ahead of the term to partition out the significant amount of variation between treatments for example a contrast term of deficit vs others ahead of the treatment partitions out the variation due to a difference between deficit smr and the other treatments normal and excess smrs the remaining variation in the treatment term is for the difference between the normal and excess smr treatments effects of the growth stage at which deficit smr was imposed were also partitioned out to explain the significant portion of variation within the interaction terms of smr treatment and growth stage see table s1 all plant characteristics shoot biomass root biomass tuber yield number of tubers proportion of small tubers 35 mm average tuber fresh mass tdmc days to flower and final plant height were assessed using anova for variation among smrs and growth stages at which the smrs were imposed all treatment means smr and growth stage combinations were compared to the control mean by setting the control treatment normal smr throughout the experiment period as model intercept since many of the plant responses can be correlated or trade off with one another we also assessed all possible correlations among plant characteristics using spearman s rank correlation as some characteristics were non linearly correlated to one another see fig s2 the correlations among plant responses were then further assessed using principal component analyses pca we then assessed whether the smrs and the growth stage at which they were imposed influenced the dissimilarity among plants in their performance using bray curtis dissimilarity in plant responses among smr treatments and the stage at which the smr treatments were imposed using a permutational anova function adonis in the r package vegan with 999 permutations to summarize the differences in plant and tuber characteristics into a single multivariate index we first inspected the eigenvectors of each pc axis to assess whether the axis direction correspond to one another i e larger positive values of each axes correspond to larger values of a particular plant response if axes differed in their direction in which they were related to a common plant response the axes were multiplied by 1 to invert the direction each of the axes were then weighted by multiplying the pc scores by the proportion of variation explained by each axis prior to averaging axis scores the weighted average pc axis score is a multivariate composite variable that has been developed elsewhere to summarize multiple responses into a single multivariate index see meyer et al 2018 the multivariate index was then scaled to the normal smr control by subtracting the mean of the normal smr treatment the multivariate response index was assessed with anova as was done with the individual plant responses we also assessed the relationship between the multivariate response index with the average soil moisture the coefficient of variation cv in soil moisture and the net amount of water plants received throughout the growth of the plants using linear regression 3 results 3 1 plant vegetative development in general soil moisture was controlled well in this experiment fig 1 this was evidenced in that the variation of soil moisture volume based value in the unit of percentage under the normal smr mostly varied within 3 percentage points of the target value and for the deficit and excess smrs the soil moisture was controlled approximately 5 6 precentage points lower and higher respectively than the normal smr fig 1 the plant vegetative development curves clearly show that water deficit had negative impacts on plant vegetative development fig 1a d deficit smr applied at the sprouting stage appeared to have caused some long term impact so that the plant height was lower than that of the control throughout the experiment period fig 1a the difference was small but it was consistent so that the plant vegetative development curve was almost parallel to that of the control when deficit smr was applied to the vegetative growth stage fig 1b the gap between the plant vegetative development curves for the deficit smr and control was the biggest compared to those when it was applied to other potato growth stages this suggests that water deficit in the vegetative growth stage negatively affected potato plant vegetative development the most the curve also showed the dynamics of how plant responded to water deficit first there was a lag time in response the plant appeared to respond after several days of deficit smr treatment the gap between deficit smr and control increased as water deficit condition prolonged after the plant was brought back to normal smr the plant did not start to recover right away instead the large gap persisted for about another 2weeks however more importantly plant vegetative development seemed to be able to recover and the gap between the two curves eventually decreased and in the end the plant height for the deficit smr treatment was close to that of the control this suggests that the plant was able to adjust its growth rate to compensate lost growth during the short period of water deficit in the vegetative growth stage similar lag time and recovery phenomena were observed when deficit smr was applied at the tuberization stage fig 1c compared to the vegetative growth stage water deficit in the tuberization stage has weaker impact as the gap between the treatment and control curve was smaller and the recovery also appeared to be faster when deficit smr was applied to the tuber bulking stage there was also a substantial reduction in plant vegetative development fig 1d however since the experiment ended at the end of the treatment period it was not possible to detect a recovery afterwards the use of contrasts to partition out significant differences among growth curves provided additional statistical evidence on how water deficit can change the plant vegetative development curve the statistical tests of the contrasts indicate that water deficit during the bulking stage significantly altered the slope of the growth curve whereas water deficit during the vegetative growth and tuberization stages altered the shape of the growth curves recovering from a reduced growth table s1 with water excess smrs the growth curves were all very close to the control indicating that water excess had little effect on plant vegetative development fig 1e h it should be noted that for water excess applied during the vegetative growth stage the plant height was slightly higher than that of the control and fell back after about 2weeks an opposite but symmetrical pattern to that for water deficit treatment this indicates that the water excess smrs implemented in this study potentially have improved plant vegetative development not to reduce it as we expected 3 2 plant and tuber characteristics regardless of the timing of smr treatments water deficit consistently had a stronger effect than water excess on all plant responses fig 2 specifically shoot biomass was significantly reduced under deficit smrs regardless of timing while excess smr had no significant effect fig 2a for root biomass all treatments did not show significant effect except for water deficit during the tuberization stage which significantly increased root biomass fig 2b the number of days to flowering only exhibited a significant effect delay in flowering with water deficit during the vegetative growth stage fig 2c the final plant height was lower for all water deficit treatment but the effect was only significant for water deficit during the tuber bulking stage fig 2d tuber yield was reduced by water deficit and the reductions were significant with water deficit treatment for the latter three growth stages while water excess marginally increased tuber yield and the effect was only significant for the tuber bulking stage fig 2e the total number of tubers was significantly lower with either water deficit or excess at the sprouting stage fig 2f for all other growth stages the effect of smr on total number of tubers was not significant the proportion of small tubers 35 mm was significantly increased with water deficit during the vegetative and tuberization stages while conversely it was significantly reduced under water excess during the sprouting stage and was not significantly affected under other treatments fig 2g the average tuber mass exhibited an inverse response of the proportion of small tubers produced where water deficit during the vegetative growth and tuberization stages significantly reduced the average tuber mass while water excess during the sprouting stage significantly increased the average tuber mass fig 2h additionally water deficit during the sprouting stage also significantly increased the average tuber mass which could be a reflection of the close relationship between total number of tubers and average tuber mass the tuber dry mass content tdmc showed a similar pattern to total tuber yield probably because tdmc was calculated from total tuber yield fig 2i statistical analysis show that water deficit smr at the vegetative and tuberization stages significantly reduced tdmc whereas excess soil moisture and water deficit at the sprouting and bulking stage did not show significant impact on tdmc 3 3 multivariate analyses correlation analysis confirmed that many plant and tuber characteristics were significantly correlated fig s2 although some of these correlations were confounded by the fact that some measurements were derived from the same data e g correlation between yield and tdmc some may indicate how plant respond in different ways or trade offs plant has to make under stress e g correlation between shoot biomass and days to flower the associations and trade offs among the plant responses can be revealed by simultaneously assessing the multiple plant responses using pca and correlation analyses with the pca the first two pc axes explained 65 of the data variances table 2 plotted with these two pc axes tuber yield tdmc and average tuber mass corresponded negatively to the proportion of small tubers fig 3a also aboveground growth plant height and shoot biomass corresponded to later flowering these relationships were also reflected in the correlation analysis fig s2 however what was important was that the two pc axes especially the first pc seem to be able to separate the deficit and excess smrs well in particular data points for water deficit during the vegetative growth and tuberization stages were mostly clustered to the far right side of pc1 fig 3a this indicates that these treatments resulted in plants with a delayed flowering date lower shoot biomass and plant height a greater number of smaller tubers but lower tuber yield tdmc and average tuber mass fig 3a this agrees with results of the permutational anova which indicates that the treatment of water deficit during vegetative growth and tuberization stages had the overall strongest influence on the performance of the plants table 1 the multivariate index extended beyond the first two pc axes to include the first six pc axes which explained 96 of the variation among the plant and tuber characteristics data table 2 the analysis collapsed down all six pc axes into a single index for the multivariate composite response of the plant under water stresses with negative values corresponding to smaller but more numerous tubers whereas positive values corresponding to larger plants larger tubers and higher yield fig 3b the multivariate index also clearly separate water deficit from water excess treatments with the deficit treatments having negative values while excess treatment either having near zero values close to control or positive values effects of three water deficit treatments for the later three growth stages and one water excess treatment for the tuber bulking stage were significantly different from the control the multivariate index was further plotted against the three soil moisture related parameters to examine the effect of water stress on plant vegetative development and tuber yield and quality as might be expected plants that had a higher mean soil moisture resulted in larger plants with higher yield and larger tubers and thus had higher multivariate index values fig 3c the variability in soil moisture due to both smr treatment applied and experimental errors had an opposite effect where greater variation in soil moisture throughout the development of the plant reduced the ability of plants to produce greater biomass larger tubers and greater yield and thus lower multivariate index values fig 3d the total amount of water added to the plants throughout the experiment had a strikingly strong effect on the performance of the plants whereby plants receiving more water produced greater biomass larger tubers and greater yield thus higher multivariate index values fig 3e 4 discussion 4 1 plant response to short period of water stress our experiment results suggest that water deficit has a negative impact on plant development and growth allocation to tubers whereas water excess had little to even a positive impact see fig 3a b the negative impact of water deficit on yield can be attributed to its effect on limiting plant vegetative development especially the development of the aboveground portion figs 1 2 as reduced aboveground growth will limit photosynthesis which provides the resources for tuber production this in turn limits tuber production this agrees with many previous studies on the effects of water deficit on potatoes e g moorby et al 1975 benoit and grant 1980 bรฉlanger et al 2000 individual plant characteristics did not all respond in a similar way to water deficits and the responses were also dependent upon the growth stage at which water deficit occurred which is similar to the results reported by lynch et al 1995 the unique response of individual plant characteristics to water deficit at different growth stages suggests that the timing of water deficit is a key factor affecting how plants allocate resources to above and belowground organs for example when water deficit occurred early in the sprouting stage the overall impact was minor but broad and long lasting this was evidenced by plant height being slightly but consistently shorter than the control plants throughout the experiment e g fig 1a in turn water deficit at this early stage resulted in reduced biomass production and plants with fewer but larger tubers see fig 2 the relatively minor impact of water deficit during the sprouting stage on plant growth and yield can be explained by that the plants were relatively small at the sprouting stage so that evapotranspiration was low and therefore water demand by plants for growth was not high on the other hand at the sprouting stage plant tissue differentiation had just begun as such any damage at this stage was likely fundamental and carried over to later stages of plant and tuber development this explains why the impact was broad and long lasting overall water deficit at the sprouting stage resulted in fewer but larger tubers so that the impact on yield was low the vegetative and tuberization stages appeared to be the timing when potato plants were most sensitive to water deficit this agrees with many previous studies de lis et al 1964 stark and mccann 1992 lynch et al 1995 for these two growth stages there were big gaps in plant height for long periods of time compared to the control fig 1b c although plants did recover afterwards to achieve a final plant height similar to that of the control tuber development were significantly affected fig 2 the biomass accumulation in these plants did not recover which was likely the cause of reduced tuber yield more importantly total number of tubers and proportion of smaller tubers were both higher so that the average tuber mass were significantly lower than the control tuber dry mass ratio was also significantly lower these tuber attributes suggest that when the potato plant was under water deficit during the vegetative growth and tuberization stage it tended to develop more tubers because the supply of water was restricted the tubers were smaller leading to an overall significant lower yield than the control water deficit during the bulking stage appeared to have the strongest impact on plant vegetative development as the shoot mass and final plant height both were significantly lower than the control plants however this was at least in part due to the fact that the plant was harvested at the end of the bulking stage leaving no time for the plant to recover whereas for all other stages there were at least 2weeks for the plant to recover what is interesting was that tuber yield although significantly lower than the control was not as badly impacted as treatments with water deficit under vegetative growth or tuberization stage other tuber quality parameters were also much closer to the control in value this indicates that the impact on yield and tuber quality of water deficit at the bulking stage was not as dramatic as at the vegetative or tuberization stage for all plant and tuber characteristics examined in this study there were mostly no significant difference between the water excess treatments and the control or between the different timings of water excess treatment figs 1 2 however the water excess treatments did consistently produce slightly higher shoot biomass final plant height tuber yield average tuber mass and tdmc as well as slightly lower proportion for small tubers although not statistically significant independently when all of these plant attributes are considered together with the multivariate analysis our results indicates that water excess does result in slightly larger potato plants with larger tubers and higher yield this was particularly evident at the bulking stage where water excess significantly increased total tuber yield which was likely due to a slightly higher total numbers of tubers and tuber size another interesting point is that when water excess was applied at the sprouting stage the effects on tuber related parameters were similar to those of water deficit at the sprouting stage where plants produced fewer tubers with a greater tuber mass fig 2 this suggests that water stress deficit and excess during the sprouting stage influences the plants allocation of growth to tubers that affects yield similar phenomenon has been reported by aliche et al 2020 4 2 implications for irrigation practices in ac the results from this study suggest that the impact of water deficit on potato plant vegetative and tuber development was overall negative and that of water excess was non significant or positive these imply that supplement irrigation is beneficial to potato crop production and the risk of damage due to over irrigation is low while the positive impact of supplemental irrigation has been reported in numerous previous studies e g benoit and grant 1980 1985 marra et al 1987 bรฉlanger et al 2000 2002 the low risk of damage due to over irrigation is something new this claim was supported not only by the overall non significant or positive impact of water excess treatment but also by the fact that the total amount of water added was very strongly correlated to the multivariate index fig 3e as well as most plant vegetative development and tuber characteristics fig s2 basically the correlations between plant growth and yield with the amount of water received suggests that the more water applied the better the potato crop performed however it should be noted that this claim needs to be put into the perspective of this study first the target soil moisture content for the water excess smr was set at 110 of field capacity it was no doubt a wet condition because for a well drained soil soil moisture will not be held at this level for long however there is still many empty macro pores for aeriation under this condition in other words it is still far from a water logging condition under which most macro pores would be filled with water so the positive feedback of adding water cannot be extrapolated to water logging conditions second the soil used in this study was sandy and had high hydraulic conductivity should the experimental soil be a clay soil the response may not be the same moreover this study was a pot study which did not consider the high variation in soil and topographic conditions in a real field see more discussion on the limitations of pot study in the following section the positive feedback of adding water may hold true in a field for the well drained spots with sandy soils it may not be true for some other spots in the same field where drainage is poor or the soil is clay the results from this study can be used to guide the design for irrigation timing when water resource is limited or when availability of irrigation water is not guaranteed first the vegetative and tuberization stages stood out to be the most sensitive periods for water deficit so it seems to be an easy decision to save water for these two stages when there is not enough water for irrigation however we also need to consider the climate condition in ac and northeast usa due to the cold winter large amount of precipitation was stored in the form of snow during the winter in the spring there is often excess water in the field due to snowmelt milburn and gartley 1988 the challenge in spring is then draining excessive water with the snowmelt water early spring is also a critical time for refilling water retention structures this water excess condition normally extends for the early growing season when plant vegetative development is limited low evapotranspiration as a result during the potato sprouting stage a normal condition is that retention structure is filled with water but the field does not need more water that being said there is high variation from year to year and at times precipitation during the sprouting stage can be low leading to short period of water deficit given the broad and long lasting negative impact of water deficit during this stage it can be beneficial to use some of the stored water for irrigation during this time especially because water excess to a certain degree e g 110 of field capacity as tested in this study during this stage brings additional benefits higher yield and larger tubers fig 2 despite the benefits of irrigation during the sprouting stage water consumption needs to be strategic if retention structure is the only water source enough water needs to be saved for the vegetative and tuberization stages since the marginal benefits for irrigation during those two stages are higher than the sprouting stage during the vegetative and tuberization stage as the plant grows evapotranspiration increases and therefore the possibility of water deficit increases irrigation is certainly helpful to ensure the yield and tuber quality large sized tubers however it may still be worthwhile to save water for later growth stages for example we can speculate that instead of maintaining soil water at an ideal level throughout these two stages it may be more beneficial to allow a low level of water deficit so that water can be saved in case there is serious drought conditions later on of course the level of water deficit and length in time the plant can endure without suffering yield and tuber quality losses needs to be studied further see detailed discussion on future studies below at the bulking stage irrigation again is beneficial because water deficit significantly reduced yield while water excess significantly increased yield in our experiment fig 2 also there is probably no need to save the water because after the bulking stage the plant enters into maturity and the need for water decreases 4 3 advantages and limitations of pot study this study was based on pot experiment there are several advantages with pot study first in a pot study most affecting factors such as natural precipitation temperature light and soil can be well controlled so that the effects observed can be attributed to the water treatment this is especially critical for examining the effects of different timings for example for the experiment designed to examine the effect of water deficit if it was conducted in an open field one rainfall event during the designated growth stage for water deficit treatment will ruin the experiment completely in arid and semi arid region the experiment may still be doable because rainfall event is rare especially when it is outside the rainy season in humid regions however rainfall event is common throughout the growing season therefore a study to examine water deficit or excess in different timing growth stages will have to be conducted in house second because the environmental condition is controlled there is much flexibility on the timing of the experiment because we do not need to stick with the natural timing of the growing season with this flexibility it also increases the throughput as several rounds of experiments can be completed in 1year there are also some limitations for pot experiment first the space in a pot was small and therefore it becomes a limitation for the development of tubers later in the growing season as a result the experiment in this study was stopped at the 57th day without carrying through the full growing season therefore yield values reported in this study are not directly comparable to those obtained from a commercial field second the environmental conditions in a pot study are not natural so that sometimes it may not reflect real world conditions well for example the temperature and light cycle were kept the same in the greenhouse throughout the experiment while in reality temperature and light cycle do change over time that being said it should be noted that removing these real world variations enabled us to attribute the treatment effects to soil water conditions alone without being confounded by those other factors therefore it is considered a necessary compromise 4 4 suggestions for future studies a first direction for future study is to validate the results obtained from this study in a real world setting this includes field experiment with similar water stress treatments throughout the growing season as well as field data collection in commercial fields over multiple years to establish relationship between water supply condition and potato tuber yield and quality second this study used russet burbank which is the most popular potato variety it is well known that potato varieties may respond differently to water stress steckel and gray 1979 lynch et al 1995 therefore another direction for future study is to carry out similar experiment for other major varieties used in this region a third direction of future study is to examine the effects of higher levels of water excess our results suggest that the more water the better but we know that potato will die in prolonged water logging conditions following this logic there must be a threshold of water level when the impacts on potato growth and tuber development flips from positive to negative studies need to be carried out to determine the threshold so that over irrigation can be prevented last but not least the time length for water stress was set at 2weeks in this study with such a design we can compare the effect of timing on the same basis however the question remains on how long the potato plant can endure water stress finding answer to this question is very important under a supplemental irrigation scenario for example if the field has suffered only a short period of water deficit and there is a rainfall event in the forecast one would like to know if an irrigation could be skipped another example is that when water resource is limited in order to save water instead of always keeping the soil at the ideal water level one would like to know whether it is ok to let the field dry for a short period of time before irrigation an experiment on the impact of different lengths of water deficit period on potato growth and tuber yield will be needed to answer these questions 5 conclusions in this study we conducted a pot experiment to test the effects of short period 2weeks of water deficit and water excess respectively applied at four different potato growth stages sprouting vegetative tuberization and bulking stage on potato vegetative development and tuber yield and quality we conclude that overall short period of water deficit had negative impacts while short period of water excess had slightly positive impacts on potato vegetative development and tuber yield and quality the magnitude of the impacts and the major characteristics to be affected were partly determined by the timing the four stages and type of water stress deficit versus excess for water deficit the most sensitive periods were the vegetative and tuberization stage whereas for water excess there was no significant differences between different potato growth stages although the impact of water deficit at the sprouting stage was minor it was broad and long lasting these results confirmed the benefits of supplemental irrigation and further suggested low risk of over irrigation in well drained fields although field validation is still required our pot experiment result does provides some directions for supplemental irrigation in atlantic canada and northeast usa on fields using water retention structure as the only water source for irrigation e g in a liswc system there may be benefits on using water strategically based on the potato growth period more specifically when water deficit occurs in the sprouting stage irrigation is beneficial but it may be more important to ensure that enough water has been saved for the vegetative and tuberization stage in case of water deficits in those two periods which is more likely to happen than in the sprouting stage if there is still water left in the retention structure at the bulking stage irrigation can then be applied whenever water deficit conditions develop and no water needs to be saved finally we suggest future field experiments and further data collection to validate our findings and further studies with different potato varieties different levels of water excess and different lengths of water deficit periods declaration of

10208,potato growth in humid climate regions is facing increasing challenges due to short period stresses in water deficit and excess however there is a lack of quantitative information on the effects of short period of water stress on potato plant growth and its implications on potato yield and tuber quality in this study we conducted a pot experiment to test the effects of short period 2weeks of water deficit and water excess respectively applied at four different potato growth stages sprouting vegetative tuberization and bulking stage on potato vegetative development and tuber yield and quality the results show that short period of water deficit overall had negative impacts while short period of water excess had slightly positive impacts on potato vegetative development and tuber yield and quality for water deficit the most sensitive periods were the vegetative and tuberization stage whereas for water excess there were mostly no significant differences between different potato growth stages although the impact of water deficit at the sprouting stage was minor it was broad and long lasting these results confirm the benefits of supplemental irrigation and suggest the low risk of over irrigation in well drained fields they further suggest that when the availability of water for irrigation is limited using water strategically during the period when potato needs water the most can maximize the benefits of supplemental irrigation keywords drought water deficit water excess potato yield tuber quality cold humid climate 1 introduction most varieties of potato have shallower and less extended roots and therefore are more sensitive to water supply than most other crops king and stark 2003 early studies on potato agronomy recognized water supply as one of the most important factors influencing potato yield and suggested that soil moisture should never be allowed to drop below 50 of the available range of moisture singh 1969 most of the studies on potato water supply were carried out in semi arid or arid regions e g west to northwest of north america where potato cropping is impossible without irrigation marra and woods 1990 king and stark 2003 the predominant water stress in semi arid or arid regions is water deficit under water deficit conditions the first response of potato plant is leaf stomatal closure epstein and grant 1973 stegman and nelson 1973 thomas et al 1976 by closing the stomata it reduces gas exchange between leaf cells and the environment so that water loss is reduced however this has a number of negative impacts such as increasing leaf temperature reducing co2 diffusion into the leaf and thus reducing photosynthesis moorby et al 1975 campbell et al 1976 ackerson et al 1977 shekhar and iritani 1979 weisz et al 1994 water deficit also reduces water pressure in plant cells without sufficient photosynthetic products starch and sugars and water pressure plant and tuber growth are restricted whereas potato growth and yield are negatively affected by short period of water deficit at any growth stage the impacts are strongest at the tuber initiation and flowering stage de lis et al 1964 stark and mccann 1992 lynch et al 1995 this leads to the strategy of drought hardening or acclimation by introducing the plant to mild water stress at an earlier stage to enhance its tolerance to water deficit drought in later stages cavagnaro et al 1971 thomas et al 1976 banik et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 while irrigation is necessary for potato cropping in semi arid and arid regions over irrigation and unexpected rainfall may cause temporary water excess king et al 2000 excessive water can also cause damage to potatoes high soil water content reduces soil temperature and prolonged period of soil water saturation results in oxygen deficiency harken and burton 1975 holder and cary 1984 these can lead to seed piece decay and delayed emergence in early potato growth stages and root damage in later stages bushnell 1956 excessive water also increases the possibility of nutrient leaching reducing fertilizer use efficiency and leading to not only plant nutrient deficiency but also elevated nutrient concentrations in ground and surface waters waddell et al 2000 woli et al 2016 it has also been reported that excessive water can increase diseases and pest infection on potato crop e g cappaert et al 1992 tuber expansion is strongly affected by water supply so that both deficit and excessive water supply can cause tuber malformation and other tuber quality issues such as pointed ends knobs brown center and hollow heart however these defects are most likely to occur when there is high fluctuation in soil water conditions which induces disruptions of normal pace for tuber expansion and creations of uneven tissue development in tubers king and stark 2003 natural conditions in humid regions such as atlantic canada ac and northeast united states of america usa are quite different from semi arid and arid regions in ac and northeast usa precipitation is generally enough for growing potato and field crops and therefore irrigation is not required to sustain a profitable potato production system as a result this area is dominated by rainfed agriculture demerchant 1983 moreover growing season is shorter crop density is generally lower and soils are also less sandy than in the west and northwest of north america given these differences the knowledge obtained from the semi arid and arid regions is not directly transferable to the humid regions marra and woods 1990 however although precipitation in this region is overall sufficient for potato growth short periods of water deficit and excess are common in fact studies have shown that water supply is one of the major limitations for potato growth and supplemental irrigation can increase potato yield and tuber quality in ac and northeast usa milburn and gartley 1988 benoit and grant 1980 1985 bรฉlanger et al 2000 2002 there are several challenges for potato irrigation under rainfed conditions first it is supplemental irrigation so that the goal is to apply sufficient water during dry periods however day to day weather in humid region is highly variable and the risk of over irrigation due to unexpected weather events is high benoit and grant 1985 this requires quantified evaluation on the impacts of both water deficit and water excess a second challenge for irrigation in this region is the lack of a reliable water source for example the landscape in ac is hilly with long and sometimes steep slopes slope gradient typically ranges from 3 to 20 fahmy et al 2010 many fields are located in uplands that are far away from surface water sources such as rivers and lakes tapping into groundwater is not only costly but also under strict scrutiny due to environmental concerns and heavy regulations one possible solution is to take advantage of the seasonal distribution of precipitation due to the cold climate there is large amount of snow accumulated in the winter in ac and northeast usa in the spring due to snowmelt there is often too much water in the field often surface and subsurface drainage systems are constructed to drain the water out currently the drainage water is mostly discharged directly to small channels streams or rivers however on a sloping field as is typical in ac water can be stored in a retention structure at the bottom of the slope and the saved water can be used for irrigation such a combination of several beneficial management practices bmp in the landscape context is termed landscape integrated soil and water conservation liswc system li 2020 in a liswc system the amount of available water for irrigation is limited determined by the storage capacity of the retention structure and the size of its catchment area the timing for using the limited water for irrigation is critical in order to maximize the benefits of irrigation on potato growth yield and tuber quality a third challenge for supplemental irrigation for potato in ac and northeast usa is economic challenge previous economic studies suggest that supplemental irrigation although can increase yield and tuber quality is not economically viable in most areas in maine and nb due to the high cost for installing and maintaining the irrigation system marra et al 1987 whitford 1993 however the situation may be different with climate change the predicted major climate change trend in atlantic canada ac is that average temperature is likely to rise whereas the direction of change in average precipitation is uncertain lemmen and warren 2004 stocker et al 2013 rising temperature will increase evapotranspiration and potentially can result in more severe water deficit in addition for both temperature and precipitation there is a high confidence that their variabilities will increase due to climate change this means that there will be more extreme weather events such as intensive rainstorms as well as longer drying periods overall it is likely that agriculture will experience less temperature stress but more severe water stress in the future in ac therefore the economic return for water supply management is expected to increase when such increase is big enough there is a potential for supplemental irrigation to be economically viable in the future in summary there is a great potential for supplemental irrigation to enhance potato growth and increase potato yield and tuber quality thereby increasing the economic returns for potato production in ac and northeast usa that requires quantitative information on the impacts of both water deficit and excess on potato growth and yield and quality although there are some studies in semi arid and arid regions on this topic the data are not directly usable in humid regions such as ac and northeast usa due to the differences in natural conditions overall there is a lack of understanding on the effects of water stress on potato growth in humid region where water stress is periodical and can be in the forms of both water deficit and water excess we hypothesize that the effect of deficit and excess soil moisture will have negative impacts on potato plant growth yield and tuber quality and the degree of the impacts is dependent upon the stage of growth at which the perturbation occurs therefore the objective for this study is to examine the effects of short period of water stress both water deficit and water excess at different stages of potato growth on potato plant vegetative development and its implications on potato yield and tuber quality the practical question we want to answer is if we have restored limited amount of surface runoff water in a retention structure when should we apply it for supplemental irrigation so that we can maximize potato yield and tuber quality while reducing the negative impacts of excessive water due to unexpected rainfall after irrigation 2 methodology 2 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted with pots in a controlled greenhouse at agriculture and agri food canada aafc s fredericton research and development centre frdc in fredericton new brunswick canada the russet burbank variety was used in the experiment because it is the most popular variety used in the province of new brunswick and worldwide the experiment was carried out with a completely randomized design three soil moisture regimes smr deficit normal and excess were examined detailed methods used for soil moisture determination are described in the following section with respect to the experimental design under deficit smr soil moisture was maintained close to the permanent wilting point pwp under normal smr soil moisture was maintained between 65 and 85 of available water content awc this is a range of soil moisture observed under normal field conditions in rainfed agriculture in ac e g bรฉlanger et al 2000 farooque et al 2019 under excess smr soil moisture was maintained to exceed field capacity fc by 10 the design uses the normal smr as the control by comparing results under deficit and excess smr to those under normal smr we can quantify the effects of water deficit and water excess on potato growth yield and tuber characteristics for the deficit and excess smrs targeted soil moisture level was imposed for a 2 week period each coincided with a potato growth stage in total four growth stages were examined stage i sprouting day 2 15 the period of time between planting and crop emergence stage ii vegetative growth day 16 29 the period of time between crop emergence and tuber initiation stage iii tuberization day 30 43 the period of time for the formation of tubers at the tips of the stolon and stage iv tuber bulking day 44 57 the period of time for the enlargement of tubers once the 2 week time period for imposing the soil moisture level ended the experimental units were brought back to the normal smr with three smrs deficit normal and excess and four growth stages sprouting vegetative growth tuberization and tuber bulking there was a total of 12 treatments all treatments were replicated four times for a total of 48 experimental units pots 2 2 soil moisture thresholds determination the soil used in this experiment was surface layer soil collected from agricultural fields in new brunswick soil texture was sandy loam the soil was filtered with a 5 mm mesh sieve to remove coarse fragments and then sterilized prior to the experiment we first determined the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp of the soil field capacity was quantified as the amount of water retained in an initially saturated soil after 2 3 days of free gravity drainage without evaporative loss this was done using cores with the pressure extraction method reynolds and topp 2008 as follows four soil cores were collected weighed and placed on the extraction plate water was added to saturate the soil in the core the plate was then placed in the pressure extractor and the pressure was set to 33kpa the soil samples were allowed to reach soil moisture equilibrium usually after 48 72 h and then were removed from the pressure extractor and weighed dried and re weighed to obtain the gravimetric moisture content 1 mc gravimetric weight of soil wet weight of soil dry weight of soil dry 2 mc volumetric mc gravimetric d b volumetric moisture content was then calculated from the gravimetric moisture content and the mean soil bulk density db of 1 25 g cm3 this resulted in a fc of 24 9 for the study permanent wilting point inferior limit of available water is represented as the amount of water retained in an initially saturated or near saturated soil after receiving a tension of 1500kpa the same pressure extraction method was used for the pwp determination the average pwp value for the experimental soil was 14 5 plant available water content awc was then calculated as 3 awc fc pwp the awc of the soil used in this study was determined to be 10 4 irrigation moisture limits 65 and 85 for the normal smr were determined based on the awc and pwp using the following equations 4 optimal upper limit oul awc 0 85 pwp 5 optimal lower limit oll awc 0 65 pwp the resulting limits were 23 3 for the oul and 21 2 for the oll 2 3 growing conditions and data collection the experiment was conducted using plastic pots 29 cm in diameter each pot was firstly filled with 10kg of the experimental soil and then 7 65 g of 17 17 17 npk granular fertilizer was added the fertilizer was mixed into the soil to prevent direct contact with the potato seed one seed piece 55 63 g seed piece of elite ii russet burbank potato with at least 3 good eyes from the apical end of the seed piece was added to each pot two kilograms of soil was then added to cover the seed piece a total of 12kg of soil per pot all pots received 550 ml of 10 52 10 npk starter fertilizer to promote growth the pots were placed on a bench in the frdc greenhouse the positions of the pots were randomized the greenhouse was set to a 16 h day photoperiod with the daytime and nighttime temperature controlled in the ranges of 20 24 c and 18 22 c respectively these conditions are similar to the natural light and temperature conditions in the growing season in nb soil moisture was monitored daily with a delta t wet sensor three readings were collected per pot to determine a mean soil moisture which was used to determine the required water inputs to maintain the smrs according to the allocated treatment for the deficit smr the pwp 14 5 was used as the threshold and water was added to the pot when the measured soil moisture fell below pwp for the normal smr the target soil moisture range was 21 2 23 3 i e between oul and oll for the excess smr water was added when the soil moisture fell below 27 4 110 of fc all irrigation was conducted manually plant emergence status was recorded daily for all pots from the date of planting until potato sprouting occurred in all pots plant flowering status was recorded in a similar fashion plant height was measured daily once the plants reached 10 cm in height at the 57th day after planting plant growth was terminated and all plant material was harvested and removed from the pot we did not wait for the potato tubers to be fully mature because the pot size became a limiting factor for tuber bulking towards the end of experiment period after harvesting the plant was cut at the root collar to separate the above ground plant material shoots and underground material including roots and tubers all tubers were removed from roots and washed counted and weighed fresh to obtain total yield the average tuber mass the number of small tubers diameter 35 mm was also counted tubers roots and shoots were dried at 55 c for 48 h to obtain shoot and root biomass and tuber dry matter content tdmc average tuber mass tuber size distribution and tdmc are commonly used indices to evaluate potato tuber quality by the industry e g canada food inspection agency cfia 2018 2 4 data analysis all data analyses were performed in r version 3 4 1 we assessed the plant vegetative development daily increase in plant height using polynomial regression in a mixed effects model using asreml for r vsn international with the smr excess normal and deficit and growth stage at which the smr was imposed sprouting vegetative growth tuberization and tuber bulking and their interactions as fixed effects plant identity experimental unit or pot was included as a random factor the temporal ar1 autocorrelation was also included to correct for the temporal correlation among residuals where significant terms were found linear contrast terms were fit ahead of the term to partition out the significant amount of variation between treatments for example a contrast term of deficit vs others ahead of the treatment partitions out the variation due to a difference between deficit smr and the other treatments normal and excess smrs the remaining variation in the treatment term is for the difference between the normal and excess smr treatments effects of the growth stage at which deficit smr was imposed were also partitioned out to explain the significant portion of variation within the interaction terms of smr treatment and growth stage see table s1 all plant characteristics shoot biomass root biomass tuber yield number of tubers proportion of small tubers 35 mm average tuber fresh mass tdmc days to flower and final plant height were assessed using anova for variation among smrs and growth stages at which the smrs were imposed all treatment means smr and growth stage combinations were compared to the control mean by setting the control treatment normal smr throughout the experiment period as model intercept since many of the plant responses can be correlated or trade off with one another we also assessed all possible correlations among plant characteristics using spearman s rank correlation as some characteristics were non linearly correlated to one another see fig s2 the correlations among plant responses were then further assessed using principal component analyses pca we then assessed whether the smrs and the growth stage at which they were imposed influenced the dissimilarity among plants in their performance using bray curtis dissimilarity in plant responses among smr treatments and the stage at which the smr treatments were imposed using a permutational anova function adonis in the r package vegan with 999 permutations to summarize the differences in plant and tuber characteristics into a single multivariate index we first inspected the eigenvectors of each pc axis to assess whether the axis direction correspond to one another i e larger positive values of each axes correspond to larger values of a particular plant response if axes differed in their direction in which they were related to a common plant response the axes were multiplied by 1 to invert the direction each of the axes were then weighted by multiplying the pc scores by the proportion of variation explained by each axis prior to averaging axis scores the weighted average pc axis score is a multivariate composite variable that has been developed elsewhere to summarize multiple responses into a single multivariate index see meyer et al 2018 the multivariate index was then scaled to the normal smr control by subtracting the mean of the normal smr treatment the multivariate response index was assessed with anova as was done with the individual plant responses we also assessed the relationship between the multivariate response index with the average soil moisture the coefficient of variation cv in soil moisture and the net amount of water plants received throughout the growth of the plants using linear regression 3 results 3 1 plant vegetative development in general soil moisture was controlled well in this experiment fig 1 this was evidenced in that the variation of soil moisture volume based value in the unit of percentage under the normal smr mostly varied within 3 percentage points of the target value and for the deficit and excess smrs the soil moisture was controlled approximately 5 6 precentage points lower and higher respectively than the normal smr fig 1 the plant vegetative development curves clearly show that water deficit had negative impacts on plant vegetative development fig 1a d deficit smr applied at the sprouting stage appeared to have caused some long term impact so that the plant height was lower than that of the control throughout the experiment period fig 1a the difference was small but it was consistent so that the plant vegetative development curve was almost parallel to that of the control when deficit smr was applied to the vegetative growth stage fig 1b the gap between the plant vegetative development curves for the deficit smr and control was the biggest compared to those when it was applied to other potato growth stages this suggests that water deficit in the vegetative growth stage negatively affected potato plant vegetative development the most the curve also showed the dynamics of how plant responded to water deficit first there was a lag time in response the plant appeared to respond after several days of deficit smr treatment the gap between deficit smr and control increased as water deficit condition prolonged after the plant was brought back to normal smr the plant did not start to recover right away instead the large gap persisted for about another 2weeks however more importantly plant vegetative development seemed to be able to recover and the gap between the two curves eventually decreased and in the end the plant height for the deficit smr treatment was close to that of the control this suggests that the plant was able to adjust its growth rate to compensate lost growth during the short period of water deficit in the vegetative growth stage similar lag time and recovery phenomena were observed when deficit smr was applied at the tuberization stage fig 1c compared to the vegetative growth stage water deficit in the tuberization stage has weaker impact as the gap between the treatment and control curve was smaller and the recovery also appeared to be faster when deficit smr was applied to the tuber bulking stage there was also a substantial reduction in plant vegetative development fig 1d however since the experiment ended at the end of the treatment period it was not possible to detect a recovery afterwards the use of contrasts to partition out significant differences among growth curves provided additional statistical evidence on how water deficit can change the plant vegetative development curve the statistical tests of the contrasts indicate that water deficit during the bulking stage significantly altered the slope of the growth curve whereas water deficit during the vegetative growth and tuberization stages altered the shape of the growth curves recovering from a reduced growth table s1 with water excess smrs the growth curves were all very close to the control indicating that water excess had little effect on plant vegetative development fig 1e h it should be noted that for water excess applied during the vegetative growth stage the plant height was slightly higher than that of the control and fell back after about 2weeks an opposite but symmetrical pattern to that for water deficit treatment this indicates that the water excess smrs implemented in this study potentially have improved plant vegetative development not to reduce it as we expected 3 2 plant and tuber characteristics regardless of the timing of smr treatments water deficit consistently had a stronger effect than water excess on all plant responses fig 2 specifically shoot biomass was significantly reduced under deficit smrs regardless of timing while excess smr had no significant effect fig 2a for root biomass all treatments did not show significant effect except for water deficit during the tuberization stage which significantly increased root biomass fig 2b the number of days to flowering only exhibited a significant effect delay in flowering with water deficit during the vegetative growth stage fig 2c the final plant height was lower for all water deficit treatment but the effect was only significant for water deficit during the tuber bulking stage fig 2d tuber yield was reduced by water deficit and the reductions were significant with water deficit treatment for the latter three growth stages while water excess marginally increased tuber yield and the effect was only significant for the tuber bulking stage fig 2e the total number of tubers was significantly lower with either water deficit or excess at the sprouting stage fig 2f for all other growth stages the effect of smr on total number of tubers was not significant the proportion of small tubers 35 mm was significantly increased with water deficit during the vegetative and tuberization stages while conversely it was significantly reduced under water excess during the sprouting stage and was not significantly affected under other treatments fig 2g the average tuber mass exhibited an inverse response of the proportion of small tubers produced where water deficit during the vegetative growth and tuberization stages significantly reduced the average tuber mass while water excess during the sprouting stage significantly increased the average tuber mass fig 2h additionally water deficit during the sprouting stage also significantly increased the average tuber mass which could be a reflection of the close relationship between total number of tubers and average tuber mass the tuber dry mass content tdmc showed a similar pattern to total tuber yield probably because tdmc was calculated from total tuber yield fig 2i statistical analysis show that water deficit smr at the vegetative and tuberization stages significantly reduced tdmc whereas excess soil moisture and water deficit at the sprouting and bulking stage did not show significant impact on tdmc 3 3 multivariate analyses correlation analysis confirmed that many plant and tuber characteristics were significantly correlated fig s2 although some of these correlations were confounded by the fact that some measurements were derived from the same data e g correlation between yield and tdmc some may indicate how plant respond in different ways or trade offs plant has to make under stress e g correlation between shoot biomass and days to flower the associations and trade offs among the plant responses can be revealed by simultaneously assessing the multiple plant responses using pca and correlation analyses with the pca the first two pc axes explained 65 of the data variances table 2 plotted with these two pc axes tuber yield tdmc and average tuber mass corresponded negatively to the proportion of small tubers fig 3a also aboveground growth plant height and shoot biomass corresponded to later flowering these relationships were also reflected in the correlation analysis fig s2 however what was important was that the two pc axes especially the first pc seem to be able to separate the deficit and excess smrs well in particular data points for water deficit during the vegetative growth and tuberization stages were mostly clustered to the far right side of pc1 fig 3a this indicates that these treatments resulted in plants with a delayed flowering date lower shoot biomass and plant height a greater number of smaller tubers but lower tuber yield tdmc and average tuber mass fig 3a this agrees with results of the permutational anova which indicates that the treatment of water deficit during vegetative growth and tuberization stages had the overall strongest influence on the performance of the plants table 1 the multivariate index extended beyond the first two pc axes to include the first six pc axes which explained 96 of the variation among the plant and tuber characteristics data table 2 the analysis collapsed down all six pc axes into a single index for the multivariate composite response of the plant under water stresses with negative values corresponding to smaller but more numerous tubers whereas positive values corresponding to larger plants larger tubers and higher yield fig 3b the multivariate index also clearly separate water deficit from water excess treatments with the deficit treatments having negative values while excess treatment either having near zero values close to control or positive values effects of three water deficit treatments for the later three growth stages and one water excess treatment for the tuber bulking stage were significantly different from the control the multivariate index was further plotted against the three soil moisture related parameters to examine the effect of water stress on plant vegetative development and tuber yield and quality as might be expected plants that had a higher mean soil moisture resulted in larger plants with higher yield and larger tubers and thus had higher multivariate index values fig 3c the variability in soil moisture due to both smr treatment applied and experimental errors had an opposite effect where greater variation in soil moisture throughout the development of the plant reduced the ability of plants to produce greater biomass larger tubers and greater yield and thus lower multivariate index values fig 3d the total amount of water added to the plants throughout the experiment had a strikingly strong effect on the performance of the plants whereby plants receiving more water produced greater biomass larger tubers and greater yield thus higher multivariate index values fig 3e 4 discussion 4 1 plant response to short period of water stress our experiment results suggest that water deficit has a negative impact on plant development and growth allocation to tubers whereas water excess had little to even a positive impact see fig 3a b the negative impact of water deficit on yield can be attributed to its effect on limiting plant vegetative development especially the development of the aboveground portion figs 1 2 as reduced aboveground growth will limit photosynthesis which provides the resources for tuber production this in turn limits tuber production this agrees with many previous studies on the effects of water deficit on potatoes e g moorby et al 1975 benoit and grant 1980 bรฉlanger et al 2000 individual plant characteristics did not all respond in a similar way to water deficits and the responses were also dependent upon the growth stage at which water deficit occurred which is similar to the results reported by lynch et al 1995 the unique response of individual plant characteristics to water deficit at different growth stages suggests that the timing of water deficit is a key factor affecting how plants allocate resources to above and belowground organs for example when water deficit occurred early in the sprouting stage the overall impact was minor but broad and long lasting this was evidenced by plant height being slightly but consistently shorter than the control plants throughout the experiment e g fig 1a in turn water deficit at this early stage resulted in reduced biomass production and plants with fewer but larger tubers see fig 2 the relatively minor impact of water deficit during the sprouting stage on plant growth and yield can be explained by that the plants were relatively small at the sprouting stage so that evapotranspiration was low and therefore water demand by plants for growth was not high on the other hand at the sprouting stage plant tissue differentiation had just begun as such any damage at this stage was likely fundamental and carried over to later stages of plant and tuber development this explains why the impact was broad and long lasting overall water deficit at the sprouting stage resulted in fewer but larger tubers so that the impact on yield was low the vegetative and tuberization stages appeared to be the timing when potato plants were most sensitive to water deficit this agrees with many previous studies de lis et al 1964 stark and mccann 1992 lynch et al 1995 for these two growth stages there were big gaps in plant height for long periods of time compared to the control fig 1b c although plants did recover afterwards to achieve a final plant height similar to that of the control tuber development were significantly affected fig 2 the biomass accumulation in these plants did not recover which was likely the cause of reduced tuber yield more importantly total number of tubers and proportion of smaller tubers were both higher so that the average tuber mass were significantly lower than the control tuber dry mass ratio was also significantly lower these tuber attributes suggest that when the potato plant was under water deficit during the vegetative growth and tuberization stage it tended to develop more tubers because the supply of water was restricted the tubers were smaller leading to an overall significant lower yield than the control water deficit during the bulking stage appeared to have the strongest impact on plant vegetative development as the shoot mass and final plant height both were significantly lower than the control plants however this was at least in part due to the fact that the plant was harvested at the end of the bulking stage leaving no time for the plant to recover whereas for all other stages there were at least 2weeks for the plant to recover what is interesting was that tuber yield although significantly lower than the control was not as badly impacted as treatments with water deficit under vegetative growth or tuberization stage other tuber quality parameters were also much closer to the control in value this indicates that the impact on yield and tuber quality of water deficit at the bulking stage was not as dramatic as at the vegetative or tuberization stage for all plant and tuber characteristics examined in this study there were mostly no significant difference between the water excess treatments and the control or between the different timings of water excess treatment figs 1 2 however the water excess treatments did consistently produce slightly higher shoot biomass final plant height tuber yield average tuber mass and tdmc as well as slightly lower proportion for small tubers although not statistically significant independently when all of these plant attributes are considered together with the multivariate analysis our results indicates that water excess does result in slightly larger potato plants with larger tubers and higher yield this was particularly evident at the bulking stage where water excess significantly increased total tuber yield which was likely due to a slightly higher total numbers of tubers and tuber size another interesting point is that when water excess was applied at the sprouting stage the effects on tuber related parameters were similar to those of water deficit at the sprouting stage where plants produced fewer tubers with a greater tuber mass fig 2 this suggests that water stress deficit and excess during the sprouting stage influences the plants allocation of growth to tubers that affects yield similar phenomenon has been reported by aliche et al 2020 4 2 implications for irrigation practices in ac the results from this study suggest that the impact of water deficit on potato plant vegetative and tuber development was overall negative and that of water excess was non significant or positive these imply that supplement irrigation is beneficial to potato crop production and the risk of damage due to over irrigation is low while the positive impact of supplemental irrigation has been reported in numerous previous studies e g benoit and grant 1980 1985 marra et al 1987 bรฉlanger et al 2000 2002 the low risk of damage due to over irrigation is something new this claim was supported not only by the overall non significant or positive impact of water excess treatment but also by the fact that the total amount of water added was very strongly correlated to the multivariate index fig 3e as well as most plant vegetative development and tuber characteristics fig s2 basically the correlations between plant growth and yield with the amount of water received suggests that the more water applied the better the potato crop performed however it should be noted that this claim needs to be put into the perspective of this study first the target soil moisture content for the water excess smr was set at 110 of field capacity it was no doubt a wet condition because for a well drained soil soil moisture will not be held at this level for long however there is still many empty macro pores for aeriation under this condition in other words it is still far from a water logging condition under which most macro pores would be filled with water so the positive feedback of adding water cannot be extrapolated to water logging conditions second the soil used in this study was sandy and had high hydraulic conductivity should the experimental soil be a clay soil the response may not be the same moreover this study was a pot study which did not consider the high variation in soil and topographic conditions in a real field see more discussion on the limitations of pot study in the following section the positive feedback of adding water may hold true in a field for the well drained spots with sandy soils it may not be true for some other spots in the same field where drainage is poor or the soil is clay the results from this study can be used to guide the design for irrigation timing when water resource is limited or when availability of irrigation water is not guaranteed first the vegetative and tuberization stages stood out to be the most sensitive periods for water deficit so it seems to be an easy decision to save water for these two stages when there is not enough water for irrigation however we also need to consider the climate condition in ac and northeast usa due to the cold winter large amount of precipitation was stored in the form of snow during the winter in the spring there is often excess water in the field due to snowmelt milburn and gartley 1988 the challenge in spring is then draining excessive water with the snowmelt water early spring is also a critical time for refilling water retention structures this water excess condition normally extends for the early growing season when plant vegetative development is limited low evapotranspiration as a result during the potato sprouting stage a normal condition is that retention structure is filled with water but the field does not need more water that being said there is high variation from year to year and at times precipitation during the sprouting stage can be low leading to short period of water deficit given the broad and long lasting negative impact of water deficit during this stage it can be beneficial to use some of the stored water for irrigation during this time especially because water excess to a certain degree e g 110 of field capacity as tested in this study during this stage brings additional benefits higher yield and larger tubers fig 2 despite the benefits of irrigation during the sprouting stage water consumption needs to be strategic if retention structure is the only water source enough water needs to be saved for the vegetative and tuberization stages since the marginal benefits for irrigation during those two stages are higher than the sprouting stage during the vegetative and tuberization stage as the plant grows evapotranspiration increases and therefore the possibility of water deficit increases irrigation is certainly helpful to ensure the yield and tuber quality large sized tubers however it may still be worthwhile to save water for later growth stages for example we can speculate that instead of maintaining soil water at an ideal level throughout these two stages it may be more beneficial to allow a low level of water deficit so that water can be saved in case there is serious drought conditions later on of course the level of water deficit and length in time the plant can endure without suffering yield and tuber quality losses needs to be studied further see detailed discussion on future studies below at the bulking stage irrigation again is beneficial because water deficit significantly reduced yield while water excess significantly increased yield in our experiment fig 2 also there is probably no need to save the water because after the bulking stage the plant enters into maturity and the need for water decreases 4 3 advantages and limitations of pot study this study was based on pot experiment there are several advantages with pot study first in a pot study most affecting factors such as natural precipitation temperature light and soil can be well controlled so that the effects observed can be attributed to the water treatment this is especially critical for examining the effects of different timings for example for the experiment designed to examine the effect of water deficit if it was conducted in an open field one rainfall event during the designated growth stage for water deficit treatment will ruin the experiment completely in arid and semi arid region the experiment may still be doable because rainfall event is rare especially when it is outside the rainy season in humid regions however rainfall event is common throughout the growing season therefore a study to examine water deficit or excess in different timing growth stages will have to be conducted in house second because the environmental condition is controlled there is much flexibility on the timing of the experiment because we do not need to stick with the natural timing of the growing season with this flexibility it also increases the throughput as several rounds of experiments can be completed in 1year there are also some limitations for pot experiment first the space in a pot was small and therefore it becomes a limitation for the development of tubers later in the growing season as a result the experiment in this study was stopped at the 57th day without carrying through the full growing season therefore yield values reported in this study are not directly comparable to those obtained from a commercial field second the environmental conditions in a pot study are not natural so that sometimes it may not reflect real world conditions well for example the temperature and light cycle were kept the same in the greenhouse throughout the experiment while in reality temperature and light cycle do change over time that being said it should be noted that removing these real world variations enabled us to attribute the treatment effects to soil water conditions alone without being confounded by those other factors therefore it is considered a necessary compromise 4 4 suggestions for future studies a first direction for future study is to validate the results obtained from this study in a real world setting this includes field experiment with similar water stress treatments throughout the growing season as well as field data collection in commercial fields over multiple years to establish relationship between water supply condition and potato tuber yield and quality second this study used russet burbank which is the most popular potato variety it is well known that potato varieties may respond differently to water stress steckel and gray 1979 lynch et al 1995 therefore another direction for future study is to carry out similar experiment for other major varieties used in this region a third direction of future study is to examine the effects of higher levels of water excess our results suggest that the more water the better but we know that potato will die in prolonged water logging conditions following this logic there must be a threshold of water level when the impacts on potato growth and tuber development flips from positive to negative studies need to be carried out to determine the threshold so that over irrigation can be prevented last but not least the time length for water stress was set at 2weeks in this study with such a design we can compare the effect of timing on the same basis however the question remains on how long the potato plant can endure water stress finding answer to this question is very important under a supplemental irrigation scenario for example if the field has suffered only a short period of water deficit and there is a rainfall event in the forecast one would like to know if an irrigation could be skipped another example is that when water resource is limited in order to save water instead of always keeping the soil at the ideal water level one would like to know whether it is ok to let the field dry for a short period of time before irrigation an experiment on the impact of different lengths of water deficit period on potato growth and tuber yield will be needed to answer these questions 5 conclusions in this study we conducted a pot experiment to test the effects of short period 2weeks of water deficit and water excess respectively applied at four different potato growth stages sprouting vegetative tuberization and bulking stage on potato vegetative development and tuber yield and quality we conclude that overall short period of water deficit had negative impacts while short period of water excess had slightly positive impacts on potato vegetative development and tuber yield and quality the magnitude of the impacts and the major characteristics to be affected were partly determined by the timing the four stages and type of water stress deficit versus excess for water deficit the most sensitive periods were the vegetative and tuberization stage whereas for water excess there was no significant differences between different potato growth stages although the impact of water deficit at the sprouting stage was minor it was broad and long lasting these results confirmed the benefits of supplemental irrigation and further suggested low risk of over irrigation in well drained fields although field validation is still required our pot experiment result does provides some directions for supplemental irrigation in atlantic canada and northeast usa on fields using water retention structure as the only water source for irrigation e g in a liswc system there may be benefits on using water strategically based on the potato growth period more specifically when water deficit occurs in the sprouting stage irrigation is beneficial but it may be more important to ensure that enough water has been saved for the vegetative and tuberization stage in case of water deficits in those two periods which is more likely to happen than in the sprouting stage if there is still water left in the retention structure at the bulking stage irrigation can then be applied whenever water deficit conditions develop and no water needs to be saved finally we suggest future field experiments and further data collection to validate our findings and further studies with different potato varieties different levels of water excess and different lengths of water deficit periods declaration of

10209,faba bean vicia faba l a major legume crop helps in maintaining soil health by fixing atmospheric nitrogen n2 and thus mostly used as a rotational crop however faba bean is sensitive to water stress which limits its yield potential in water limited environments the objectives of the present study were to i characterize the agro physiological performance of 14 faba bean genotypes with different genetic backgrounds to various levels of water stress in an arid environment and ii identify the most drought tolerant genotypes that maximize the marginal use of unit water without significant yield loss field experiments were conducted for two consecutive growing seasons in an arid mediterranean climate and several agronomic and physiological measurements of different faba bean genotypes in response to water stress were recorded a great variation among the tested genotypes according to several drought response indices was observed as a result of water stress on the basis of which they were classified into five groups a e ranging from drought tolerant to highly sensitive genotypes yield and water productivity results indicated that drought tolerant genotypes produced more yield with less water compared with drought sensitive genotypes and thus are highly recommended for faba bean production in water limited environments certain physiological parameters such as photosynthetic pigment net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate leaf nutrient status n p and k content relative water content and membrane stability index exhibited highly positive association with seed yield and yield contributing traits it is valid to use these parameters as rapid indicators of drought tolerance in breeding programs aiming to screen and improve faba bean genotypes for drought tolerance in arid environments keywords arid environment crop water productivity drought indices photosynthetic pigment relative water content membrane stability index vicia faba 1 introduction faba bean vicia faba l is one of the oldest and most important pulse crops grown in the mediterranean region for its use in human consumption and animal feed it is considered as an important source of protein due to its high crude protein content and certain essential amino acids kharrat and ouchari 2011 robinson et al 2019 vogelsang o dwyer et al 2020 faba bean is not only nutritionally important but also plays a critical role in reducing nitrogen n fertilizer inputs to agricultural production systems through symbiotic fixation of atmospheric n2 liu et al 2019 according to the fao estimate n fertilizer input has increased more than nine fold from 12 mt year to 110 mt year during 1961 2014 posing serious economic and environmental threats fao 2014 the inclusion of faba bean in the rotation can address these challenges by increasing soil productivity particularly in low input cropping systems jensen et al 2010 2012 aschi et al 2017 stagnari et al 2017 crews and peoples 2004 mentioned that the added n to the soil through symbiotic fixation by legumes is potentially more sustainable than the industrial synthetic n applied as inorganic fertilizers the reduced or no input of synthetic n fertilizer in faba bean and other legumes production systems has considerable economic and environmental benefits and ensures the sustainability of agricultural systems in areas where these crops are an integral part of the cropping systems the global population is increasing at an alarming rate necessitating the production of sufficient food and fibers with the challenges of changing consumption patterns and climate change giorgi 2006 chhogyel and kumar 2018 hussain et al 2019 ullah et al 2019 mediterranean region is identified as one of the most vulnerable regions to adverse impacts of climate change where an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation leading toward heat and drought stresses garcรญa ruiz et al 2011 cook et al 2016 mansour et al 2018a b heat and drought are the most frequent environmental abiotic stresses causing deleterious effects on field crops that supply most of the global food energy zhao et al 2017 li et al 2018 ray et al 2019 ullah et al 2019 faba bean is grown in the mediterranean region as a rotational crop and can symbiotically fix above 80 of its own n requirement under a range of environmental conditions denton et al 2017 but this crop is highly sensitive to water stress compared with other legumes parvin et al 2019 water stress results in the generation of reactive oxygen species ros in plant cells these ros damage photosynthetic pigments nucleic acids and membrane lipids as well as inhibit protein synthesis along with a loss of enzymes activity subsequently it leads to a severe reduction in number and size of leaves a decrease in shoot dry matter a smaller number of pods and reduced seed weight resulting in lower seed productivity sharma et al 2012 siddiqui et al 2015 desoky et al 2020 although faba bean is one of the most sensitive pulse crops to water stress its genotypes possess differential efficiency in producing acceptable yield under drought stress amede and schubert 2003 an enhancement in faba bean yield under drought stress could be achieved by improving its genetic background through the agro physiological screening of drought tolerant genotypes for inclusion in breeding programs aiming to develop new genotypes for water limited environments drought tolerance is a complex trait with low heritability therefore it is important to use physiological traits associated with seed yield to assist plant breeders in improving seed yield under water limited environments farooq et al 2009 alderfasi and alghamdi 2010 khan et al 2010 ammar et al 2015 utilizing physiological parameters in evaluating diverse genotypes under abiotic stress was found to be essential for studying the association between physiological processes and drought tolerance ribeiro et al 2019 mansour et al 2020 in this context several physiological parameters could be suitably used as indicators for identifying drought tolerant genotypes such as photosynthetic pigment net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate relative water content membrane stability index soluble sugar content proline content catalase activity peroxidase activity superoxide dismutase activity ascorbate peroxidase activity and hydrogen peroxide bohnert et al 2006 khan et al 2010 ammar et al 2015 although sufficient published literature is available dealing with various aspects of faba bean agronomy and ecological importance alteration and modification of different physiological processes in response to water stress is not well explored in the study region to evaluate some of these physiological parameters under water stress the present study was designed with the following specific objectives i to characterize agronomic and physiological responses of 14 diverse faba bean genotypes under various water stress levels ii to identify drought tolerant faba bean genotypes that could be used in arid mediterranean environments or utilized in breeding program for developing new drought tolerant faba bean genotypes and iii to determine the impact of water levels on yield and water productivity of genotypes with different genetic backgrounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and culture practices two field experiments were conducted at the designated site for faba bean cultivation at khattara research station sharqia egypt 30 36 57 n 31 46 58 e during 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 growing seasons physical and chemical properties of the soil at the depth of 0 60 cm were analyzed before sowing and presented in table s1 the soil is sandy throughout the profile 95 2 sand 3 4 silt and 1 4 clay with an alkaline ph 8 1 meteorological data mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures growing degree days and total precipitation maintained by the egyptian meteorological authority were collected for the two growing seasons and the past 36 years 1984 2019 from stations close to the experimental site and are presented in table s2 sowing dates in both seasons were in the first week of november within the optimal period for faba bean cultivation in the area standard agronomic practices including insect pest disease and weed control were followed as recommended for planting faba bean in the region the seeds were inoculated with the microbial symbiont rhizobium leguminosarum immediately before sowing phosphorus p and potassium k were applied before sowing at the rate of 75 kg p ha as superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 and 60 kg k ha as potassium sulfate 48 k2o nitrogen fertilizer was applied once as a basal dose during sowing at the rate of 45 kg n ha as ammonium sulfate 21 n starter n was applied becasue of the low n fixing capacity of legumes at early growth stages in the arid sandy soils of the study region and the starter n is needed to boost plant growth and ensure unifrom plant stands this is consistent with previous research that reported the benefits of the addition of starter n in improving nodulation and n2 fixation of legume crops under low fertility soils mรผller and pereira 1995 singh and usha 2003 gai et al 2017 youseif et al 2017 2 2 plant material and irrigation regimes fourteen local and exotic faba bean genotypes were grown during two growing seasons of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 table s3 the experimental design was a spilt plot in which irrigation levels were randomized in the main plots and genotypes were randomized in the sub plots in three replications each plot consisted of four rows 3 m long with a 0 70 m spacing between rows and 0 15 m between plants resulting in a seeding rate of 20 seeds m2 for an average plant population of 190 477 plants ha seasonal crop water use of faba bean ranges from 300 to 400 mm in the study region according to bahnas and bondok 2010 hegab et al 2014 fayed et al 2018 and mansour et al 2019 accordingly the genotypes were evaluated under three irrigation regimes well watered moderate drought and severe drought represented by 4000 3000 and 2000 m3 irrigation water ha respectively drought conditions were induced after seedling establishment to maturity irrigation water m3 ha amounts of the three irrigation regimes during different growth stages of faba bean are presented in table 1 drip irrigation system was used with drip laterals spaced 0 7 m apart and the space between emitters along the polyethylene pipelines was 0 3 m each irrigation sector had a valve and pressure gauge to maintain the operating pressure at 1 bar and emitter flow rate of 4 l hr a flow meter was used to measure the amount of targeted irrigation water at each irrigation level irrigation was applied once every week from seedling emergence to flowering twice every week from flowering to maturity and was terminated two weeks before harvest on mid of april in both growing seasons 2 3 determination of physio chemical constituents chlorophyll a and b were extracted from fresh leaf using pure acetone as outlined by fadeels 1962 leaf net photosynthetic rate pn and transpiration rate tr were assessed for photosynthetic parameters using a portable photosynthesis system lf6400xtr li cor usa the assessments were taken at 09 00 11 00 am from the second fully expanded leaf calculations of the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii psii fv fm were obtained using maxwell and johnson 2000 relative water content rwc was estimated according to barrs and weatherley 1962 fresh leaves were collected and weighed fresh weight fw then left soaked in water for three hours and their turgid weights tw were measured the samples were then dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h and weighed dw the rwc is determined as follows rwc fw dw tw dw 100 the membrane stability index msi was determined by taking 200 mg fresh leaf material in two sets in test tubes containing 10 cm3 of double distilled water one set was heated at 40 c for 30 min in water bath and the electrical conductivity of the solution was recorded on conductivity bridge c1 second set was boiled at 100 c on a boiling water bath for 10 min and conductivity was measured on conductivity bridge c2 msi was calculated according to rady 2011 using the formula msi 1 c 1 c 2 100 for nutrients determinations a weight of 0 2 g of dried leaves was digested with 96 h2so4 in the presence of h2o2 wolf 1982 and diluted with distilled water total n was determined using the micro kjeldahl method as outlined by chapman and pratt 1982 total p was determined calorimetrically using ascorbic acid method watanabe and olsen 1965 total k concentration was measured directly using flame photometer lachica et al 1973 contents of n p and k were calculated as percentage total soluble sugar content was estimated according to irigoyen et al 1992 the method of bates et al 1973 was used to determine proline accumulation in faba bean leaves hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was determined using the method of mukherjee and choudhuri 1983 the superoxide radical o2 content in faba bean leaves was determined as a580 g fresh weight according to kubis 2008 2 4 determination of antioxidant enzyme activities fresh leaf samples were collected in an icebox and were taken to the laboratory the leaves were cleaned by distilled water and wiped out of surface moisture a sample of 0 5 g of leaf was homogenized in ice cold 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 5 containing 0 5 mm edta using pre chilled mortar and pestle then the samples were moved to centrifuge tubes and were centrifuged at 4 c in beckman refrigerated centrifuge at 15000g for 15 min the supernatant was transferred to 30 ml tubes and referred to enzyme extract the enzyme extraction was carried out following the method as described by vitoria et al 2001 the concentration of catalase cat was determined by spectro photochemical analysis following chance and maehly 1955 ascorbate peroxidase apx as outlined by fielding and hall 1978 and peroxidase pox according to thomas et al 1982 superoxide dismutase sod was measured by recording the decrease in absorbance of superoxide nitroblue tetrazolium complex by the enzyme as described by sairam et al 2002 2 5 agronomic traits measurements days to flowering was recorded as number of days from sowing until 50 of the plants have at least one open flower in each plot days to physiological maturity was recorded as number of days from sowing until 50 of the plants have at least one pod losing its green pigmentation plant height was measured from ground level to the tip of uppermost leaf at physiological maturity from the average reading of 10 plants in each plot at the end of growing season two middle rows at each plot were harvested from a total area of 4 2 m2 and yield components number of pods plant number of seeds pod 100 seed weight seed yield and aboveground biomass were determined hundred seed weight was estimated from weight of three sets of 100 seeds 2 6 crop water productivity cwp crop water productivity kg m3 for seed yield cwps and biological yield cwpb were calculated as the ratio of seed yield or biological yield kg ha to crop evapotranspiration et mm as outlined by kijne et al 2003 pereira et al 2012 and fernรกndez et al 2020 cwp kg m 3 yield et crop evapotranspiration was calculated following the water balance equation james 1988 et i p cr d r s where i is the irrigation mm p is the precipitation mm cr is the capillary rise to the root zone mm d is the soil water drainage below the crop root zone mm r is the surface runoff mm and s is the soil moisture change at planting and harvest mm soil moisture content was measured by the oven drying method soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm soil depths from each plot before planting and at harvest to determine the initial and final soil moisture content respectively the values were converted to a volumetric basis by multiplying by depth of soil sample and bulk density surface runoff and drainage were neglected because of the use of drip irrigation system aydinsakir et al 2013 capillary rise was also considered negligible as the groundwater table is 10 m deep dong et al 2011 ram et al 2013 2 7 drought tolerance indices drought tolerance indices were used to differentiate drought tolerant genotypes from drought sensitive ones these indices were mainly based on the quantitative measurement of yield responses to non water stressed and water stressed conditions and were calculated as follows mean productivity mp y s y p 2 hossain et al 1990 geometric mean productivity gmp y s y p fernandez 1992 stress tolerance index sti y s y p y p 2 fernandez 1992 yield index yi y s y s gavuzzi et al 1997 yield stability index ysi y s y p bouslama and schapaugh 1984 where ys is the seed yield under water stress y p is the seed yield under non water stressed condition y s is the average seed yield of all genotypes under water stress and y p is the average seed yield of all genotypes under non water stressed condition 2 8 statistical analysis based on calculated drought tolerance indices hierarchical cluster analysis was constructed following the ward method ward 1963 to identify drought tolerant genotypes of faba bean following cluster analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed for split plot design differences among irrigation regimes faba bean genotypes and their interactions were separated by the least significant difference test at p 0 05 linear model and quadratic plateau regression model were applied between seed yield and irrigation water amount using graphpad prism version 5 00 graphpad inc san diego ca usa principal component analysis was performed on the averages of the measured physiological and agronomic traits to determine the relationships among them anova cluster and principal component analyses were performed using r statistical software version 3 6 1 3 results 3 1 genotypic classification according to drought tolerance five drought tolerance indices mp gmp sti yi and ysi were calculated based on seed yield of each genotype in response to severe drought and well watered conditions to identify tolerant and sensitive genotypes table 2 based on these indices the genotypes were classified into five groups using hierarchical clustering fig 1 group a comprised of one genotype with the highest observed seed yield and tolerance indices therefore it could be considered as highly tolerant genotype group b had six genotypes with high tolerance indices values hence they are considered as tolerant genotypes similarly group c is composed of two genotypes that had intermediate tolerance indices values and they are considered as moderate tolerant genotypes groups d and e included three and two genotypes with low and very low values of seed yield and tolerance indices and they are considered as sensitive and highly sensitive genotypes respectively 3 2 leaf photosynthetic pigment and gas exchange the combined anova for all evaluated traits indicated that the effects of irrigation regime genotype and their interaction were significant tables 3 5 drought stress significantly decreased the contents of leaf photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a and b gas exchange e g leaf net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate rwc msi and leaf nutrient status n p and k content in the evaluated genotypes compared with the well watered condition table 3 furthermore the reduction in these parameters was more pronounced in the severe compared with the moderate drought conditions on the other hand the drought tolerant genotypes groups a and b demonstrated significant increase in the abovementioned physiological parameters compared with the highly sensitive genotypes group e under moderate and severe drought conditions however the genotypes in group e exhibited a reduction in chlorophyll a chlorophyll b leaf net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate rwc and msi by 21 50 26 47 21 and 22 respectively compared with the drought tolerant genotype in group a under severe drought conditions likewise the aforementioned parameters decreased by 17 42 22 38 15 and 16 for the genotypes in group d compared with genotype in group a under severe drought conditions similarly these parameters decreased by 13 31 16 27 11 and 11 for the genotypes in group c compared with genotype in group a under severe drought conditions 3 3 osmoprotectants and enzymatic antioxidant activities the contents of osmoprotectants e g total soluble sugar and proline enzymatic antioxidant activities cat pox sod and apx and contents of h2o2 and o2 increased due to drought stress compared with the well watered condition table 4 however drought tolerant genotypes groups a and b resulted in the highest osmoprotectants content and enzymatic activity compared with the highly sensitive ones group e under moderate and severe drought stress in contrast the tolerant genotypes demonstrated minimum observed contents of h2o2 and o2 compared with the sensitive ones 3 4 agronomic performance a reduction in irrigation amount significantly decreased growth cycle seed yield and all contributing agronomic traits table 5 generally severe drought reduced seed yield and aboveground biomass by 29 and 31 respectively compared with the well watered condition table 5 the drought tolerant genotype in group a showed significant increase in seed yield 47 and aboveground biomass 32 followed by group b and group c compared with the highly sensitive ones in group e the evaluated genotypes presented considerable variation for seed yield and aboveground biomass under irrigation regimes ranged between 3036 and 6359 and 7101 and 14 520 kg ha respectively fig s2 the genotypes nubaria 2 nubaria 3 misr 1 sakha 3 giza 3 improved giza 843 and gza exhibited the highest seed yield contributing traits and aboveground biomass under different irrigation regimes 3 5 crop water productivity cwp drought stress increased cwp for seed yield cwps and aboveground biomass cwpb by 18 and 15 compared with the well watered condition respectively table 5 moreover cwps and cwpb varied among the evaluated genotypes and the highly drought tolerant genotype in group a showed a significant increase in cwps 50 and cwpb 31 compared with the sensitive ones in group e cwps ranged from 0 91 to 1 71 kg m3 while cwpb varied from 1 99 to 3 39 kg m3 table 6 generally the genotypes nubaria 2 nubaria 3 misr 1 sakha 3 giza 3 improved giza 843 and gza showed the highest values of cwps and cwpb compared with the others under different irrigation regimes table 6 3 6 seed yield response to irrigation regimes seed yield was plotted against irrigation regimes to describe their relationships by quadratic regression model fig 2 a strong straight line relationship was observed between irrigation amount and seed yield the drought tolerant genotypes groups a and b produced much greater seed yields with less irrigation amounts compared with the highly drought sensitive genotypes group e the groups a and b exhibited linear non diminishing responses whereas groups c d and e displayed quadratic convex response the optimum water amount for the groups presented quadratic response ranged from 3700 to 3900 m3 ha which produced seed yield ranged from 4500 to 5350 kg ha 3 7 interrelationship among evaluated traits the association between evaluated agronomic and physiological traits was estimated by principal components the first two principal components presented about 84 11 of variability 69 94 by pc1 and 14 17 by pc2 accordingly they were used to construct the biplot fig 3 the traits represented by parallel vectors or close to each other revealed a strong positive association and those located nearly opposite at 180 showed highly negative association while the vectors toward sides expressed weak relationship the evaluated traits in this study could be divided into three groups the first group comprised of all agronomic traits days to flowering days to maturity plant height number of pods plant number of seeds pod 100 seed weight seed yield and aboveground biomass in addition to content of chlorophyll a and b leaf net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate rwc msi and leaf nutrient status n p and k content the second group included cwps cwpb soluble sugar proline and antioxidant enzyme activities cat pox sod and apx the third group contained h2o2 and o2 a strong positive association was detected among traits included in each group furthermore a positive association was observed between second and third groups on the contrary a negative association was determined between first group on one side and second and third groups on the other side 4 discussion mediterranean region is considered as one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change cook et al 2016 drought is projected to become more severe frequent and longer due to climate change particularly in arid and semi arid environments as a result of increasing precipitation variability rajsekhar et al 2015 spinoni et al 2018 campozano et al 2020 this climate change induced drought stress would put the crop productivity at risk and consequently food security would be threatened faba bean is an important legume crop providing low cost protein for human consumption and animal feed as well as improves soil fertility by fixing atmospheric n2 etemadi et al 2019 however it is one of the sensitive crops to water deficit and its production is adversely impacted by drought stress manning et al 2020 but its genotypes display differential efficiency in producing acceptable seed yield under drought stress therefore assessing faba bean genotypes under different irrigation regimes is crucial for investigating their performances and identifying drought tolerant genotypes this will not only help in growing faba bean genotypes under limited water availability but will also provide fruitful insights for maximizing productivity and cwp of this important rotational crop ricciardi et al 2001 ammar et al 2015 mansour et al 2017 in the present study 14 diverse faba bean genotypes were evaluated under different irrigation regimes to investigate their agro physiological responses the results demonstrated that first response of faba bean plants to water stress was impaired physiological processes in terms of reduced photosynthesis transpiration rwc and msi table 3 most probably due to stomatal closure to reduce transpiration and water loss which might have influenced water movement from xylem to surrounding cells on the other hand the ros especially h2o2 and o2 increased table 4 under water stress the depletion of intercellular co2 concentration is facilitated by increasing gas diffusion barrier during the photosynthesis process consequently low co2 availability catalyses the oxygenation of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate thereby an increasing production of photo respiratory h2o2 occurs in cell peroxisomes noctor et al 2002 wang et al 2010 in this context chen et al 1991 and ahanger and agarwal 2017 documented significant impact of stress stimulated cellular membrane ion leakage on the biosynthesis of chlorophyll moreover dalal and tripathy 2012 reported a decrease in the biosynthesis of pigments and the functioning of pigment protein complex under drought stress furthermore it reduces the de novo biosynthesis of proteins and associated components of chlorophyll the harmful effects in the physiological processes induced by drought stress are translated in the form of remarkable reduction in plant growth and production table 5 moreover the results revealed highly significant variation among the evaluated genotypes in terms of both physiological and agronomic traits which provides evidence for the presence of substantial genetic variability in these genotypes consequently the genotypes were classified into five groups based on their drought tolerance ability highly tolerant tolerant moderate tolerant sensitive and highly sensitive genotypes fig 1 the tolerant genotypes groups a and b exhibited the highest physiological parameters seed yield agronomic contributing traits aboveground biomass and cwp compared with the sensitive ones tables 3 6 these genotypes showed ameliorative effect by raising photosynthetic efficiency photochemical efficiency of psii although negative effects of drought on chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics roach and krieger liszkay 2014 ahanger and agarwal 2017 were visible the psii activity is likely to prevent the formation of singlet oxygen and thus protects the structure of chloroplasts from the oxidative damage desoky et al 2020 maintaining the efficiency of psii function and the antioxidant system components has contributed along with the beneficial effects of the bioactive stimuli in the tolerant genotypes for positive performance tables 3 and 4 furthermore the elevated enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant activities i e cat pox sod apx and proline lead to scavenging of different ros ahanger and agarwal 2017 desoky et al 2019 which might have contributed in improving the drought tolerance of these genotypes as cat sod and apx remove free oxygen radicals o2 through ros dismutation process moreover cat dismantles the h2o2 produced as a result of o2 elimination in cytoplasm or in the ascorbate glutathione cycle by apx while apx plays a crucial role in scavenging of h2o2 in the chloroplast and cytosol thereby inhibiting its diffusion to other organelles for possible avoidance of any damage a series of redox reactions is involved in this cycle including the bioactive participation of ascorbate glutathione and nadph mittler 2002 this mechanism results in a reduction in the formation of more toxic hydroxyl oh radicals as reported by singh and prasad 2014 alzahrani and rady 2019 and rady et al 2019 the limited availability of water resources is a main challenge for sustainable crop productivity in arid and semi arid environments and the problem is further aggravated by the changing climate therefore high cwp of faba bean genotypes is necessary to save crop production principally in these environments the evaluated genotypes exhibited high cwps and cwpb under drought stress moderate and severe than the well watered conditions tables 5 and 6 furthermore the genotypes exhibited differential cwps and cwpb under the three irrigation regimes the genotypes nubaria 2 nubaria 3 misr 1 sakha 3 giza 3 improved giza 843 and gza exhibited maximum observed cwps and cwpb compared with the others under different irrigation regimes this result is in line with the genotypic classification according to their drought tolerance as these genotypes are classified as tolerant ones these drought tolerant genotypes used water more efficiently maintained tissue water status reduced water loss exhibited high cwp and produced stable seed yield under different irrigation regimes the current findings are in close agreement with oweis et al 2005 and alghamdi et al 2015 alghamdi et al 2015 conducted a pot experiment to evaluate 20 faba bean genotypes on physiological and molecular basis and observed a high level of heterogeneity among the evaluated genotypes in response to water stress which could be used in breeding program to assemble different drought tolerant traits in a single genotype to cope with water scarcity the evaluated faba bean genotypes have diverse genetic backgrounds therefore they exhibited different seed yield responses to the irrigation regimes higher seed yield of drought tolerant genotypes could be attributed to a collective better response of yield contributing characters under water stress furthermore the genotypes with linear non diminishing response groups a and b can be grown in favorable environments with irrigation water input of more than 4000 m3 ha moreover their response equations obviously revealed to high cwp as they recorded the highest constant compared with the other groups these results are in line with the values of estimated cwps as these genotypes demonstrated the highest values of cwps therefore the use of these tolerant genotypes can assist in improving water productivity and consequently mitigating negative impacts of water stress in addition these genotypes can be used in faba bean breeding programs to further enhance drought tolerance on the other hand the level of 4000 m3 ha could be considered as the highest irrigation amount for groups c d and e which exhibited quadratic response and any increase in irrigation amount would not add any substantial increase in their seed yields the optimum irrigation amount identified for these groups was ranged between 3700 and 3900 m3 ha the present results are in close agreement with other published literature where a diverse response was observed among different faba bean genotypes when they were subjected to varied levels of water stress ricciardi et al 2001 oweis et al 2005 ammar et al 2015 understanding the interrelationships between agronomic and physiological traits can provide useful information for screening faba bean genotypes and breeding programs biplot of principal components is considered as an appropriate statistical approach for visualizing the interrelationships among traits which is determined by angle size of traits vectors fig 3 the results showed that agronomic traits were positively associated with photosynthetic pigment leaf net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate leaf nutrient status n p and k content rwc and msi accordingly high values of these parameters showed better performance in terms of yield contributing characters and seed yield on the other hand agronomic traits had lower association with proline soluble sugar content and antioxidant enzyme activities while negative association with h2o2 and o2 5 conclusion drought stress significantly reduced photosynthetic pigment net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate rwc and msi which ultimately lead to a reduction in seed yield and poor performance of yield contributing characters the evaluated faba bean genotypes possess a distinct genetic diversity which was reflected in their differential responses to water stress the genotypes nubaria 2 nubaria 3 misr 1 sakha 3 giza 3 improved giza 843 and gza were classified as drought tolerant genotypes for their better seed yields cwps and cwpb as well as overall better performance under different water stress levels the drought tolerant genotypes were less affected by water stress possibly because of preserving cell osmotic potential and cell turgor maintaining tissue water potential adjusting gas exchange developing more efficient enzymatic activity assisting in movement of water into the cells and consequently an increase in chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate therefore these genotypes could be recommended for better seed yields and high cwp especially in water limited environments results of the present research indicated that these genotypes could be exploited in breeding programs for further improving drought tolerance certain physiological parameters exhibited highly positive association with seed yield and yield contributing traits these parameters are photosynthetic pigment net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate leaf nutrient status n p and k content rwc and msi it is possible to use these parameters as rapid indicators for screening faba bean genotypes for drought tolerance in breeding programs credit authorship contribution statement elsayed mansour conceptualization investigation

different genetic backgrounds to various levels of water stress in an arid environment and ii identify the most drought tolerant genotypes that maximize the marginal use of unit water without significant yield loss field experiments were conducted for two consecutive growing seasons in an arid mediterranean climate and several agronomic and physiological measurements of different faba bean genotypes in response to water stress were recorded a great variation among the tested genotypes according to several drought response indices was observed as a result of water stress on the basis of which they were classified into five groups a e ranging from drought tolerant to highly sensitive genotypes yield and water productivity results indicated that drought tolerant genotypes produced more yield with less water compared with drought sensitive genotypes and thus are highly recommended for faba bean production in water limited environments certain physiological parameters such as photosynthetic pigment net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate leaf nutrient status n p and k content relative water content and membrane stability index exhibited highly positive association with seed yield and yield contributing traits it is valid to use these parameters as rapid indicators of drought tolerance in breeding programs aiming to screen and improve faba bean genotypes for drought tolerance in arid environments keywords arid environment crop water productivity drought indices photosynthetic pigment relative water content membrane stability index vicia faba 1 introduction faba bean vicia faba l is one of the oldest and most important pulse crops grown in the mediterranean region for its use in human consumption and animal feed it is considered as an important source of protein due to its high crude protein content and certain essential amino acids kharrat and ouchari 2011 robinson et al 2019 vogelsang o dwyer et al 2020 faba bean is not only nutritionally important but also plays a critical role in reducing nitrogen n fertilizer inputs to agricultural production systems through symbiotic fixation of atmospheric n2 liu et al 2019 according to the fao estimate n fertilizer input has increased more than nine fold from 12 mt year to 110 mt year during 1961 2014 posing serious economic and environmental threats fao 2014 the inclusion of faba bean in the rotation can address these challenges by increasing soil productivity particularly in low input cropping systems jensen et al 2010 2012 aschi et al 2017 stagnari et al 2017 crews and peoples 2004 mentioned that the added n to the soil through symbiotic fixation by legumes is potentially more sustainable than the industrial synthetic n applied as inorganic fertilizers the reduced or no input of synthetic n fertilizer in faba bean and other legumes production systems has considerable economic and environmental benefits and ensures the sustainability of agricultural systems in areas where these crops are an integral part of the cropping systems the global population is increasing at an alarming rate necessitating the production of sufficient food and fibers with the challenges of changing consumption patterns and climate change giorgi 2006 chhogyel and kumar 2018 hussain et al 2019 ullah et al 2019 mediterranean region is identified as one of the most vulnerable regions to adverse impacts of climate change where an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation leading toward heat and drought stresses garcรญa ruiz et al 2011 cook et al 2016 mansour et al 2018a b heat and drought are the most frequent environmental abiotic stresses causing deleterious effects on field crops that supply most of the global food energy zhao et al 2017 li et al 2018 ray et al 2019 ullah et al 2019 faba bean is grown in the mediterranean region as a rotational crop and can symbiotically fix above 80 of its own n requirement under a range of environmental conditions denton et al 2017 but this crop is highly sensitive to water stress compared with other legumes parvin et al 2019 water stress results in the generation of reactive oxygen species ros in plant cells these ros damage photosynthetic pigments nucleic acids and membrane lipids as well as inhibit protein synthesis along with a loss of enzymes activity subsequently it leads to a severe reduction in number and size of leaves a decrease in shoot dry matter a smaller number of pods and reduced seed weight resulting in lower seed productivity sharma et al 2012 siddiqui et al 2015 desoky et al 2020 although faba bean is one of the most sensitive pulse crops to water stress its genotypes possess differential efficiency in producing acceptable yield under drought stress amede and schubert 2003 an enhancement in faba bean yield under drought stress could be achieved by improving its genetic background through the agro physiological screening of drought tolerant genotypes for inclusion in breeding programs aiming to develop new genotypes for water limited environments drought tolerance is a complex trait with low heritability therefore it is important to use physiological traits associated with seed yield to assist plant breeders in improving seed yield under water limited environments farooq et al 2009 alderfasi and alghamdi 2010 khan et al 2010 ammar et al 2015 utilizing physiological parameters in evaluating diverse genotypes under abiotic stress was found to be essential for studying the association between physiological processes and drought tolerance ribeiro et al 2019 mansour et al 2020 in this context several physiological parameters could be suitably used as indicators for identifying drought tolerant genotypes such as photosynthetic pigment net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate relative water content membrane stability index soluble sugar content proline content catalase activity peroxidase activity superoxide dismutase activity ascorbate peroxidase activity and hydrogen peroxide bohnert et al 2006 khan et al 2010 ammar et al 2015 although sufficient published literature is available dealing with various aspects of faba bean agronomy and ecological importance alteration and modification of different physiological processes in response to water stress is not well explored in the study region to evaluate some of these physiological parameters under water stress the present study was designed with the following specific objectives i to characterize agronomic and physiological responses of 14 diverse faba bean genotypes under various water stress levels ii to identify drought tolerant faba bean genotypes that could be used in arid mediterranean environments or utilized in breeding program for developing new drought tolerant faba bean genotypes and iii to determine the impact of water levels on yield and water productivity of genotypes with different genetic backgrounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and culture practices two field experiments were conducted at the designated site for faba bean cultivation at khattara research station sharqia egypt 30 36 57 n 31 46 58 e during 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 growing seasons physical and chemical properties of the soil at the depth of 0 60 cm were analyzed before sowing and presented in table s1 the soil is sandy throughout the profile 95 2 sand 3 4 silt and 1 4 clay with an alkaline ph 8 1 meteorological data mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures growing degree days and total precipitation maintained by the egyptian meteorological authority were collected for the two growing seasons and the past 36 years 1984 2019 from stations close to the experimental site and are presented in table s2 sowing dates in both seasons were in the first week of november within the optimal period for faba bean cultivation in the area standard agronomic practices including insect pest disease and weed control were followed as recommended for planting faba bean in the region the seeds were inoculated with the microbial symbiont rhizobium leguminosarum immediately before sowing phosphorus p and potassium k were applied before sowing at the rate of 75 kg p ha as superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 and 60 kg k ha as potassium sulfate 48 k2o nitrogen fertilizer was applied once as a basal dose during sowing at the rate of 45 kg n ha as ammonium sulfate 21 n starter n was applied becasue of the low n fixing capacity of legumes at early growth stages in the arid sandy soils of the study region and the starter n is needed to boost plant growth and ensure unifrom plant stands this is consistent with previous research that reported the benefits of the addition of starter n in improving nodulation and n2 fixation of legume crops under low fertility soils mรผller and pereira 1995 singh and usha 2003 gai et al 2017 youseif et al 2017 2 2 plant material and irrigation regimes fourteen local and exotic faba bean genotypes were grown during two growing seasons of 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 table s3 the experimental design was a spilt plot in which irrigation levels were randomized in the main plots and genotypes were randomized in the sub plots in three replications each plot consisted of four rows 3 m long with a 0 70 m spacing between rows and 0 15 m between plants resulting in a seeding rate of 20 seeds m2 for an average plant population of 190 477 plants ha seasonal crop water use of faba bean ranges from 300 to 400 mm in the study region according to bahnas and bondok 2010 hegab et al 2014 fayed et al 2018 and mansour et al 2019 accordingly the genotypes were evaluated under three irrigation regimes well watered moderate drought and severe drought represented by 4000 3000 and 2000 m3 irrigation water ha respectively drought conditions were induced after seedling establishment to maturity irrigation water m3 ha amounts of the three irrigation regimes during different growth stages of faba bean are presented in table 1 drip irrigation system was used with drip laterals spaced 0 7 m apart and the space between emitters along the polyethylene pipelines was 0 3 m each irrigation sector had a valve and pressure gauge to maintain the operating pressure at 1 bar and emitter flow rate of 4 l hr a flow meter was used to measure the amount of targeted irrigation water at each irrigation level irrigation was applied once every week from seedling emergence to flowering twice every week from flowering to maturity and was terminated two weeks before harvest on mid of april in both growing seasons 2 3 determination of physio chemical constituents chlorophyll a and b were extracted from fresh leaf using pure acetone as outlined by fadeels 1962 leaf net photosynthetic rate pn and

at 80 c for 24 h and weighed dw the rwc is determined as follows rwc fw dw tw dw 100 the membrane stability index msi was determined by taking 200 mg fresh leaf material in two sets in test tubes containing 10 cm3 of double distilled water one set was heated at 40 c for 30 min in water bath and the electrical conductivity of the solution was recorded on conductivity bridge c1 second set was boiled at 100 c on a boiling water bath for 10 min and conductivity was measured on conductivity bridge c2 msi was calculated according to rady 2011 using the formula msi 1 c 1 c 2 100 for nutrients determinations a weight of 0 2 g of dried leaves was digested with 96 h2so4 in the presence of h2o2 wolf 1982 and diluted with distilled water total n was determined using the micro kjeldahl method as outlined by chapman and pratt 1982 total p was determined calorimetrically using ascorbic acid method watanabe and olsen 1965 total k concentration was measured directly using flame photometer lachica et al 1973 contents of n p and k were calculated as percentage total soluble sugar content was estimated according to irigoyen et al 1992 the method of bates et al 1973 was used to determine proline accumulation in faba bean leaves hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was determined using the method of mukherjee and choudhuri 1983 the superoxide radical o2 content in faba bean leaves was determined as a580 g fresh weight according to kubis 2008 2 4 determination of antioxidant enzyme activities fresh leaf samples were collected in an icebox and were taken to the laboratory the leaves were cleaned by distilled water and wiped out of surface moisture a sample of 0 5 g of leaf was homogenized in ice cold 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 5 containing 0 5 mm edta using pre chilled mortar and pestle then the samples were moved to centrifuge tubes and were centrifuged at 4 c in beckman refrigerated centrifuge at 15000g for 15 min the supernatant was transferred to 30 ml tubes and referred to enzyme extract the enzyme extraction was carried out following the method as described by vitoria et al 2001 the concentration of catalase cat was determined by spectro photochemical analysis following chance and maehly 1955 ascorbate peroxidase apx as outlined by fielding and hall 1978 and peroxidase pox according to thomas et al 1982 superoxide dismutase sod was measured by recording the decrease in absorbance of superoxide nitroblue tetrazolium complex by the enzyme as described by sairam et al 2002 2 5 agronomic traits measurements days to flowering was recorded as number of days from sowing until 50 of the plants have at least one open flower in each plot days to physiological maturity was recorded as number of days from sowing until 50 of the plants have at least one pod losing its green pigmentation plant height was measured from ground level to the tip of uppermost leaf at physiological maturity from the average reading of 10 plants in each plot at the end of growing season two middle rows at each plot were harvested from a total area of 4 2 m2 and yield components number of pods plant number of seeds pod 100 seed weight seed yield and aboveground biomass were determined hundred seed weight was estimated from weight of three sets of 100 seeds 2 6 crop water productivity cwp crop water productivity kg m3 for seed yield cwps and biological yield cwpb were calculated as the ratio of seed yield or biological yield kg ha to crop evapotranspiration et mm as outlined by kijne et al 2003 pereira et al 2012 and fernรกndez et al 2020 cwp kg m 3 yield et crop evapotranspiration was calculated following the water balance equation james 1988 et i p cr d r s where i is the irrigation mm p is the precipitation mm cr is the capillary rise to the root zone mm d is the soil water drainage below the crop root zone mm r is the surface runoff mm and s is the soil moisture change at planting and harvest mm soil moisture content was measured by the oven drying method soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm soil depths from each plot before planting and at harvest to determine the initial and final soil moisture content respectively the values were converted to a volumetric basis by multiplying by depth of soil sample and bulk density surface runoff and drainage were neglected because of the use of drip irrigation system aydinsakir et al 2013 capillary rise was also considered negligible as the groundwater table is 10 m deep dong et al 2011 ram et al 2013 2 7 drought tolerance indices drought tolerance indices were used to differentiate drought tolerant genotypes from drought sensitive ones these indices were mainly based on the quantitative measurement of yield responses to non water stressed and water stressed conditions and were calculated as follows mean productivity mp y s y p 2 hossain et al 1990 geometric mean productivity gmp y s y p fernandez 1992 stress tolerance index sti y s y p y p 2 fernandez 1992 yield index yi y s y s gavuzzi et al 1997 yield stability index ysi y s y p bouslama and schapaugh 1984 where ys is the seed yield under water stress y p is the seed yield under non water stressed condition y s is the average seed yield of all genotypes under water stress and y p is the average seed yield of all genotypes under non water stressed condition 2 8 statistical analysis based on calculated drought tolerance indices hierarchical cluster analysis was constructed following the ward method ward 1963 to identify drought tolerant genotypes of faba bean following cluster analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed for split plot design differences among irrigation regimes faba bean genotypes and their interactions were separated by the least significant difference test at p 0 05 linear model and quadratic plateau regression model were applied between seed yield and irrigation water amount using graphpad prism version 5 00 graphpad inc san diego ca usa principal component analysis was performed on the averages of the measured physiological and agronomic traits to determine the relationships among them anova cluster and principal component analyses were performed using r statistical software version 3 6 1 3 results 3 1 genotypic classification according to drought tolerance five drought tolerance indices mp gmp sti yi and ysi were calculated based on seed yield of each genotype in response to severe drought and well watered conditions to identify tolerant and sensitive genotypes table 2 based on these indices the genotypes were classified into five groups using hierarchical clustering fig 1 group a comprised of one genotype with the highest observed seed yield and tolerance indices therefore it could be considered as highly tolerant genotype group b had six genotypes with high tolerance indices values hence they are considered as tolerant genotypes similarly group c is composed of two genotypes that had intermediate tolerance indices values and they are considered as moderate tolerant genotypes groups d and e included three and two genotypes with low and very low values of seed yield and tolerance indices and they are considered as sensitive and highly sensitive genotypes respectively 3 2 leaf photosynthetic pigment and gas exchange the combined anova for all evaluated traits indicated that the effects of irrigation regime genotype and their interaction were significant tables 3 5 drought stress significantly decreased the contents of leaf photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a and b gas exchange e g leaf net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate rwc msi and leaf nutrient status n p and k content in the evaluated genotypes compared with the well watered condition table 3 furthermore the reduction in these parameters was more pronounced in the severe compared with the moderate drought conditions on the other hand the drought tolerant genotypes groups a and b demonstrated significant increase in the abovementioned physiological parameters compared with the highly sensitive genotypes group e under moderate and severe drought conditions however the genotypes in group e exhibited a reduction in chlorophyll a chlorophyll b leaf net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate rwc and msi by 21 50 26 47 21 and 22 respectively compared with the drought tolerant genotype in group a under severe drought conditions likewise the aforementioned parameters decreased by 17 42 22 38 15 and 16 for the genotypes in group d compared with genotype in group a under severe drought conditions similarly these parameters decreased by 13 31 16 27 11 and 11 for the genotypes in group c compared with genotype in group a under severe drought conditions 3 3 osmoprotectants and enzymatic antioxidant activities the contents of osmoprotectants e g total soluble sugar and proline enzymatic antioxidant activities cat pox sod and apx and contents of h2o2 and o2 increased due to drought stress compared with the well watered condition table 4 however drought tolerant genotypes groups a and b resulted in the highest osmoprotectants content and enzymatic activity compared with the highly sensitive ones group e under moderate and severe drought stress in contrast the tolerant genotypes demonstrated minimum observed contents of h2o2 and o2 compared with the sensitive ones 3 4 agronomic performance a reduction in irrigation amount significantly decreased growth cycle seed yield and all contributing agronomic traits table 5 generally severe drought reduced seed yield and aboveground biomass by 29 and 31 respectively compared with the well watered condition table 5 the drought tolerant genotype in group a showed significant increase in seed yield 47 and aboveground biomass 32 followed by group b and group c compared with the highly sensitive ones in group e the evaluated genotypes presented considerable variation for seed yield and aboveground biomass under irrigation regimes ranged between 3036 and 6359 and 7101 and 14 520 kg ha respectively fig s2 the genotypes nubaria 2 nubaria 3 misr 1 sakha 3 giza 3 improved giza 843 and gza exhibited the highest seed yield contributing traits and aboveground biomass under different irrigation regimes 3 5 crop water productivity cwp drought stress increased cwp for seed yield cwps and aboveground biomass cwpb by 18 and 15 compared with the well watered condition respectively table 5 moreover cwps and cwpb varied among the evaluated genotypes and the highly drought tolerant genotype in group a showed a significant increase in cwps 50 and cwpb 31 compared with the sensitive ones in group e cwps ranged from 0 91 to 1 71 kg m3 while cwpb varied from 1 99 to 3 39 kg m3 table 6 generally the genotypes nubaria 2 nubaria 3 misr 1 sakha 3 giza 3 improved giza 843 and gza showed the highest values of cwps and cwpb compared with the others under different irrigation regimes table 6 3 6 seed yield response to irrigation regimes seed yield was plotted against irrigation regimes to describe their relationships by quadratic regression model fig 2 a strong straight line relationship was observed between irrigation amount and seed yield the drought tolerant genotypes groups a and b produced much greater seed yields with less irrigation amounts compared with the highly drought sensitive genotypes group e the groups a and b exhibited linear non diminishing responses whereas groups c d and e displayed quadratic convex response the optimum water amount for the groups presented quadratic response ranged from 3700 to 3900 m3 ha which produced seed yield ranged from 4500 to 5350 kg ha 3 7 interrelationship among evaluated traits the association between evaluated agronomic and physiological traits was estimated by principal components the first two principal components presented about 84 11 of variability 69 94 by pc1 and 14 17 by pc2 accordingly they were used to construct the biplot fig 3 the traits represented by parallel vectors or close to each other revealed a strong positive association and those located nearly opposite at 180 showed highly negative association while the vectors toward sides expressed weak relationship the evaluated traits in this study could be divided into three groups the first group comprised of all agronomic traits days to flowering days to maturity plant height number of pods plant number of seeds pod 100 seed weight seed yield and aboveground biomass in addition to content of chlorophyll a and b leaf net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate rwc msi and leaf nutrient status n p and k content the second group included cwps cwpb soluble sugar proline and antioxidant enzyme activities cat pox sod and apx the third group contained h2o2 and o2 a strong positive association was detected among traits included in each group furthermore a positive association was observed between second and third groups on the contrary a negative association was determined between first group on one side and second and third groups on the other side 4 discussion mediterranean region is considered as one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change cook et al 2016 drought is projected to become more severe frequent and longer due to climate change particularly in arid and semi arid environments as a result of increasing precipitation variability rajsekhar et al 2015 spinoni et al 2018 campozano et al 2020 this climate change induced drought stress would put the crop productivity at risk and consequently food security would be threatened faba bean is an important legume crop providing low cost protein for human consumption and animal feed as well as improves soil fertility by fixing atmospheric n2 etemadi et al 2019 however it is one of the sensitive crops to water deficit and its production is adversely impacted by drought stress manning et al 2020 but its genotypes display differential efficiency in producing acceptable seed yield under drought stress therefore assessing faba bean genotypes under different irrigation regimes is crucial for investigating their performances and identifying drought tolerant genotypes this will not only help in growing faba bean genotypes under limited water availability but will also provide fruitful insights for maximizing productivity and cwp of this important rotational crop ricciardi et al 2001 ammar et al 2015 mansour et al 2017 in the present study 14 diverse faba bean genotypes were evaluated under different irrigation regimes to investigate their agro physiological responses the results demonstrated that first response of faba bean plants to water stress was impaired physiological processes in terms of reduced photosynthesis transpiration rwc and msi table 3 most probably due to stomatal closure to reduce transpiration and water loss which might have influenced water movement from xylem to surrounding cells on the other hand the ros especially h2o2 and o2 increased table 4 under water stress the depletion of intercellular co2 concentration is facilitated by increasing gas diffusion barrier during the photosynthesis process consequently low co2 availability catalyses the oxygenation of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate thereby an increasing production of photo respiratory h2o2 occurs in cell peroxisomes noctor et al 2002 wang et al 2010 in this context chen et al 1991 and ahanger and agarwal 2017 documented significant impact of stress stimulated cellular membrane ion leakage on the biosynthesis of chlorophyll moreover dalal and tripathy 2012 reported a decrease in the biosynthesis of pigments and the functioning of pigment protein complex under drought stress furthermore it reduces the de novo biosynthesis of proteins and associated components of chlorophyll the harmful effects in the physiological processes induced by drought stress are translated in the form of remarkable reduction in plant growth and production table 5 moreover the results revealed highly significant variation among the evaluated genotypes in terms of both physiological and agronomic traits which provides evidence for the presence of substantial genetic variability in these genotypes consequently the genotypes were classified into five groups based on their drought tolerance ability highly tolerant tolerant moderate tolerant sensitive and highly sensitive genotypes fig 1 the tolerant genotypes groups a and b exhibited the highest physiological parameters seed yield agronomic contributing traits aboveground biomass and cwp compared with the sensitive ones tables 3 6 these genotypes showed ameliorative effect by raising photosynthetic efficiency photochemical efficiency of psii although negative effects of drought on chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics roach and krieger liszkay 2014 ahanger and agarwal 2017 were visible the psii activity is likely to prevent the formation of singlet oxygen and thus protects the structure of chloroplasts from the oxidative damage desoky et al 2020 maintaining the efficiency of psii function and the antioxidant system components has contributed along with the beneficial effects of the bioactive stimuli in the tolerant genotypes for positive performance tables 3 and 4 furthermore the elevated enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant activities i e cat pox sod apx and proline lead to scavenging of different ros ahanger and agarwal 2017 desoky et al 2019 which might have contributed in improving the drought tolerance of these genotypes as cat sod and apx remove free oxygen radicals o2 through ros dismutation process moreover cat dismantles the h2o2 produced as a result of o2 elimination in cytoplasm or in the ascorbate glutathione cycle by apx while apx plays a crucial role in scavenging of h2o2 in the chloroplast and cytosol thereby inhibiting its diffusion to other organelles for possible avoidance of any damage a series of redox reactions is involved in this cycle including the bioactive participation of ascorbate glutathione and nadph mittler 2002 this mechanism results in a reduction in the formation of more toxic hydroxyl oh radicals as reported by singh and prasad 2014 alzahrani and rady 2019 and rady et al 2019 the limited availability of water resources is a main challenge for sustainable crop productivity in arid and semi arid environments and the problem is further aggravated by the changing climate therefore high cwp of faba bean genotypes is necessary to save crop production principally in these environments the evaluated genotypes exhibited high cwps and cwpb under drought stress moderate and severe than the well watered conditions tables 5 and 6 furthermore the genotypes exhibited differential cwps and cwpb under the three irrigation regimes the genotypes nubaria 2 nubaria 3 misr 1 sakha 3 giza 3 improved giza 843 and gza exhibited maximum observed cwps and cwpb compared with the others under different irrigation regimes this result is in line with the genotypic classification according to their drought tolerance as these genotypes are classified as tolerant ones these drought tolerant genotypes used water more efficiently maintained tissue water status reduced water loss exhibited high cwp and produced stable seed yield under different irrigation regimes the current findings are in close agreement with oweis et al 2005 and alghamdi et al 2015 alghamdi et al 2015 conducted a pot experiment to evaluate 20 faba bean genotypes on physiological and molecular basis and observed a high level of heterogeneity among the evaluated genotypes in response to water stress which could be used in breeding program to assemble different drought tolerant traits in a single genotype to cope with water scarcity the evaluated faba bean genotypes have diverse genetic backgrounds therefore they exhibited different seed yield responses to the irrigation regimes higher seed yield of drought tolerant genotypes could be attributed to a collective better response of yield contributing characters under water stress furthermore the genotypes with linear non diminishing response groups a and b can be grown in favorable environments with irrigation water input of more than 4000 m3 ha moreover their response equations obviously revealed to high cwp as they recorded the highest constant compared with the other groups these results are in line with the values of estimated cwps as these genotypes demonstrated the highest values of cwps therefore the use of these tolerant genotypes can assist in improving water productivity and consequently mitigating negative impacts of water stress in addition these genotypes can be used in faba bean breeding programs to further enhance drought tolerance on the other hand the level of 4000 m3 ha could be considered as the highest irrigation amount for groups c d and e which exhibited quadratic response and any increase in irrigation amount would not add any substantial increase in their seed yields the optimum irrigation amount identified for these groups was ranged between 3700 and 3900 m3 ha the present results are in close agreement with other published literature where a diverse response was observed among different faba bean genotypes when they were subjected to varied levels of water stress ricciardi et al 2001 oweis et al 2005 ammar et al 2015 understanding the interrelationships between agronomic and physiological traits can provide useful information for screening faba bean genotypes and breeding programs biplot of principal components is considered as an appropriate statistical approach for visualizing the interrelationships among traits which is determined by angle size of traits vectors fig 3 the results showed that agronomic traits were positively associated with photosynthetic pigment leaf net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate leaf nutrient status n p and k content rwc and msi accordingly high values of these parameters showed better performance in terms of yield contributing characters and seed yield on the other hand agronomic traits had lower association with proline soluble sugar content and antioxidant enzyme activities while negative association with h2o2 and o2 5 conclusion drought stress significantly reduced photosynthetic pigment net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate rwc and msi which ultimately lead to a reduction in seed yield and poor performance of yield contributing characters the evaluated faba bean genotypes possess a distinct genetic diversity which was reflected in their differential responses to water stress the genotypes nubaria 2 nubaria 3 misr 1 sakha 3 giza 3 improved giza 843 and gza were classified as drought tolerant genotypes for their better seed yields cwps and cwpb as well as overall better performance under different water stress levels the drought tolerant genotypes were less affected by water stress possibly because of preserving cell osmotic potential and cell turgor maintaining tissue water potential adjusting gas exchange developing more efficient enzymatic activity assisting in movement of water into the cells and consequently an increase in chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate therefore these genotypes could be recommended for better seed yields and high cwp especially in water limited environments results of the present research indicated that these genotypes could be exploited in breeding programs for further improving drought tolerance certain physiological parameters exhibited highly positive association with seed yield and yield contributing traits these parameters are photosynthetic pigment net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate leaf nutrient status n p and k content rwc and msi it is possible to use these parameters as rapid indicators for screening faba bean genotypes for drought tolerance in breeding programs credit authorship contribution statement elsayed mansour conceptualization investigation
