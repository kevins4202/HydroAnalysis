9665,rainfall adapted irrigation rai or supplementary irrigation for rain fed rice cultivation consumes less amount of irrigation water by harvesting rainfall and thus is vital for sustainable rice oryza sativa l production in multi rain areas including the jianghan plain in china however nitrogen management strategies influence rice growth and water and nitrogen utilization under rai remains unclear thus we conducted a two year 2016 and 2017 field experiment at jingzhou city central china to investigate the effects of nitrogen management strategies on grain yield crop water productivity cwp and nitrogen use efficiency nue of rice under conventional flooding irrigation cf and rai the nitrogen management strategies included local farmers nitrogen fertilization cn common urea 30 nitrogen blended with controlled release nitrogen fertilizer 70 nitrogen u crf and optimized nitrogen fertilization on at a nitrogen rate of 180 180 and 150 kg ha 1 respectively compared to the cf condition rai down regulated the numbers of irrigation 3 in 2016 and 4 in 2017 and reduced the total amount of irrigation water 41 6 in 2016 and 45 6 in 2017 suggesting that rainfall adapted irrigation enhanced the rainwater storage capacity and usage rai also increased root length root and shoot biomass net photosynthetic rate crop growth rate nitrogen accumulation percentage of productive tillers harvest index and nitrogen harvest index the u crf and on increased or maintained these parameters compared with the cn compared to the traditional irrigation and nitrogen fertilization pattern cf interacted with cn rai combined with u crf or on enhanced root length and root biomass and had a relatively high spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000

staple food in the world especially in asia china has the largest rice planting area and the greatest rice production in the world moa 2012 rice is also a greatest consumer for freshwater resources in china accounting for approximately 45 50 of the total water consumption in the country cai and chen 2000 moreover submerged cultivation of rice production in the traditional manner is conducted with a large amount of irrigation water and thus leading to low crop water productivity cwp this also induces environmental issues including methane ch4 emissions nitrogen and phosphorus losses from paddy fields yan et al 2005 xu et al 2020 ishfaq et al 2020 recently climate changes and social development have increased the consumption of freshwater in form of irrigation drainage and other non agricultural usages and therefore aggravated shortage of freshwater li and li 2010 this is urging researchers to devote novel irrigation technologies to improve cwp for sustainable agricultural development morison et al 2008 yao et al 2012 nowadays there are four popular rice ecosystems e g upland 11 deep water 4 rain fed 31 and irrigated 54 systems chen and zhu 2003 suggesting that rain fed and irrigated rice systems are the two main rice ecosystems in the world several water efficient management strategies including semi dry cultivation intermittent irrigation controlled irrigation no flooded mulching cultivation alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd and rainfall adapted irrigation rai or supplementary irrigation for rain fed rice cultivation have been implemented to counter the water scarcity and improve cwp belder et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 shao et al 2015 cao et al 2020 among the various irrigation methods awd exhibits the widely benefits including rises famer income lampayan et al 2015 reduces ch4 emission yan et al 2005 tarlera et al 2016 and alleviates the pest attack and disease damage zhuang et al 2019 an earlier study illustrated that a safe awd regime soil water potential at root depth above 20 kpa or 15 cm in water depth threshold below the soil surface can obtain a relatively high rice yield carrijo et al 2017 rai is a further development of awd where rainfall is maximum harvested to reduce unnecessary drainage during the rainy season and the paddy fields remain unsubmerged unless the cracks appear in the soil surface so that soil wetting and drying occurs alternatively throughout the rice growing season shao et al 2010 it has been shown that rai can not only maintain rice yield but also reduce environmental pollution and the irrigation cost in comparison with conventional flood irrigation cf qiao et al 2011 shao et al 2015 qi et al 2020a thus rai has been widely practiced in multi rain regions besides irrigation water nitrogen is substantially required for intensive rice production spiertz 2010 in the past years due to the increased consumption of fossil fuels the cost of nitrogen fertilizer has been on a rising trajectory moreover although the application of nitrogen fertilizer plays an vital role in improving rice yield its over and or unscientific use not only results in low nitrogen use efficiency nue but also causes detrimental effects on environment including soil degradation surface groundwater contamination and ammonia nh3 and ch4 emission ju et al 2009 peng et al 2009 to overcome these issues and increase farmer income several nitrogen efficient management strategies including balanced application of nitrogen fertilizer optimized and reduced nitrogen management mixed with nitrification urease inhibitors or organic fertilizers and adopt of controlled release fertilizers have been widely implemented jat et al 2012 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 qi et al 2020a among them the application of controlled release nitrogen fertilizer crf exhibits benefit to improve the nue and minimize the side effects on natural environment due to the reduced nitrogen loss by slowly releasing nitrogen nutrient from the coated fertilizer compared with the conventional nitrogen fertilizer application yang et al 2013 sun et al 2019 qi et al 2020a however some researchers shown that applying crf only cannot meet the nitrogen demand of during rice grown season due to the release of nitrogen nutrients from crf varied with environments including temperature soil moisture content and microbial activities and the effect of crf on rice yield and nue depends not only on its input amount but also on the ratio of crf to common urea cu chien et al 2009 thus crf combined with cu has a better performance in supplying nitrogen for rice production and lowering nitrogen losses zhang et al 2021 qi et al 2020a ding et al 2018 further demonstrated that 70 slow release nitrogen plus 30 cu results in the greatest rice yield moreover it has been shown that optimized nitrogen management or an appropriate decrease in nitrogen rates and increase top dressing of nitrogen fertilizer at the heading stage reduces the unproductive tillers and thereby increasing grain yield and nue in rice liang et al 2019 fu et al 2021 notably irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer are interrelated to play a coupling effect on crop growth e g li et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 it is widely known that positive interactions of nitrogen and water improve rice growth and final yield by coordinating source sink relationships wang et al 2016 cao et al 2020 some researchers illustrated that the high yield sink capacity results from the greater photosynthetic rate harvest index percentage of productive tiller and spikelet number sun et al 2012 cao et al 2017 xu et al 2018 water saving technology such as awd also results in a healthy environmental condition benefits to improve root growth and enhance nitrogen accumulation yang et al 2018 abbas et al 2019 ishfaq et al 2020 however other literatures reported that awd reduces plant nitrogen accumulation and nue as high nitrogen losses by increasing nh3 volatilization nitrification and denitrification belder et al 2004 zou et al 2007 moreover decisions on nitrogen management strategy call for considering variations in soil water conditions li et al 2009 qi et al 2020a 2020b in addition coupling effects of water and nitrogen on rice growth under supplementary irrigation for rain fed rice cultivation remains largely unknown wu and yuan 2020 optimized nitrogen fertilization and irrigation regime improves the utilization of water and nitrogen by crops ye et al 2013 cao et al 2020 qi et al 2020b 2020c moreover in the jianghan plain of china the key growth stages of rice plants usually coincide with the plum rain season namely a weather phenomenon characteristics with continuous overcast and rainy qi et al 2020a this results in the enhanced frequency of drainage and thus increasing the risk of nitrogen and phosphorus losses shao et al 2015 also the intermittent drought often occurs following the ending of the plum rain season wu et al 2016 thus nitrogen management strategy should be carefully considered to improve rice production and reduce non point source pollution in this region qi et al 2020a in special the effects of crf blend with cu as well as optimized nitrogen fertilization on plant growth yield formation nue and cwp in rice under rai remain unclear the objectives of this study were to evaluate the performances of two irrigation regimes rai and cf interacted with three nitrogen management strategies local farmers n fertilization crf blended with cu and optimized nitrogen fertilization influence rice yield nue and cwp in the jianghan plain and to elucidate the causes of possible differences we hypothesized that the new developed nitrogen management strategy crf mixed with cu or optimized nitrogen fertilization improves root growth and thus increasing grain yield cwp and nue in rice under rai 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials a two year 2016 and 2017 field experiment was performed at the agricultural experimental station of yangtze university central china latitude 30 21 n longitude 112 09 e altitude 28 m the station is located in a region with typical subtropical monsoon climate zone the mean annual precipitation annual sunshine duration and annual temperature of 1095 mm 1718 h and 16 5 respectively the accumulated temperature of above 10 is 5094 9 5294 3 the soil texture at the experimental site is an acrisol based on the fao soil classification system and contained 2 04 g kg 1 total n 0 48 g kg 1 total p 79 5 mg kg 1 available nitrogen n 38 5 mg kg 1 olsen p and 108 7 mg kg 1exchangeable potassium in the 0 40 cm soil depth and with ph of 7 4 the field capacity soil water content was 0 34 cm3 cm 3 and the soil bulk density was 1 42 g cm 3 the daily rainfall amount during the rice growing season is shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design a 2 3 the two irrigation regimes combined with three n fertilizer managements factorial experiment was established with 6 treatments and repeated for three times plots and arranged in a complete randomized block design the irrigation treatments were consistent of cf and rai the n treatments were consistent of local farmers n fertilization cn common urea blended with crf 30 n from cu and 70 n from crf u crf and optimized n fertilization on 180 180 and 150 kg n ha 1 was applied in total for treatments cn u crf and on respectively there were two basal and tillering one basal and three basal tillering and heading n fertilization events for treatments cn u crf and on respectively table 1 the corresponding dates of basal tillering and heading n fertilization were 14 may 26 june and august 1 in 2016 and 14 may 25 june and august 2 in 2017 respectively our early studies shown that compare with cn an appropriate decrease in n fertilizer rate 17 and increase thenumbers of fertilization top dressing of n fertilizer at the heading stage produces a comparable rice yield with low n losses yan et al 2019 qi et al 2020a thus the on was established as described above before sowing 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 105 kg k2o ha 1 were basal applied the crf 28 n 5 p2o5 9 k2o produced by kingenta ecological engineering co ltd shandong china has 70 d of n released period common compound fertilizer 18 n 8 p2o5 15 k2o and common urea 46 n were used as the conventional n fertilizer moreover the insufficient of phosphorus and potassium after the basal application of crf and common compound fertilizer differences between the designed rate and the done rate were supplemented by using superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium chloride 60 k2o to make sure all treatments were identical in application rates of fertilizers phosphorus and potassium table 1 the cf was the conventional irrigation method used by local farmers has submerged water depth of 10 80 mm above the soil surface in the field through the rice growing season except single terminal drainage maintain about 10 days before the rice harvest in rai the field was permitted to be intermittently flooded by maximum harvesting rainfall and it was not irrigated unless the standing water depth swd dropped to approximately 100 mm below the topsoil to avoid waterlogging stress on rice plant and reduce the unnecessary drainage the harvested rainfall above the soil surface of paddy fields can be maintained up to 50 100 and 150 mm at the re greening stage tillering to jointing stages and the booting to maturity stages of rice respectively qi et al 2020a the phenological development of rice during the two growing seasons is shown in table 2 during the rice growing seasons swd was monitored at a 5 20 cm soil depth by using a home made water table observation pipe with graduated scale buried in each plot pipe readings were recorded every 4 h from 0600 h to 1800 h when swd reached the threshold the field was re flooded to a standing water depth of 40 60 mm in each irrigation event the cycles were repeated until the necessary drainage before the harvest 2 3 experimental management rice plants was grown the tested field in multiple years each plot with a dimension of 30 m2 6 m 5 m and a pvc sheet with 60 cm in height inserted to the soil to a depth of 30 cm around the plots to form a barrier each plot had an independently irrigation or drainage system mid maturation two line hybrid rice oryza sativa l cultivar huifeng8 widely used by local farmers was adopted as test target in the two experimental years seedlings were raised in the seedbed sowed on 15 april and transplanted on 15 may at a hill spacing of 0 25 m 0 30 m then all plots were irrigated with a same irrigation amount immediately fig 1 weeds were regularly controlled by hands during the rice growing season chemicals used to control diseases and insects the rice was in heading 50 plants on 27 28 july table 2 and the crop was harvested on september 18 19 the irrigation water volume was monitored by using a flow meter which installed at the discharging end of water inlet in the irrigation pipelines 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 gas exchange parameters the last fully developed leaves of rice were measured at the tillering jointing booting heading filling and maturity stages corresponding to 32 43 56 72 94 and 115 days after transplanting dat in 2016 33 44 57 73 95 and 116 dat in 2017 respectively gas exchange parameters including net photosynthetic rate p n stomatal conductance g s and transpiration rate t r were measured by using a portable infrared gas analyzer li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa the measurement was made from five leaves during 0900 1100 h photosynthetic active radiation was 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 2 4 2 tiller number twenty rice plants from each plot were used marked to determine tiller number at the jointing and maturity stages the ratio of the number of tillers at the maturity to the number of tillers at the jointing stage was calculated as the productive tillers percentage wang et al 2016 2 4 3 shoot biomass the shoot samples were division into leaf blades stems culms add sheaths and panicles at the heading and maturity stages and then dried at 75 c in an oven to constant weight and weighed for determination of shoot biomass at the jointing heading and maturity stages crop growth rate cgr g m 2 d 1 was determined by calculating ratio of the shoot biomass differences between the adjusted sampling dates to the corresponded growth periods per unit area wang et al 2016 2 4 4 root sampling root biomass and root length were determined at the heading and the maturity stage at the same dates as the leaf gas exchanges measurement for root sampling a cube soil 25 cm 16 cm 20 cm length width and depth around each individual hill involves approximately 95 of total root biomass according to yang et al 2008 was dug up by using a sampling core the roots sample were rinsed fist followed by arranged and floated in a glass container with shallow water and then be scanned by using a scanner epson expression 1680 scanner seiko epson corp tokyo japan the winrhizo root analyzer system regent instruments inc quebec canada was used to analyze length of root the scanned roots were dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed 2 4 5 grain yield and its components a dimension of 6 0 m2 in central of each plot was harvest for grain yield determination adjusted to 14 moisture yield components panicles number per square meter spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight were determined from an area of 0 8 m2 sampled randomly from the middle of each plot yoshida 1972 the grains filled percentage was ratio of the filled grains namely specific gravity over than 1 06 g cm 3 to total number of spikelets wang et al 2016 2 4 6 nitrogen uptake and its utilization the concentration of n in the maturity plants was determined by using the semi micro kjeldahl method shoot n uptake was calculated from the sum of the products of biomass and tissue n concentrations the nues including the nue nitrogen partial factor productivity pfpn and nitrogen harvest index nhi namely the ratio of grain yield to the total amount of n uptake in shoots grain yield to the amount of n fertilizer applied and the amount of n in grains to the amount n in shoot biomass respectively ju et al 2015 harvest index was the ratio of grain weight to shoot biomass at the harvest cwp was calculated as the ratio of rice yield to the added amount of irrigation water and precipitation across the rice growing season 2 5 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed by using the general linear model module of spss 12 0 software usa the mean values were compared based on duncan s test at p 0 05 although the gas exchange root biomass root length grain yield shoot biomass yield components harvest index cwp and most n utilization parameters of maize varied across the two years there was neither year water regime nor year n interactions indicating that the irrigation regimes and n management responses were consistent across years therefore data were pooled and presented across the years steel and torrie 1980 3 results the cf treated plants received seven times of irrigation in the two years fig 1 with total amount of irrigation water of 440 5 mm in 2016 and 410 4 mm in 2017 and total water consumption sum of the accumulated precipitation and the total irrigation water of 990 8 mm in 2016 and 1021 5 mm in 2017 compared to the cf rai reduced the irrigation numbers 3 in 2016 and 4 in 2017 corresponding to the reduced total amount of irrigation water 41 6 in 2016 and 45 6 in 2017 and a lower amount of total water consumption 807 3 mm in 2016 and 825 2 mm in 2017 3 1 grain yield and its components as shown in table 3 effective numbers were comparable among the different treatments seed setting rate was significantly smaller in the cf combined cn compared to the other treatments compared to cf rai resulted in greater spikeltet per panicle 1000 grain weight and grain yield in each n management strategy compared to cn u crf and on resulted in greater spikeltet per panicle 1000 grain weight and grain yield under the two irrigation regimes rai combined with u crf produced the greatest grain yield while cf combined with cn exhibited the smallest grain yield 3 2 gas exchange parameters as shown in table 4 compared to the cn on decreased the p n at the tillering and jointing stage and increased it at the booting heading filling and maturity stages u crf maintained or improved the p n g s and t r at each measured stage under the two irrigation regimes compared to the cf coupled with cn rai coupled with u crf or on increased the p n g s and t r at each measured stage notably rai combined with u crf or on exhibited the greatest p n at the rice heading filling and maturity stages 3 3 shoot biomass as shown in table 5 compared to the cn u crf increased shoot biomass at the tilllering heading and maturity stages while on reduced shoot biomass at the tillering stage and increased shoot biomass at the heading and maturity stages in each irrigation regime compared to the cf rai increased shoot biomass in each n management at the three growth stages and the difference was statistical significant at the heading and maturity rai combined with u crf produced the greatest shoot biomass cf combined with cn exhibited the smallest shoot biomass 3 4 cgr percentage of productive tillers harvest index and cwp as shown in table 6 compared to the cn u crf and on resulted in greater cgr in each irrigation regime compared to the cf rai increased cgr in each n management and the difference reached a significant level at u crf similarly u crf and on as well as rai resulted in greater percentage of productive tillers and harvest index at the same irrigation and n management strategy u crf showed greater cwp under the rai while cwp had no response to the different n managements under the cf rai interacted with u crf or on achieved the greatest cgr percentage of productive tillers harvest index and cwp 3 5 n accumulation nhi nue and pfpn as shown in table 7 compared to the cf rai increased nitrogen accumulation nhi nue and pfpn in each n treatment compared to the cn u crf and on increased nitrogen accumulation nhi nue and pfpn under the two irrigation regimes and the differences were statistical significant in the most cases rai combined with u crf resulted in the greatest nitrogen accumulation and rai combined with on exhibited the greatest nhi nue and pfpn cf combined with cn showed the least nitrogen accumulation nhi nue and pfpn 3 6 root length and root biomass root length and root biomass decreased obviously from the heading to maturity stage in all treatments fig 2 compared to the cf rai resulted in greater length and biomass of root system at the heading and maturity stages in each n management fig 2 compared to the cn u crf and on resulted in greater length and biomass of root system at the heading and maturity stages under the two irrigation regimes rai combined with u crf or on resulted in the greatest root length and root biomass at the two growth stages cf combined with cn showed the smallest root length and root biomass fig 2 4 discussion 4 1 effects of rai and nitrogen management strategies on grain yield and cwp it remains inconsistent if awd could synergistically improve grain yield and cwp tuong et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2016 cao et al 2020 in the present study we observed that rai increases both rice yield and cwp suggesting that rainfall adapted irrigation can synergistically increase rice yield and cwp how could rai make these achievements herein we observed several reasons first the tillering to the booting stage of rice coincides with the plum rain season in the jianghan plain where has frequent and heavy precipitation rai reduced the irrigation numbers and irrigation quota fig 1 by maximum harvesting rainfall resulting in high precipitation use efficiency qi et al 2020a second rai maintained a relatively high p n at the post growth heading filling and maturity stages table 4 and thus establishing a solid foundation for achieving high yield in rice wang et al 2016 third the growth and development of above ground plants depend on the acquisition of soil nutrients and water by the root systems xu et al 2018 rai improved root biomass and root length at the heading and maturity stages fig 2 partially accounting for the enhanced grain yield alternatively increasing plant root growth at the later growth stage improves leaf area index and thus getting more carbohydrate and obtaining a high grain yield qi et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 the greater cgr table 6 and shoot biomass table 5 confirmed this fourth rai reduced redundant vegetative growth yan et al 2019 as shown by the higher percentage of productive tillers and greater harvest index table 6 it is widely accepted that improvement of harvest index leads to greater crop yield and water use efficiency in cereal crops ehdaie and waines 1993 yang and zhang 2010 wang et al 2016 shoot biomass accumulation is one of the key growth indictors for rice and is closely related to yield formation in the present study rai produced a greater root biomass and root length fig 1 suggesting improvement of water and nutrient absorption capacity zhang et al 2009 ye et al 2013 and therefore enhanced the shoot biomass table 5 and final yield table 3 this is in line with the findings of previous studies xu et al 2018 qi et al 2020b our results also illustrated that the u crf and on produce greater final shoot biomass compare with cn table 5 this could be related to the increased root biomass root length and p n at the post growth stages it has been shown that appropriate nitrogen fertilization can delay the root senescence and controlled release fertilizers help to maintain vigorous root growth at the latter growth stages ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 for the u crf treated plants relatively high soil nitrogen availability was maintained for a longer period of time 70 d of n release period for the on plants nitrogen fertilization was additional added at the heading stage leading to the increased soil nitrogen availability at the post growth stages data not shown for the cn treated plants however soil nitrogen availability was lower at the post growth stages due to no fertilizers were applied after the last topdressing panicle fertilization most dramatically rai combined with the u crf produced the greatest shoot biomass table 5 this was associated with the enhanced root length root biomass cgr and p n rice yield is a function of panicles number per square meter spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight coordinating supply of irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer is the key to improve rice yield ye et al 2013 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 it is proposed that only safe awd results in a comparable cabangon et al 2004 yao et al 2012 or greater zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2016 rice yield in the present study rai increased the grain yield with less amount of irrigation water by enhancing spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight compared with cf table 3 suggesting that rainfall adapted irrigation is a safe and effective water saving irrigation method moreover the application of nitrogen fertilizer plays an important role in determining yield formation controlled release fertilizer obtained higher grain yield than cu with equivalent nitrogen rate were observed previously kiran et al 2010 ye et al 2013 consistently compared with the cn u crf resulted in a greater rice yield by increasing panicles number per square meter grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight table 3 in addition on obtained a comparable grain yield suggesting proper reduced and postponed application of nitrogen fertilizer can maintain rice yield this is in line with the findings observed on wheat tian et al 2018 postponing and decreasing the application of nitrogen fertilizer can delay leaf senescence which contributes to high grain yield ma et al 2016 the enhanced p n at the filling and maturity stages table 4 confirmed this based on the above benefits from both rai and u crf it was not surprised that the rai combined with u crf achieved the greatest grain yield table 3 and cwp table 6 in support zhang et al 2021 demonstrated that an appropriate proportion of polymer coated urea pcu and cu rates 70 pcu 30 cu improves leaf area index root oxidation activity and nonstructural carbohydrate remobilization during grain filling resulting in greater grain yield and water use efficiency in rice under moderate awd 4 2 effects of rai and nitrogen management strategies on nue it is debatable that awd can increase nue with different water conditions at comparable supply levels of nitrogen fertilizer cabangon et al 2011 sun et al 2012 ye et al 2013 wang et al 2016 in this study nue was greater under rai compared with cf table 7 suggesting that rainfall adapted irrigation has benefits to improve nitrogen use efficiency of rice this was associated with awd leading to an unfavorable condition for nitrification denitrification processes due to the soil water status is close to the saturation during the periods of drying belder et al 2004 moreover the ph in our tested soil is low 7 4 than the optimum ph needed for nitrification about 8 5 and thus minimizing the possibility of nitrogen loss via nitrification cabangon et al 2011 the increases in ammonia volatilization loss is one of the main limiting factors for efficient management of nitrogen fertilizer under awd compare with cf however dong et al 2012 suggested that cf results in greater ph in floodwater than awd and consequently leading to greater nitrogen loss via ammonia volatilization xu et al 2012 reported similar results in addition since reduced amount of irrigation water or field water storage ye et al 2013 fig 1 rai induced increased contents of total nitrogen in surface and seepage water of paddy field however the total nitrogen losses through runoff and leaching were still lower due to the reduction of drainage and leaching water in comparison with cf qi et al 2020a in terms of nitrogen utilization by plants rai could enhance the air exchange between the soil surface and the atmosphere because of the awd cycles tan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 resulting in enhanced soil nitrogen availability required for plant growth dong et al 2012 wang et al 2017 moreover awd enhances activities of main enzymes including lutamine synthetase glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase resulting in improved plant nitrogen metabolism sun et al 2012 the enhanced nitrogen accumulation and nhi under rai table 7 confirmed this therefore rainfall adapted irrigation is an efficient irrigation regime for rice production in the jianghan plain by lowering nitrogen losses and improving nitrogen utilization by plants the application of crf fertilizer is an effective way to improve rice nue jat et al 2012 ye et al 2013 it has been shown that the controlled release fertilizer results in a greater nue compare to conventional nitrogen fertilizers at equivalent nitrogen rates fujinuma et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 due to the reduced nitrogen fertilizer losses through denitrification volatilization leaching and surface runoff xu et al 2012 qi et al 2020a in this study too the u crf produces greater nue compared with cn table 7 this could be related to the enhanced soil nitrogen availability data not shown at the post growth stages of rice due to the application of crf which helps to reduce the redundant growth ye et al 2013 as shown by the enhanced percentage of productive tillers spikelets number per panicle table 3 and harvest index table 6 high harvest index accounting for the better nitrogen utilization wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 as shown by the enhanced nitrogen accumulation and nhi table 7 moreover splits posting and appropriate decreasing the rate of nitrogen fertilizer reduces the nitrogen transfer rate in leaves and thus delaying leaf senescence ma et al 2016 in addition the improved root length at the post growth stages fig 2 was responsible for the enhanced nitrogen accumulation table 7 as nitrogen uptake by plants was positively correlated with root length density qi et al 2020c optimized water and nitrogen management strategy not only increases crop yield water and nitrogen use efficiencies e g li et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 but also reduces the risk of nitrogen losses e g ju et al 2009 qi et al 2020a thus it is essential for sustainable development of rice production and environmental protection in the present study compared with the cn grain yield and cwp at u crf and on were comparable under cf whereas they were greater under rai and on increased nue more in the latter table 7 suggesting that positive interactions of the new irrigation regime and nitrogen fertilization mode thus rai coupled with u crf or on can be served as an optimized water and nitrogen management strategy to improve rice production in line with current green principles moreover pfpn is an important indicator used to reflect the productivity of nitrogen fertilizers maintaining a large crop yield with relatively high pfpn is important for sustainable rice production too in the present study rai coupled with on resulted in the greatest pfpn table 7 accompanied by a high grain yield table 3 suggesting that optimized nitrogen fertilization ameliorated the productivity of nitrogen fertilizers for rice production under rainfall adapted irrigation a reduced nitrogen rate as on can not only save chemical fertilizer input costs but also reduce the pollution risk caused by the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in various forms ju et al 2009 jat et al 2012 however on increased the numbers of fertilization compared to the other nitrogen treatments table 2 resulting in higher labor cost also the application of crf means the higher production fertilizers cost compare with cu ke et al 2021 thus exactly economic benefits for different nitrogen management strategies under rai remain unknown this is worth to further study 5 conclusions rai in combination with u crf or on produced high root length root and shoot biomass net photosynthetic rate crop growth rate nitrogen accumulation percentage of productive tillers and harvest index with less amount of irrigation water and or nitrogen fertilizer input and resulted in a greater spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight and obtain a relatively high grain yield crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency this may be considered as an optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen application pattern for sustainable rice production in the jianghan plain china the enhanced rice yield crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency were associated with the improved root length and root biomass the results also suggest the physiological mechanisms underlying rice yield water and nitrogen use efficiencies responses to nitrogen management strategies under supplementary

nitrogen blended with controlled release nitrogen fertilizer 70 nitrogen u crf and optimized nitrogen fertilization on at a nitrogen rate of 180 180 and 150 kg ha 1 respectively compared to the cf condition rai down regulated the numbers of irrigation 3 in 2016 and 4 in 2017 and reduced the total amount of irrigation water 41 6 in 2016 and 45 6 in 2017 suggesting that rainfall adapted irrigation enhanced the rainwater storage capacity and usage rai also increased root length root and shoot biomass net photosynthetic rate crop growth rate nitrogen accumulation percentage of productive tillers harvest index and nitrogen harvest index the u crf and on increased or maintained these parameters compared with the cn compared to the traditional irrigation and nitrogen fertilization pattern cf interacted with cn rai combined with u crf or on enhanced root length and root biomass and had a relatively high spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000

staple food in the world especially in asia china has the largest rice planting area and the greatest rice production in the world moa 2012 rice is also a greatest consumer for freshwater resources in china accounting for approximately 45 50 of the total water consumption in the country cai and chen 2000 moreover submerged cultivation of rice production in the traditional manner is conducted with a large amount of irrigation water and thus leading to low crop water productivity cwp this also induces environmental issues including methane ch4 emissions nitrogen and phosphorus losses from paddy fields yan et al 2005 xu et al 2020 ishfaq et al 2020 recently climate changes and social development have increased the consumption of freshwater in form of irrigation drainage and other non agricultural usages and therefore aggravated shortage of freshwater li and li 2010 this is urging researchers to devote novel irrigation technologies to improve cwp for sustainable agricultural development morison et al 2008 yao et al 2012 nowadays there are four popular rice ecosystems e g upland 11 deep water 4 rain fed 31 and irrigated 54 systems chen and zhu 2003 suggesting that rain fed and irrigated rice systems are the two main rice ecosystems in the world several water efficient management strategies including semi dry cultivation intermittent irrigation controlled irrigation no flooded mulching cultivation alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd and rainfall adapted irrigation rai or supplementary irrigation for rain fed rice cultivation have been implemented to counter the water scarcity and improve cwp belder et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 shao et al 2015 cao et al 2020 among the various irrigation methods awd exhibits the widely benefits including rises famer income lampayan et al 2015 reduces ch4 emission yan et al 2005 tarlera et al 2016 and alleviates the pest attack and disease damage zhuang et al 2019 an earlier study illustrated that a safe awd regime soil water potential at root depth above 20 kpa or 15 cm in water depth threshold below the soil surface can obtain a relatively high rice yield carrijo et al 2017 rai is a further development of awd where rainfall is maximum harvested to reduce unnecessary drainage during the rainy season and the paddy fields remain unsubmerged unless the cracks appear in the soil surface so that soil wetting and drying occurs alternatively throughout the rice growing season shao et al 2010 it has been shown that rai can not only maintain rice yield but also reduce environmental pollution and the irrigation cost in comparison with conventional flood irrigation cf qiao et al 2011 shao et al 2015 qi et al 2020a thus rai has been widely practiced in multi rain regions besides irrigation water nitrogen is substantially required for intensive rice production spiertz 2010 in the past years due to the increased consumption of fossil fuels the cost of nitrogen fertilizer has been on a rising trajectory moreover although the application of nitrogen fertilizer plays an vital role in improving rice yield its over and or unscientific use not only results in low nitrogen use efficiency nue but also causes detrimental effects on environment including soil degradation surface groundwater contamination and ammonia nh3 and ch4 emission ju et al 2009 peng et al 2009 to overcome these issues and increase farmer income several nitrogen efficient management strategies including balanced application of nitrogen fertilizer optimized and reduced nitrogen management mixed with nitrification urease inhibitors or organic fertilizers and adopt of controlled release fertilizers have been widely implemented jat et al 2012 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 qi et al 2020a among them the application of controlled release nitrogen fertilizer crf exhibits benefit to improve the nue and minimize the side effects on natural environment due to the reduced nitrogen loss by slowly releasing nitrogen nutrient from the coated fertilizer compared with the conventional nitrogen fertilizer application yang et al 2013 sun et al 2019 qi et al 2020a however some researchers shown that applying crf only cannot meet the nitrogen demand of during rice grown season due to the release of nitrogen nutrients from crf varied with environments including temperature soil moisture content and microbial activities and the effect of crf on rice yield and nue depends not only on its input amount but also on the ratio of crf to common urea cu chien et al 2009 thus crf combined with cu has a better performance in supplying nitrogen for rice production and lowering nitrogen losses zhang et al 2021 qi et al 2020a ding et al 2018 further demonstrated that 70 slow release nitrogen plus 30 cu results in the greatest rice yield moreover it has been shown that optimized nitrogen management or an appropriate decrease in nitrogen rates and increase top dressing of nitrogen fertilizer at the heading stage reduces the unproductive tillers and thereby increasing grain yield and nue in rice liang et al 2019 fu et al 2021 notably irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer are interrelated to play a coupling effect on crop growth e g li et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 it is widely known that positive interactions of nitrogen and water improve rice growth and final yield by coordinating source sink relationships wang et al 2016 cao et al 2020 some researchers illustrated that the high yield sink capacity results from the greater photosynthetic rate harvest index percentage of productive tiller and spikelet number sun et al 2012 cao et al 2017 xu et al 2018 water saving technology such as awd also results in a healthy environmental condition benefits to improve root growth and enhance nitrogen accumulation yang et al 2018 abbas et al 2019 ishfaq et al 2020 however other literatures reported that awd reduces plant nitrogen accumulation and nue as high nitrogen losses by increasing nh3 volatilization nitrification and denitrification belder et al 2004 zou et al 2007 moreover decisions on nitrogen management strategy call for considering variations in soil water conditions li et al 2009 qi et al 2020a 2020b in addition coupling effects of water and nitrogen on rice growth under supplementary irrigation for rain fed rice cultivation remains largely unknown wu and yuan 2020 optimized nitrogen fertilization and irrigation regime improves the utilization of water and nitrogen by crops ye et al 2013 cao et al 2020 qi et al 2020b 2020c moreover in the jianghan plain of china the key growth stages of rice plants usually coincide with the plum rain season namely a weather phenomenon characteristics with continuous overcast and rainy qi et al 2020a this results in the enhanced frequency of drainage and thus increasing the risk of nitrogen and phosphorus losses shao et al 2015 also the intermittent drought often occurs following the ending of the plum rain season wu et al 2016 thus nitrogen management strategy should be carefully considered to improve rice production and reduce non point source pollution in this region qi et al 2020a in special the effects of crf blend with cu as well as optimized nitrogen fertilization on plant growth yield formation nue and cwp in rice under rai remain unclear the objectives of this study were to evaluate the performances of two irrigation regimes rai and cf interacted with three nitrogen management strategies local farmers n fertilization crf blended with cu and optimized nitrogen fertilization influence rice yield nue and cwp in the jianghan plain and to elucidate the causes of possible differences we hypothesized that the new developed nitrogen management strategy crf mixed with cu or optimized nitrogen fertilization improves root growth and thus increasing grain yield cwp and nue in rice under rai 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials a two year 2016 and 2017 field experiment was performed at the agricultural experimental station of yangtze university central china latitude 30 21 n longitude 112 09 e altitude 28 m the station is located in a region with typical subtropical monsoon climate zone the mean annual precipitation annual sunshine duration and annual temperature of 1095 mm 1718 h and 16 5 respectively the accumulated temperature of above 10 is 5094 9 5294 3 the soil texture at the experimental site is an acrisol based on the fao soil classification system and contained 2 04 g kg 1 total n 0 48 g kg 1 total p 79 5 mg kg 1 available nitrogen n 38 5 mg kg 1 olsen p and 108 7 mg kg 1exchangeable potassium in the 0 40 cm soil depth and with ph of 7 4 the field capacity soil water content was 0 34 cm3 cm 3 and the soil bulk density was 1 42 g cm 3 the daily rainfall amount during the rice growing season is shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design a 2 3 the two irrigation regimes combined with three n fertilizer managements factorial experiment was established with 6 treatments and repeated for three times plots and arranged in a complete randomized block design the irrigation treatments were consistent of cf and rai the n treatments were consistent of local farmers n fertilization cn common urea blended with crf 30 n from cu and 70 n from crf u crf and optimized n fertilization on 180 180 and 150 kg n ha 1 was applied in total for treatments cn u crf and on respectively there were two basal and tillering one basal and three basal tillering and heading n fertilization events for treatments cn u crf and on respectively table 1 the corresponding dates of basal tillering and heading n fertilization were 14 may 26 june and august 1 in 2016 and 14 may 25 june and august 2 in 2017 respectively our early studies shown that compare with cn an appropriate decrease in n fertilizer rate 17 and increase thenumbers of fertilization top dressing of n fertilizer at the heading stage produces a comparable rice yield with low n losses yan et al 2019 qi et al 2020a thus the on was established as described above before sowing 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 105 kg k2o ha 1 were basal applied the crf 28 n 5 p2o5 9 k2o produced by kingenta ecological engineering co ltd shandong china has 70 d of n released period common compound fertilizer 18 n 8 p2o5 15 k2o and common urea 46 n were used as the conventional n fertilizer moreover the insufficient of phosphorus and potassium after the basal application of crf and common compound fertilizer differences between the designed rate and the done rate were supplemented by using superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium chloride 60 k2o to make sure all treatments were identical in application rates of fertilizers phosphorus and potassium table 1 the cf was the conventional irrigation method used by local farmers has submerged water depth of 10 80 mm above the soil surface in the field through the rice growing season except single terminal drainage maintain about 10 days before the rice harvest in rai the field was permitted to be intermittently flooded by maximum harvesting rainfall and it was not irrigated unless the standing water depth swd dropped to approximately 100 mm below the topsoil to avoid waterlogging stress on rice plant and reduce the unnecessary drainage the harvested rainfall above the soil surface of paddy fields can be maintained up to 50 100 and 150 mm at the re greening stage tillering to jointing stages and the booting to maturity stages of rice respectively qi et al 2020a the phenological development of rice during the two growing seasons is shown in table 2 during the rice growing seasons swd was monitored at a 5 20 cm soil depth by using a home made water table observation pipe with graduated scale buried in each plot pipe readings were recorded every 4 h from 0600 h to 1800 h when swd reached the threshold the field was re flooded to a standing water depth of 40 60 mm in each irrigation event the cycles were repeated until the necessary drainage before the harvest 2 3 experimental management rice plants was grown the tested field in multiple years each plot with a dimension of 30 m2 6 m 5 m and a pvc sheet with 60 cm in height inserted to the soil to a depth of 30 cm around the plots to form a barrier each plot had an independently irrigation or drainage system mid maturation two line hybrid rice oryza sativa l cultivar huifeng8 widely used by local farmers was adopted as test target in the two experimental years seedlings were raised in the seedbed sowed on 15 april and transplanted on 15 may at a hill spacing of 0 25 m 0 30 m then all plots were irrigated with a same irrigation amount immediately fig 1 weeds were regularly controlled by hands during the rice growing season chemicals used to control diseases and insects the rice was in heading 50 plants on 27 28 july table 2 and the crop was harvested on september 18 19 the irrigation water volume was monitored by using a flow meter which installed at the discharging end of water inlet in the irrigation pipelines 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 gas exchange parameters the last fully developed leaves of rice were measured at the tillering jointing booting heading filling and maturity stages corresponding to 32 43 56 72 94 and 115 days after transplanting dat in 2016 33 44 57 73 95 and 116 dat in 2017 respectively gas exchange parameters including net photosynthetic rate p n stomatal conductance g s and transpiration rate t r were measured by using a portable infrared gas analyzer li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa the measurement was made from five leaves during 0900 1100 h photosynthetic active radiation was 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 2 4 2 tiller number twenty rice plants from each plot were used marked to determine tiller number at the jointing and maturity stages the ratio of the number of tillers at the maturity to the number of tillers at the jointing stage was calculated as the productive tillers percentage wang et al 2016 2 4 3 shoot biomass the shoot samples were division into leaf blades stems culms add sheaths and panicles at the heading and maturity stages and then dried at 75 c in an oven to constant weight and weighed for determination of shoot biomass at the jointing heading and maturity stages crop growth rate cgr g m 2 d 1 was determined by calculating ratio of the shoot biomass differences between the adjusted sampling dates to the corresponded growth periods per unit area wang et al 2016 2 4 4 root sampling root biomass and root length were determined at the heading and the maturity stage at the same dates as the leaf gas exchanges measurement for root sampling a cube soil 25 cm 16 cm 20 cm length width and depth around each individual hill involves approximately 95 of total root biomass according to yang et al 2008 was dug up by using a sampling core the roots sample were rinsed fist followed by arranged and floated in a glass container with shallow water and then be scanned by using a scanner epson expression 1680 scanner seiko epson corp tokyo japan the winrhizo root analyzer system regent instruments inc quebec canada was used to analyze length of root the scanned roots were dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed 2 4 5 grain yield and its components a dimension of 6 0 m2 in central of each plot was harvest for grain yield determination adjusted to 14 moisture yield components panicles number per square meter spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight were determined from an area of 0 8 m2 sampled randomly from the middle of each plot yoshida 1972 the grains filled percentage was ratio of the filled grains namely specific gravity over than 1 06 g cm 3 to total number of spikelets wang et al 2016 2 4 6 nitrogen uptake and its utilization the concentration of n in the maturity plants was determined by using the semi micro kjeldahl method shoot n uptake was calculated from the sum of the products of biomass and tissue n concentrations the nues including the nue nitrogen partial factor productivity pfpn and nitrogen harvest index nhi namely the ratio of grain yield to the total amount of n uptake in shoots grain yield to the amount of n fertilizer applied and the amount of n in grains to the amount n in shoot biomass respectively ju et al 2015 harvest index was the ratio of grain weight to shoot biomass at the harvest cwp was calculated as the ratio of rice yield to the added amount of irrigation water and precipitation across the rice growing season 2 5 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed by using the general linear model module of spss 12 0 software usa the mean values were compared based on duncan s test at p 0 05 although the gas exchange root biomass root length grain yield shoot biomass yield components harvest index cwp and most n utilization parameters of maize varied across the two years there was neither year water regime nor year n interactions indicating that the irrigation regimes and n management responses were consistent across years therefore data were pooled and presented across the years steel and torrie 1980 3 results the cf treated plants received seven times of irrigation in the two years fig 1 with total amount of irrigation water of 440 5 mm in 2016 and 410 4 mm in 2017 and total water consumption sum of the accumulated precipitation and the total irrigation water of 990 8 mm in 2016 and 1021 5 mm in 2017 compared to the cf rai reduced the irrigation numbers 3 in 2016 and 4 in 2017 corresponding to the reduced total amount of irrigation water 41 6 in 2016 and 45 6 in 2017 and a lower amount of total water consumption 807 3 mm in 2016 and 825 2 mm in 2017 3 1 grain yield and its components as shown in table 3 effective numbers were comparable among the different treatments seed setting rate was significantly smaller in the cf combined cn compared to the other treatments compared to cf rai resulted in greater spikeltet per panicle 1000 grain weight and grain yield in each n management strategy compared to cn u crf and on resulted in greater spikeltet per panicle 1000 grain weight and grain yield under the two irrigation regimes rai combined with u crf produced the greatest grain yield while cf combined with cn exhibited the smallest grain yield 3 2 gas exchange parameters as shown in table 4 compared to the cn on decreased the p n at the tillering and jointing stage and increased it at the booting heading filling and maturity stages u crf maintained or improved the p n g s and t r at each measured stage under the two irrigation regimes compared to the cf coupled with cn rai coupled with u crf or on increased the p n g s and t r at each measured stage notably rai combined with u crf or on exhibited the greatest p n at the rice heading filling and maturity stages 3 3 shoot biomass as shown in table 5 compared to the cn u crf increased shoot biomass at the tilllering heading and maturity stages while on reduced shoot biomass at the tillering stage and increased shoot biomass at the heading and maturity stages in each irrigation regime compared to the cf rai increased shoot biomass in each n management at the three growth stages and the difference was statistical significant at the heading and maturity rai combined with u crf produced the greatest shoot biomass cf combined with cn exhibited the smallest shoot biomass 3 4 cgr percentage of productive tillers harvest index and cwp as shown in table 6 compared to the cn u crf and on resulted in greater cgr in each irrigation regime compared to the cf rai increased cgr in each n management and the difference reached a significant level at u crf similarly u crf and on as well as rai resulted in greater percentage of productive tillers and harvest index at the same irrigation and n management strategy u crf showed greater cwp under the rai while cwp had no response to the different n managements under the cf rai interacted with u crf or on achieved the greatest cgr percentage of productive tillers harvest index and cwp 3 5 n accumulation nhi nue and pfpn as shown in table 7 compared to the cf rai increased nitrogen accumulation nhi nue and pfpn in each n treatment compared to the cn u crf and on increased nitrogen accumulation nhi nue and pfpn under the two irrigation

resulted in greater length and biomass of root system at the heading and maturity stages under the two irrigation regimes rai combined with u crf or on resulted in the greatest root length and root biomass at the two growth stages cf combined with cn showed the smallest root length and root biomass fig 2 4 discussion 4 1 effects of rai and nitrogen management strategies on grain yield and cwp it remains inconsistent if awd could synergistically improve grain yield and cwp tuong et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2016 cao et al 2020 in the present study we observed that rai increases both rice yield and cwp suggesting that rainfall adapted irrigation can synergistically increase rice yield and cwp how could rai make these achievements herein we observed several reasons first the tillering to the booting stage of rice coincides with the plum rain season in the jianghan plain where has frequent and heavy precipitation rai reduced the irrigation numbers and irrigation quota fig 1 by maximum harvesting rainfall resulting in high precipitation use efficiency qi et al 2020a second rai maintained a relatively high p n at the post growth heading filling and maturity stages table 4 and thus establishing a solid foundation for achieving high yield in rice wang et al 2016 third the growth and development of above ground plants depend on the acquisition of soil nutrients and water by the root systems xu et al 2018 rai improved root biomass and root length at the heading and maturity stages fig 2 partially accounting for the enhanced grain yield alternatively increasing plant root growth at the later growth stage improves leaf area index and thus getting more carbohydrate and obtaining a high grain yield qi et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 the greater cgr table 6 and shoot biomass table 5 confirmed this fourth rai reduced redundant vegetative growth yan et al 2019 as shown by the higher percentage of productive tillers and greater harvest index table 6 it is widely accepted that improvement of harvest index leads to greater crop yield and water use efficiency in cereal crops ehdaie and waines 1993 yang and zhang 2010 wang et al 2016 shoot biomass accumulation is one of the key growth indictors for rice and is closely related to yield formation in the present study rai produced a greater root biomass and root length fig 1 suggesting improvement of water and nutrient absorption capacity zhang et al 2009 ye et al 2013 and therefore enhanced the shoot biomass table 5 and final yield table 3 this is in line with the findings of previous studies xu et al 2018 qi et al 2020b our results also illustrated that the u crf and on produce greater final shoot biomass compare with cn table 5 this could be related to the increased root biomass root length and p n at the post growth stages it has been shown that appropriate nitrogen fertilization can delay the root senescence and controlled release fertilizers help to maintain vigorous root growth at the latter growth stages ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 for the u crf treated plants relatively high soil nitrogen availability was maintained for a longer period of time 70 d of n release period for the on plants nitrogen fertilization was additional added at the heading stage leading to the increased soil nitrogen availability at the post growth stages data not shown for the cn treated plants however soil nitrogen availability was lower at the post growth stages due to no fertilizers were applied after the last topdressing panicle fertilization most dramatically rai combined with the u crf produced the greatest shoot biomass table 5 this was associated with the enhanced root length root biomass cgr and p n rice yield is a function of panicles number per square meter spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight coordinating supply of irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer is the key to improve rice yield ye et al 2013 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 it is proposed that only safe awd results in a comparable cabangon et al 2004 yao et al 2012 or greater zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2016 rice yield in the present study rai increased the grain yield with less amount of irrigation water by enhancing spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight compared with cf table 3 suggesting that rainfall adapted irrigation is a safe and effective water saving irrigation method moreover the application of nitrogen fertilizer plays an important role in determining yield formation controlled release fertilizer obtained higher grain yield than cu with equivalent nitrogen rate were observed previously kiran et al 2010 ye et al 2013 consistently compared with the cn u crf resulted in a greater rice yield by increasing panicles number per square meter grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight table 3 in addition on obtained a comparable grain yield suggesting proper reduced and postponed application of nitrogen fertilizer can maintain rice yield this is in line with the findings observed on wheat tian et al 2018 postponing and decreasing the application of nitrogen fertilizer can delay leaf senescence which contributes to high grain yield ma et al 2016 the enhanced p n at the filling and maturity stages table 4 confirmed this based on the above benefits from both rai and u crf it was not surprised that the rai combined with u crf achieved the greatest grain yield table 3 and cwp table 6 in support zhang et al 2021 demonstrated that an appropriate proportion of polymer coated urea pcu and cu rates 70 pcu 30 cu improves leaf area index root oxidation activity and nonstructural carbohydrate remobilization during grain filling resulting in greater grain yield and water use efficiency in rice under moderate awd 4 2 effects of rai and nitrogen management strategies on nue it is debatable that awd can increase nue with different water conditions at comparable supply levels of nitrogen fertilizer cabangon et al 2011 sun et al 2012 ye et al 2013 wang et al 2016 in this study nue was greater under rai compared with cf table 7 suggesting that rainfall adapted irrigation has benefits to improve nitrogen use efficiency of rice this was associated with awd leading to an unfavorable condition for nitrification denitrification processes due to the soil water status is close to the saturation during the periods of drying belder et al 2004 moreover the ph in our tested soil is low 7 4 than the optimum ph needed for nitrification about 8 5 and thus minimizing the possibility of nitrogen loss via nitrification cabangon et al 2011 the increases in ammonia volatilization loss is one of the main limiting factors for efficient management of nitrogen fertilizer under awd compare with cf however dong et al 2012 suggested that cf results in greater ph in floodwater than awd and consequently leading to greater nitrogen loss via ammonia volatilization xu et al 2012 reported similar results in addition since reduced amount of irrigation water or field water storage ye et al 2013 fig 1 rai induced increased contents of total nitrogen in surface and seepage water of paddy field however the total nitrogen losses through runoff and leaching were still lower due to the reduction of drainage and leaching water in comparison with cf qi et al 2020a in terms of nitrogen utilization by plants rai could enhance the air exchange between the soil surface and the atmosphere because of the awd cycles tan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 resulting in enhanced soil nitrogen availability required for plant growth dong et al 2012 wang et al 2017 moreover awd enhances activities of main enzymes including lutamine synthetase glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase resulting in improved plant nitrogen metabolism sun et al 2012 the enhanced nitrogen accumulation and nhi under rai table 7 confirmed this therefore rainfall adapted irrigation is an efficient irrigation regime for rice production in the jianghan plain by lowering nitrogen losses and improving nitrogen utilization by plants the application of crf fertilizer is an effective way to improve rice nue jat et al 2012 ye et al 2013 it has been shown that the controlled release fertilizer results in a greater nue compare to conventional nitrogen fertilizers at equivalent nitrogen rates fujinuma et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 due to the reduced nitrogen fertilizer losses through denitrification volatilization leaching and surface runoff xu et al 2012 qi et al 2020a in this study too the u crf produces greater nue compared with cn table 7 this could be related to the enhanced soil nitrogen availability data not shown at the post growth stages of rice due to the application of crf which helps to reduce the redundant growth ye et al 2013 as shown by the enhanced percentage of productive tillers spikelets number per panicle table 3 and harvest index table 6 high harvest index accounting for the better nitrogen utilization wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 as shown by the enhanced nitrogen accumulation and nhi table 7 moreover splits posting and appropriate decreasing the rate of nitrogen fertilizer reduces the nitrogen transfer rate in leaves and thus delaying leaf senescence ma et al 2016 in addition the improved root length at the post growth stages fig 2 was responsible for the enhanced nitrogen accumulation table 7 as nitrogen uptake by plants was positively correlated with root length density qi et al 2020c optimized water and nitrogen management strategy not only increases crop yield water and nitrogen use efficiencies e g li et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 but also reduces the risk of nitrogen losses e g ju et al 2009 qi et al 2020a thus it is essential for sustainable development of rice production and environmental protection in the present study compared with the cn grain yield and cwp at u crf and on were comparable under cf whereas they were greater under rai and on increased nue more in the latter table 7 suggesting that positive interactions of the new irrigation regime and nitrogen fertilization mode thus rai coupled with u crf or on can be served as an optimized water and nitrogen management strategy to improve rice production in line with current green principles moreover pfpn is an important indicator used to reflect the productivity of nitrogen fertilizers maintaining a large crop yield with relatively high pfpn is important for sustainable rice production too in the present study rai coupled with on resulted in the greatest pfpn table 7 accompanied by a high grain yield table 3 suggesting that optimized nitrogen fertilization ameliorated the productivity of nitrogen fertilizers for rice production under rainfall adapted irrigation a reduced nitrogen rate as on can not only save chemical fertilizer input costs but also reduce the pollution risk caused by the loss of nitrogen fertilizer in various forms ju et al 2009 jat et al 2012 however on increased the numbers of fertilization compared to the other nitrogen treatments table 2 resulting in higher labor cost also the application of crf means the higher production fertilizers cost compare with cu ke et al 2021 thus exactly economic benefits for different nitrogen management strategies under rai remain unknown this is worth to further study 5 conclusions rai in combination with u crf or on produced high root length root and shoot biomass net photosynthetic rate crop growth rate nitrogen accumulation percentage of productive tillers and harvest index with less amount of irrigation water and or nitrogen fertilizer input and resulted in a greater spikelets number per panicle grains filled percentage and 1000 grain weight and obtain a relatively high grain yield crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency this may be considered as an optimal combination of irrigation and nitrogen application pattern for sustainable rice production in the jianghan plain china the enhanced rice yield crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency were associated with the improved root length and root biomass the results also suggest the physiological mechanisms underlying rice yield water and nitrogen use efficiencies responses to nitrogen management strategies under supplementary

9666,in the field of agriculture the water used for irrigation should be given special treatment as it is responsible for a large proportion of total water consumption irrigation scheduling is critical to food production because it guarantees producers a consistent harvest and minimizes the risk of losses due to water shortages therefore the creation of an automatic irrigation method using new technologies is essential new methods such as deep learning algorithms have attracted a lot of attention in agriculture and are already being used successfully in this work a deep q network was trained for irrigation scheduling the agent was trained to schedule irrigation for a tomato field in portugal two long short term memory models were used as the agent environment one predicts the total water in the soil profile on the next day the other one was employed to estimate the yield based on the environmental condition during a season and then measure the net return the agent uses this information to decide the following irrigation amount an artificial neural network a long short term memory and a convolutional neural network were used to estimating the q table during training unlike the long short terms memory model the artificial neural network and the convolutional neural network could not estimate the q table and the agent s reward decreased during training the comparison of the performance of the model was done with fixed base irrigation and threshold based irrigation the trained model increased productivity by 11 and decreased water consumption by 20 30 compared to the fixed method keywords agriculture lstm deep reinforcement learning irrigation scheduling 1 introduction water is the most strategic commodity on the planet and can become scarce if not protected on average 70 of water is consumed in agriculture wang et al 2002 according to fao agriculture is also the sector where the greatest need for action to reduce water consumption fao 2002 challenges such as increasing population and demand for agricultural communities food preferences degradation of soils and water related ecosystems pollution and climate change bring uncertainties regarding the availability of water resources rosegrant et al 2009 sundmaeker et al 2016 clark and tilman 2017 in the future these challenges include high uncertainty about the impacts of climate change rising costs of groundwater and pump irrigation and the increasing viability of large storage systems rosegrant et al 2009 therefore how to manage and reduce water consumption without compromising productivity is critical appropriate agricultural practices can be achieved if new technologies and innovations are used sundmaeker et al 2016 smart farms have adopted modern technologies in agriculture to bring farmers closer to modern digital technologies that revolutionize decision making and productivity in the field sundmaeker et al 2016 doshi et al 2019 it uses sensors and communication technology to enable remote monitoring and control of various parameters such as soil livestock and others from a computer or smartphone and provides better control and monitoring lohchab et al 2018 the vast amount of data and information generated by agricultural technology and connectivity will be the basis for smart farms sundmaeker et al 2016 there is a need to analyze and store the huge amount of data collected by sensors per second and to consider and study the observations obtained about the variable attributes of the field artificial intelligence algorithms and in particular deep learning algorithms dl are a tool to extract features from these data and develop decision systems lohchab et al 2018 in a dl model a huge amount of data big data is fed into an artificial neural network valuable features are extracted from the data and these features are used for future predictions najafabadi et al 2014 dl already successfully applied in various fields of agriculture kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 evapotranspiration and soil moisture are two important factors that should be considered in irrigation scheduling tseng et al 2018 applied a convolutional neural network cnn to estimate soil moisture from images the cnn model performed better than rf svm and ann song et al 2016 used a macroscopic cellular automata mca combined with deep belief network dbn to predict soil moisture the proposed model reduced the mean square error by 18 compared to the multilayer perceptron adamala 2018 used a generalized wavelet neural network wnn to estimate the reference evapotranspiration the wnn and artificial neural network ann models outperformed wavelet regression and linear regression methods in saggi and jain 2019 deep learning multilayer perceptron mlp was used to estimate daily evapotranspiration the mlp outperformed the gradient boosting machine random forest and generalized linear models in de oliveira e lucas et al 2020 three convolutional neural networks cnn with unique structures were used to predict evapotranspiration the cnn model performed better than the seasonal arima sarima and seasonal naive model snaive in terms of computational complexity accuracy and variance in deep learning recurrent neural networks are developed to model time series data a neural network was implemented in adeyemi et al 2018 to predict soil moisture the model achieved r 2 above 0 94 in all test areas a long short terms memory lstm model was used in zhang et al 2018 to estimate agricultural groundwater depth data from 14 years were used including precipitation water runoff temperature reference evapotranspiration and groundwater depth the lstm model performed better compared to feed forward neural network ffnn alibabaei et al 2021b used a singlelayer bidirectional lstm model to predict evapotranspiration and soil water content one day in advance during the test period an r 2 score between 0 96 and 0 98 was obtained the cnn model was added to the lstm to investigate possible performance improvement performance decreased in all data sets due to the complexity of the model however farmers do not have the knowledge to work with soil water content or evapotranspiration and need an expert to analyze the data which makes it impractical for small farms in this work we trained a deep q lstm networks network model that uses this knowledge and simply tells farmers when and how much to irrigate to achieve the best productivity without wasting water for a tomato field 2 materials and methods a computer system comprising an intel core i7 9700 cpu 32 0 gb ram and an nvidia geforce rtx 2080 graphics card was used for the work the tensorflow 2 1 0 framework and keras library 2 2 4 tf were used to implement the models fig 1 shows the general framework of this work which consists of four parts first historical data are collected from various sources and prepared for use as input to the models fig 1 a then two lstm models are trained on the obtained historical data to predict swtd for the next day and tomato yield at the end of a season respectivly fig 1 b training the lstm models is a unique process and after training they use as a feature in the drl training environment which takes the current state s historical climate data and action a amount of irrigation and then returns the next state s and reward r fig 1 c during the agent s training it selects an action for the next irrigation based on the current state of the field and evaluates that action using a function called q value the environment receives the current state and the action chosen by the agent and indicates the next state and the reward this interaction between the drl agent and training environment is repeated until the drl agent converges to an optimal strategy for choosing the next day s irrigation amount fig 1 c and d 1 1 the codes can be found in the following link https github com falibabaei dqn irrigation in agriculture fig 2 in the following section each part of the framework is explained in detail 2 1 data collection in this paper the climate dataset for fadagosa portugal of alibabaei et al 2021a was used which comes from the government agency of the ministries of agriculture and the sea the direç ão regional de agricultura e pescas do centro portugal www drapc gov pt the soil type in fadagosa is sandy or sandy loam permeable with low to medium organic matter content with low reaction from acid to neutral rich in phosphorus and potassium and without salinity the climate in fadagosa is a warm mediterranean summer climate alibabaei et al 2021a the location and details of the dataset were described in tables 1 and 2 fig 3 also shows the time series of the dataset to create an environment in which a drl agent can interact during the training period crop yields and total soil water in profile swtd based on different irrigation were needed in addition to climate data in the real world recording crop yields and swtd with various irrigation is extremely time consuming and sometimes impractical therefore decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat was employed to simulate these variables dssat is a software operating program consisting of crop production simulation models for more than 42 crops that evaluate the effects of environmental and management influences on crop production dssat simulates crop yield response to water tomato yields were simulated using dssat under different irrigation schedules in fadagosa the crop simulation model cropgro tomato from dssat was used to conduct the study the soil type selected was sandy loam which is typical of fadagosa the planting date was fixed to the first of april and the harvest date to the time of maturity in each season tomato seedlings were selected as direct seeding in a single row with a planting distance of 60 cm the initial soil condition was selected with 70 available water sprinkler irrigation was selected as an irrigation method which is adjustable in the dssat software four days and values between 0 and 60 were chosen as the time and depth norms for determining the irrigation schedule the irrigation amount for each experimental year included no irrigation and specified depths of 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 60 mm per four days eto calculator is a software developed by the land and water division of fao to calculate reference evapotranspiration using the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 in this work this software was used to calculate eto see fig 3 2 2 data pre processing the same data preprocessing as in alibabaei et al 2021a including filling missing data with the moving average method removing multicollinear parameters in the dataset and normalizing parameters between 0 and 1 was applied in this work the variance inflation factor vif is a measure of the extent of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables and an instrument for measuring the degree of multicollinearity between variables james et al 2014 in this paper the vif was used to remove the variables with a vif greater than 5 in the end the variables average temperature t avg average humidity hr avg average wind speed ws avg reference evapotranspiration eto total soil water in profile swtd irrigation and precipitation prec remain as inputs to the model the goal of normalization is to bring the values of the numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale without distorting the differences in the ranges of values for machine learning normalization is required only when the resources have different value ranges the eq 1 was used to bring data between 0 and 1 1 y x x m i n x m a x x m i n where x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values in the dataset 2 3 deep learning algorithm machine learning is a data analysis technique that allows computers to extract information from data to detect patterns and decide with minimal human intervention it is a subfield of artificial intelligence that teaches computers the ability to perform tasks based on examples without explicit programming nguyen et al 2019 liakos et al 2018 presented an overview of the application of ml algorithm in various agricultural activities of farming dl is a subfield of machine learning the term deep points to the number of hidden layers in the design of artificial neural networks each layer converts the input into actionable information that an adjacent layer can use for a prediction task since the models of dl are faster and more efficient compared to the traditional ml models and unlike them have the ability to automatically extract features from the input data they have been increasingly used in recent years the dl algorithms are successfully used for detection classification and segmentation sermanet et al 2013 three types of dl models were used in this work which is listed below 2 3 1 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks ann is part of the machine learning domain and their use is broad in supervised learning anns are applicable to both regression and classification problems in ml murtagh 1991 an artificial neural network performs its processing through neurons distributed in layers aiming for a structure analogous to neurons in the human brain murtagh 1991 the layers of ann models consist of an input layer hidden layers fully connected layers and the output the input layer processes the data input the hidden layers are linear functions that add weights and biases to the input of the layer and extract features from the input data and do the processing finally the output layer is the final result of neural network processing activation functions are used after a convolution layer to introduce nonlinearities into the model there are many functions such as sigmoid tanh and softmax however the most suitable for convolutional networks is relu as it is computationally more efficient without much difference in accuracy compared to other functions this function reset al negative values from the output of the previous layer murtagh 1991 2 3 2 convolutional neural networks the convolutional layer applies filters to extract features from the input of the layer these filters are matrices of weights and biases applied to the previous output layer a filter applies to a region of the image and a dot product between the input and the filter is calculated and a matrix is an output then the filter is shifted and this process is repeated until the filter has swept all the inputs the final output of the layer is called feature maps similar to the ann model the activation function is used after each convolution layer to add nonlinearity to the model a pooling layer is applied to simplify the information from the previous layer the most commonly used method is max pooling where only the larger unit number is passed to the output this data pooling is used to reduce the number of weights to be learned and to avoid overfitting 2 3 3 recurrent neural network and long short terms memory structure recurrent neural network rnn is constructed to deal with sequential data with a temporal dataset unlike cnn and aan its purpose is to use data from a previous input to understand the current data patterson and gibson 2017 rnn can be considered as several copies of a network each of which transmits information to another network the drawback of the rnn model is that for large inputs the gradient of the loss function may approach zero during the training of the model eventually causing the failure to update the weights of the first layer patterson and gibson 2017 to overcome this drawback the long short terms memory lstm was designed a typical lstm unit comprises of several gates including an input gate i t an output gate o t a block input z t a forget gate f t and a memory cell c t see fig 4 the first step of the lstm unit is to determine what information to discard from the previous cell state the forget gate makes this decision using a sigmoid function first a linear combination of the input x t at time t and the output of the previous unit h t 1 is computed by multiplying with weight and bias matrices then a sigmoid function inputs the combination and outputs a number in the range of 0 and 1 zero means that all knowledge has been forgotten and the output of one means that all information from the previous unit has been retained similar to forget gate the input gate uses a sigmoid function to control the information from the current input of the cell and the output of the previous unit and adds valuable information to c t the block gate generates a new vector value of x t and h t 1 using the tanh function the vector values and the controlled values generated by the input gate are multiplied together to produce useful information the output gate o t uses a sigmoid function and determines the information of the cell that computes the output of the lstm unit first the tanh function is applied to the cell and a vector is generated then a sigmoid function controls the information and derives the values to be obtained using x t and h t 1 the controlled values and the vector values are multiplied to be used as input for the next unit and output 2 3 4 deep q network before talking about reinforcement learning it is necessary to explain a markov decision process mdp mdp is the mathematical model used to describe the learning problem sutton and barto 2018 there is an agent that makes the decisions and learns within an environment that interacts with the agent at each time t the agent chooses an action a from a set of actions a that can be performed depending on the current state s the environment responds at the next time step by transitioning to a new state s and gives the agent a corresponding reward r a s s the probability that the agent transitions to the new state s is a direct consequence of the previous state and the chosen action more precisely it is given by the state transition function t a s s therefore an mdp consists of a tuple s a t r where s is the set of all environmental states a is all possible moves the agent can make r s a s r is the reward function which r s a s is immediate feedback from the environment evaluating the action a and t s a s 0 1 indicates the probability function that t s a s is the probability that action a in state s at time t leads to state s at time t 1 sutton and barto 2018 policy π s a is a strategy used by the agent to determine the next action based on the current state reinforcement learning is an mdp problem in which an agent interacts with an environment see fig 5 the goal of reinforcement learning is to find the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of long term rewards the long term reward at time t is defined by eq 2 sutton and barto 2018 2 g t r t γ r t 1 γ 2 r t 2 γ 3 r t 3 γ t 1 r t r t n 1 t γ g t 1 where r t is the reward of the terminal state and γ is the discount factor satisfying 0 γ 1 it is necessary to add the discount factor because future states are uncertain the action value function or q function is a function that can measure the value of a state action pair that is for a given state s it can evaluate how good it would be to perform an action the q function for a policy π is defined by eq 3 sutton and barto 2018 3 q π s a e π g t s t s a t a s s a a the optimal policy π is defined as one that maximizes the expected value of rewards to compute π a q value iteration algorithm is used to compute the expected reward of the current state given an arbitrary state s and action a such that its expected q value is q s a it applies the bellman equation 4 until the convergence of q s a denoted by q s a is reached which is used to compute the optimal policy 4 q i s a s t s s a r s a s γ max a q i 1 s a 5 lim i q i s a q s a the optimal policy can be defined using the optimal q function with eq 6 6 π s arg max a q s a a markov decision process whose transition probability function or reward is unknown becomes a reinforcement learning problem deep q learning mnih et al 2013 is a form of reinforcement learning that uses deep learning algorithms to approximate the q function the model is given the current state of the environment and outputs the q value of the current state for each possible action the loss function of the model to predict the q function is defined by eq 7 7 l θ r s t a t s t 1 γ max a t 1 q s t 1 a t 1 θ q s t a t θ 2 where θ are the weights of the network the problem with the vanilla dqn model is that the training of the model is unstable in the error calculation the objective function q value is changed frequently and this unstable objective function makes training difficult to overcome this problem the target network was defined the target network q ˆ is a copy of the q network with the same input output but it updates its weights θ ˆ differently in this paper we used the soft update given by eq 8 lillicrap et al 2016 8 θ ˆ τ θ 1 τ θ ˆ where τ is a number between 0 and 1 that manages the scope of updates for the target network using the target network the loss function can be modified by eq 9 9 l θ r s t a t s t 1 γ max a t 1 q ˆ s t 1 a t 1 θ ˆ q s t a t θ 2 another solution to make the training of the dqn more robust is to use experience replay memory which removes correlations between observations and avoids overfitting the q network lin 1992 at time t the experience of agent is defined as the tuple e t s t a t r t s t 1 where s t is the current state a t is the action performed in the current state r t is the reward from the environment upon execution of action a t and s t 1 is the next state the experience replay memory stores all the experiences the agent has had at each time step over all the episodes it has played during the agent s training a random batch is selected from the replay memory and the agent trains with that batch in this paper a batch size of 64 was chosen 2 4 creating environment for the drl agent an environment is required to collaborate with the agent during training and aid the agent find the optimal policy the first step to construct this interactive training environment is to design the states actions and rewards in our design the agent controls irrigation by observing the climate data irrigation amount irr and swtd the state at time t is defined by a combination of these parameters based on the agent states the agent selects an action every four days table 3 shows the states and actions used in this work for agricultural irrigation the long term reward is defined as net return given by eq 10 10 r y p y w p w where w is the overall water consumption during a season p w is the cost of 1 mm ha ha of water y is the total amount of yield kg and p y is the price of 1 kg of yield an episode contains a loop in which the agent interacts with the training environment by selecting various actions since the reward depends on the crop yield in our implementation an episode is defined as the length of a season during the season the reward is zero and at the end of the season the reward is determined by eq 10 bidirectional lstm blstm extends the lstm model the first recurrent layer in the network is duplicated so that two layers are now adjacent then the input sequence in its original form is provided as input to the first layer and an inverted copy of the input sequence is provided to the second schuster 1997 in alibabaei et al 2021a a two layer bidirectional lstm model consists of 512 nodes in each layer developed for tomato yield prediction using irrigation scheduling and climate big data the model receives daily climate data irrigation scheduling and swtd during a season to predict yield the same model was trained with the new dataset from dssat since the harvest date was set to the ripening date in the dssat the season length was changed from 110 in alibabaei et al 2021a to 172 days and the same change was made in the model root mean square error rmse and the r 2 score were used to evaluate the model willmott et al 1985 rmse and r 2 score are calculated by eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 12 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y ˆ 2 where y i s y s and y ˆ are the true value the predicted value and the mean of the true values respectively in this work the trained model was used to estimate the tomato yield and then calculate the agent s reward at the end of the season another lstm model was trained to estimate the daily swtd one day in advance and complete the agent environment this model is used to predict the next state of the environment in alibabaei et al 2021b 2 2 the code is available at the following link https github com falibabaei soil water content and reference evapotranspiration a single layer bidirectional lstm model consists of 512 nodes was used to predict the soil water content and reference evapotranspiration one day ahead the same structure with the same hyperparameters is trained in this work to predict swtd one day ahead as mentioned earlier lstms can look back many time steps and use this information to make predictions about what will happen next in our implementation irrigation occurs every four days therefore the lookback of the blstm was changed from eight in alibabaei et al 2021b to four days of historical data representing the current state of the environment the output of the model was also changed to predict only swtd and the prediction of eto was removed from it the same hyperparameters and strategy as in alibabaei et al 2021b were used to train the model after defining the state reward and environment design algorithm 1 was created a boolean value done is defined to represent whether a training episode is complete for the drl agent algorithm 1 dqn training environment table image 1 2 5 training configuration of the drl agent a two layer ann cnn and lstm model with 256 nodes were used to estimate the q value since the number of time steps was only four a filter size of three was chosen for each convolutional layer the models receive the current state of the environment and the output is the value for each action exploitation versus exploration is a critical issue in reinforcement learning the rl agent should find the best solution as quickly as possible however if it commits itself too quickly to a solution without sufficient exploration it may lead to local minima or outright failure sutton and barto 2018 to explore the environment the method epsilon greedy was used i e the agent chooses a random action with probability ϵ and takes the optimal action with probability 1 ϵ sutton and barto 2018 the ϵ was set to 1 and at each episode ϵ was decremented by a factor of 0 9997 and stopped when it reached 0 001 the duration of a season was divided into four and the agent chose the irrigation action 42 times in training time the model randomly selects a batch of experiences from memory and training is performed on that batch the batch size is a hyperparameter that must be set before training a batch size of 64 was chosen to speed up training and avoid overfitting or underfitting the model the agent was trained on a dataset from 2010 to 2017 for 10 000 episodes and tested on the last two years 2018 2019 the rewards received by the drl agent were calculated using eq 10 since the net return was very high the agent could not converge to avoid this problem the logarithms of the reward were used to calculate the agent s reward as the net return during a season was zero it was truncated by one so that the reward would not be infinite irrigation costs for 1 ha mm ha were set at 0 5 usd rodrigues 2016 and tomato prices for one hectare at 728 20 usd ton www tridge com these parameters are tunable the average reward was calculated every 50 episodes and when the average reward was improved the weights of the q network were saved after configuring the training of the agent algorithm 2 was created to train the agent algorithm 2 dqn algorithm table image 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of the lstm models the blstm model for yield estimation was trained for a maximum of 500 epochs and it achieved an r 2 score of 0 97 and an rmse of 366 kg ha on the tomato yield test data set the model predicting swtd was also trained for a maximum of 500 epochs and it obtained an rmse osf 6 841 mm and an r 2 score of 0 98 fig 6 shows the actual values of swtd and of tomato yield compared to the predicted value by the models since the result of these two models has already been compared with other models in alibabaei et al 2021a 2021b no comparison with other models was made in this paper the trained lstm models were replaced in algorithms 1 to complete the agent environment 3 2 evaluation of the drl agent fig 7 shows the average rewards received by the agent during the training of the q ann network and the q cnn network as fig 7 shows the agent did not learn and the average rewards during training not only did not improve but actually decreased therefore in the irrigation scheduling problem where the state of the environment is time series the q ann network and the q cnn network do not converge to an optimal policy fig 8 shows the agent s average rewards during the training of the q lstm network the q lstm network showed the best performance in predicting the q table and the reward improved during training compared to ann and the cnn model at the beginning of training the model starts exploring the environment and converges to an optimal policy after a while the reason for the better performance of the lstm is its ability to achieve higher accuracy in time series predictions as it can use information from previous inputs and loops within the lstm layers zheng et al 2019 fig 9 shows the loss of lstm prediction of q table and epsilon during training of q lstm networks as shown in figs 8 and 9 when epsilon is high the model explores the environment and when epsilon becomes lower the model starts exploiting the loss of the lstm predicting q table tends close to zero very quickly but the reward coverage after almost 8000 episodes the agent was tested with the 2018 and 2019 datasets fig 10 shows the swtd predicted by the model and the amount of irrigation chosen by the agent in 2018 and 2019 as the figure shows the agent automatically learned how to avoid overwatering the plants in the beginning it adopts the measure of lower water supply but in the later stages it increases the water supply this prevents wasting water at the beginning of the season and stresses the plants at the end of the season moreover the total precipitation in the 2018 and 2019 seasons was 575 19 mm and 157 mm and the total irrigation amounts were 965 and 1165 ha mm ha respectively therefore the trained model automatically learned to irrigate more when there is less rainfall and it adjusts the irrigation based on climate change table 4 shows the comparison of net return under different irrigation rates as can be seen from the table the trained model obtained the highest net return compared to other fixed irrigation rates the net returns of the trained model improved by 11 in 2018 and 2019 relative to the best net return of the fixed irrigation volume while water consumption was reduced by 20 30 this amount of reduction is significant the analysis of tomato yield shows that the only cases where yield increased compared to the trained model are fixed irrigation at 40 and 50 mm in these cases yield increased by 2 10 but water use increased by 18 55 resulting in a reduction in net return of at least 7 fig 11 shows the swtd under different irrigation rates under the fixed method the swtd is high at the beginning of the season and decreases at the end of the season but the trained model keeps the swtd above a value of 440 and does not stress the plant at the end of the season and does not allow the water to be wasted at the beginning of the season since the model kept swtd above the threshold of 440 the model was compared to a threshold based irrigation method with thresholds of 440 460 and 480 which irrigates a fixed amount of water in four days when swtd is below a threshold the result is shown in tables 5 6 and 7 the percentages next to the net return show the reduction in the net return of the threshold methods compared to the net return of the trained model as can be seen in the tables 5 7 the best net return of the threshold based irrigation method still cannot keep up with the trained model and when the net return of the threshold method approaches the net return of the trained model the amount of water used for irrigation increases significantly for example in 2018 the net return of threshold based irrigation with a threshold of 480 and a fixed water volume of 50 is 1 higher than the net return of the trained model but the amount of water used increased by 9 therefore the trained model performed better than the threshold based irrigation method in terms of net return among the threshold irrigators the threshold of 460 had the best performance but still could not match the performance of the trained model in threshold irrigation 480 with irrigation rates of 40 and 50 mm tomato yield increased between one and 8 but irrigation volume increased by 20 35 compared with the trained model which is a considerable amount of water in other cases of threshold irrigation tomato yield decreased compared with the trained model 4 conclusions in this paper the ability of reinforcement learning to schedule irrigation of a tomato field was investigated a dqn model was trained with seven years of data and tested with two years of data the results show that the lstm model can predict the q table better than cnn and ann models when the states of the environment are time series the trained q lstm network automatically learns to avoid water wastage at the beginning of the season and stress to plants at the end of the season moreover the trained model adjusts the irrigation amount according to climatic changes and rainfall during the season the comparison of the performance of the model was done with fixed base irrigation and threshold based irrigation the comparison result shows that the trained model increased the productivity in the test field and reduced the water consumption 18 30 compared to fixed and threshold based irrigation methods although the net return of threshold based irrigation reached the net return of the trained model at some thresholds water consumption increased significantly therefore reinforcement learning can be used in our case study for irrigation scheduling to avoid water wastage in agriculture without affecting productivity as mentioned in the paper the model was trained with data from a region with sandy or sandy loam soil and climate type of warm mediterranean summer climate and for growing tomatoes each soil type climate type and crop has its own characteristics in order to apply the model in other regions with different soil and climate types or crops the model should be trained with variables from these regions one limitation of the model is that the model was only trained with the simulated data one possibility would be to train the model with the data collected in the field and the simulated data to make it more realistic for real world application one drawback of the dqn model is that the number of actions must be finite which was set to 12 actions in this work future work will investigate algorithms such as deep deterministic policy gradients ddpg that allow continuous actions declaration of competing interest the

9666,in the field of agriculture the water used for irrigation should be given special treatment as it is responsible for a large proportion of total water consumption irrigation scheduling is critical to food production because it guarantees producers a consistent harvest and minimizes the risk of losses due to water shortages therefore the creation of an automatic irrigation method using new technologies is essential new methods such as deep learning algorithms have attracted a lot of attention in agriculture and are already being used successfully in this work a deep q network was trained for irrigation scheduling the agent was trained to schedule irrigation for a tomato field in portugal two long short term memory models were used as the agent environment one predicts the total water in the soil profile on the next day the other one was employed to estimate the yield based on the environmental condition during a season and then measure the net return the agent uses this information to decide the following irrigation amount an artificial neural network a long short term memory and a convolutional neural network were used to estimating the q table during training unlike the long short terms memory model the artificial neural network and the convolutional neural network could not estimate the q table and the agent s reward decreased during training the comparison of the performance of the model was done with fixed base irrigation and threshold based irrigation the trained model increased productivity by 11 and decreased water consumption by 20 30 compared to the fixed method keywords agriculture lstm deep reinforcement learning irrigation scheduling 1 introduction water is the most strategic commodity on the planet and can become scarce if not

lohchab et al 2018 the vast amount of data and information generated by agricultural technology and connectivity will be the basis for smart farms sundmaeker et al 2016 there is a need to analyze and store the huge amount of data collected by sensors per second and to consider and study the observations obtained about the variable attributes of the field artificial intelligence algorithms and in particular deep learning algorithms dl are a tool to extract features from these data and develop decision systems lohchab et al 2018 in a dl model a huge amount of data big data is fed into an artificial neural network valuable features are extracted from the data and these features are used for future predictions najafabadi et al 2014 dl already successfully applied in various fields of agriculture kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 evapotranspiration and soil moisture are two important factors that should be considered in irrigation scheduling tseng et al 2018 applied a convolutional neural network cnn to estimate soil moisture from images the cnn model performed better than rf svm and ann song et al 2016 used a macroscopic cellular automata mca combined with deep belief network dbn to predict soil moisture the proposed model reduced the mean square error by 18 compared to the multilayer perceptron adamala 2018 used a generalized wavelet neural network wnn to estimate the reference evapotranspiration the wnn and artificial neural network ann models outperformed wavelet regression and linear regression methods in saggi and jain 2019 deep learning multilayer perceptron mlp was used to estimate daily evapotranspiration the mlp outperformed the gradient boosting machine random forest and generalized linear models in de oliveira e lucas et al 2020 three convolutional neural networks cnn with unique structures were used to predict evapotranspiration the cnn model performed better than the seasonal arima sarima and seasonal naive model snaive in terms of computational complexity accuracy and variance in deep learning recurrent neural networks are developed to model time series data a neural network was implemented in adeyemi et al 2018 to predict soil moisture the model achieved r 2 above 0 94 in all test areas a long short terms memory lstm model was used in zhang et al 2018 to estimate agricultural groundwater depth data from 14 years were used including precipitation water runoff temperature reference evapotranspiration and groundwater depth the lstm model performed better compared to feed forward neural network ffnn alibabaei et al 2021b used a singlelayer bidirectional lstm model to predict evapotranspiration and soil water content one day in advance during the test period an r 2 score between 0 96 and 0 98 was obtained the cnn model was added to the lstm to investigate possible performance improvement performance decreased in all data sets due to the complexity of the model however farmers do not have the knowledge to work with soil water content or evapotranspiration and need an expert to analyze the data which makes it impractical for small farms in this work we trained a deep q lstm networks network model that uses this knowledge and simply tells farmers when and how much to irrigate to achieve the best productivity without wasting water for a tomato field 2 materials and methods a computer system comprising an intel core i7 9700 cpu 32 0 gb ram and an nvidia geforce rtx 2080 graphics card was used for the work the tensorflow 2 1 0 framework and keras library 2 2 4 tf were used to implement the models fig 1 shows the general framework of this work which consists of four parts first historical data are collected from various sources and prepared for use as input to the models fig 1 a then two lstm models are trained on the obtained historical data to predict swtd for the next day and tomato yield at the end of a season respectivly fig 1 b training the lstm models is a unique process and after training they use as a feature in the drl training environment which takes the current state s historical climate data and action a amount of irrigation and then returns the next state s and reward r fig 1 c during the agent s training it selects an action for the next irrigation based on the current state of the field and evaluates that action using a function called q value the environment receives the current state and the action chosen by the agent and indicates the next state and the reward this interaction between the drl agent and training environment is repeated until the drl agent converges to an optimal strategy for choosing the next day s irrigation amount fig 1 c and d 1 1 the codes can be found in the following link https github com falibabaei dqn irrigation in agriculture fig 2 in the following section each part of the framework is explained in detail 2 1 data collection in this paper the climate dataset for fadagosa portugal of alibabaei et al 2021a was used which comes from the government agency of the ministries of agriculture and the sea the direç ão regional de agricultura e pescas do centro portugal www drapc gov pt the soil type in fadagosa is sandy or sandy loam permeable with low to medium organic matter content with low reaction from acid to neutral rich in phosphorus and potassium and without salinity the climate in fadagosa is a warm mediterranean summer climate alibabaei et al 2021a the location and details of the dataset were described in tables 1 and 2 fig 3 also shows the time series of the dataset to create an environment in which a drl agent can interact during the training period crop yields and total soil water in profile swtd based on different irrigation were needed in addition to climate data in the real world recording crop yields and swtd with various irrigation is extremely time consuming and sometimes impractical therefore decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat was employed to simulate these variables dssat is a software operating program consisting of crop production simulation models for more than 42 crops that evaluate the effects of environmental and management influences on crop production dssat simulates crop yield response to water tomato yields were simulated using dssat under different irrigation schedules in fadagosa the crop simulation model cropgro tomato from dssat was used to conduct the study the soil type selected was sandy loam which is typical of fadagosa the planting date was fixed to the first of april and the harvest date to the time of maturity in each season tomato seedlings were selected as direct seeding in a single row with a planting distance of 60 cm the initial soil condition was selected with 70 available water sprinkler irrigation was selected as an irrigation method which is adjustable in the dssat software four days and values between 0 and 60 were chosen as the time and depth norms for determining the irrigation schedule the irrigation amount for each experimental year included no irrigation and specified depths of 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 60 mm per four days eto calculator is a software developed by the land and water division of fao to calculate reference evapotranspiration using the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 in this work this software was used to calculate eto see fig 3 2 2 data pre processing the same data preprocessing as in alibabaei et al 2021a including filling missing data with the moving average method removing multicollinear parameters in the dataset and normalizing parameters between 0 and 1 was applied in this work the variance inflation factor vif is a measure of the extent of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables and an instrument for measuring the degree of multicollinearity between variables james et al 2014 in this paper the vif was used to remove the variables with a vif greater than 5 in the end the variables average temperature t avg average humidity hr avg average wind speed ws avg reference evapotranspiration eto total soil water in profile swtd irrigation and precipitation prec remain as inputs to the model the goal of normalization is to bring the values of the numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale without distorting the differences in the ranges of values for machine learning normalization is required only when the resources have different value ranges the eq 1 was used to bring data between 0 and 1 1 y x x m i n x m a x x m i n where x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values in the dataset 2 3 deep learning algorithm machine learning is a data analysis technique that allows computers to extract information from data to detect patterns and decide with minimal human intervention it is a subfield of artificial intelligence that teaches computers the ability to perform tasks based on examples without explicit programming nguyen et al 2019 liakos et al 2018 presented an overview of the application of ml algorithm in various agricultural activities of farming dl is a subfield of machine learning the term deep points to the number of hidden layers in the design of artificial neural networks each layer converts the input into actionable information that an adjacent layer can use for a prediction task since the models of dl are faster and more efficient compared to the traditional ml models and unlike them have the ability to automatically extract features from the input data they have been increasingly used in recent years the dl algorithms are successfully used for detection classification and segmentation sermanet et al 2013 three types of dl models were used in this work which is listed below 2 3 1 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks ann is part of the machine learning domain and their use is broad in supervised learning anns are applicable to both regression and classification problems in ml murtagh 1991 an artificial neural network performs its processing through neurons distributed in layers aiming for a structure analogous to neurons in the human brain murtagh 1991 the layers of ann models consist of an input layer hidden layers fully connected layers and the output the input layer processes the data input the hidden layers are linear functions that add weights and biases to the input of the layer and extract features from the input data and do the processing finally the output layer is the final result of neural network processing activation functions are used after a convolution layer to introduce nonlinearities into the model there are many functions such as sigmoid tanh and softmax however the most suitable for convolutional networks is relu as it is computationally more efficient without much difference in accuracy compared to other functions this function reset al negative values from the output of the previous layer murtagh 1991 2 3 2 convolutional neural networks the convolutional layer applies filters to extract features from the input of the layer these filters are matrices of weights and biases applied to the previous output layer a filter applies to a region of the image and a dot product between the input and the filter is calculated and a matrix is an output then the filter is shifted and this process is repeated until the filter has swept all the inputs the final output of the layer is called feature maps similar to the ann model the activation function is used after each convolution layer to add nonlinearity to the model a pooling layer is applied to simplify the information from the previous layer the most commonly used method is max pooling where only the larger unit number is passed to the output this data pooling is used to reduce the number of weights to be learned and to avoid overfitting 2 3 3 recurrent neural network and long short terms memory structure recurrent neural network rnn is constructed to deal with sequential data with a temporal dataset unlike cnn and aan its purpose is to use data from a previous input to understand the current data patterson and gibson 2017 rnn can be considered as several copies of a network each of which transmits information to another network the drawback of the rnn model is that for large inputs the gradient of the loss function may approach zero during the training of the model eventually causing the failure to update the weights of the first layer patterson and gibson 2017 to overcome this drawback the long short terms memory lstm was designed a typical lstm unit comprises of several gates including an input gate i t an output gate o t a block input z t a forget gate f t and a memory cell c t see fig 4 the first step of the lstm unit is to determine what information to discard from the previous cell state the forget gate makes this decision using a sigmoid function first a linear combination of the input x t at time t and the output of the previous unit h t 1 is computed by multiplying with weight and bias matrices then a sigmoid function inputs the combination and outputs a number in the range of 0 and 1 zero means that all knowledge has been forgotten and the output of one means that all information from the previous unit has been retained similar to forget gate the input gate uses a sigmoid function to control the information from the current input of the cell and the output of the previous unit and adds valuable information to c t the block gate generates a new vector value of x t and h t 1 using the tanh function the vector values and the controlled values generated by the input gate are multiplied together to produce useful information the output gate o t uses a sigmoid function and determines the information of the cell that computes the output of the lstm unit first the tanh function is applied to the cell and a vector is generated then a sigmoid function controls the information and derives the values to be obtained using x t and h t 1 the controlled values and the vector values are multiplied to be used as input for the next unit and output 2 3 4 deep q network before talking about reinforcement learning it is necessary to explain a markov decision process mdp mdp is the mathematical model used to describe the learning problem sutton and barto 2018 there is an agent that makes the decisions and learns within an environment that interacts with the agent at each time t the agent chooses an action a from a set of actions a that can be performed depending on the current state s the environment responds at the next time step by transitioning to a new state s and gives the agent a corresponding reward r a s s the probability that the agent transitions to the new state s is a direct consequence of the previous state and the chosen action more precisely it is given by the state transition function t a s s therefore an mdp consists of a tuple s a t r where s is the set of all environmental states a is all possible moves the agent can make r s a s r is the reward function which r s a s is immediate feedback from the environment evaluating the action a and t s a s 0 1 indicates the probability function that t s a s is the probability that action a in state s at time t leads to state s at time t 1 sutton and barto 2018 policy π s a is a strategy used by the agent to determine the next action based on the current state reinforcement learning is an mdp problem in which an agent interacts with an environment see fig 5 the goal of reinforcement learning is to find the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of long term rewards the long term reward at time t is defined by eq 2 sutton and barto 2018 2 g t r t γ r t 1 γ 2 r t 2 γ 3 r t 3 γ t 1 r t r t n 1 t γ g t 1 where r t is the reward of the terminal state and γ is the discount factor satisfying 0 γ 1 it is necessary to add the discount factor because future states are uncertain the action value function or q function is a function that can measure the value of a state action pair that is for a given state s it can evaluate how good it would be to perform an action the q function for a policy π is defined by eq 3 sutton and barto 2018 3 q π s a e π g t s t s a t a s s a a the optimal policy π is defined as one that maximizes the expected value of rewards to compute π a q value iteration algorithm is used to compute the expected reward of the current state given an arbitrary state s and action a such that its expected q value is q s a it applies the bellman equation 4 until the convergence of q s a denoted by q s a is reached which is used to compute the optimal policy 4 q i s a s t s s a r s a s γ max a q i 1 s a 5 lim i q i s a q s a the optimal policy can be defined using the optimal q function with eq 6 6 π s arg max a q s a a markov decision process whose transition probability function or reward is unknown becomes a reinforcement learning problem deep q learning mnih et al 2013 is a form of reinforcement learning that uses deep learning algorithms to approximate the q function the model is given the current state of the environment and outputs the q value of the current state for each possible action the loss function of the model to predict the q function is defined by eq 7 7 l θ r s t a t s t 1 γ max a t 1 q s t 1 a t 1 θ q s t a t θ 2 where θ are the weights of the network the problem with the vanilla dqn model is that the training of the model is unstable in the error calculation the objective function q value is changed frequently and this unstable objective function makes training difficult to overcome this problem the target network was defined the target network q ˆ is a copy of the q network with the same input output but it updates its weights θ ˆ differently in this paper we used the soft update given by eq 8 lillicrap et al 2016 8 θ ˆ τ θ 1 τ θ ˆ where τ is a number between 0 and 1 that manages the scope of updates for the target network using the target network the loss function can be modified by eq 9 9 l θ r s t a t s t 1 γ max a t 1 q ˆ s t 1 a t 1 θ ˆ q s t a t θ 2 another solution to make the training of the dqn more robust is to use experience replay memory which removes correlations between observations and avoids overfitting the q network lin 1992 at time t the experience of agent is defined as the tuple e t s t a t r t s t 1 where s t is the current state a t is the action performed in the current state r t is the reward from the environment upon execution of action a t and s t 1 is the next state the experience replay memory stores all the experiences the agent has had at each time step over all the episodes it has played during the agent s training a random batch is selected from the replay memory and the agent trains with that batch in this paper a batch size of 64 was chosen 2 4 creating environment for the drl agent an environment is required to collaborate with the agent during training and aid the agent find the optimal policy the first step to construct this interactive training environment is to design the states actions and rewards in our design the agent controls irrigation by observing the climate data irrigation amount irr and swtd the state at time t is defined by a combination of these parameters based on the agent states the agent selects an action every four days table 3 shows the states and actions used in this work for agricultural irrigation the long term reward is defined as net return given by eq 10 10 r y p y w p w where w is the overall water consumption during a season p w is the cost of 1 mm ha ha of water y is the total amount of yield kg and p y is the price of 1 kg of yield an episode contains a loop in which the agent interacts with the training environment by selecting various actions since the reward depends on the crop yield in our implementation an episode is defined as the length of a season during the season the reward is zero and at the end of the season the reward is determined by eq 10 bidirectional lstm blstm extends the lstm model the first recurrent layer in the network is duplicated so that two layers are now adjacent then the input sequence in its original form is provided as input to the first layer and an inverted copy of the input sequence is provided to the second schuster 1997 in alibabaei et al 2021a a two layer bidirectional lstm model consists of 512 nodes in each layer developed for tomato yield prediction using irrigation scheduling and climate big data the model receives daily climate data irrigation scheduling and swtd during a season to predict yield the same model was trained with the new dataset from dssat since the harvest date was set to the ripening date in the dssat the season length was changed from 110 in alibabaei et al 2021a to 172 days and the same change was made in the model root mean square error rmse and the r 2 score were used to evaluate the model willmott et al 1985 rmse and r 2 score are calculated by eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 12 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y ˆ 2 where y i s y s and y ˆ are the true value the predicted value and the mean of the true values respectively in this work the trained model was used to estimate the tomato yield and then calculate the agent s reward at the end of the season another lstm model was trained to estimate the daily swtd one day in advance and complete the agent environment this model is used to predict the next state of the environment in alibabaei et al 2021b 2 2 the code is available at the following link https github com falibabaei soil water content and reference evapotranspiration a single layer bidirectional lstm model consists of 512 nodes was used to predict the soil water content and reference evapotranspiration one day ahead the same structure with the same hyperparameters is trained in this work to predict swtd one day ahead as mentioned earlier lstms can look back many time steps and use this information to make predictions about what will happen next in our implementation irrigation occurs every four days therefore the lookback of the blstm was changed from eight in alibabaei et al 2021b to four days of historical data representing the current state of the environment the output of the model was also changed to predict only swtd and the prediction of eto was removed from it the same hyperparameters and strategy as in alibabaei et al 2021b were used to train the model after defining the state reward and environment design algorithm 1 was created a boolean value done is defined to represent whether a training episode is complete for the drl agent algorithm 1 dqn training environment table image 1 2 5 training configuration of the drl agent a two layer ann cnn and lstm model with 256 nodes were used to estimate the q value since the number of time steps was only four a filter size of three was chosen for each convolutional layer the models receive the current state of the environment and the output is the value for each action exploitation versus exploration is a critical issue in reinforcement learning the rl agent should find the best solution as quickly as possible however if it commits itself too quickly to a solution without sufficient exploration it may lead to local minima or outright failure sutton and barto 2018 to explore the environment the method epsilon greedy was used i e the agent chooses a random action with probability ϵ and takes the optimal action with probability 1 ϵ sutton and barto 2018 the ϵ was set to 1 and at each episode ϵ was decremented by a factor of 0 9997 and stopped when it reached 0 001 the duration of a season was divided into four and the agent chose the irrigation action 42 times in training time the model randomly selects a batch of experiences from memory and training is performed on that batch the batch size is a hyperparameter that must be set before training a batch size of 64 was chosen to speed up training and avoid overfitting or underfitting the model the agent was trained on a dataset from 2010 to 2017 for 10 000 episodes and tested on the last two years 2018 2019 the rewards received by the drl agent were calculated using eq 10 since the net return was very high the agent could not converge to avoid this problem the logarithms of the reward were used to calculate the agent s reward as the net return during a season was zero it was truncated by one so that the reward would not be infinite irrigation costs for 1 ha mm ha were set at 0 5 usd rodrigues 2016 and tomato prices for one hectare at 728 20 usd ton www tridge com these parameters are tunable the average reward was calculated every 50 episodes and when the average reward was improved the weights of the q network were saved after configuring the training of the agent algorithm 2 was created to train the agent algorithm 2 dqn algorithm table image 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of the lstm models the blstm model for yield estimation was trained for a maximum of 500 epochs and it achieved an r 2 score of 0 97 and an rmse of 366 kg ha on the tomato yield test data set the model predicting swtd was also trained for a maximum of 500 epochs and it obtained an rmse osf 6 841 mm and an r 2 score of 0 98 fig 6 shows the actual values of swtd and of tomato yield compared to the predicted value by the models since the result of these two models has already been compared with other models in alibabaei et al 2021a 2021b no comparison with other models was made in this paper the trained lstm models were replaced in algorithms 1 to complete the agent environment 3 2 evaluation of the drl agent fig 7 shows the average rewards received by the agent during the training of the q ann network and the q cnn network as fig 7 shows the agent did not learn and the average rewards during training not only did not improve but actually decreased therefore in the irrigation scheduling problem where the state of the environment is time series the q ann network and the q cnn network do not converge to an optimal policy fig 8 shows the agent s average rewards during the training of the q lstm network the q lstm network showed the best performance in predicting the q table and the reward improved during training compared to ann and the cnn model at the beginning of training the model starts exploring the environment and converges to an optimal policy after a while the reason for the better performance of the lstm is its ability to achieve higher accuracy in time series predictions as it can use information from previous inputs and loops within the lstm layers zheng et al 2019 fig 9 shows the loss of lstm prediction of q table and epsilon during training of q lstm networks as shown in figs 8 and 9 when epsilon is high the model explores the environment and when epsilon becomes lower the model starts exploiting the loss of the lstm predicting q table tends close to zero very quickly but the reward coverage after almost 8000 episodes the agent was tested with the 2018 and 2019 datasets fig 10 shows the swtd predicted by the model and the amount of irrigation chosen by the agent in 2018 and 2019 as the figure shows the agent automatically learned how to avoid overwatering the plants in the beginning it adopts the measure of lower water supply but in the later stages it increases the water supply this prevents wasting water at the beginning of the season and stresses the plants at the end of the season moreover the total precipitation in the 2018 and 2019 seasons was 575 19 mm and 157 mm and the total irrigation amounts were 965 and 1165 ha mm ha respectively therefore the trained model automatically learned to irrigate more when there is less rainfall and it adjusts the irrigation based on climate change table 4 shows the comparison of net return under different irrigation rates as can be seen from the table the trained model obtained the highest net return compared to other fixed irrigation rates the net returns of the trained model improved by 11 in 2018 and 2019 relative to the best net return of the fixed irrigation volume while water consumption was reduced by 20 30 this amount of reduction is significant the analysis of tomato yield shows that the only cases where yield increased compared to the trained model are fixed irrigation at 40 and 50 mm in these cases yield increased by 2 10 but water use increased by 18 55 resulting in a reduction in net return of at least 7 fig 11 shows the swtd under different irrigation rates under the fixed method the swtd is high at the beginning of the season and decreases at the end of the season but the trained model keeps the swtd above a value of 440 and does not stress the plant at the end of the season and does not allow the water to be wasted at the beginning of the season since the model kept swtd above the threshold of 440 the model was compared to a threshold based irrigation method with thresholds of 440 460 and 480 which irrigates a fixed amount of water in four days when swtd is below a threshold the result is shown in tables 5 6 and 7 the percentages next to the net return show the reduction in the net return of the threshold methods compared to the net return of the trained model as can be seen in the tables 5 7 the best net return of the threshold based irrigation method still cannot keep up with the trained model and when the net return of the threshold method approaches the net return of the trained model the amount of water used for irrigation increases significantly for example in 2018 the net return of threshold based irrigation with a threshold of 480 and a fixed water volume of 50 is 1 higher than the net return of the trained model but the amount of water used increased by 9 therefore the trained model performed better than the threshold based irrigation method in terms of net return among the threshold irrigators the threshold of 460 had the best performance but still could not match the performance of the trained model in threshold irrigation 480 with irrigation rates of 40 and 50 mm tomato yield increased between one and 8 but irrigation volume increased by 20 35 compared with the trained model which is a considerable amount of water in other cases of threshold irrigation tomato yield decreased compared with the trained model 4 conclusions in this paper the ability of reinforcement learning to schedule irrigation of a tomato field was investigated a dqn model was trained with seven years of data and tested with two years of data the results show that the lstm model can predict the q table better than cnn and ann models when the states of the environment are time series the trained q lstm network automatically learns to avoid water wastage at the beginning of the season and stress to plants at the end of the season moreover the trained model adjusts the irrigation amount according to climatic changes and rainfall during the season the comparison of the performance of the model was done with fixed base irrigation and threshold based irrigation the comparison result shows that the trained model increased the productivity in the test field and reduced the water consumption 18 30 compared to fixed and threshold based irrigation methods although the net return of threshold based irrigation reached the net return of the trained model at some thresholds water consumption increased significantly therefore reinforcement learning can be used in our case study for irrigation scheduling to avoid water wastage in agriculture without affecting productivity as mentioned in the paper the model was trained with data from a region with sandy or sandy loam soil and climate type of warm mediterranean summer climate and for growing tomatoes each soil type climate type and crop has its own characteristics in order to apply the model in other regions with different soil and climate types or crops the model should be trained with variables from these regions one limitation of the model is that the model was only trained with the simulated data one possibility would be to train the model with the data collected in the field and the simulated data to make it more realistic for real world application one drawback of the dqn model is that the number of actions must be finite which was set to 12 actions in this work future work will investigate algorithms such as deep deterministic policy gradients ddpg that allow continuous actions declaration of competing interest the

e the black plastic raises the soil temperature above ambient level in summer tarara 2000 as a result the physical process mechanisms of the land atmosphere interactions within film mulched agroecosystems have also attracted more scholarly attention lately chen et al 2020 feng et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 biophysical one dimensional and multilayered process based models are often used to distinctively simulate the interactions within the canopy air space to precisely determine crop water use or evapotranspiration in complex agroecosystems ding et al 2015 french et al 2015 ochege et al 2019 the penman monteith p m algorithm performs well under fully covered canopy monteith 1965 while compartmental models such as the shuttle wallace s w model can efficiently estimate soil evaporation and canopy transpiration separately shuttleworth and wallace 1985 however the effectiveness of s w model can be affected by canopy and soil surface resistances kato et al 2004 under plastic film mulching condition the adjusted s w model can improve the accuracy of the original p m and s w models however these three et models have been found to significantly overestimate underestimate crop et in arid agroecosystem in northwest china li et al 2013 other experimental methods include the land surface models lsms and regional circulation models rcms or their coupling zeng et al 2017 but their robustness is guaranteed mostly at global scales ham and kluitenberg 1994 had earlier employed the newton raphson method to model the influence of mulches on surface energy partitioning and soil temperature regimes though it was applied over a short term but the model is very robust and can concurrently iterate the plastic mulch soil system in complex ecosystems and at point scale yang et al 2012 ding et al 2013 used a modified priestly taylor model to accurately estimate the diurnal variation of evapotranspiration et over an irrigated maize field the study revealed the exact threshold of maize crop water stress and pointed out that plastic film mulching together with other controlling factors can impact soil temperature and its radiative budget thereby reducing soil evaporation and plant senescence the use of process based et methods for example the modified priestley taylor pt model illustrates that with cognizance to the surface type the conductance of energy fluxes particularly sensible heat from a film and non film mulched soils are different ding et al 2015 2013 besides that the choice of method can produce varied outputs little changes in their parameterization can as well produce contradicting results e g kustas and norman 1999 as such relatively small variations in the land energy budget in complex agroecosystems induced by irrigation activities can cause significant changes in land atmosphere interactions because net radiation tends to respond differently to surface types bateni et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the experiment by tarara and ham 1999 which approximated aerodynamic conductance to heat transfer between bare soil and the black plastic mulch by using a sensor based measurement found that the plastics used for surface mulching are a major source of sensible heat over crop fields this suggests the need for continuous investigation particularly on surface resistances to energy fluxes under plastic film mulched soil conditions in complex terrains at a much higher level of complexity several studies adapt the priestly taylor based two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 priestly and taylor 1972 and its refined versions which apply the simple linear mixing technique gan et al 2019 kustas et al 2012 kustas and norman 1999 using satellite data such as landsat the tseb can address potential uncertainty issues of angular dependence of the radiometric thermal radiation which is absent in the single source models this is the difference between observed surface temperature t r θ and aerodynamic temperature t o to satisfy the bulk resistance formulation for sensible heat transfer across different terrains kustas and anderson 2009 kustas et al 2012 yao et al 2010 the tseb model is very skillful in determining both the sublayer and above canopy energy fluxes kustas et al 2012 it has also been reliably used for investigating the ecohydrological characteristics of wetland ecosystems yao et al 2010 and for mapping the spatial distribution of crop drought index wu et al 2018 the energy fluxes computed from the soil and vegetation composites in tseb have been found to be more robust in the tseb modification series colaizzi et al 2012 gan and gao 2015 song et al 2016 notwithstanding the several refinements on the tseb model there exists no evidence of its application to assess plastic mulch irrigation effects across the complex and arid continental central asia therefore this study applied the tseb schematization because of its advantage to simplify the fluxes between vegetation soil and the canopy air space unlike the single source models which schematizes with the big leaf structure but cannot directly differentiate between soil evaporation and plant transpiration zhang et al 2020 this study improves our knowledge by evaluating the refinement of the tseb model to calibrate film mulched soil effects of intensified irrigation practices on vapor and surface energy fluxes over an irrigated cotton field using the fine landsat scale resolution data specifically the study incorporates a mulch layer component based on a thermal contact resistance model ham and kluitenberg 1994 into the tseb model to 1 simulate the effects of the changes in mulch optical properties on surface energy fluxes and to 2 determine how much of irrigated water contributes to cotton production at different development stages when et is partitioned into evaporation e and transpiration t under the plastic film mulched soil condition in this way the added value of the tseb simulations over a drip irrigated cotton field with plastic mulch can be effectively explored interpreted and adequately represented in complex and arid agroecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site design and eddy covariance ec measurements the experiment was carried out in an oasis agroecosystem in xinjiang china at 85 86488128 e 44 29754019 n on an elevation of 469 23 m which is located in the north tianshan mountains of central asia fig 1 the central asian region is broadly typified by arid continental climate with patchy terrains sparse canopies and mountain ranges hence the huge attraction for irrigation agriculture zhang et al 2019 cotton gossypium hirsutum l xinluzao 36 production constitutes two third of the total agricultural productivity of the major cash crops from the region as such the general irrigation design of the cotton fields consumes over two thirds of the total agricultural water supplied to the region ai and yang 2016 the experiment was conducted on a sub plot of a large cotton field covering 39 600 m2 for two growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 fig 1 specifically the sub plot of cotton field treatment comprises of average row and planting spacing of 0 38 m and 0 11 m respectively the field has a mean population density of about 24 5 plants per m2 within a field area of 330 120 m2 zhou et al 2012 table 1 shows the irrigation schedule describing the cotton growth stages the direction of cotton rows is oriented north westerly separated by the width of the row spacing into narrow 10 cm and wide 60 cm rows allowing the placement pegging and coverage of the drip pipes under plastic films at the edge of the soil the soil type is grayish sandy loamy with about 42 silt 39 sand and 19 clay at the depth of 0 30 mm zhou et al 2012 the site has an average field capacity of 27 with a bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 during the study period about 80 of the cotton fields are covered with perforated plastic polyethylene 0 08 mm thick under drip irrigation system starting from april to september 2009 and to october 2010 the holes are separated 10 cm apart from each other such that the drip hose placement under the plastic film is tolerable thereby allowing about 1 cm gap between the film mulch and the soil surface depending on the day s soil moisture the usual practice is to apply the drip irrigation at least 7 10 times at 10 days interval for each growing season soil moisture content is observed before and after application at depths between 20 cm and 160 cm soil depths using a tcav probe campbell scientific inc logan ut usa the cotton seed yield in 2009 and 2010 were 4 5 t hm2 and 3 9 t hm2 while the consecutive cotton densities achieved in both years were 26 57 plant m2 and 28 94 plant m2 respectively sometimes dissolve nitrogen fertilizer is added into the irrigation system bai et al 2015 the cotton is sown in early april development starts mid april while between september and mid october they are harvested so we extended the julian day of the year doy selected for the crop water stress and energy balance simulations to october for the growing season of 2010 the total length of growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 are 188 and 160 days respectively however only doy with corresponding clear sky landsat data were investigated table 2 the eddy covariance ec flux tower installed in the cotton field consisted of a three dimensional 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa system and an li 7500 open path infra red gas analyzer li cor inc lincoln

cnr 1 kipp zonen delft netherlands was used to measure radiation components at 3 m above cotton canopy a data logger was in place to automatically register the flux records in ghg format at a sampling frequency of 10 hz every 30 min interval meteorological parameters including air temperature and relative humidity were concurrently measured with a temperature probe hmp45d and relative humidity probe vaisala inc helsinki finland at 2 m above the ground a 20 cm diameter standard rain gauge and a ptb220 barometer vaisala helsinki finland were installed to record precipitation and atmospheric air pressure respectively wind speed and wind direction were respectively captured using el15 1a and el1 2d sensors zhonghuan tig tianjin china more information of the ec technique at our experiment including the initial data preprocessing are already documented bai et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 during the period daily meteorological conditions in both seasons were fairly typical of an arid continental climate with temperature rates that required equitable water use hence the use of plastic mulching under the drip irrigation condition annual mean precipitation and temperature are 210 mm and 7 0 c respectively table 1 fig 2 2 2 remote sensing data collection and preprocessing 2 2 1 landsat 5 tm and 7 etm a total of 22 clear sky imageries including 12 landsat 5 tm 10 landsat 7 etm oli tirs were collected from the usgs portal www earthexplorer usgs gov the spatial resolution of the near infrared and visible bands is 30 m x 30 m while the thermal band is 60 120 60 120 m all scenes were properly preprocessed ochege et al 2019 to prepare the initial input variables including surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndiv and air temperature ta from which canopy component temperature tc and soil component temperature ts were derived following principles described by norman et al 1995 others include leaf area index lai fractional vegetation cover fc and vegetation green fraction all these primary variables are required inputs for the two source energy balance model and its revised versions gan and gao 2015 song et al 2016 we maintained a 30 m resolution for all datasets using the bilinear resampling method the temporal resolution span through the growing season of 2009 and 2010 their acquisition dates are represented by the doy at the corresponding local time with the satellite overpass time for each image table 2 these corresponding local time with that of satellite overpass time for each image were considered in the model parameterization as instantaneous outputs which are extrapolated to daily energy and et output for the doy using the one time of day calculation colaizzi et al 2014 2 3 parameterization of plastic film mulch irrigation effect on surface energy exchange to determine the plastic mulched soil effects on surface energy fluxes in the cotton field of experiment this study took consideration of the satellite overpass doys for available clear sky scenes with cognizance to the irrigation timing which corresponds to the cotton growth stages spanning through growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 tables 1 and 2 then to solve for the radiation transferred to the surface and absorbed by the canopy the standard equation is first applied to partition net radiation r n w m 2 into turbulent heat fluxes according to equ 1 1 r n g 0 λ e h where h g 0 and λ e represents the sensible heat ground heat and latent heat fluxes respectively negative and positive values symbolize fluxes moving towards and from the surface respectively then the tseb framework norman et al 1995 which is the most robust land surface temperature based et partitioning model especially for similar complex terrains as ours is employed here kustas and norman 1999 song et al 2016 the tseb model is applied to relate the directional surface temperature t r to the soil and vegetation component temperatures t s and t c at the radiometer view angle i e from remotely sensed directional brightness temperature of the fractional vegetation cover f c by a simple linear mixing as illustrated in equ 2 colaizzi et al 2012 kustas and anderson 2009 2 t r θ f c θ t c 4 1 f c θ t s 4 0 25 where t c and t s are the pixel component temperatures k 1 f c θ is the sensor observed thermal fractional vegetation cover at the view zenith angle θ obtained from lai as an exponential clumping index ω based on equ 3 3a f c θ 1 exp 0 5 ω θ lai cos θ 3b ω θ ω 0 ω max ω 0 ω max ω 0 exp k θ p where ω max approaches unity for an azimuth view perpendicular to the crop row p 3 8 0 46 d the ratio between the canopy height and the nominal clump width is d while k depends on the stand architecture for azimuthal views perpendicular to the row k can be obtained by the expression k 0 3 1 7 ω 0 14 sánchez et al 2008 t r θ in the tseb model can simulate the differences between observed surface temperature and aerodynamic temperature t o to satisfy the bulk resistance formulation for latent and sensible heat transfers kustas and anderson 2009 thus using both t c and t s the soil and vegetation net radiation represented by r n s and r n c eqs 4 7 are then estimated with composite or component temperatures these formulations have been extensively utilized and documented colaizzi et al 2012 song et al 2016 4 r n c h c λ e c 5 r n s h s λ

boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 wm 2 k 4 we set our emissivity value at 0 95 for the experiment site t 0 is the land surface temperature i e lst while the incoming longwave and shortwave radiation w m 2 from the sky are denoted by l and s respectively s and c represent soil and canopy layers α s and α c are the soil and vegetation albedo τ lw and τ sw are the longwave and shortwave radiation transmittances via canopy while emissivity of the soil and canopy essentials are given as ε s and ε c respectively h computation from both h s and h c through the boundary canopy layer t ac follows the original tseb formulations for normal irrigated conditions according to equs 8 9 colaizzi et al 2012 8 h c ρ c p t c t ac r x 9 h s ρ c p t s t ac r s where r s and r x are the resistances to heat flux in the boundary layer directly above the soil surface and the boundary layer near the canopy respectively s m 1 the mathematical derivations aerodynamic resistances of r a r s and r x using the monin obukov similarity theory all follows through the initial tseb formulation which are also extensively documented kustas and norman 1999 norman et al 1995 then on the assumption that heat storage within a partially film mulched soil cannot be neglected due to the planting holes and or the gap between mulch and soil i e 1 cm as compared to a fully covered soil surface by the mulch we attempt a definition of the thermal contact resistance between the soil surface and the plastic film mulch ham and kluitenberg 1994 a schematic representation of the soil mulch vegetation atmosphere system is shown in fig 3 the resistance network of the tseb models can be adjusted as they are less sensitive to uncertainties in lai and the near surface soil moisture which has proven very effective among the temperature based et models gan and gao 2015 gan et al 2019 it is hypothesized that definite changes in the optical properties of longwave and or shortwave spectrums based on radiation reflectance are inevitable given a plastic mulched soil system under drip irrigation condition this is based on the principle that the mulch absorbs global irradiance shortwave radiation reflected from the underlying soil and longwave radiation emitted by the sky and the soil ham and kluitenberg 1994 in this case the net radiation absorbed by the plastic mulch for the mulched soil heat transfer can be expressed as follows equs 10 11 10 r n m h m s h 0 11 r n m a m s 1 ρ τ m ρ s ε m ε sky σ t r 4 1 ρ i r τ m i r 1 ε s ρ i r ε m ε s σt s 4 ρ i r ε m 2 σt m 4 1 ε s 2 σε m t m 4 where α m τ m ε m and τ m ir represents the shortwave absorbed by the mulch shortwave transmitted by the mulch longwave emitted and transmitted by the mulch respectively t m is the temperature of the mulch k 1 ρ s is the shortwave reflectance of the soil ρ ir is an infinite series term which accounts for the multiple reflectances of the longwave between the mulch and the soil surface the mathematical expansion details are according to ham and kluitenberg 1994 a clearer expression of how the energy balance equation within the mulch and soil layers are derived are shown as follows yuan et al 2019 12 r n m s h m s g m 0 13 r n m s w m l w m 14 r n m s s w s l w s where r n m and r n m s represents net radiation available to the mulch and soil surface covered by the plastic film w m 2 g m is the heat fluxes absorbed by soil that is covered by plastic mulch w m 2 h m s is the sensible heat flux in between the mulch and soil w m 2 s w m l w m s w s and l w s represents the net shortwave and longwave radiation absorbed by the mulch and soil layers covered by the plastic mulch w m 2 respectively then the downward shortwave radiation to the mulch surface is balanced by the reflection and the absorption of the mulch in addition to multiple reflections between the mulch and soil surface and can be obtained as follows yang et al 2012 15 s w m α m 1 ρ τ m ρ s s w 16 s w s 1 ρ s ρ τ m s w 17 l w m ε m 1 ρ ir τ

contribution c g to r n and the constant of mulch fraction δ m i e δ m 0 8 derived from field measurements yuan et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 19 g m c g 1 δ m r n m s note that c g value can range between 0 2 and 0 5 depending on soil property or its moisture content sánchez et al 2008 in this study c g was determined as 0 3 based on consideration of underneath temperature change caused by the plastic mulch and the irrigation which retains the soil moisture yet pose no limitation to the cotton growth previous studies which applied c g in the tseb model expressed it in time interval eg colaizzi et al 2012 we show in fig 3 the modified energy series resistance network as it applies to this study it is still patterned after norman et al 1995 but with a slight adjustment for a covered soil with plastic mulch under drip irrigation it shows the skill of a plastic mulch driven tseb model hereafter tseb pm to iterate between soil mulch system canopy and bare surfaces by dividing available energy into turbulent so given the excess resistance that is considered in aerodynamic resistance and on assumption that the covered soils with plastic mulch would possibly have some effects on energy transfer between mulch and underneath soil surface the thermal contact resistance r c i e a function based on the rayleigh number r v within the mulched soil equs 20 21 ham and kluitenberg 1994 can be obtain for sensible heat between mulch and soil surface h m s according to equ 22 20 r c r c d l d k a nu r v 1708 or t m t s r c c 14 5 l d k a r v 0 3 p r 0 074 r v 1708 or t m t s 21 r v g β t s t m l d 3 α v 22 h m s t s t m r c where r c d and r c c represents the resistances of conduction and convection on the temperature gradient and thermal stability underneath the mulched soil system k a nu and p r are the thermal conductivity of air w m 1 k 1 the nusselt number of a conductive regime given as 1 and prandtl number of air given as 0 75 sauer and norman 1995 while r v the rayleigh number is determined to check for any occurrence of conduction or free convection within the mulched soil system g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 β is the thermal expansion coefficient of air k 1 v is the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 and α is the thermal diffusivity at given temperature at the satellite corresponding local time of the doy as shown in table 2 m2 s 1 while the distance between the mulch and soil is represented by l d m note that an r c of up to 0 025 is equivalent to 0 65 mm gap of air between the mulch and soil ham and kluitenberg 1994 as such it is considered a bulk transfer dimensionless measurement for heat exchange which can assimilate many complex factors into a single resistance function because of the air movement either through the planting holes or from evaporation condensation that is likely to amount to a mixed regime ham and kluitenberg 1994 sauer and norman 1995 it is on this note that tseb is configured with r c over the plastic mulched soil condition therefore the sensible heat for the soil mulch vegetation atmosphere system can then be derived as following equs 23 24 23 h m c ρ c p t m t ac r c 24 h h m c h m s ρ c p t ac t a t m r a ρ c p t c t ac r x t m t ac r c where air density and the specific heat of air are represented with ρ kg m 3 and c p j kg 1 k 1 t a and t m are the temperatures of the air and mulch respectively k 1 the schematization of the component surface fluxes from soil and vegetation canopy for which t m is incorporated into the tseb under mulched soil condition in the series resistance formulation is here restated to accommodate the plastic mulch layer component as follows 25 t ac t a r a t c r x t m r c 1 r a 1 r x 1 r c in this case the t ac helps to moderate any possible uncertainty with the parallel model which is found to be sensitive to both errors in the plastic mulched soil and vegetation cover calculations the earlier tseb version i e tseb tr from which t c and t s are related based on calculation from the composite directional radiometric surface temperature t r equ 2 provides the analytical basis for the derivation of a plastic mulch temperature component t m used for determining the mulched soil effects on energy fluxes as shown in equ 26 incorporating r n m with the mulched soil heat component 26 t ci t a r n m r a ρ c p 1 α s f g δ δ γ where t ci is the original value of t c α s f g δ and γ represents the modified site specific priestly taylor coefficient fraction of green vegetation slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus the temperature curve kpa k 1 and the psychometric constant 0 06 kpa k 1 respectively note that the configuration of α pt in the original tseb model was replaced as site specific α s function here due to the special advective situation across arid continental central asia for which no specific value can be guaranteed over a particular film mulched condition except when it has been tested and verified e g ai and yang 2016 secondly the multiple reflectance angle of solar radiation reflected back to the atmosphere from the film and soil surfaces is presumed to be more sensitive when responding to mulch fraction lai soil moisture and surface reflectance under the film mulched conditions in the region therefore we tested the modified priestly taylor coefficient variable ranges 0 28 1 70 derived by ai and yang 2016 for our experiment site and used 1 34 as the average reliable site specific value α s in the tseb pm model run for this study while tseb is run for a normal condition the partitioned net radiation absorbed by the plastic mulch equs 11 and 12 which accounts for both longwave and shortwave radiation attenuation equs 13 and 18 within the mulch system is introduced into the priestley taylor equation and run as tseb pm to determine the latent heat under mulch soil condition after the vapor flux from soil covered by plastic mulch to canopy air λ e m c is determined as follows 27 λ et λ e m c α s f g δ δ γ r n m g m this way uncertainty is reduced in the latent heat fluxes from both soil and canopy surfaces i e under the film mulched conditions which originally can be derived as a residual in the energy balance equation of the two composite and component temperature based tseb without a mulch layer therefore the partitioned instantaneous latent heat fluxes including λ e s and λ e m c under the covered and not covered plastic mulches which are assumed constant throughout the daytime were considered reliable for the sampled doy vapor flux outputs during the irrigation seasons at the experiment site tseb pm output validation was taken at pixel level 30 m resolution 2 4 sensitivity analysis we performed a global sensitivity analysis on the selected key inputs of λ et in the tse b p m table 3 by applying the improved parameter variance based sobol method sobol i m 2001 as simplified by eq 20 in saltelli et al 2010 the method has the ability to disaggregate and quantify the degree of uncertainty in prediction models by decomposing and identifying parameter s interaction effects in this way the model structure based on sub model in our case physical process influential inputs are corroborated to simplify complex models requiring several inputs thus the sobol method produces the first order index s i by computing for the independent contribution of each parameter to model output variable and then the total interaction effects s ti on the final model s performance in this study key model inputs were selected from 3 groups of physical contribution to model output e i by aerodynamic resistance canopy transpiration and or radiation transfer in this case 9 key tseb pm terms parameters were considered table 3 therefore given that sobol is a variance based tool the terms of variances in the anova decomposition of the representative tseb pm sub model parameters were computed following equs 28 30 28 v i v i i j v ij i j m v ijm v 1 2 k 29 s i v i v 30 s ti v i i v ij i m v ijm v i j k v where v i and v ij are the model output variances in response to the i th and j th input terms required for the computation of the sensitivity indices i e s i and s ti j and m are the j th and m th model input variables besides i j m further computational details are elaborated in sobol 2001 and saltelli et al 2010 2 5 model evaluation metrics the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe statistical analyses were used to assess the simulated plastic mulch irrigation induced vapor and energy fluxes against the true ec flux tower measurements at the experiment site 3 results 3 1 global sensitivity analysis fig 4 shows that the 3 canopy transpiration variables α s f c and f g have more influence in the optimization of model performance than other parameters within the sub model categories specifically the cotton crop metric represented by fractional vegetation cover f c revealed the highest sensitivity index based on the first order s i and total effects s ti 0 684 and 0 44 respectively this is followed by the modified priestly taylor coefficient α s parameter 0 541 and 0 331 respectively and then the vegetation green fraction f g parameter 0 248 and 0 228 respectively the most sensitive parameters among the aerodynamic resistance variables are the crop canopy height h c and the incorporated mulched soil layer contact resistance r c parameter while it is very obvious that the canopy transpiration parameters have the largest s i and s ti effects in the tseb pm it is equally evident that the resistant variables do have a significant influence on the crop water use simulation particularly during the cotton seeding and squaring stages table 1 as such adequate canopy saturation at the various development stages of the cotton crop commenced after the emergence stages at different crop heights therefore it can be said that a strong complementary relationship exists between the two sub model structures i e aerodynamic resistance and canopy transpiration under plastic mulching condition during cotton productivity in the arid agroecosystem 3 2 evaluation of surface energy fluxes fig 5 shows the validation scatterplots of energy fluxes by tseb pm and tseb against ground observation i e ec technique using various analytical matrices for growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 the detailed combined statistics for both 2009 and 2010 are shown in table 4 the daily mean values for the energy fluxes during the study period ranges between 120 65 and 201 702 w m 2 71 12 81 07 w m 2 12 50 13 51 w m 2 and 1 60 4 01 w m 2 for rn le h and g respectively in general the optimized model produced a more robust model fit with observation than the original tseb model both models revealed negative mbe for the important variable of net radiation tseb 26 34 and tseb pm 17 07 w m 2 however the optimized model still showed a reduced rmse and mae this indicates an improvement in the model simulation of energy fluxes using tseb pm 3 3 surface albedo response to plastic film mulching in arid agroecosystem fig 6 illustrates the daily surface albedo response under plastic mulched soil during the two consecutive growing seasons generally soil surface temperature is regarded as the boundary condition for an implicit finite difference model of the soil heat exchange this is due to its temporality and the feedback propensity from other surface parameters such as the surface albedo the large panels in fig 6 show the albedo response to vegetation saturation canopy transpiration as somewhat unchanged or didn t show a significant relationship during cotton growth stages in both growing seasons however a trend analysis was performed to show the dynamic pattern in the surface albedo response under the plastic mulch condition the small panels in fig 6 show an obvious downward trend after the cotton seedling stage i e after 28 may 2009 and at the emergence stage on 31 may 2010 these differences occurred at a slope rate of 1 65 and 0 77 for 2009 and 2010 respectively this was so because the surface reflectance of the upward shortwave radiation component largely depends on the surface albedo and was slightly truncated immediately after the cotton emergence stages table 1 fig 6 plastic mulching tend to impact land surface parameters which are significant to energy partitioning on cotton fields particularly under less canopy saturation of lai 1 ai et al 2018 3 4 tseb pm simulation and partitioning of et and the pattern of e and t fig 7 shows the validation results of the simulated et estimates from the optimized and original models against the ec observation estimates during the growing seasons 2009 and 2010 and for the study period metrics in black text the optimized model tseb pm showed a better performance for et simulation with reduced mean bias error values according to the rmse of 0 53 mm day 1 and mae of 0 45 mm day 1 respectively the daily mean et estimates by tseb pm is 2 74 mm day 1 with maximum and minimum values of 5 123 mm day 1 and 1 032 mm day 1 respectively likewise the daily mean et estimates by the original tseb is 3 75 mm day 1 with maximum and minimum values of 5 5 mm day 1 and 1 08 mm day 1 respectively the detailed statistical metrics are shown in table 5 both models show a stable cotton crop growth trend with tseb pm having a slight slope increase by 0 162 but not statistically significant p 0 05 however tseb pm simulation of daily et outperformed the revised common land model colm with the added plastic mulch module at the same site it reported a slope of 0 76 r2 value of 0 75 and rmse of 1 mm day 1 yuan et al 2019 our objective was to determine how much of irrigation water contribute to cotton growth when et is partitioned into e and t at the different development stages in the arid agroecosystem we note that both models generally produced acceptable et estimates figs 5 7 and table 5 however outputs from the best performing model i e tseb pm was presented for the et partitioning analysis fig 8 and table 6 focus on the partitioned et components from the optimized model i e tseb pm to illustrate cotton crop water use efficiency for both growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 table 6 shows the partitioned et into t and e the ratio of t component to et revealed higher estimates of evaporation than the e component that is the fully saturated cotton canopy tends to transpire more water it also suggests that the canopy transpiration fraction f c which dominated in the simulation of surface energy fluxes fig 4 is a possible reason for the decreased soil evaporation in both growing seasons the mean value of cotton transpiration t was 1 88 mm day 1 the maximum values were recorded during the boll filling stages on day of the years 228 3 64 mm and 215 3 18 mm in 2009 and 2010 respectively notably et values during the cotton bolling stages were higher in the growing season of 2010 than during the drier 2009 growing season fig 8 table 6 note that our analysis did not adequately capture the seedling daily et in 2009 as with those of 2010 however transpiration during the cotton seeding stage was almost insignificant given the absence of stomatal conductance due to non existence of saturated cotton canopy similar situation occurred during the harvest stage fig 8 in this case the percentage change of t et was generally low in the seeding stage up until the shooting emergence when increases in cotton leaf area index were regulated by the plant physiological processes to the maturity stage table 6 in other words t et ratio correlates strongly with the cotton metrics i e f c and f g that is t signals dominated et during the irrigation seasons therefore crop yield was improved because the plastic mulching regulates the hydrothermal condition of the cotton field thereby increasing the aboveground biomass of cotton produce however note that some days of the year revealed a low ratio of t et even as the preceding growth stages showed high canopy transpiration table 6 this probably resulted from well saturated air temperature or movement of eddies from the canopy as t remained under physiological control of the leaf stomata which was tightly coupled with the cotton tissue properties also it can be said that the biological processes of e were suppressed while it responded to environmental changes of wet conditions by irrigation water as such a significant reduction in t et 2 was observed in the complete stage of cotton growth in 2010 which led to a spike in evaporation afterwards fig 8 et partitioning in this study clearly shows how much of vapor flux is transpired during the various development stages of the cotton crop as indicated by the well saturated canopy during the crop growth stages in both growing seasons fig 8 this is critical for evaluating crop productivity and the future allocation of scarce water resources in the region 4 discussions 4 1 plastic film mulching effects on vapor and energy fluxes we modeled the plastic film mulched soil effects on surface energy fluxes and partitioned et using an optimized radiometric surface temperature based t r model i e tseb pm in this case soil surface temperature based on satellite lst was used instead of soil moisture data bateni et al 2013 song et al 2016 the generated outputs were more in agreement with the ec flux tower observation than with the original tseb model figs 5 and 7 the tseb pm simulation outputs which derived inputs from the fine scale landsat resolution datasets are very comparable with modelled outputs of irrigation processes on energy fluxes which used coarse resolution land surface models such as common land model yuan et al 2019 and noah wrf regional circulation models zhang et al 2019 however tseb pm showed an improvement of h and le simulation given the reduced rmses of le and h by 1 93 w m 2 and 4 84 w m 2 respectively the tseb pm simulation of energy fluxes under irrigation condition with plastic mulching identified effects in the reduction of daily r n which impacted g m and h m s mostly during the cotton development stages but were constrained in the original tseb model figs 5 and 6 ai et al 2018 confirm this finding that the increases in surface reflectance can shorten r n particularly during the seedling stages but can affect energy partitioning in cotton fields with plastic mulches our findings are also in agreement with previous studies which specifically pointed out that reductions in h are induced by irrigation processes and quite often occurs during the corresponding local time with the satellite overpass time considered in this study i e between 8 00 20 00 beijing time zhang et al 2019 similarly zeng et al 2017 reported that irrigation effects on le and h are more evident in summers with le increases of about 100 wm 2 and a decrease in h by about 60 wm 2 under intense irrigation as in our study area these effects are less significant at night times but tend to elevate le during the day this may have resulted from other factors such as oasis effects which tend to induce regional advection across arid central asia however the et simulation matrices of this study still falls within the ranges reported in the few previous studies under similar mulching conditions even though different model parameterization processes were applied zhang et al 2016 2020 in this study the daily mean et estimates by tseb pm is 2 74 mm day 1 while bai et al 2015 reported a 4 year daily mean of 2 8 mm day 1 the optimized model showed a reduced rmse value 0 532 mm day 1 when compared with the rmse value of 1 76 mm day 1 by the noah wrf rcm regional circulation model zhang et al 2019 therefore the uncertainty in the model parameterization and et partitioning which was at reasonable spatial resolutions e g landsat scale under plastic mulch conditions were reduced as demonstrated in this study table 5 4 2 added value of tseb pm parameterization with fine scale resolution data irrigation modifies the partitioning of available net radiation and the microclimate but their effects significantly differ depending on the type of surface crop and ecosystem li et al 2020 zeng et al 2017 for example zhang et al 2019 reported an irrigation season decrease of sensible heat by 50 50 w m 2 under flood irrigation whereas our study show about 4 84 w m 2 decrease under drip irrigation with plastic mulching this indicate that the soil water content under flood irrigation is usually higher despite having the plastic mulch suppressing evaporation under the drip irrigation in dry areas in our case mean daily et was significantly lowered table 6 than those of flood and furrow irrigation as reported across central asia e g ibragimov et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 importantly the landsat earth observation data used in this study allowed the tseb pm model to evaluate irrigation effects at flux observation footprint scale which is at meter scales i e 30 m as was emphasized by earlier studies french et al 2015 ma et al 2018 unlike with the lsms or rcms in which their simulation of irrigation effects are constrained by coarse resolution 1 km wu et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 simulations at such low resolutions cannot effectively determine or capture exact flux tower fetch area in complex landscape and can yield errors up to 100 w m 2 castelli et al 2018 the sensitivity of energy fluxes to land surface regional circulation model grids in composite canopies and the unevenness of row spacing canopy structure and or distances between rows especially for cotton crops make their outputs uncertain the model related errors are confounded by uncertainties in observations beyond the flux tower footprint 1 km on irregular surfaces especially where the terrain is generally heterogeneous patchy or canopies are sparsely distributed during some days or throughout the growing season anderson et al 2012 tarara and ham 1999 which is the exact situation with our experiment region 4 3 sensitivity of the optimized tseb pm sub model structures in arid agroecosystems the effects of parameter interactions in the physical process of sub model structure in tseb pm were decomposed and identified based on the sobol method the nonlinearity of a parameter in model output affects the sensitivity indices by introducing randomness from parameter ranges lu et al 2013 notably tseb is generally less sensitive to errors in lai and lst than most seb models particularly the single source models gan et al 2019 tang et al 2011 however the aerodynamic roughness values derived in this study significantly vary e g r c 0 01 0 045 mm with those obtained using the raupach s model for the same cotton crop specie in the tarim basin but under flood irrigation li et al 2015 note that the aerodynamic roughness for cropland is much larger in agroecosystems with high wind speed such as in the tarim basin besides the high winds that tend to cause erosions in spring thereby leading to water wastages in such cases other atmospheric parameters e g friction velocity are also likely to have increased sensitivity to model total effects or outputs if the tseb model were to be implemented in such agroecosystem in practical terms partitioned daily et estimates are important for enhancing precision agriculture through sustainable irrigation scheduling which is critical for improving water use efficiency in arid lands 5 conclusions this study determined the energy flux transfer from plastic film mulched soil to both the canopy air and to the atmosphere by incorporating a plastic mulch layer to the tseb model and using landsat high resolution data then it identified the consequent effects in two irrigation seasons 2009 and 2010 over a drip irrigated cotton field the improved model tseb pm proved that surface energy fluxes were impacted by the plastic mulching of soil under drip irrigation in the study area as such the following key conclusions were gathered 1 the tseb model with default resistances to heat flux parameters underestimated the performance of the surface energy fluxes in the irrigated cotton field surface energy fluxes were better approximated when mulch is considered in the simulation the tseb pm showed reduced error biases with comparable differences in rmse values obtained from the ec measurements as 10 85 1 93 4 84 0 81 w m 2 for the net radiation latent sensible and ground heat fluxes respectively this suggests that changes in the plastic mulch optical properties under drip irrigation affected the exchange of surface energy fluxes in the study area 2 plastic mulching irrigation effects induced higher ratio of cotton transpiration on the average when cotton growth reaches ball opening stage which is the due period for harvesting i e 75 of cotton canopy coverage the e et value was 0 20 0 05 while t et was 0 79 0 05 during the irrigation seasons transpiration contributed about 80 of water use efficiency to cotton crop productivity during the two consecutive growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 during which et was strongly dominated by t signals 3 albedo surface reflectance showed a comparable temporal pattern in the different irrigation seasons 2009 and 2010 however it varied during cotton crop growth stages this resulted from the reduction in reflected shortwave radiation under the plastic mulched soil condition 4 the canopy transpiration sub model inputs i e modified priestley taylor coefficient α s fractional vegetation cover f c and vegetation green cover f g followed by the cotton canopy height h c resistance between plastic and soil boundary layer r c and roughness length from soil z 0s were the most sensitive parameters in the tseb pm model this was based on their variance influences first order effects and overall interactions total effects in the simulation of cotton et under the mulched soil condition 5 the adjustment of resistance variables and or related parameters in the tseb pm model is critical to uncertainty reduction of et modeling

9667,the value added by plastic film mulches are numerous in agricultural productivity and its global acceptance is unprecedented however its disturbing effects on the natural water cycling surface energy fluxes and partitioning of evapotranspiration et in drip irrigated fields with plastic film mulch are often overlooked or not investigated due to deficiencies in existing process based et models this study optimized the simulation of plastic film mulched soil effects on surface energy fluxes by incorporating a thermal contact resistance component into a satellite derived land surface temperature based two source energy balance i e tseb pm model in a drip irrigated cotton field for two consecutive growing seasons 2009 and 2010 the optimized model agrees better with eddy covariance ec flux tower observation and showed reduced error biases than the original tseb model the rmse values decreased for the net radiation latent sensible and ground heat fluxes by 10 85 1 93 4 84 0 81 w m 2 respectively moreover et partitioning by tseb pm revealed the actual contribution of evaporation e and transpiration t in cotton water use at different growth stages when cotton growth reaches the ball opening stage i e harvesting period or cotton canopy coverage 75 the mean e et value was 0 20 0 05 while t et was 0 79 0 05 during the irrigation seasons meanwhile the plastic mulching altered the reflected shortwave radiation thereby impacting on surface albedo reflectance under well saturated cotton canopy as such the transpiration sub model parameters such as fractional vegetation cover and vegetation green fraction had influential effects and are the most sensitive in the tseb pm model parameterization this study showed that tseb pm can provide robust insights into the effects of plastic mulching on surface energy fluxes and cotton et therefore can be explored further across arid agroecosystems keywords plastic film mulching drip irrigation remote sensing evapotranspiration partitioning arid agroecosystem 1 introduction the need to control the rising global food demand is accelerating the rapid transition of traditional irrigation techniques to modern irrigation systems e g drip irrigation with plastic film mulches under most irrigation conditions soil evaporation is often overlooked or measured as an unproductive component of terrestrial evapotranspiration however activities which tend to alter land surface parameters such as aerodynamic resistance roughness and surface albedo or the soil heat flux can also affect crop transpiration and the surface energy budget berger et al 2013 tarara and ham 1999 yu et al 2016 this is because soil moisture content varies throughout the growing season and all year round for instance the commonly used mulching films i e the black plastic raises the soil temperature above ambient level in summer tarara 2000 as a result the physical process mechanisms of the land atmosphere interactions within film mulched agroecosystems have also attracted more scholarly attention lately chen et al 2020 feng et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 biophysical one dimensional and multilayered process based models are often used to distinctively simulate the interactions within the canopy air space to precisely determine crop water use or evapotranspiration in complex agroecosystems ding et al 2015 french et al 2015 ochege et al 2019 the penman monteith p m algorithm performs well under fully covered canopy monteith 1965 while compartmental models such as the shuttle wallace s w model can efficiently estimate soil evaporation and canopy transpiration separately shuttleworth and wallace 1985 however the effectiveness of s w model can be affected by canopy and soil surface resistances kato et al 2004 under plastic film mulching condition the adjusted s w model can improve the accuracy of the original p m and s w models however these three et models have been found to significantly overestimate underestimate crop et in arid agroecosystem in northwest china li et al 2013 other experimental methods include the land surface models lsms and regional circulation models rcms or their coupling zeng et al 2017 but their robustness is guaranteed mostly at global scales ham and kluitenberg 1994 had earlier employed the newton raphson method to model the influence of mulches on surface energy partitioning and soil temperature regimes though it was applied over a short term but the model is very robust and can concurrently iterate the plastic mulch soil system in complex ecosystems and at point scale yang et al 2012 ding et al 2013 used a modified priestly taylor model to accurately estimate the diurnal variation of evapotranspiration et over an irrigated maize field the study revealed the exact threshold of maize crop water stress and pointed out that plastic film mulching together with other controlling factors can impact soil temperature and its radiative budget thereby reducing soil evaporation and plant senescence the use of process based et methods for example the modified priestley taylor pt model illustrates that with cognizance to the surface type the conductance of energy fluxes particularly sensible heat from a film and non film mulched soils are different ding et al 2015 2013 besides that the choice of method can produce varied outputs little changes in their parameterization can as well produce contradicting results e g kustas and norman 1999 as such relatively small variations in the land energy budget in complex agroecosystems induced by irrigation activities can cause significant changes in land atmosphere interactions because net radiation tends to respond differently to surface types bateni et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the experiment by tarara and ham 1999 which approximated aerodynamic conductance to heat transfer between bare soil and the black plastic mulch by using a sensor based measurement found that the plastics used for surface mulching are a major source of sensible heat over crop fields this suggests the need for continuous investigation particularly on surface resistances to energy fluxes under plastic film mulched soil conditions in complex terrains at a much higher level of complexity several studies adapt the priestly taylor based two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 priestly and taylor 1972 and its refined versions which apply the simple linear mixing technique gan et al 2019 kustas et al 2012 kustas and norman 1999 using satellite data such as landsat the tseb can address potential uncertainty issues of angular dependence of the radiometric thermal radiation which is absent in the single source models this is the difference between observed surface temperature t r θ and aerodynamic temperature t o to satisfy the bulk resistance formulation for sensible heat transfer across different terrains kustas and anderson 2009 kustas et al 2012 yao et al 2010 the tseb model is very skillful in determining both the sublayer and above canopy energy fluxes kustas et al 2012 it has also been reliably used for investigating the ecohydrological characteristics of wetland ecosystems yao et al 2010 and for mapping the spatial distribution of crop drought index wu et al 2018 the energy fluxes computed from the soil and vegetation composites in tseb have been found to be more robust in the tseb modification series colaizzi et al 2012 gan and gao 2015 song et al 2016 notwithstanding the several refinements on the tseb model there exists no evidence of its application to assess plastic mulch irrigation effects across the complex and arid continental central asia therefore this study applied the tseb schematization because of its advantage to simplify the fluxes between vegetation soil and the canopy air space unlike the single source models which schematizes with the big leaf structure but cannot directly differentiate between soil evaporation and plant transpiration zhang et al 2020 this study improves our knowledge by evaluating the refinement of the tseb model to calibrate film mulched soil effects of intensified irrigation practices on vapor and surface energy fluxes over an irrigated cotton field using the fine landsat scale resolution data specifically the study incorporates a mulch layer component based on a thermal contact resistance model ham and kluitenberg 1994 into the tseb model to 1 simulate the effects of the changes in mulch optical properties on surface energy fluxes and to 2 determine how much of irrigated water contributes to cotton production at different development stages when et is partitioned into evaporation e and transpiration t under the plastic film mulched soil condition in this way the added value of the tseb simulations over a drip irrigated cotton field with plastic mulch can be effectively explored interpreted and adequately represented in complex and arid agroecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site design and eddy covariance ec measurements the experiment was carried out in an oasis agroecosystem in xinjiang china at 85 86488128 e 44 29754019 n on an elevation of 469 23 m which is located in the north tianshan mountains of central asia fig 1 the central asian region is broadly typified by arid continental climate with patchy terrains sparse canopies and mountain ranges hence the huge attraction for irrigation agriculture zhang et al 2019 cotton gossypium hirsutum l xinluzao 36 production constitutes two third of the total agricultural productivity of the major cash crops from the region as such the general irrigation design of the cotton fields consumes over two thirds of the total agricultural water supplied to the region ai and yang 2016 the experiment was conducted on a sub plot of a large cotton field covering 39 600 m2 for two growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 fig 1 specifically the sub plot of cotton field treatment comprises of average row and planting spacing of 0 38 m and 0 11 m respectively the field has a mean population density of about 24 5 plants per m2 within a field area of 330 120 m2 zhou et al 2012 table 1 shows the irrigation schedule describing the cotton growth stages the direction of cotton rows is oriented north westerly separated by the width of the row spacing into narrow 10 cm and wide 60 cm rows allowing the placement pegging and coverage of the drip pipes under plastic films at the edge of the soil the soil type is grayish sandy loamy with about 42 silt 39 sand and 19 clay at the depth of 0 30 mm zhou et al 2012 the site has an average field capacity of 27 with a bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 during the study period about 80 of the cotton fields are covered with perforated plastic polyethylene 0 08 mm thick under drip irrigation system starting from april to september 2009 and to october 2010 the holes are separated 10 cm apart from each other such that the drip hose placement under the plastic film is tolerable thereby allowing about 1 cm gap between the film mulch and the soil surface depending on the day s soil moisture the usual practice is to apply the drip irrigation at least 7 10 times at 10 days interval for each growing season soil moisture content is observed before and after application at depths between 20 cm and 160 cm soil depths using a tcav probe campbell scientific inc logan ut usa the cotton seed yield in 2009 and 2010 were 4 5 t hm2 and 3 9 t hm2 while the consecutive cotton densities achieved in both years were 26 57 plant m2 and 28 94

and mid october they are harvested so we extended the julian day of the year doy selected for the crop water stress and energy balance simulations to october for the growing season of 2010 the total length of growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 are 188 and 160 days respectively however only doy with corresponding clear sky landsat data were investigated table 2 the eddy covariance ec flux tower

frequency of 10 hz every 30 min interval meteorological parameters including air temperature and relative humidity were concurrently measured with a temperature probe hmp45d and relative humidity probe vaisala inc helsinki finland at 2 m above the ground a 20 cm diameter standard rain gauge and a ptb220 barometer vaisala helsinki finland were installed to record precipitation and atmospheric air pressure respectively wind speed and wind direction were respectively captured using el15 1a and el1 2d sensors zhonghuan tig tianjin china more information of the ec technique at our experiment including the initial data preprocessing are already documented bai et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 during the period daily meteorological conditions in both seasons were fairly typical of an arid continental climate with temperature rates that required equitable water use hence the use of plastic mulching under the drip irrigation condition annual mean precipitation and temperature are 210 mm and 7 0 c respectively table 1 fig 2 2 2 remote sensing data collection and preprocessing 2 2 1 landsat 5 tm and 7 etm a total of 22 clear sky imageries including 12 landsat 5 tm 10 landsat 7 etm oli

were properly preprocessed ochege et al 2019 to prepare the initial input variables including surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndiv and air temperature ta from which canopy component temperature tc and soil component temperature ts were derived following principles described by norman et al 1995 others include leaf area index lai fractional vegetation cover fc and vegetation green fraction all these primary variables are required inputs for the two source energy balance model and its revised versions gan and gao 2015 song et al 2016 we maintained a 30 m resolution for all datasets using the bilinear resampling method the temporal resolution span through the growing season of 2009 and 2010 their acquisition dates are represented by the doy at the corresponding local time with the satellite overpass time for each image table 2 these corresponding local time with that of satellite overpass time for each image were considered in the model parameterization as instantaneous outputs which are extrapolated to daily energy and et output for the doy using the one time of day calculation colaizzi et al 2014 2 3 parameterization of plastic film mulch irrigation effect on surface energy exchange to determine the plastic mulched soil effects on surface energy fluxes in the cotton field of experiment this study took consideration of the satellite overpass doys for available clear sky scenes with cognizance to the irrigation timing which corresponds to the cotton growth stages spanning through growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 tables 1 and 2 then to solve for the radiation transferred to the surface and absorbed by the canopy the standard equation is first applied to partition net radiation r n w m 2 into turbulent heat fluxes according to equ 1 1 r n g 0 λ e h where h g 0 and λ e represents the sensible heat ground heat and latent heat fluxes respectively negative and positive values symbolize fluxes moving towards and from the surface respectively then the tseb framework norman et al 1995 which is the most robust land surface temperature based et partitioning model especially for similar complex terrains as ours is employed here kustas and norman 1999 song et al 2016 the tseb model is applied to relate the directional surface temperature t r to the soil and vegetation component temperatures t s and t c at the radiometer view angle i e from remotely sensed directional brightness temperature of the fractional vegetation cover f c by a simple linear mixing as illustrated in equ 2 colaizzi et al 2012 kustas and anderson 2009 2 t r θ f c θ t c 4 1 f c θ t s 4 0 25 where t c and t s are the pixel component temperatures k 1 f c θ is the sensor observed thermal fractional vegetation cover at the view zenith

perpendicular to the crop row p 3 8 0 46 d the ratio between the canopy height and the nominal clump width is d while k depends on the stand architecture for azimuthal views perpendicular to the row k can be obtained by the expression k 0 3 1 7 ω 0 14 sánchez et al 2008 t r θ in the tseb model can simulate the differences between observed surface temperature and aerodynamic temperature t o to satisfy the bulk resistance formulation for latent and sensible heat transfers kustas and anderson 2009 thus using both t c and t s the soil and vegetation net radiation represented by r n s and r n c eqs 4 7 are then estimated with composite or component temperatures these formulations have been extensively utilized and documented colaizzi et al 2012 song et al 2016 4 r n c h c λ e c 5 r n s h s λ

boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 wm 2 k 4 we set our emissivity value at 0 95 for the experiment site t 0 is the land surface temperature i e lst while the incoming longwave and shortwave radiation w m 2 from the sky are denoted by l and s respectively s and c represent soil and canopy layers α s and α c are the soil and vegetation albedo τ lw and τ sw are the longwave and shortwave radiation transmittances via canopy while emissivity of the soil and canopy essentials are given as ε s and ε c respectively h computation from both h s and h c through the boundary canopy layer t ac follows the original tseb formulations for normal irrigated conditions according to equs 8 9 colaizzi et al 2012 8 h c ρ c p t c t ac r x 9 h s ρ c p t s t ac r s where r s and r x are the resistances to heat flux in the boundary layer directly above the soil surface and the boundary layer near the canopy respectively s m 1 the mathematical derivations aerodynamic resistances of r a r s and r x using the monin obukov similarity theory all follows through the initial tseb formulation which are also extensively documented kustas and norman 1999 norman et al 1995 then on the assumption that heat storage within a partially film mulched soil cannot be neglected due to the planting holes and or the gap between mulch and soil i e 1 cm as compared to a fully covered soil surface by the mulch we attempt a definition of the thermal contact resistance between the soil surface and the plastic film mulch ham and kluitenberg 1994 a schematic representation of the soil mulch vegetation atmosphere system is shown in fig 3 the resistance network of the tseb models can be adjusted as they are less sensitive to uncertainties in lai and the near surface soil moisture which has proven very effective among the temperature based et models gan and gao 2015 gan et al 2019 it is hypothesized that definite changes in the optical properties of longwave and or shortwave spectrums based on radiation reflectance are inevitable given a plastic mulched soil system under drip irrigation condition this is based on the principle that the mulch absorbs global irradiance shortwave radiation reflected from the underlying soil and longwave radiation emitted by the sky and the soil ham and kluitenberg 1994 in this case the net radiation absorbed by the plastic mulch for the mulched soil heat transfer can be expressed as follows equs 10 11 10 r n m h m s h 0 11 r n m a m s 1 ρ τ m ρ s ε m ε sky σ t r 4 1 ρ i r τ m i r 1 ε s ρ i r ε m ε s σt s 4 ρ i r ε m 2 σt m 4 1 ε s 2 σε m t m 4 where α m τ m ε m and τ m ir represents the shortwave absorbed by the mulch shortwave transmitted by the mulch longwave emitted and transmitted by the mulch respectively t m is the temperature of the mulch k 1 ρ s is the shortwave reflectance of the soil ρ ir is an infinite series term which accounts for the multiple reflectances of the longwave between the mulch and the soil surface the mathematical expansion details are according to ham and kluitenberg 1994 a clearer expression of how the energy balance equation within the mulch and soil layers are derived are shown as follows yuan et al 2019 12 r n m s h m s g m 0 13 r n m s w m l w m 14 r n m s s w s l w s where r n m and r n m s represents net radiation available to the mulch and soil surface covered by the plastic film w m 2 g m is the heat fluxes absorbed by soil that is covered by plastic mulch w m 2 h m s is the sensible heat flux in between the mulch and soil w m 2 s w m l w m s w s and l w s represents the net shortwave and longwave radiation absorbed by the mulch and soil layers covered by the plastic mulch w m 2 respectively then the downward shortwave radiation to the mulch surface is balanced by the reflection and the absorption of the mulch in addition to multiple reflections between the mulch and soil surface and can be obtained as follows yang et al 2012 15 s w m α m 1 ρ τ m ρ s s w 16 s w s 1 ρ s ρ τ m s w 17 l w m ε m 1 ρ ir τ

between 0 2 and 0 5 depending on soil property or its moisture content sánchez et al 2008 in this study c g was determined as 0 3 based on consideration of underneath temperature change caused by the plastic mulch and the irrigation which retains the soil moisture yet pose no limitation to the cotton growth previous studies which applied c g in the tseb model expressed it in time interval eg colaizzi et al 2012 we show in fig 3 the modified energy series resistance network as it applies to this study it is still patterned after norman et al 1995 but with a slight adjustment for a covered soil with plastic mulch under drip irrigation it shows the skill of a plastic mulch driven tseb model hereafter tseb pm to iterate between soil mulch system canopy and bare surfaces by dividing available energy into turbulent so given the excess resistance that is considered in aerodynamic resistance and on assumption that the covered soils with plastic mulch would possibly have some effects on energy transfer between mulch and underneath soil surface the thermal contact resistance r c i e a function based on the rayleigh number r v within the mulched soil equs 20 21 ham and kluitenberg 1994 can be obtain for sensible heat between mulch and soil surface h m s according to equ 22 20 r c r c d l d k a nu r v 1708 or t m t s r c c 14 5 l d k a r v 0 3 p r 0 074 r v 1708 or t m t s 21 r v g β t s t m l d 3 α v 22 h m s t s t m r c where r c d and r c c represents the resistances of conduction and convection on the temperature gradient and thermal stability underneath the mulched soil system k a nu and p r are the thermal conductivity of air w m 1 k 1 the nusselt number of a conductive regime given as 1 and prandtl number of air given as 0 75 sauer and norman 1995 while r v the rayleigh number is determined to check for any occurrence of conduction or free convection within the mulched soil system g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 β is the thermal expansion coefficient of air k 1 v is the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 and α is the thermal diffusivity at given temperature at the satellite corresponding local time of the doy as shown in table 2 m2 s 1 while the distance between the mulch and soil is represented by l d m note that an r c of up to 0 025 is equivalent to 0 65 mm gap of air between the mulch and soil ham and kluitenberg 1994 as such it is considered a bulk transfer dimensionless measurement for heat exchange which can assimilate many complex factors into a single resistance function because of the air movement either through the planting holes or from evaporation condensation that is likely to amount to a mixed regime ham and kluitenberg 1994 sauer and norman 1995 it is on this note that tseb is configured with r c over the plastic mulched soil condition therefore the sensible heat for the soil mulch vegetation atmosphere system can then be derived as following equs 23 24 23 h m c ρ c p t m t ac r c 24 h h m c h m s ρ c p t ac t a t m r a ρ c p t c t ac r x t m t ac r c where air density and the specific heat of air are represented with ρ kg m 3 and c p j kg 1 k 1 t a and t m are the temperatures of the air and mulch respectively k 1 the schematization of the component surface fluxes from soil and vegetation canopy for which t m is incorporated into the tseb under mulched soil condition in the series resistance formulation is here restated to accommodate the plastic mulch layer component as follows 25 t ac t a r a t c r x t m r c 1 r a 1 r x 1 r c in this case the t ac helps to moderate any possible uncertainty with the parallel model which is found to be sensitive to both errors in the plastic mulched soil and vegetation cover calculations the earlier tseb version i e tseb tr from which t c and t s are related based on calculation from the composite directional radiometric surface temperature t r equ 2 provides the analytical basis for the derivation of a plastic mulch temperature component t m used for determining the mulched soil effects on energy fluxes as shown in equ 26 incorporating r n m with the mulched soil heat component 26 t ci t a r n m r a ρ c p 1 α s f g δ δ γ where t ci is the original value of t c α s f g δ and γ represents the modified site specific priestly taylor coefficient fraction of green vegetation slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus the temperature curve kpa k 1 and the psychometric constant 0 06 kpa k 1 respectively note that the configuration of α pt in the original tseb model was replaced as site specific α s function here due to the special advective situation across arid continental central asia for which no specific value can be guaranteed over a particular film mulched condition except when it has been tested and verified e g ai and yang 2016 secondly the multiple reflectance angle of solar radiation reflected back to the atmosphere from the film and soil surfaces is presumed to be more sensitive when responding to mulch fraction lai soil moisture and surface reflectance under the film mulched conditions in the region therefore we tested the modified priestly taylor coefficient variable ranges 0 28 1 70 derived by ai and yang 2016 for our experiment site and used 1 34 as the average reliable site specific value α s in the tseb pm model run for this study while tseb is run for a normal condition the partitioned net radiation absorbed by the plastic mulch equs 11 and 12 which accounts for both longwave and shortwave radiation attenuation equs 13 and 18 within the mulch system is introduced into the priestley taylor equation and run as tseb pm to determine the latent heat under mulch soil condition after the vapor flux from soil covered by plastic mulch to canopy air λ e m c is determined as follows 27 λ et λ e m c α s f g δ δ γ r n m g m this way uncertainty is reduced in the latent heat fluxes from both soil and canopy surfaces i e under the film mulched conditions which originally can be derived as a residual in the energy balance equation of the two composite and component temperature based tseb without a mulch layer therefore the partitioned instantaneous latent heat fluxes including λ e s and λ e m c under the covered and not covered plastic mulches which are assumed constant throughout the daytime were considered reliable for the sampled doy vapor flux outputs during the irrigation seasons at the experiment site tseb pm output validation was taken at pixel level 30 m resolution 2 4 sensitivity analysis we performed a global sensitivity analysis on the selected key inputs of λ et in the tse b p m table 3 by applying the improved parameter variance based sobol method sobol i m 2001 as simplified by eq 20 in saltelli et al 2010 the method has the ability to disaggregate and quantify the degree of uncertainty in prediction models by decomposing and identifying parameter s interaction effects in this way the model structure based on sub model in our case physical process influential inputs are corroborated to simplify complex models requiring several inputs thus the sobol method produces the first order index s i by computing for the independent contribution of each parameter to model output variable and then the total interaction effects s ti on the final model s performance in this study key model inputs were selected from 3 groups of physical contribution to model output e i by aerodynamic resistance canopy transpiration and or radiation transfer in this case 9 key tseb pm terms parameters were considered table 3 therefore given that sobol is a variance based tool the terms of variances in the anova decomposition of the representative tseb pm sub model parameters were computed following equs 28 30 28 v i v i i j v ij i j m v ijm v 1 2 k 29 s i v i v 30 s ti v i i v ij i m v ijm v i j k v where v i and v ij are the model output variances in response to the i th and j th input terms required for the computation of the sensitivity indices i e s i and s ti j and m are the j th and m th model input variables besides i j m further computational details are elaborated in sobol 2001 and saltelli et al 2010 2 5 model evaluation metrics the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe statistical analyses were used to assess the simulated plastic mulch irrigation induced vapor and energy fluxes against the true ec flux tower measurements at the experiment site 3 results 3 1 global sensitivity analysis fig 4 shows that the 3 canopy transpiration variables α s f c and f g have more influence in the optimization of model performance than other parameters within the sub model categories specifically the cotton crop metric represented by fractional vegetation cover f c revealed the highest sensitivity index based on the first order s i and total effects s ti 0 684 and 0 44 respectively this is followed by the modified priestly taylor coefficient α s parameter 0 541 and 0 331 respectively and then the vegetation green fraction f g parameter 0 248 and 0 228 respectively the most sensitive parameters among the aerodynamic resistance variables are the crop canopy height h c and the incorporated mulched soil layer contact resistance r c parameter while it is very obvious that the canopy transpiration parameters have the largest s i and s ti effects in the tseb pm it is equally evident that the resistant variables do have a significant influence on the crop water use simulation particularly during the cotton seeding and squaring stages table 1 as such adequate canopy saturation at the various development stages of the cotton crop commenced after the emergence stages at different crop heights therefore it can be said that a strong complementary relationship exists between the two sub model structures i e aerodynamic resistance and canopy transpiration under plastic mulching condition during cotton productivity in the arid agroecosystem 3 2 evaluation of surface energy fluxes fig 5 shows the validation scatterplots of energy fluxes by tseb pm and tseb against ground observation i e ec technique using various analytical matrices for growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 the detailed combined statistics for both 2009 and 2010 are shown in table 4 the daily mean values for the energy fluxes during the study period ranges between 120 65 and 201 702 w m 2 71 12 81 07 w m 2 12 50 13 51 w m 2 and 1 60 4 01 w m 2 for rn le h and g respectively in general the optimized model produced a more robust model fit with observation than the original tseb model both models revealed negative mbe for the important variable of net radiation tseb 26 34 and tseb pm 17 07 w m 2 however the optimized model still showed a reduced rmse and mae this indicates an improvement in the model simulation of energy fluxes using tseb pm 3 3 surface albedo response to plastic film mulching in arid agroecosystem fig 6 illustrates the daily surface albedo response under plastic mulched soil during the two consecutive growing seasons generally soil surface temperature is regarded as the boundary condition for an implicit finite difference model of the soil heat exchange this is due to its temporality and the feedback propensity from other surface parameters such as the surface albedo the large panels in fig 6 show the albedo response to vegetation saturation canopy transpiration as somewhat unchanged or didn t show a significant relationship during cotton growth stages in both growing seasons however a trend analysis was performed to show the dynamic pattern in the surface albedo response under the plastic mulch condition the small panels in fig 6 show an obvious downward trend after the cotton seedling stage i e after 28 may 2009 and at the emergence stage on 31 may 2010 these differences occurred at a slope rate of 1 65 and 0 77 for 2009 and 2010 respectively this was so because the surface reflectance of the upward shortwave radiation component largely depends on the surface albedo and was slightly truncated immediately after the cotton emergence stages table 1 fig 6 plastic mulching tend to impact land surface parameters which are significant to energy partitioning on cotton fields particularly under less canopy saturation of lai 1 ai et al 2018 3 4 tseb pm simulation and partitioning of et and the pattern of e and t fig 7 shows the validation results of the simulated et estimates from the optimized and original models against the ec observation estimates during the growing seasons 2009 and 2010 and for the study period metrics in black text the optimized model tseb pm showed a better performance for et simulation with reduced mean bias error values according to the rmse of 0 53 mm day 1 and mae of 0 45 mm day 1 respectively the daily mean et estimates by tseb pm is 2 74 mm day 1 with maximum and minimum values of 5 123 mm day 1 and 1 032 mm day 1 respectively likewise the daily mean et estimates by the original tseb is 3 75 mm day 1 with maximum and minimum values of 5 5 mm day 1 and 1 08 mm day 1 respectively the detailed statistical metrics are shown in table 5 both models show a stable cotton crop growth trend with tseb pm having a slight slope increase by 0 162 but not statistically significant p 0 05 however tseb pm simulation of daily et outperformed the revised common land model colm with the added plastic mulch module at the same site it reported a slope of 0 76 r2 value of 0 75 and rmse of 1 mm day 1 yuan et al 2019 our objective was to determine how much of irrigation water contribute to cotton growth when et is partitioned into e and t at the different development stages in the arid agroecosystem we note that both models generally produced acceptable et estimates figs 5 7 and table 5 however outputs from the best performing model i e tseb pm was presented for the et partitioning analysis fig 8 and table 6 focus on the partitioned et components from the optimized model i e tseb pm to illustrate cotton crop water use efficiency for both growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 table 6 shows the partitioned et into t and e the ratio of t component to et revealed higher estimates of evaporation than the e component that is the fully saturated cotton canopy tends to transpire more water it also suggests that the canopy transpiration fraction f c which dominated in the simulation of surface energy fluxes fig 4 is a possible reason for the decreased soil evaporation in both growing seasons the mean value of cotton transpiration t was 1 88 mm day 1 the maximum values were recorded during the boll filling stages on day of the years 228 3 64 mm and 215 3 18 mm in 2009 and 2010 respectively notably et values during the cotton bolling stages were higher in the growing season of 2010 than during the drier 2009 growing season fig 8 table 6 note that our analysis did not adequately capture the seedling daily et in 2009 as with those of 2010 however transpiration during the cotton seeding stage was almost insignificant given the absence of stomatal conductance due to non existence of saturated cotton canopy similar situation occurred during the harvest stage fig 8 in this case the percentage change of t et was generally low in the seeding stage up until the shooting emergence when increases in cotton leaf area index were regulated by the plant physiological processes to the maturity stage table 6 in other words t et ratio correlates strongly with the cotton metrics i e f c and f g that is t signals dominated et during the irrigation seasons therefore crop yield was improved because the plastic mulching regulates the hydrothermal condition of the cotton field thereby increasing the aboveground biomass of cotton produce however note that some days of the year revealed a low ratio of t et even as the preceding growth stages showed high canopy transpiration table 6 this probably resulted from well saturated air temperature or movement of eddies from the canopy as t remained under physiological control of the leaf stomata which was tightly coupled with the cotton tissue properties also it can be said that the biological processes of e were suppressed while it responded to environmental changes of wet conditions by irrigation water as such a significant reduction in t et 2 was observed in the complete stage of cotton growth in 2010 which led to a spike in evaporation afterwards fig 8 et partitioning in this study clearly shows how much of vapor flux is transpired during the various development stages of the cotton crop as indicated by the well saturated canopy during the crop growth stages in both growing seasons fig 8 this is critical for evaluating crop productivity and the future allocation of scarce water resources in the region 4 discussions 4 1 plastic film mulching effects on vapor and energy fluxes we modeled the plastic film mulched soil effects on surface energy fluxes and partitioned et using an optimized radiometric surface temperature based t r model i e tseb pm in this case soil surface temperature based on satellite lst was used instead of soil moisture data bateni et al 2013 song et al 2016 the generated outputs were more in agreement with the ec flux tower observation than with the original tseb model figs 5 and 7 the tseb pm simulation outputs which derived inputs from the fine scale landsat resolution datasets are very comparable with modelled outputs of irrigation processes on energy fluxes which used coarse resolution land surface models such as common land model yuan et al 2019 and noah wrf regional circulation models zhang et al 2019 however tseb pm showed an improvement of h and le simulation given the reduced rmses of le and h by 1 93 w m 2 and 4 84 w m 2 respectively the tseb pm simulation of energy fluxes under irrigation condition with plastic mulching identified effects in the reduction of daily r n which impacted g m and h m s mostly during the cotton development stages but were constrained in the original tseb model figs 5 and 6 ai et al 2018 confirm this finding that the increases in surface reflectance can shorten r n particularly during the seedling stages but can affect energy partitioning in cotton fields with plastic mulches our findings are also in agreement with previous studies which specifically pointed out that reductions in h are induced by irrigation processes and quite often occurs during the corresponding local time with the satellite overpass time considered in this study i e between 8 00 20 00 beijing time zhang et al 2019 similarly zeng et al 2017 reported that irrigation effects on le and h are more evident in summers with le increases of about 100 wm 2 and a decrease in h by about 60 wm 2 under intense irrigation as in our study area these effects are less significant at night times but tend to elevate le during the day this may have resulted from other factors such as oasis effects which tend to induce regional advection across arid central asia however the et simulation matrices of this study still falls within the ranges reported in the few previous studies under similar mulching conditions even though different model parameterization processes were applied zhang et al 2016 2020 in this study the daily mean et estimates by tseb pm is 2 74 mm day 1 while bai et al 2015 reported a 4 year daily mean of 2 8 mm day 1 the optimized model showed a reduced rmse value 0 532 mm day 1 when compared with the rmse value of 1 76 mm day 1 by the noah wrf rcm regional circulation model zhang et al 2019 therefore the uncertainty in the model parameterization and et partitioning which was at reasonable spatial resolutions e g landsat scale under plastic mulch conditions were reduced as demonstrated in this study table 5 4 2 added value of tseb pm parameterization with fine scale resolution data irrigation modifies the partitioning of available net radiation and the microclimate but their effects significantly differ depending on the type of surface crop and ecosystem li et al 2020 zeng et al 2017 for example zhang et al 2019 reported an irrigation season decrease of sensible heat by 50 50 w m 2 under flood irrigation whereas our study show about 4 84 w m 2 decrease under drip irrigation with plastic mulching this indicate that the soil water content under flood irrigation is usually higher despite having the plastic mulch suppressing evaporation under the drip irrigation in dry areas in our case mean daily et was significantly lowered table 6 than those of flood and furrow irrigation as reported across central asia e g ibragimov et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 importantly the landsat earth observation data used in this study allowed the tseb pm model to evaluate irrigation effects at flux observation footprint scale which is at meter scales i e 30 m as was emphasized by earlier studies french et al 2015 ma et al 2018 unlike with the lsms or rcms in which their simulation of irrigation effects are constrained by coarse resolution 1 km wu et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 simulations at such low resolutions cannot effectively determine or capture exact flux tower fetch area in complex landscape and can yield errors up to 100 w m 2 castelli et al 2018 the sensitivity of energy fluxes to land surface regional circulation model grids in composite canopies and the unevenness of row spacing canopy structure and or distances between rows especially for cotton crops make their outputs uncertain the model related errors are confounded by uncertainties in observations beyond the flux tower footprint 1 km on irregular surfaces especially where the terrain is generally heterogeneous patchy or canopies are sparsely distributed during some days or throughout the growing season anderson et al 2012 tarara and ham 1999 which is the exact situation with our experiment region 4 3 sensitivity of the optimized tseb pm sub model structures in arid agroecosystems the effects of parameter interactions in the physical process of sub model structure in tseb pm were decomposed and identified based on the sobol method the nonlinearity of a parameter in model output affects the sensitivity indices by introducing randomness from parameter ranges lu et al 2013 notably tseb is generally less sensitive to errors in lai and lst than most seb models particularly the single source models gan et al 2019 tang et al 2011 however the aerodynamic roughness values derived in this study significantly vary e g r c 0 01 0 045 mm with those obtained using the raupach s model for the same cotton crop specie in the tarim basin but under flood irrigation li et al 2015 note that the aerodynamic roughness for cropland is much larger in agroecosystems with high wind speed such as in the tarim basin besides the high winds that tend to cause erosions in spring thereby leading to water wastages in such cases other atmospheric parameters e g friction velocity are also likely to have increased sensitivity to model total effects or outputs if the tseb model were to be implemented in such agroecosystem in practical terms partitioned daily et estimates are important for enhancing precision agriculture through sustainable irrigation scheduling which is critical for improving water use efficiency in arid lands 5 conclusions this study determined the energy flux transfer from plastic film mulched soil to both the canopy air and to the atmosphere by incorporating a plastic mulch layer to the tseb model and using landsat high resolution data then it identified the consequent effects in two irrigation seasons 2009 and 2010 over a drip irrigated cotton field the improved model tseb pm proved that surface energy fluxes were impacted by the plastic mulching of soil under drip irrigation in the study area as such the following key conclusions were gathered 1 the tseb model with default resistances to heat flux parameters underestimated the performance of the surface energy fluxes in the irrigated cotton field surface energy fluxes were better approximated when mulch is considered in the simulation the tseb pm showed reduced error biases with comparable differences in rmse values obtained from the ec measurements as 10 85 1 93 4 84 0 81 w m 2 for the net radiation latent sensible and ground heat fluxes respectively this suggests that changes in the plastic mulch optical properties under drip irrigation affected the exchange of surface energy fluxes in the study area 2 plastic mulching irrigation effects induced higher ratio of cotton transpiration on the average when cotton growth reaches ball opening stage which is the due period for harvesting i e 75 of cotton canopy coverage the e et value was 0 20 0 05 while t et was 0 79 0 05 during the irrigation seasons transpiration contributed about 80 of water use efficiency to cotton crop productivity during the two consecutive growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 during which et was strongly dominated by t signals 3 albedo surface reflectance showed a comparable temporal pattern in the different irrigation seasons 2009 and 2010 however it varied during cotton crop growth stages this resulted from the reduction in reflected shortwave radiation under the plastic mulched soil condition 4 the canopy transpiration sub model inputs i e modified priestley taylor coefficient α s fractional vegetation cover f c and vegetation green cover f g followed by the cotton canopy height h c resistance between plastic and soil boundary layer r c and roughness length from soil z 0s were the most sensitive parameters in the tseb pm model this was based on their variance influences first order effects and overall interactions total effects in the simulation of cotton et under the mulched soil condition 5 the adjustment of resistance variables and or related parameters in the tseb pm model is critical to uncertainty reduction of et modeling

9668,weather index based insurances wiis have emerged as a promising risk coping mechanism to compensate for weather induced damage to rainfed agriculture remote sensing may provide cost effective information capable of discriminating the weather spatial variability thus reducing the spatial basis risk i e the mismatch between the weather based index triggering the insurance payout and the actual damage experienced by the farmers which is often one of the causes hindering the wide implementation of wiis in this work we assess which indices based on remote sensing datasets are the best proxy indicators for rainfed maize yield in malawi we analyse the spatial district scale and temporal monthly correlations of historical maize yield data and several remote sensing datasets including the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset the esa cci soil moisture combined dataset version 4 2 the evaporative stress index esi from the atmosphere land exchange inversion model alexi the mod13q1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi with respect to the previous literature this work exploits a historical crop yield dataset at the sub national level which allows us to analyse the correlation of the hydro meteorological and vegetation variables at a higher spatial resolution than what is commonly done i e at the national level using fao national yield statistics and ultimately explore the issues related to wii spatial basis risk results show that the correlations between crop yield and satellite datasets show high spatial and temporal variability making it difficult to identify a unique wii index that is at the same time simple and effective for the entire country precipitation particularly the standardized march precipitation anomaly has the highest correlations with maize yield with pearson correlation values higher than 0 55 in central and south malawi soil moisture and ndvi do not add much value to precipitation in anticipating historical maize yield at the district scale from a methodological perspective our work shows that wii indexes are best identified by i considering datasets with fine spatial resolution whenever possible ii accounting for the vulnerability of the different crop growing stages to water stress iii distinguishing between water scarce and water abundant events abbreviations wii weather index based insurance keywords precipitation drought risk weather index based insurance spatial basis risk data scarce regions sub saharan africa 1 introduction almost 95 of the agriculture in africa is rainfed thus making crop production highly vulnerable to weather and climate related risks such as droughts and heat waves rockström et al 2009 biradar et al 2009 godfray et al 2010 extreme weather events can adversely impact agricultural production and threaten food security particularly in those communities whose livelihoods rely on subsistence food production such as in the majority of smallholder farming systems barnett et al 2008 vogel et al 2019 he et al 2019 and references therein weather index based insurances wiis emerged as a promising risk coping mechanism to compensate for weather induced damage to crop yield especially for rainfed agriculture mills 2007 world bank 2011 instead of relying on crop loss assessment as traditional agricultural insurances the wii payoff is proportional to an index representing the weather conditions experienced by farmers this eliminates the burden and cost of on the ground crop loss assessment thus making wii affordable to low income households and enabling faster payouts because of these features many wii schemes were tested in sub saharan africa in the last decades and few of them have been implemented including those supported by acre africa and r4 rural resilience initiative barnett et al 2008 ntukamazina et al 2017 wii are effective and sustainable only if a good correlation between the index triggering the insurance payout and the actual damage experienced by the farmers exists mills 2007 world bank 2011 carter et al 2015 the mismatch between these two is known as basis risk and represents one of the main challenges that hinders the success of wii the spatial basis risk particularly i e the mismatch between the weather based index and the actual crop damage caused by the spatial variance of the weather crop relationship is one of the major concerns for farmers hess and syroka 2005 leblois and quirion 2013 in fact most of the wii ensuring crop loss due to water stress and droughts relies on indexes expressing deficit or lack of precipitation measured at ground stations barnett et al 2008 world bank 2011 ntukamazina et al 2017 möllmann et al 2020 given the high spatial variability of precipitation events the station records may not represent the actual meteorological conditions experienced by the farmers the further from the station the decline of gauging networks worldwide vorosmarty et al 2001 pagano et al 2014 and the lack of long term and widespread records particularly in developing countries sheffield et al 2014 challenge the wide applicability of wii leblois et al 2014 there has been a recent effort to introduce new gauging networks in sub saharan africa e g the trans african hydro meteorological observatory tahmo launched in 2014 van de giesen et al 2014 which although promising provide short observational records which hinder robust statistical analysis remote sensing represents a good alternative data source for wii because of its large spatial coverage range of spatial and temporal resolutions and long record length de leeuw et al 2014 the remote sensing features which could add value when used in the design of wii instead of gauges are that i remote sensing provides cost effective information available automatically and in near real time ii the data accuracy does not depend on the density and distribution of the gauging network iii the remote sensing datasets are global and in principle capable to discriminate the weather spatial variability these features in turns could potentially contribute to reducing the spatial basis risk and upscaling the wii applicability thus including farmers in remote and or data scarce regions carter et al 2015 de leeuw et al 2014 on the other hand the main issues with using remote sensing in the design of wii are that i contrary to ground stations which provide direct measurements of the weather variables e g the precipitation amount the satellite sensors measure proxy variables thus potentially increasing the uncertainty of the weather estimation and eventually the basis risk ii as a result the wii design may become less transparent and trustworthy to the farmers thus leading to more resistance in the uptake of the insurance a number of studies have explored the potential for remote sensing datasets in the design of wii in sub saharan africa although their actual use in pilot or operational insurance schemes is still rare in their review paper de leeuw et al 2014 report that remote sensing data has been used for assessing weather related risk in crop traditional and index based insurances against flood drought and fire and sometimes it has also been used for verifying the damages claimed in traditional insurances most of the literature concerning drought risk assessment is based on indexes derived by rainfall monitoring hydrological modelling crop monitoring or a combination of them which can address the different aspects of droughts i e the meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought tarnavsky and bonifacio 2020 benami et al 2021 the simplest indexes include rainfall anomalies tarnavsky et al 2014 temporal rainfall attributes such as the duration and or the onset of the rainy season wakjira et al 2021 or short term dryness indicators such as the number of non rainy days senay et al 2014 more complex indexes rely on the integration of the precipitation estimates with water mass balance estimates or crop yield estimates tadesse et al 2008 most of the literature concerning the use of wii against drought risk adopts remote sensing estimate of precipitation or ndvi normalized difference vegetation index to define the weather index barnett et al 2008 funk and budde 2009 de leeuw et al 2014 awondo et al 2020 a large part of the studies using these indexes as part of wiis ensure livestock while the use of wiis for crop insurance is less extensive the reason is likely that the relationship between water availability vegetation greenness and crop yield is more complex than the relationship between water availability vegetation greenness and forage yield in rangelands and it is influenced by agricultural management practices which may vary largely among individual farmers some previous works e g hoffman et al 2018 enenkel et al 2018 2019 have thus claimed the need to define more sophisticated wii indexes for example by accounting for hydrological or weather variables which influence crop growth dynamics more closely than precipitation e g soil moisture evaporative stress index extreme degree days and vapour pressure deficit however these studies often find that variables different than precipitation only slightly improve the prediction of national statistics of crop yield in sub saharan africa on the other hand the adoption of more complex regression techniques with respect to the widely used linear regression e g multivariate non linear or black box relations identified via machine learning algorithms have been shown to improve the prediction performance see vogel et al 2019 hoffman et al 2018 and references therein it is nevertheless unclear if such performance increase can compensate for the more complex wii design which may undermine the farmers understanding of the insurance product and perception of the associated benefits which in turn may weaken their willingness to purchase the insurance gine and yang 2009 patt et al 2010 binswanger mkhize 2012 cole et al 2013 carter et al 2015 osgood et al 2018 möllmann et al 2020 in this work we explore the potential of several remote sensing datasets in reducing the spatial basis risk of a possible wii ensuring maize yield against water scarcity in malawi we analyse the spatial correlations of several indexes representing hydrological variables and vegetation greenness and historical records of maize yield at the sub national level i e county level we focus particularly on rainfed maize which is the most important food crop in malawi and more generally an indicator for food security in sub saharan africa fao ifad wfp 2015 stevens and madani 2016 our research questions are which indexes can reliably represent the exposure of malawi rainfed maize yield to water scarcity at the sub national level what is the added value in considering indexes based on hydrological variables and vegetation greenness other than the commonly used precipitation what is the spatial basis risk associated with the different indexes with respect to the previous literature this work exploits a historical crop yield dataset at the sub national level which allows us to analyse the correlation of the hydro meteorological and vegetation variables at a higher spatial resolution than what is commonly done i e at the national level using the fao national yield statistics and ultimately explore the issues related to wii spatial basis risk we consider the following remote sensing datasets climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset funk et al 2015 esa cci soil moisture combined dataset version 4 2 evaporative stress index esi from the atmosphere land exchange inversion model alexi wardlow et al 2012 mod13q1 dataset including both the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi didan 2015 we compute standardized anomalies for the annual yield records and monthly remote sensing variables also considering consecutive months during the maize growing season to possibly account for cumulative processes which may influence crop growth we then analyse the spatio temporal correlation of the datasets quantified by median pearson correlation coefficient to understand how water scarcity propagates from meteorological i e precipitation to hydrological variables i e soil moisture and finally how it impacts vegetation growth as measured by esi ndvi and evi and historical maize yield data we repeat this analysis by removing the years when a flood occurred according to the emergency events database em dat guha sapir 2019 so to focus specifically on drought risk only 2 study area malawi malawi has an heterogeneous landscape with elevations spanning from approximately 20 to 2900 m a s l and different land cover from forest mostly in the north to cropland fig 1 malawi has a tropical climate with a wet season from november to april which usually receives 95 of the total annual precipitation and a dry season between may and october jayanthi et al 2013 the mean annual temperature shows a clear trend from north to south while the annual average precipitation is quite homogeneous across the country about 700 mm on average but for the high altitude areas where mean annual precipitation can be up to 2500 mm ngongondo et al 2011 malawi is divided into three administrative regions north central and south comprising 28 districts in total agriculture is the main economic sector in the country representing about 40 of the gross domestic product gdp syroka and nucifora 2010 the majority of the agriculture is rainfed and the food production is almost entirely consumed within the country the agricultural economy of malawi strongly dedicated to the subsistence of the population is among the most sensitive to climatic shocks in southern africa minot 2010 clay et al 2003 aragie et al 2018 malawi is indeed prone to experiencing food crisis which have affected around 17 million people from the beginning of the century hess and syroka 2005 harrigan 2008 pourazar 2017 in particular malawi faced a severe drought in 2005 which together with a change in agricultural policy led to food shortage and a consequent increase in maize price in 2005 and 2006 harrigan 2008 to tackle this food crisis the government introduced a new malawi agricultural input subsidy programme which was centred around the distribution of vouchers to approximately 50 of the smallholder farmers for buying fertilizers and improved maize seeds dorward and chirwa 2011 the main difference with respect to previous programmes was to specifically target the most productive farmers with resources i e fertilizers and seeds to improve their food self sufficiency and agricultural income which could in turn boost the national food self sufficiency chinsinga 2008 levy 2005 the malawi agricultural input subsidy programme was successful in fulfilling and sometime even exceeding the national requirements in the following years chibwana et al 2013 in this study we focus on maize which is the dominant crop in malawi followed by cassava tabacco and rice clay et al 2003 according to the fourth integrated household survey ihs4 conducted by the world bank and the malawian national statistical office approximately 83 of the households were engaged in agricultural activities in 2016 and 75 of the crop fields were cultivated with maize national statistical office 2017 maize is thus a good indicator of households food security in the country maize is mostly cultivated in the south and central south districts see fig 2a the sowing period spans from mid november to the end of december and the harvesting period spans from the end of april to the end of july the actual crop season in each field depends on the farm location the local weather conditions and the individual farmers management practices extreme weather events could negatively impact the maize production depending on the plant growing stage maize is very sensitive to water stress during the flowering stage which occurs about 8 weeks after plants emerge i e in february or march while the early vegetative stages are more vulnerable to floods clay et al 2003 çakir 2004 osgood et al 2007 ransom and endres 2014 comas et al 2019 there have been previous studies and implementations of wii against droughts in malawi for groundnuts and maize hess and syroka 2005 chavula and gommes 2006 osgood et al 2007 barnett et al 2008 most of these studies analyse the relations between precipitation recorded at ground stations and crop yields hellmuth et al 2009 specifically acknowledge that the spatial variability of the rainfall and the lack of rainfall stations with reliable and long term records limit the upscaling of the pilot studies and suggest that remote sensing may help in this respect gine and yang 2009 conducted randomized field experiments with maize and groundnut farmers in malawi to understand which conditions favour the uptake of wii insurances almost 70 of the interviewed farmers reported that the amount of rainfall was the most important risk factor for crop production interviews and simulation games conducted with farmers in ethiopia and malawi reported in patt et al 2010 suggests that a better understanding of the wii scheme correlates with higher willingness to purchase it finally reeves 2017 critically discusses the experience of the african risk capacity drought insurance policy in malawi 3 materials and methods 3 1 maize yield dataset local maize is the maize variety that is most consistently cultivated across malawi gine and yang 2009 lunduka et al 2012 we use yearly yield data from official agricultural statistical bulletins provided by the ministry of agriculture in malawi the dataset has a yearly temporal resolution a district spatial resolution for a total of 28 districts in the whole malawi and it spans the period 1984 2016 table 1 fig 2a shows the average percentage of cropland harvested with maize for each district in the period 1984 2016 maize is mostly cultivated in central and south malawi with districts having up to 12 of their cropland cultivated with maize fig 2b shows the average yield computed over the whole of malawi and in the three regions a shift in the mean yield is recognizable in the year 2005 breakpoint resulted from the pettitt test with p value lower than 0 001 which corresponds to the introduction of the agricultural policy mentioned in section 2 3 2 remote sensing datasets we consider precipitation and soil moisture as the main hydrometeorological variables that influence crop growth and ndvi evi and esi as variables representing crop health status table 1 the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset is a quasi global precipitation dataset which combines satellite and ground measurements funk et al 2015 it spans the period from 1981 to near real time with a spatial resolution of 5 5 km2 with respect to other remote sensing precipitation datasets chirps has shown to be the most accurate in africa gebrechorkos et al 2018 dinku et al 2018 we use the esa cci soil moisture combined dataset version 4 2 which spans the period 1979 2015 with a spatial resolution of 25 25 km2 this dataset is derived by the combination of measurements from two active and four passive microwave sensors and represents the moisture in the upper few centimetres of soil dorigo et al 2015 gruber et al 2019 the evaporative stress index esi represents the monthly anomaly of the ratio between actual evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet we use it to identify water stressed vegetation the dataset spans the period 2001 2019 with a spatial resolution of 5 5 km2 et and pet are derived from satellite datasets and the atmosphere land exchange inversion model alexi wardlow et al 2012 finally we use the mod13q1 dataset including both the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi these datasets span the period 2001 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1 1 km2 didan 2015 we disregard ndvi and evi values smaller than 0 1 to exclude non vegetated or sparsely vegetated pixels 3 3 land cover map we use the esa cci land cover map defourny et al 2017 to identify cropland areas in malawi it refers to 2015 and has a spatial resolution of 300 300 m2 in this work we define cropland as the aggregation of three classes in the original esa cci classification namely rainfed cropland mosaic cropland 50 natural vegetation and mosaic natural vegetation 50 cropland most of the cropland is located in central and south malawi while north malawi is mostly covered with forest fig 1 we use this cropland map to mask the remote sensing datasets in some of the analysis as detailed in section 3 5 3 4 emergency events database em dat the emergency events database em dat guha sapir 2019 records various types of disasers worldwide from 1900 to nowadays it is used for vulnerability assessment by various research and governmental institutions and organizations the definition of disaster event adopted in em dat requires that at least one of the following criteria is met 10 or more people reported killed 100 or more people reported affected declaration of a state of emergency call for international assistance we considered the events belonging to the following categories natural disaster hydrological flood riverine flood or flash flood in the period of analysis 2001 2015 north malawi experienced 21 events central malawi experienced 41 events and southern malawi experienced 76 events corresponding to 1 4 2 73 and 5 0 events per year respectively we use this dataset for a comparative analysis on the exposure of maize yield to both flood and drought risk and to drought risk only as detailed in section 3 5 3 5 spatio temporal correlation of statellite datasets and maize yield data our analysis concerns the period 2001 2015 for a total of 15 years as this represents the largest overlapping period of all the datasets we preprocess the datasets in table 1 by computing standardized anomalies for each dataset as follows the crop yield data have an annual time resolution and a spatial resolution corresponding to the administrative districts of malawi for each district i and year j we compute the standardized anomaly z i j x i j μ i p σ i p where z i j is the standardized maize yield x i j is the original maize yield μ i p and σ i p are the mean and standard deviation of maize yield computed over the period p to account for the step change in the mean yield due to the changes in the agricultural policy see fig 2b and section 2 we consider two time periods namely p 2001 2005 if j 2005 and p 2006 2015 if j 2005 no change is instead detectable in the time series of either the hydrometeorological variables or the vegetation greenness variables for each pixel k and aggregation period m corresponding to one month or a sequence of consecutive months we compute the standardized anomaly z k m x k m μ k σ k where the mean and standard deviations account for the entire period of analysis i e 2001 2015 we aggregate consecutive months during the maize growing season to possibly account for cumulative processes which may influence the crop growth we then analyse the spatio temporal correlation of the datasets to understand how water scarcity propagates from meteorological i e precipitation to hydrological variables i e soil moisture and finally how it impacts vegetation growth i e esi ndvi and evi and historical maize yield data we quantify the correlations by means of the pearson correlation coefficient ρ ab σ ab σ a σ b where σ ab is the covariance between the variable a and b and σ a σ b is the standard deviation of the variable a and b respectively in particular we analyse the spatial variability of the pearson correlation coefficients for different time lags between precipitation and the other remote sensing variables when the spatial resolution of the datasets do not match the spatial resolution of chirps i e 5 5 km2 we aggregate the dataset with the finest resolution to the coarsest resolution in other words i we average chirps to 25 25 km2 when analysing the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture ii we average ndvi and evi to 5 5 km2 when analysing the correlation between precipitation and vegetation health we disregard pixels where more than 30 of the data are missing for example because of cloud cover when we analyse the spatio temporal correlation of the remote sensing datasets and historical maize yield data we mask the remote sensing datasets using the cropland mask described in section 3 3 and we compute the median of all the resulting pixels in each district we repeat the correlation analysis by removing the flood years listed in the em dat so to focus specifically on crop yield damage possibly caused by water scarcity only 4 results 4 1 correlation between precipitation and the other remote sensing datasets precipitation and soil moisture present on average the highest pixel to pixel pearson correlation coefficients fig 3 in particular the correlations computed for january february and march are the highest the results show a clear spatial trend with increasing correlation values from north approximately 0 4 to central approximately 0 6 and south malawi approximately 0 7 precipitation and esi show the highest correlations in march in south malawi and in april in central and north malawi as in the previous case there is a clear spatial trend between the 3 regions but the correlation coefficients are in general below 0 4 we acknowledge however that esi has a percentage of missing data up to 85 due to cloud cover in january and february which may affect the correlation results in those months the correlation analysis between precipitation and ndvi and precipitation and evi show very similar results although ndvi presents slightly higher correlation values differently from the previous cases the highest correlation coefficients are obtained when considering a time lag of two months i e when considering precipitation in february or march and ndvi in april or may respectively the spatial trend is visible also in this case with lower and more variable correlation values in north malawi approximately 0 2 and higher and less variable correlation values in south malawi approximately 0 5 4 2 correlation between remote sensing datasets and historical maize yield table 2 shows the median pearson correlation coefficients between each remote sensing dataset and the historical maize yield computed over the 3 malawian regions as detailed in section 3 5 we analyse the correlation for each month and sequence of consecutive months in the maize growing season when considering all the years in the period 2001 2015 and when removing the flood events to focus on the relation between water scarcity and maize yield only only the most interesting results for each remote sensing variable are reported in the table when considering the entire period i e with flood years only precipitation and soil moisture show correlation values larger than 0 5 particularly in march and when considering the aggregation of january february and march in south malawi only when removing flood years from the datasets precipitation and soil moisture show higher correlation values with maize yield both in central and south malawi in addition also ndvi and esi show correlation values higher than 0 5 in central malawi ndvi has generally higher correlation values than evi the spatial differences are noticeable as it was the case in the previous analysis with north malawi showing lower correlation values than central and south malawi fig 4 further explores within each region the spatial variability of the relations which showed the highest correlations reported in table 2 for all the variables the correlation values vary from district to district in each of the 3 regions nevertheless districts in central and south malawi tend to behave more homogeneously than districts in north malawi the degree of spatial variability is however dependent on the variable considered for example precipitation in south malawi and esi in central malawi show the lowest variance as precipitation shows in general higher correlation values to maize yield than the other variables we further explored its relationship with historical maize yield on an annual basis fig 5 shows the scatterplot between march precipitation standardized anomalies and maize yield standardized anomalies in the three regions each point correspond to a district and year in the entire period of analysis and when removing flood years negative march precipitation standardized anomalies clearly correlate with negative crop yield standardized anomalies positive precipitation standardized anomalies instead do not show a clear trend in most cases but not all they are associated with positive maize yield standardized anomalies the cases in which they are associated with negative yield standardized anomalies tends to correspond with years when at least one flood event happened filled circles in the figure the number of flood events are higher in central and south malawi when the flood years are removed monotonic relations are visible in all the 3 regions the water stress effect on the crop yield becomes clearer as well as the saturation of crop yield with increasing precipitation 5 discussion 5 1 on the spatial and temporal resolution of the remote sensing datasets we analyse the correlation between precipitation and other remote sensing variables to investigate how water availability propagates from meteorological i e precipitation to hydrological variables i e soil moisture and finally how it impacts vegetation growth i e esi ndvi and evi precipitation and soil moisture have the highest correlation coefficients during the peak of the rainy season i e in january february and march with no time lag between the two variables section 4 1 and fig 3 even if it is reasonable to expect a delay between precipitation events and the accumulation of moisture in the soil this dynamic is masked by the monthly resolution of our analysis and by the fact that the remote sensed soil moisture is representative of the water storage in the first few centimeters of soil only which dries out quickly after rainfall events the lower correlations in north malawi are likely due to the extensive presence of forests which on the one hand intercept precipitation and on the other hand shade the soil from direct radiation thus affecting the soil moisture accumulation and depletion fig 1 this is confirmed by the correlation analysis between precipitation and esi which show lower values in the north when considering the correlation between precipitation and vegetation indexes the time lag of the maximum correlation increase up to two months which indicates the response time on vegetation growth processes to precipitation this analysis suggests that the remote sensing datasets at the time and spatial resolution adopted in this study are adequate for analysing the effect of water availability to vegetation growth processes although a finer time resolution would likely allow a better detection of hydrometeorological and vegetation dynamics happening on shorter scales than one month this is likely one of the reasons why the soil moisture and esi datasets are less informative than precipitation in anticipating maize yield as discussed in section 5 2 5 2 on potential wii indexes precipitation and soil moisture have the highest and most spatially consistent correlations with crop yield among the variables we have analysed table 2 and fig 4 for both variables we find the highest correlations in march or in the aggregation of february and march in central and south malawi particularly this result is consistent with previous literature e g jayanthi et al 2013 which report that crop in south malawi is most vulnerable to water stress in february and march as mentioned in section 2 this period corresponds to maize flowering in malawi which is one of the most sensitive growing stages to water stress clay et al 2003 çakir 2004 comas et al 2019 our analysis suggests instead that esi is not a good proxy for rainfed maize yield this result may be driven by the high percentage of missing data during the high precipitation months december february which are also critical for maize growth indeed esi can be estimated under clear sky conditions only anderson et al 2007 ndvi generally shows higher correlation values than evi our results show that the correlation values of ndvi in april and may corresponding roughly to the harvesting period as commented in section 2 are comparable to the ones obtained when considering precipitation and soil moisture this is however limited to central malawi ndvi could thus be considered a satisfactory proxy for maize yield only in parts of the country the literature is not unanimous on this point see for example möllmann et al 2020 and references therein as the correlation between ndvi and crop yield may be very location specific turvey and mclaurin 2011 bokusheva et al 2016 for example according to turvey and mclaurin 2011 vegetation greenness is not necessarily a proxy for crop yield while lopresti et al 2015 suggest that ndvi is a satisfactory predictor for wheat yield in a case study in argentina and makaudze and miranda 2010 conclude that ndvi is a more effective wii index than precipitation for maize and cotton yield in zimbabwe contrary to other works e g enenkel et al 2018 2019 our analysis suggest that evapotranspiration soil moisture and vegetation variables do not add much value with respect to precipitation in anticipating historical maize yield at the district spatial resolution in malawi precipitation seems thus to be the most promising candidate for a wii index among the remote sensing datasets we have analysed in this work in fact it not only shows higher correlation coefficients for a wide portion of the country but it has the most straightforward and intuitive connection to crop growth thus increasing the potential for the acceptance and uptake of the insurance from both the insured farmers and the insurance company hess and syroka 2005 osgood et al 2007 world bank 2011 5 3 on the effect of water stress and excess there is a theoretical parabolic relationship an inverted u between crop growth and water availability as both water scarcity and excess inhibit plant growth clay et al 2003 nevertheless the sensitivity of maize to water scarcity or excess can be different depending on the growth stages see the discussion in section 2 our analysis suggests that it is important to account for these differences when analysing the correlations of hydrometeorological variables and crop yield fig 5 suggests that below average precipitation in march is critical for the final maize yield when removing flood years from the analysis the water stress effect on the crop yield becomes clearer as well as the saturation of crop yield with increasing precipitation although most floods are associated with positive precipitation anomalies as expected some are associated with below average precipitation this may descend from the rough details about the flood location extent and duration recorded in the em dat database a flood may have affected a sub portion of the district while the precipitation anomaly is computed on the entire district or may not have been so intense to damage the crops table 2 supports our conclusion because identifying and removing flood events from the analysis generally improves the correlations nevertheless the pearson correlation coefficients do not exceed 0 7 this partly reflects the fact that crop yield depends on many factors that are not necessarily water related such as soil fertility crop management practices pests labour availability among others world bank 2011 sutcliffe et al 2016 concerning the 2005 malawi food crisis the fao reported for example that the 2005 food crisis was the result of a combination of factors including drought floods consecutive poor harvests endemic poverty and the effects of the hiv aids pandemic fao newsroom 2005 this multi driver dependence is evident from the scatterplots in fig 5 which show a considerable spread in crop yield particularly when march precipitation is slightly below average this suggests that a small water deficiency in that period is not always critical and may be compensated by other factors the drivers that may cause this spread should be further investigated as they may suggest possible structural and or policy interventions to increase the yield and reduce its variability 5 4 on the spatial basis risk the maize yield dataset we use in this work is quite unique because it spans a relatively long time period for all the districts across malawi in fact most of the literature adopts the fao national statistics on crop yields e g hoffman et al 2018 enenkel et al 2018 vogel et al 2019 this allows us to analyse the spatial variability of the correlations with the remote sensing datasets for all the analysed relations a clear spatial trend is visible this is likely induced by the elongated shape of the country the landscape of which presents clear gradients in elevation temperature and land cover north malawi usually shows lower correlation values than central and south malawi even among the districts in each region the correlations show high variability our analysis suggests that considering a unique index for the entire malawi may be challenging as the highest correlations in each district are associated to different variables and months unfortunately we do not have historical maize yield records at finer spatial resolution still we could have a sense of this finer spatial variability by considering ndvi prior to the maize senescence approximately around april may as a proxy for maize yield fig 3c f suggests that the spatial heterogeneity of the correlation when considering precipitation may be high even within each district our results show that remote sensing datasets may be very valuable for representing the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and reducing the spatial basis risk as such it could be interesting to further explore its role within a wii pilot scheme the next generation of high resolution remote sensing datasets e g ndvi at 10 10 m2 could allow for a better characterization of the spatial variability of cropland extension and yield estimate that could improve the effectiveness of the insurance contracts bokusheva et al 2016 5 5 limitations and future works althought we use an interesting maize yield dataset as commented in section 5 4 it is difficult to assess how reliable the data is world bank 2011 claims that national and district crop yield statistics may be of limited quality consistency and only available for brief periods of time covering large areas they usually summarize different environmental conditions and farmers adopting different practices which may not be adequately recorded during the data collection process osgood et al 2013 clay et al 2003 reports that there might be an issue with overestimation of yield and production of tuber cassava and sweet potatoes in the reports of the national statistical office of the ministry of agriculture in malawi for these reasons there is limited research about wii considering historical crop yield data enenkel et al 2018 the uncertainty associated with these data is however difficult to quantify the monthly time aggregation we adopted in this study may mask some more complex relationship between hydrometeorological variables and crop growth repeating the analysis using a finer time resolution is potentially interesting for further refining the identification of a possible wii index this would allow also to overcome another limitation of the study i e considering a fixed average maize growing season for the entire malawi and for each year it would be instead interesting to account for the spatial variability and interannual variability of the growing season for example the fao guidelines use the dekad i e a period of 10 consecutive days as unit of time to analyse the crop growth dynamics and indicate that there is some difference in the start and lenght of the maize growing season depending on whether the field is located in low medium or high elevation zones these analyses could further explain the spatial variability of the results shown in this paper and contribute to reduce the spatial basis risk we considered a fixed landcover map in this work corresponding to the year 2015 to identify cropland in malawi cropland expansion is however happening in all sub saharan africa for meeting the growing food demand of the local smallholder farmers chamberlin et al 2014 ordway et al 2017 li et al 2021 a more precise and time varying mapping of cropland location and extent could improve the accuracy of the correlations explored in this work this is however a field of ongoing research as most of the studies so far estimate cropland expansion at the national level only evenson and gollin 2003 grassini et al 2013 as the identification of flooding events is important to focus on the specific impact of water scarcity on maize yield it may be interesting to better characterise the time duration and spatial extent of the floods remote sensing datasets could be used to validate and possibly improve the emdat records as in the previous cases this additional information could contribute to improve the correlations between the precipitation index and maize yield thus ultimately reducing the spatial basis risk 6 conclusions in this work we explored the suitability of using remote sensing datasets as proxy for maize yield in the 28 administrative districts of malawi we analysed the spatial and temporal correlations of the historical maize yield data and several remote sensing datasets including the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset esa cci soil moisture combined dataset version 4 2 the evaporative stress index esi from the atmosphere land exchange inversion model alexi the mod13q1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi our analysis shows that indexes based on precipitation particularly precipitation standardized anomaly in march provides the highest pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 55 and most spatially consistent correlations across the districts in malawi soil moisture and ndvi show correlations similar to precipitation in some months and areas but contrary to what is suggested by some recent literature they do not improve significantly the correlations with maize yield at the spatial and temporal resolution adopted in this study ndvi shows higher correlations than evi and esi is not a suitable proxy for rainfed maize yield in malawi because of the high percentage of missing values in the months of february and march overall the use of remote sensing dataset allowed us to discriminate the spatial variability of the relation between water availability and crop yield the strength of the relations are location dependent the highest and less variable correlation values are found in central and south malawi we conclude that the spatial basis risk can be addressed by adopting remote sensing datasets in the definition of a wii index but the variability of the correlations across and within the 3 malawian regions still prevents an identification of a unique index which could be regarded as the most suitable maize crop yield proxy in the whole country from the methodological point of view we recognize the importance of distinguishing between water scarce and water abundant events which if considered together may confound the strength of the relations investigated it is also important to test the specific area for the suitability of ndvi as a proxy for crop yield as this is very location dependent also considering a priori field or laboratory based knowledge on the vulnerability of the different crop growing

9668,weather index based insurances wiis have emerged as a promising risk coping mechanism to compensate for weather induced damage to rainfed agriculture remote sensing may provide cost effective information capable of discriminating the weather spatial variability thus reducing the spatial basis risk i e the mismatch between the weather based index triggering the insurance payout and the actual damage experienced by the farmers which is often one of the causes hindering the wide implementation of wiis in this work we assess which indices based on remote sensing datasets are the best proxy indicators for rainfed maize yield in malawi we analyse the spatial district scale and temporal monthly correlations of historical maize yield data and several remote sensing datasets including the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset the esa cci soil moisture combined dataset version 4 2 the evaporative stress index esi from the atmosphere land exchange inversion model alexi the mod13q1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi with respect to the previous literature this work exploits a historical crop yield dataset at the sub national level which allows us to analyse the correlation of the hydro meteorological and vegetation variables at a higher spatial resolution than what is commonly done i e at the national level using fao national yield statistics and ultimately explore the issues related to wii spatial basis risk results show that the correlations between crop yield and satellite datasets show high spatial and temporal variability making it difficult to identify a unique wii index that is at the same time simple and effective for the entire country precipitation particularly the standardized march precipitation anomaly has the highest correlations with maize yield with pearson correlation values higher than 0 55 in central and south malawi soil moisture and ndvi do not add much value to precipitation in anticipating historical maize yield at the district scale from a methodological perspective our work shows that wii indexes are best identified by i considering datasets with fine spatial resolution whenever possible ii accounting for the vulnerability of the different crop growing stages to water stress iii distinguishing between water scarce and water abundant events abbreviations wii weather index based insurance keywords precipitation drought risk weather index based insurance spatial basis risk data scarce regions sub saharan africa 1 introduction almost 95 of the agriculture in africa is rainfed thus making crop production highly vulnerable to weather and climate related risks such as droughts and heat waves rockström et al 2009 biradar et al 2009 godfray et al 2010 extreme weather events can adversely impact agricultural production and threaten food security particularly in those communities whose livelihoods rely on subsistence food production such as in the majority of smallholder farming systems barnett et al 2008 vogel et al 2019 he et al 2019 and references therein weather index based insurances wiis emerged as a promising risk coping mechanism to compensate for weather induced damage to crop yield especially for rainfed agriculture mills 2007 world bank 2011 instead of relying on crop loss assessment as traditional agricultural insurances the wii payoff is proportional to an index representing the weather conditions experienced by farmers this eliminates the burden and cost of on the ground crop loss assessment thus making wii affordable to low income households and enabling faster payouts because of these features many wii schemes were tested in sub saharan africa in the last decades and few of them have been implemented including those supported by acre africa and r4 rural resilience initiative barnett et al 2008 ntukamazina et al 2017 wii are effective and sustainable only if a good correlation between the index triggering the insurance payout and the actual damage experienced by the farmers exists mills 2007 world bank 2011 carter et al 2015 the mismatch between these two is known as basis risk and represents one of the main challenges that hinders the success of wii the spatial basis risk particularly i e the mismatch between the weather based index and the actual crop damage caused by the spatial variance of the weather crop relationship is one of the major concerns for farmers hess and syroka 2005 leblois and quirion 2013 in fact most of the wii ensuring crop loss due to water stress and droughts relies on indexes expressing deficit or lack of precipitation measured at ground stations barnett et al 2008 world bank 2011 ntukamazina et al 2017 möllmann et al 2020 given the high spatial variability of precipitation events the station records may not represent the actual meteorological conditions experienced by the farmers the further from the station the decline of gauging networks worldwide vorosmarty et al 2001 pagano et al 2014 and the lack of long term and widespread records particularly in developing countries sheffield et al 2014 challenge the wide applicability of wii leblois et al 2014 there has been a recent effort to introduce new gauging networks in sub saharan africa e g the trans african hydro meteorological observatory tahmo launched in 2014 van de giesen et al 2014 which although promising provide short observational records which hinder robust statistical analysis remote sensing represents a good alternative data source for wii because of its large spatial coverage range of spatial and temporal resolutions and long record length de leeuw et al 2014 the remote sensing features which could add value when used in the design of wii instead of gauges are that i remote sensing provides cost effective information available automatically and in near real time ii the data accuracy does not depend on the density and distribution of the gauging network iii the remote sensing datasets are global and in principle capable to discriminate the weather spatial variability these features in turns could potentially contribute to reducing the spatial basis risk and upscaling the wii applicability thus including farmers in remote and or data scarce regions carter et al 2015 de leeuw et al 2014 on the other hand the main issues with using remote sensing in the design of wii are that i contrary to ground stations which provide direct measurements of the weather variables e g the precipitation amount the satellite sensors measure proxy variables thus potentially increasing the uncertainty of the weather estimation and eventually the basis risk ii as a result the wii design may become less transparent and trustworthy to the farmers thus leading to more resistance in the uptake of the insurance a number of studies have explored the potential for remote sensing datasets in the design of wii in sub saharan africa although their actual use in pilot or operational insurance schemes is still rare in their review paper de leeuw et al 2014 report that remote sensing data has been used for assessing weather related risk in crop traditional and index based insurances against flood drought and fire and sometimes it has also been used for verifying the damages claimed in traditional insurances most of the literature concerning drought risk assessment is based on indexes derived by rainfall monitoring hydrological modelling crop monitoring or a combination of them which can address the different aspects of droughts i e the meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought tarnavsky and bonifacio 2020 benami et al 2021 the simplest indexes include rainfall anomalies tarnavsky et al 2014 temporal rainfall attributes such as the duration and or the onset of the rainy season wakjira et al 2021 or short term dryness indicators such as the number of non rainy days senay et al 2014 more complex indexes rely on the integration of the precipitation estimates with water mass balance estimates or crop yield estimates tadesse et al 2008 most of the literature concerning the use of wii against drought risk adopts remote sensing estimate of precipitation or ndvi normalized difference vegetation index to define the weather index barnett et al 2008 funk and budde 2009 de leeuw et al 2014 awondo et al 2020 a large part of the studies using these indexes as part of wiis ensure livestock while the use of wiis for crop insurance is less extensive the reason is likely that the relationship between water availability vegetation greenness and crop yield is more complex than the relationship between water availability vegetation greenness and forage yield in rangelands and it is influenced by agricultural management practices which may vary largely among individual farmers some previous works e g hoffman et al 2018 enenkel et al 2018 2019 have thus claimed the need to define more sophisticated wii indexes for example by accounting for hydrological or weather variables which influence crop growth dynamics more closely than precipitation e g soil moisture evaporative stress index extreme degree days and vapour pressure deficit however these studies often find that variables different than precipitation only slightly improve the prediction of national statistics of crop yield in sub saharan africa on the other hand the adoption of more complex regression techniques with respect to the widely used linear regression e g multivariate non linear or black box relations identified via machine learning algorithms have been shown to improve the prediction performance see vogel et al 2019 hoffman et al 2018 and references therein it is nevertheless unclear if such performance increase can compensate for the more complex wii design which may undermine the farmers understanding of the insurance product and perception of the associated benefits which in turn may weaken their willingness to purchase the insurance gine and yang 2009 patt et al 2010 binswanger mkhize 2012 cole et al 2013 carter et al 2015 osgood et al 2018 möllmann et al 2020 in this work we explore the potential of several remote sensing datasets in reducing the spatial basis risk of a possible wii ensuring maize yield against water scarcity in malawi we analyse the spatial correlations of several indexes representing hydrological variables and vegetation greenness and historical records of maize yield at the sub national level i e county level we focus particularly on rainfed maize which is the most important food crop in malawi and more generally an indicator for food security in sub saharan africa fao ifad wfp 2015 stevens and madani 2016 our research questions are which indexes can reliably represent the exposure of malawi rainfed maize yield to water scarcity at the sub national level what is the added value in considering indexes based on hydrological variables and vegetation greenness other than the commonly used precipitation what is the spatial basis risk associated with the different indexes with respect to the previous literature this work exploits a historical crop yield dataset at the sub national level which allows us to analyse the correlation of the hydro meteorological and vegetation variables at a higher spatial resolution than what is commonly done i e at the national level using the fao national yield statistics and ultimately explore the issues related to wii spatial basis risk we consider the following remote sensing datasets climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset funk et al 2015 esa cci soil moisture combined dataset version 4 2 evaporative stress index esi from the atmosphere land exchange inversion model alexi wardlow et al 2012 mod13q1 dataset including both the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi didan 2015 we compute standardized anomalies for the annual yield records and monthly remote sensing variables also considering consecutive months during the maize growing season to possibly account for cumulative processes which may influence crop growth we then analyse the spatio temporal correlation of the datasets quantified by median pearson correlation coefficient to understand how water scarcity propagates from meteorological i e precipitation to hydrological variables i e soil moisture and finally how it impacts vegetation growth as measured by esi ndvi and evi and historical maize yield data we repeat this analysis by removing the years when a flood occurred according to the emergency events database em dat guha sapir 2019 so to focus specifically on drought risk only 2 study area malawi malawi has an heterogeneous landscape with elevations spanning from approximately 20 to 2900 m a s l and different land cover from forest mostly in the north to cropland fig 1 malawi has a tropical climate with a wet season from november to april which usually receives 95 of the total annual precipitation and a dry season between may and october jayanthi et al 2013 the mean annual temperature shows a clear trend from north to south while the annual average precipitation is quite homogeneous across the country about 700 mm on average but for the high altitude areas where mean annual precipitation can be up to 2500 mm ngongondo et al 2011 malawi is divided into three administrative regions north central and south comprising 28 districts in total agriculture is the main economic sector in the country representing about 40 of the gross domestic product gdp syroka and nucifora 2010 the majority of the agriculture is rainfed and the food production is almost entirely consumed within the country the agricultural economy of malawi strongly dedicated to the subsistence of the population is among the most sensitive to climatic shocks in southern africa minot 2010 clay et al 2003 aragie et al 2018 malawi is indeed prone to experiencing food crisis which have affected around 17 million people from the beginning of the century hess and syroka 2005 harrigan 2008 pourazar 2017 in particular malawi faced a severe drought in 2005 which together with a change in agricultural policy led to food shortage and a consequent increase in maize price in 2005 and 2006 harrigan 2008 to tackle this food crisis the government introduced a new malawi agricultural input subsidy programme which was centred around the distribution of vouchers to approximately 50 of the smallholder farmers for buying fertilizers and improved maize seeds dorward and chirwa 2011 the main difference with respect to previous programmes was to specifically target the most productive farmers with resources i e fertilizers and seeds to improve their food self sufficiency and agricultural income which could in turn boost the national food self sufficiency chinsinga 2008 levy 2005 the malawi agricultural input subsidy programme was successful in fulfilling and sometime even exceeding the national requirements in the following years chibwana et al 2013 in this study we focus on maize which is the dominant crop in malawi followed by cassava tabacco and rice clay et al 2003 according to the fourth integrated household survey ihs4 conducted by the world bank and the malawian national statistical office approximately 83 of the households were engaged in agricultural activities in 2016 and 75 of the crop fields were cultivated with maize national statistical office 2017 maize is thus a good indicator of households food security in the country maize is mostly cultivated in the south and central south districts see fig 2a the sowing period spans from mid november to the end of december and the harvesting period spans from the end of april to the end of july the actual crop season in each field depends on the farm location the local weather conditions and the individual farmers management practices extreme weather events could negatively impact the maize production depending on the plant growing stage maize is very sensitive to water stress during the flowering stage which occurs about 8 weeks after plants emerge i e in february or march while the early vegetative stages are more vulnerable to floods clay et al 2003 çakir 2004 osgood et al 2007 ransom and endres 2014 comas et al 2019 there have been previous studies and implementations of wii against droughts in malawi for groundnuts and maize hess and syroka 2005 chavula and gommes 2006 osgood et al 2007 barnett et al 2008 most of these studies analyse the relations between precipitation recorded at ground stations and crop yields hellmuth et al 2009 specifically acknowledge that the spatial variability of the rainfall and the lack of rainfall stations with reliable and long term records limit the upscaling of the pilot studies and suggest that remote sensing may help in this respect gine and yang 2009 conducted randomized field experiments with maize and groundnut farmers in malawi to understand which conditions favour the uptake of wii insurances almost 70 of the interviewed farmers reported that the amount of rainfall was the most important risk factor for crop production interviews and simulation games conducted with farmers in ethiopia and malawi reported in patt et al 2010 suggests that a better understanding of the wii scheme correlates with higher willingness to purchase it finally reeves 2017 critically discusses the experience of the african risk capacity drought insurance policy in malawi 3 materials and methods 3 1 maize yield dataset local maize is the maize variety that is most consistently cultivated across malawi gine and yang 2009 lunduka et al 2012 we use yearly yield data from official agricultural statistical bulletins provided by the ministry of agriculture in malawi the dataset has a yearly temporal resolution a district spatial resolution for a total of 28 districts in the whole malawi and it spans the period 1984 2016 table 1 fig 2a shows the average percentage of cropland harvested with maize for each district in the period 1984 2016 maize is mostly cultivated in central and south malawi with districts having up to 12 of their cropland cultivated with maize fig 2b shows the average yield computed over the whole of malawi and in the three regions a shift in the mean yield is recognizable in the year 2005 breakpoint resulted from the pettitt test with p value lower than 0 001 which corresponds to the introduction of the agricultural policy mentioned in section 2 3 2 remote sensing datasets we consider precipitation and soil moisture as the main hydrometeorological variables that influence crop growth and ndvi evi and esi as variables representing crop health status table 1 the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset is a quasi global precipitation dataset which combines satellite and ground measurements funk et al 2015 it spans the period from 1981 to near real time with a spatial resolution of 5 5 km2 with respect to other remote sensing precipitation datasets chirps has shown to be the most accurate in africa gebrechorkos et al 2018 dinku et al 2018 we use the esa cci soil moisture combined dataset version 4 2 which spans the period 1979 2015 with a spatial resolution of 25 25 km2 this dataset is derived by the combination of measurements from two active and four passive microwave sensors and represents the moisture in the upper few centimetres of soil dorigo et al 2015 gruber et al 2019 the evaporative stress index esi represents the monthly anomaly of the ratio between actual evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet we use it to identify water stressed vegetation the dataset spans the period 2001 2019 with a spatial resolution of 5 5 km2 et and pet are derived from satellite datasets and the atmosphere land exchange inversion model alexi wardlow et al 2012 finally we use the mod13q1 dataset including both the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi these datasets span the period 2001 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1 1 km2 didan 2015 we disregard ndvi and evi values smaller than 0 1 to exclude non vegetated or sparsely vegetated pixels 3 3 land cover map we use the esa cci land cover map defourny et al 2017 to identify cropland areas in malawi it refers to 2015 and has a spatial resolution of 300 300 m2 in this work we define cropland as the aggregation of three classes in the original esa cci classification namely rainfed cropland mosaic cropland 50 natural vegetation and mosaic natural vegetation 50 cropland most of the cropland is located in central and south malawi while north malawi is mostly covered with forest fig 1 we use this cropland map to mask the remote sensing datasets in some of the analysis as detailed in section 3 5 3 4 emergency events database em dat the emergency events database em dat guha sapir 2019 records various types of disasers worldwide from 1900 to nowadays it is used for vulnerability assessment by various research and governmental institutions and organizations the definition of disaster event adopted in em dat requires that at least one of the following criteria is met 10 or more people reported killed 100 or more people reported affected declaration of a state of emergency call for international assistance we considered the events belonging to the following categories natural disaster hydrological flood riverine flood or flash flood in the period of analysis 2001 2015 north malawi experienced 21 events central malawi experienced 41 events and southern malawi experienced 76 events corresponding to 1 4 2 73 and 5 0 events per year respectively we use this dataset for a comparative analysis on the exposure of maize yield to both flood and drought risk and to drought risk only as detailed in section 3 5 3 5 spatio temporal correlation of statellite datasets and maize yield data our analysis concerns the period 2001 2015 for a total of 15 years as this represents the largest overlapping period of all the datasets we preprocess the datasets in table 1 by computing standardized anomalies for each dataset as follows the crop yield data have an annual time resolution and a spatial resolution corresponding to the administrative districts of malawi for each district i and year j we compute the standardized anomaly z i j x i j μ i p σ i p where z i j is the standardized maize yield x i j is the original maize yield μ i p and σ i p are the mean and standard deviation of maize yield computed over the period p to account for the step change in the mean yield due to the changes in the agricultural policy see fig 2b and section 2 we consider two time periods namely p 2001 2005 if j 2005 and p 2006 2015 if j 2005 no change is instead detectable in the time series of either the hydrometeorological variables or the vegetation greenness variables for each pixel k and aggregation period m corresponding to one month or a sequence of consecutive months we compute the standardized anomaly z k m x k m μ k σ k where the mean and standard deviations account for the entire period of analysis i e 2001 2015 we aggregate consecutive months during the maize growing season to possibly account for cumulative processes which may influence the crop growth we then analyse the spatio temporal correlation of the datasets to understand how water scarcity propagates from meteorological i e precipitation to hydrological variables i e soil moisture and finally how it impacts vegetation growth i e esi ndvi and evi and historical maize yield data we quantify the correlations by means of the pearson correlation coefficient ρ ab σ ab σ a σ b where σ ab is the covariance between the variable a and b and σ a σ b is the standard deviation of the variable a and b respectively in particular we analyse the spatial variability of the pearson correlation coefficients for different time lags between precipitation and the other remote sensing variables when the spatial resolution of the datasets do not match the spatial resolution of chirps i e 5 5 km2 we aggregate the dataset with the finest resolution to the coarsest resolution in other words i we average chirps to 25 25 km2 when analysing the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture ii we average ndvi and evi to 5 5 km2 when analysing the correlation between precipitation and vegetation health we disregard pixels where more than 30 of the data are missing for example because of cloud cover when we analyse the spatio temporal correlation of the remote sensing datasets and historical maize yield data we mask the remote sensing datasets using the cropland mask described in section 3 3 and we compute the median of all the resulting pixels in each district we repeat the correlation analysis by removing the flood years listed in the em dat so to focus specifically on crop yield damage possibly caused by water scarcity only 4 results 4 1 correlation between precipitation and the other remote sensing datasets precipitation and soil moisture present on average the highest pixel to pixel pearson correlation coefficients fig 3 in particular the correlations computed for january february and march are the highest the results show a clear spatial trend with increasing correlation values from north approximately 0 4 to central approximately 0 6 and south malawi approximately 0 7 precipitation and esi show the highest correlations in march in south malawi and in april in central and north malawi as in the previous case there is a clear spatial trend between the 3 regions but the correlation coefficients are in general below 0 4 we acknowledge however that esi has a percentage of missing data up to 85 due to cloud cover in january and february which may affect the correlation results in those months the correlation analysis between precipitation and ndvi and precipitation and evi show very similar results although ndvi presents slightly higher correlation values differently from the previous cases the highest correlation coefficients are obtained when considering a time lag of two months i e when considering precipitation in february or march and ndvi in april or may respectively the spatial trend is visible also in this case with lower and more variable correlation values in north malawi approximately 0 2 and higher and less variable correlation values in south malawi approximately 0 5 4 2 correlation between remote sensing datasets and historical maize yield table 2 shows the median pearson correlation coefficients between each remote sensing dataset and the historical maize yield computed over the 3 malawian regions as detailed in section 3 5 we analyse the correlation for each month and sequence of consecutive months in the maize growing season when considering all the years in the period 2001 2015 and when removing the flood events to focus on the relation between water scarcity and maize yield only only the most interesting results for each remote sensing variable are reported in the table when considering the entire period i e with flood years only precipitation and soil moisture show correlation values larger than 0 5 particularly in march and when considering the aggregation of january february and march in south malawi only when removing flood years from the datasets precipitation and soil moisture show higher correlation values with maize yield both in central and south malawi in addition also ndvi and esi show correlation values higher than 0 5 in central malawi ndvi has generally higher correlation values than evi the spatial differences are noticeable as it was the case in the previous analysis with north malawi showing lower correlation values than central and south malawi fig 4 further explores within each region the spatial variability of the relations which showed the highest correlations reported in table 2 for all the variables the correlation values vary from district to district in each of the 3 regions nevertheless districts in central and south malawi tend to behave more homogeneously than districts in north malawi the degree of spatial variability is however dependent on the variable considered for example precipitation in south malawi and esi in central malawi show the lowest variance as precipitation shows in general higher correlation values to maize yield than the other variables we further explored its relationship with historical maize yield on an annual basis fig 5 shows the scatterplot between march precipitation standardized anomalies and maize yield standardized anomalies in the three regions each point correspond to a district and year in the entire period of analysis and when removing flood years negative march precipitation standardized anomalies clearly correlate with negative crop yield standardized anomalies positive precipitation standardized anomalies instead do not show a clear trend in most cases but not all they are associated with positive maize yield standardized anomalies the cases in which they are associated with negative yield standardized anomalies tends to correspond with years when at least one flood event happened filled circles in the figure the number of flood events are higher in central and south malawi when the flood years are removed monotonic relations are visible in all the 3 regions the water stress effect on the crop yield becomes clearer as well as the saturation of crop yield with increasing precipitation 5 discussion 5 1 on the spatial and temporal resolution of the remote sensing datasets we analyse the correlation between precipitation and other remote sensing variables to investigate how water availability propagates from meteorological i e precipitation to hydrological variables i e soil moisture and finally how it impacts vegetation growth i e esi ndvi and evi precipitation and soil moisture have the highest correlation coefficients during the peak of the rainy season i e in january february and march with no time lag between the two variables section 4 1 and fig 3 even if it is reasonable to expect a delay between precipitation events and the accumulation of moisture in the soil this dynamic is masked by the monthly resolution of our analysis and by the fact that the remote sensed soil moisture is representative of the water storage in the first few centimeters of soil only which dries out quickly after rainfall events the lower correlations in north malawi are likely due to the extensive presence of forests which on the one hand intercept precipitation and on the other hand shade the soil from direct radiation thus affecting the soil moisture accumulation and depletion fig 1 this is confirmed by the correlation analysis between precipitation and esi which show lower values in the north when considering the correlation between precipitation and vegetation indexes the time lag of the maximum correlation increase up to two months which indicates the response time on vegetation growth processes to precipitation this analysis suggests that the remote sensing datasets at the time and spatial resolution adopted in this study are adequate for analysing the effect of water availability to vegetation growth processes although a finer time resolution would likely allow a better detection of hydrometeorological and vegetation dynamics happening on shorter scales than one month this is likely one of the reasons why the soil moisture and esi datasets are less informative than precipitation in anticipating maize yield as discussed in section 5 2 5 2 on potential wii indexes precipitation and soil moisture have the highest and most spatially consistent correlations with crop yield among the variables we have analysed table 2 and fig 4 for both variables we find the highest correlations in march or in the aggregation of february and march in central and south malawi particularly this result is consistent with previous literature e g jayanthi et al 2013 which report that crop in south malawi is most vulnerable to water stress in february and march as mentioned in section 2 this period corresponds to maize flowering in malawi which is one of the most sensitive growing stages to water stress clay et al 2003 çakir 2004 comas et al 2019 our analysis suggests instead that esi is not a good proxy for rainfed maize yield this result may be driven by the high percentage of missing data during the high precipitation months december february which are also critical for maize growth indeed esi can be estimated under clear sky conditions only anderson et al 2007 ndvi generally shows higher correlation values than evi our results show that the correlation values of ndvi in april and may corresponding roughly to the harvesting period as commented in section 2 are comparable to the ones obtained when considering precipitation and soil moisture this is however limited to central malawi ndvi could thus be considered a satisfactory proxy for maize yield only in parts of the country the literature is not unanimous on this point see for example möllmann et al 2020 and references therein as the correlation between ndvi and crop yield may be very location specific turvey and mclaurin 2011 bokusheva et al 2016 for example according to turvey and mclaurin 2011 vegetation greenness is not necessarily a proxy for crop yield while lopresti et al 2015 suggest that ndvi is a satisfactory predictor for wheat yield in a case study in argentina and makaudze and miranda 2010 conclude that ndvi is a more effective wii index than precipitation for maize and cotton yield in zimbabwe contrary to other works e g enenkel et al 2018 2019 our analysis suggest that evapotranspiration soil moisture and vegetation variables do not add much value with respect to precipitation in anticipating historical maize yield at the district spatial resolution in malawi precipitation seems thus to be the most promising candidate for a wii index among the remote sensing datasets we have analysed in this work in fact it not only shows higher correlation coefficients for a wide portion of the country but it has the most straightforward and intuitive connection to crop growth thus increasing the potential for the acceptance and uptake of the insurance from both the insured farmers and the insurance company hess and syroka 2005 osgood et al 2007 world bank 2011 5 3 on the effect of water stress and excess there is a theoretical parabolic relationship an inverted u between crop growth and water availability as both water scarcity and excess inhibit plant growth clay et al 2003 nevertheless the sensitivity of maize to water scarcity or excess can be different depending on the growth stages see the discussion in section 2 our analysis suggests that it is important to account for these differences when analysing the correlations of hydrometeorological variables and crop yield fig 5 suggests that below average precipitation in march is critical for the final maize yield when removing flood years from the analysis the water stress effect on the crop yield becomes clearer as well as the saturation of crop yield with increasing precipitation although most floods are associated with positive precipitation anomalies as expected some are associated with below average precipitation this may descend from the rough details about the flood location extent and duration recorded in the em dat database a flood may have affected a sub portion of the district while the precipitation anomaly is computed on the entire district or may not have been so intense to damage the crops table 2 supports our conclusion because identifying and removing flood events from the analysis generally improves the correlations nevertheless the pearson correlation coefficients do not exceed 0 7 this partly reflects the fact that crop yield depends on many factors that are not necessarily water related such as soil fertility crop management practices pests labour availability among others world bank 2011 sutcliffe et al 2016 concerning the 2005 malawi food crisis the fao reported for example that the 2005 food crisis was the result of a combination of factors including drought floods consecutive poor harvests endemic poverty and the effects of the hiv aids pandemic fao newsroom 2005 this multi driver dependence is evident from the scatterplots in fig 5 which show a considerable spread in crop yield particularly when march precipitation is slightly below average this suggests that a small water deficiency in that period is not always critical and may be compensated by other factors the drivers that may cause this spread should be further investigated as they may suggest possible structural and or policy interventions to increase the yield and reduce its variability 5 4 on the spatial basis risk the maize yield dataset we use in this work is quite unique because it spans a relatively long time period for all the districts across malawi in fact most of the literature adopts the fao national statistics on crop yields e g hoffman et al 2018 enenkel et al 2018 vogel et al 2019 this allows us to analyse the spatial variability of the correlations with the remote sensing datasets for all the analysed relations a clear spatial trend is visible this is likely induced by the elongated shape of the country the landscape of which presents clear gradients in elevation temperature and land cover north malawi usually shows lower correlation values than central and south malawi even among the districts in each region the correlations show high variability our analysis suggests that considering a unique index for the entire malawi may be challenging as the highest correlations in each district are associated to different variables and months unfortunately we do not have historical maize yield records at finer spatial resolution still we could have a sense of this finer spatial variability by considering ndvi prior to the maize senescence approximately around april may as a proxy for maize yield fig 3c f suggests that the spatial heterogeneity of the correlation when considering precipitation may be high even within each district our results show that remote sensing datasets may be very valuable for representing the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and reducing the spatial basis risk as such it could be interesting to further explore its role within a wii pilot scheme the next generation of high resolution remote sensing datasets e g ndvi at 10 10 m2 could allow for a better characterization of the spatial variability of cropland extension and yield estimate that could improve the effectiveness of the insurance contracts bokusheva et al 2016 5 5 limitations and future works althought we use an interesting maize yield dataset as commented in section 5 4 it is difficult to assess how reliable the data is world bank 2011 claims that national and district crop yield statistics may be of limited quality consistency and only available for brief periods of time covering large areas they usually summarize different environmental conditions and farmers adopting different practices which may not be adequately recorded during the data collection process osgood et al 2013 clay et al 2003 reports that there might be an issue with overestimation of yield and production of tuber cassava and sweet potatoes in the reports of the national statistical office of the ministry of agriculture in malawi for these reasons there is limited research about wii considering historical crop yield data enenkel et al 2018 the uncertainty associated with these data is however difficult to quantify the monthly time aggregation we adopted in this study may mask some more complex relationship between hydrometeorological variables and crop growth repeating the analysis using a finer time resolution is potentially interesting for further refining the identification of a possible wii index this would allow also to overcome another limitation of the study i e considering a fixed average maize growing season for the entire malawi and for each year it would be instead interesting to account for the spatial variability and interannual variability of the growing season for example the fao guidelines use the dekad i e a period of 10 consecutive days as unit of time to analyse the crop growth dynamics and indicate that there is some difference in the start and lenght of the maize growing season depending on whether the field is located in low medium or high elevation zones these analyses could further explain the spatial variability of the results shown in this paper and contribute to reduce the spatial basis risk we considered a fixed landcover map in this work corresponding to the year 2015 to identify cropland in malawi cropland expansion is however happening in all sub saharan africa for meeting the growing food demand of the local smallholder farmers chamberlin et al 2014 ordway et al 2017 li et al 2021 a more precise and time varying mapping of cropland location and extent could improve the accuracy of the correlations explored in this work this is however a field of ongoing research as most of the studies so far estimate cropland expansion at the national level only evenson and gollin 2003 grassini et al 2013 as the identification of flooding events is important to focus on the specific impact of water scarcity on maize yield it may be interesting to better characterise the time duration and spatial extent of the floods remote sensing datasets could be used to validate and possibly improve the emdat records as in the previous cases this additional information could contribute to improve the correlations between the precipitation index and maize yield thus ultimately reducing the spatial basis risk 6 conclusions in this work we explored the suitability of using remote sensing datasets as proxy for maize yield in the 28 administrative districts of malawi we analysed the spatial and temporal correlations of the historical maize yield data and several remote sensing datasets including the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset esa cci soil moisture combined dataset version 4 2 the evaporative stress index esi from the atmosphere land exchange inversion model alexi the mod13q1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi our analysis shows that indexes based on precipitation particularly precipitation standardized anomaly in march provides the highest pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 55 and most spatially consistent correlations across the districts in malawi soil moisture and ndvi show correlations similar to precipitation in some months and areas but contrary to what is suggested by some recent literature they do not improve significantly the correlations with maize yield at the spatial and temporal resolution adopted in this study ndvi shows higher correlations than evi and esi is not a suitable proxy for rainfed maize yield in malawi because of the high percentage of missing values in the months of february and march overall the use of remote sensing dataset allowed us to discriminate the spatial variability of the relation between water availability and crop yield the strength of the relations are location dependent the highest and less variable correlation values are found in central and south malawi we conclude that the spatial basis risk can be addressed by adopting remote sensing datasets in the definition of a wii index but the variability of the correlations across and within the 3 malawian regions still prevents an identification of a unique index which could be regarded as the most suitable maize crop yield proxy in the whole country from the methodological point of view we recognize the importance of distinguishing between water scarce and water abundant events which if considered together may confound the strength of the relations investigated it is also important to test the specific area for the suitability of ndvi as a proxy for crop yield as this is very location dependent also considering a priori field or laboratory based knowledge on the vulnerability of the different crop growing

9669,drought and heat are major stresses that adversely affect crop production in arid and semi arid regions this study assessed the water stress status of rainfed barley genotypes and identified their critical drought stress threshold in the cold semi arid area of iran the field experiments were conducted at the dryland agricultural research institute maragheh iran in 2015 16 and 2017 18 the experimental design was a split plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design with three replications the main plots included two water regimes rainfed stress and supplemental irrigation and the subplots included 15 barley genotypes data were collected for grain yield and its components surface temperature ts taken at six crop growth stages from flag leaf to soft dough and normalized differences vegetative index ndvi at seven crop growth stages from the first node to the soft dough the water deficit index wdi was determined using ndvi and the difference between ts and air temperature ta based on the wdi the critical water stress and temperature thresholds for genotypes were 0 59 and 24 3 c respectively the identified temperature threshold was equivalent to 7 2 mm day 1 evapotranspiration et0 and 4 3 kpa vapor pressure deficient the genotypes experienced a maximum drought stress when the wdi ts and et0 reached 1 01 34 6 c upper limit and 11 6 mm day 1 respectively the critical drought threshold happened 254 days after the sowing date wdi had strong negative correlation with both grain and biological yields according to wdi ghara arpa kuban 06 and ansar genotypes were placed in the drought tolerant group and are suitable for rainfed conditions whereas arm icb sahand sararood1 and ste antares yea762 genotypes were more suitable for supplemental irrigation conditions it can be concluded that wdi could effectively discriminate genotypes into tolerant and susceptible groups and identify the starting time of water stress under rainfed conditions keywords canopy temperature ndvi supplemental irrigation rainfed conditions surface temperature 1 introduction barley is one of the most common crops grown under low input and harsh conditions due to its wide adaptability and tolerance to drought heat and salinity stresses fischbeck 2002 although barley is relatively tolerant to drought stress the water stress results in yield reduction when it occurs during stem elongation and grain filling stages sharifi alhoseini and taherian 2019 in the rainfed areas water stress is often combined with heat stress specifically after anthesis amplifying the adverse effects of water stress via disrupting water uptake of plants elbashier 2012 different strategies have been proposed to improve crop tolerance to water and terminal heat stress breeders primarily focus on genotypes with high water stress tolerance and high water use efficiency agronomists are also using the methods based on plant water status such as pressure chamber method boyer 1967 pressure bomb technique scholander et al 1965 leaf thickness malone 1993 mcburney 1992 and plant based probe zimmermann et al 2008a and leaf stomatal conductance physiological parameter to measure crop water status and its negative effects by identifying the critical period of water stress these methods are not suitable for long term monitoring of plant water status because of their limitations such as complex operation destructive time consuming sensitive to environmental variations and crop moisture status slow and giving only spot measurements ru et al 2020 zimmermann et al 2008a 2008b measurement of canopy temperature tc by infrared thermometry is a non destructive technique that can effectively characterize crop water status fitzgerald et al 2006 ru et al 2020 guendouz et al 2012 correlation between tc and grain yield and stress tolerance indices such as stress tolerance index and mean productivity suggest that tc can be a useful selection index for drought tolerance in plant breeding and predicting water status mishra et al 2016 ru et al 2020 saab et al 2019 cooler tc resulting from increased stomatal conductance and higher transpiration was associated with increased yield in wheat deery et al 2016 the tc was also used to calculate the practical crop water stress index cwsi to detect crop stress status based on the differences between tc and air temperature tc ta idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981a 1981b the cwsi is based on the relationship between tc and transpiration in which canopy s temperature decreases because of evaporating cooling due to more open stomata dold et al 2017 dold et al 2017 also reported that the cwsi had a negative significant correlation with transpiration stomatal conductance carbon dioxide flux daily soil water content and net ecosystem production a negative significant correlation was also found between cwsi and carbon dioxide flux in corn and wheat li et al 2010 feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b reported a positive correlation between cwsi and vapor pressure deficit vpd under both water stressed and supplemental watered conditions it was identified 6 c tc over air temperature ta i e tc ta 6 as an upper limit for non transpiration conditions for rainfed bread wheat using cwsi that caused serious decline in stomatal conductance co2 flux water uptake and photosynthesis hakala et al 2012 hlaváčová et al 2017 rizza et al 2004 in barley the upper limit of tc ta was identified at 5 5 and 6 5 c before and after the heading stage respectively tubaileh et al 1986 and the initial point of tc was identified 28 c for barley genotypes in finland conditions at the heading stage hakala et al 2012 furthermore there was a significant negative correlation between cwsi and grain yield relative water content rwc and precipitation p 0 01 feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b a significant positive relationship was also reported between cwsi and evapotranspiration and depleted water from the soil until 50 cm depth p 0 01 feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b application of the cwsi is generally limited to measuring tc of full cover crops canopy whereas in a partially vegetated field infrared thermometer measures the average temperature of soil and plant moran et al 1994 since the soil temperature can be very different from plant temperature and dominates the average temperature jackson et al 1981a 1981b so tc in a partially vegetated field under rainfed conditions could possibly lead to a serious error in cwsi vani et al 2019 to resolve this bias moran et al 1994 proposed a vegetation index temperature vit trapezoidal shape where soil and canopy temperatures were measured simultaneously as a surface temperature ts they substituted tc ta in cwsi with ts ta and developed water deficit index wdi the trapezoidal vit shape can depict the relationship between the ts ta and partially vegetation cover vc ranging from 0 for bare soil to 1 for full cover canopy based on the trapezoidal shape and soil water deficit theory clarke 1997 moran et al 1994 wang et al 2011 wdi index allows to estimate evapotranspiration rate and soil water deficit for full and partially covered canopies however in the full canopy cover no soil tc is equal ts so wdi is equal to cwsi for the complete canopy wdi is 0 for non stressed plants and is 1 for maximum water stress hoffmann et al 2016a wang et al 2011 conducted a study in 16 locations in the southwest of arizona state of the usa and reported that there was a highly significant negative correlation r 0 67 to 0 92 between wdi and soil surface moisture at 5 cm depth they also reported a negative significant correlation r 0 55 between wdi and annual precipitation girolimetto and venturini 2013 reported that wdi had a positive significant correlation r 0 85 with soil surface temperature and negative significant correlation with soil surface weighted moisture r 0 72 direct method and five days cumulative precipitation r 0 89 these studies highlight the significance of wdi and its related parameters for a reliable assessment of water status of plants which needs to be further explored for various crops and climates identifying the starting date of water stress for a crop is one of the most crucial factors to manage water and heat stress in arid and semi arid regions by supplemental irrigations where possible optimal use of nitrogen fertilizers and weed control feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b moreover identifying the initial date of water stress is helpful for scheduling long term managements e g in conservation agriculture to improve soil structure increase root depth reduce soil water runoff and soil erosions increase soil water storage windbreakers and screening more adapted genotypes for each region stagnari et al 2009 feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b previous studies indicated that wdi had a significant correlation not only with rwc but also had significant correlations with soil moisture soil temperature and daily precipitation which shows that wdi is a highly reliable index to evaluate water balance in the soil plant systems wang et al 2011 and girolimetto and venturini 2013 the objectives of this study were to i evaluate water stress effects on rainfed barley genotypes using ts ii identify the upper limit for ts that can affect performance and reduce grain yield of barley iii determine initial point of water stress and iv apply wdi to screen the most suitable barley genotypes for both rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 field trials rainfed barley genotypes were planted under rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions 50 mm irrigation at sowing time and 30 mm irrigation at booting stage in a vetch barley rotation at the dryland agricultural research institute dari in maragheh iran elevation 1720 m 46 27 e 37 16 n during 2015 2016 and 2017 18 cropping seasons this field station is located in a cold semi arid region with an average precipitation of 350 mm and an average annual temperature of 5 3 c during the cropping season dari local meteorological data unpublished the characteristics of the field soil 0 25 cm depth was determined prior to sowing supplementary table 1 the experiment was conducted in a split plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design rcbd as a standard design for agricultural experiments petersen 1994 with three replications and 15 rainfed barley genotypes table 1 the barley genotypes were planted on a flat plot area by wintersteiger planter in six row plots with 8 m long and 1 20 m wide 20 cm row spacing the sowing rate was 380 seeds per m2 based on thousand kernel weight tkw of each genotype abdorahmani and tavakoli 2017 seeds were treated by penconazole fungicide the planting dates were

demonstrates moran et al 1994 tanriverdi et al 2017 wang et al 2011 the relationship between the range of ts ta c and vegetation cover ndvi fig 1 the vit trapezoid has four corners c1 well watered crop c2 completely stressed crop c3 wet bar soil and c4 dry bar soil the top line between c1 and c2 characterizes the range of ts ta for full vegetation cover while the bottom line between c3 and c4 characterizes the range of ts ta for no vegetation cover soil only the left line of the trapezoid which includes point a describes the range of ts ta for non limiting water status no limitation condition for evapotranspiration et and the right line which contains point b describes the possible range of ts ta for the no available water status the upper limit the point c indicates the actual measurement of ts ta the points a b and c were identified on the vit trapezoid for a given amount of vegetation cover fig 1 the vit trapezoid was used to calculate the water deficit index wdi for each actual data c point using the following equation moran et al 1994 wdi ac ab where ac and ab are distance of ac and ab respectively the estimated wdi was used to classify barley genotypes into tolerant and susceptible groups under rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions as fallowing gomes 2009 table wdi i wdi sd susceptible group wdi sd wdi i wdi sd medium group wdi i wdi sd tolerant group where wdi i is for i th genotype under rainfed or supplemental irrigation wdi is grand mean of wdi for all genotypes under rainfed or supplemental irrigation and sd is standard deviation 2 4 climatic conditions daily rainfall and air temperature during the cropping seasons 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 was illustrated at fig 2 although precipitations in both 2015 2016 and 2017 18 cropping seasons were higher than the long term average precipitation 350 mm supplementary table 2 most of the precipitation occurred in the winter moreover the lower temperatures in april and may caused slow growth of plants along with a 20 day period with temperatures over 25 c 25 30 c during the grain filling period which provided unfavorable environmental conditions for barley genotypes pradhan and prasad 2015 fig 2 2 5 statistical analysis two year cropping season data was used for statistical analysis in which equations were fitted using curveexpert 2 6 3 software charts were drawn in excel the principal component analysis pca was done in xlstat2016 software to uncover the relationships between wdi and gy by tkw spn m2 sn sp hi ts and ndvi the average value of variables for 15 genotypes under rainfed and supplementary conditions total 30 data for each variable was used for pca 3 results the vit trapezoid was drawn using the collected ndvi ts and ta data fig 3 with four corners c1 well watered crop and ideal conditions c2 completely stressed crop c3 wet bar soil and c4 dry bar soil according to vit trapezoid fig 3 for c1 ts and wdi were 10 5 c and 0 01 respectively table 2 at c1 the ts and ta difference was 5 6 c ts ta 5 6 ºc for c2 completely stressed crop fig 3 wdi and ts values were 1 01 and 34 6 c respectively table 2 and ts value was 2 9 c higher than ta value ts ta 2 9 ºc the wdi and et0 values at c3 wet bar soil were significantly lower than those at c4 fig 3 and table 2 3 1 estimating water stress threshold by wdi a scatter plot was drawn between wdi and ts ta and a linear equation was fitted to identify water stress threshold fig 4a the average wdi value at ts ta 0 was 0 59 ranged from 0 56 to 0 60 as the water stress threshold for barley genotypes under rainfed conditions feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981a 1981b fig 4a also this relationship indicated that wdi values was increased by 0 0681 when ts ta increased by 1 c y 0 0681x 0 5898 r2 0 98 fig 4a furthermore three scatter plots were drawn between wdi and ts fig 4b evapotranspiration et0 fig 4c and vpd fig 4d and linear equations were fitted to identify the average threshold for ts et0 and vpd at wdi 0 59 average water stress threshold for barley genotypes the average thresholds for ts et0 and vpd were 24 3 c ts 24 3 c ranged from 22 7 to 25 0 c depending on the genotype and experimental treatments fig 4b 7 3 mm day 1 fig 4c and 4 3 kpa for barley genotypes fig 4d respectively 3 2 relationship between wdi and climate factors the relationship between wdi and days of cropping year was used to determine the starting date of water stress threshold for barley genotypes in which wdi reached or exceeded 0 59 for the first time fig 5a this date was found to be 16th may grain filling stage 254 days after the sowing date october 4 2015 and october 7 2017 fig 5a in this study a negative relationship was found between wdi and precipitation during the growing season r2 0 68 fig 5b the trend of wdi and precipitation variations in the vegetative period late march to maturity stage showed that wdi was affected by rainfall amount such that if the daily rainfall was more than 4 mm wdi decreased on the same day while if daily rainfall was less than 4 mm wdi decreased after one to two days fig 5a in the present study a positive relationship was found between wdi and soil temperature at 5 cm below the surface in which wdi values increased by 0 0427 when soil temperature increased by 1 c y 0 0427 x 0 2764 r2 0 90 fig 5c average daily wind speed during cropping season influenced the wdi where a wind speed over 3 9 m s 1 14 km h 1 could decline wdi resulting in heat and water stress reductions fig 5d by increasing the wind speed of 1 km h 1 after the value of 14 km h 1 the wdi decreased by 0 11 unit on the boundary line right corner in fig 5d which was equivalent to 19 of wdi threshold value our finding showed that slow 2 5 m s 1 to average 5 10 m s 1 wind speed decreased heat and water stress on barley plants fig 5d however the wdi did not re increase probably due to absence of winds over 7 m s 1 25 2 km h 1 3 3 water and heat stress status of barley genotypes the vit trapezoid divided into three classes based on the intensity of heat and water stress on the plant using two year average data here fig 6a class i has wet soil surface with maximum transpiration minimum stress class ii has a dry soil surface without reduced transpiration medium water stress and class iii has a dry soil surface with some degree of plant water stress fig 6a in this study all barley genotypes were categorized in class ii based on their response under rainfed stress and supplemental irrigation non stress conditions according to clarke 1997 fig 6a in this class the supplemental irrigation blue dots improved the condition of plants in terms of moisture stress because most of the genotypes were placed closer to the ideal point c1 equivalent to without water stress in comparison to the rainfed condition red triangles fig 6a the vit trapezoid was drawn for each genotype and the trend of genotypes response to stressed and non stressed conditions was evaluated based on ndvi and ts ta values in class ii three trends were identified as followings 1 ndvi and ts ta values did not change supplemental irrigation did not improve any of these values fig 6b 2 ndvi value increased while ts ta value decreased supplemental irrigation improved both values fig 6c and 3 ndvi value did not change while ts ta value decreased supplemental irrigation only improved ts ta fig 6d based on these three trends in the class ii the barley genotypes were classified into three groups group 1 following trend 1 included abidar and valfajr varieties supplemental irrigation did not change their ndvi and ts ta values fig 6b based on two year average data for valfajr although the supplemental irrigation increased gy 1725 kg ha 1 by 4191 kg ha 1 spn m2 108 tkw 5 gr and sn sp 7 seeds its ndvi and ts ta indices varied only slightly compared with rainfed stress conditions fig 6b and table 3 valfajr had the lowest by 4836 kg ha 1 after sararood 1 due to inadequate vegetation cover under stress conditions table 3 however it had the highest infertile tillers and highest rwc among all the 15 genotypes table 3 leading to increased ndvi and transpiration under stress conditions abidar variety was closer to ideal conditions c1 and supplemental irrigation increased its vegetation cover considerably most likely due to its adequate vegetation cover under rainfed conditions close to vegetation cover threshold the extra vegetation cover did not change its ndvi wdi and ts ta values however gy and by of abidar under supplemental irrigation were higher than those in the rainfed conditions table 3 therefore higher by 8985 kg ha 1 and gy 3169 kg ha 1 of abidar under rainfed conditions were because of its adequate green cover under stress condition table 3 according to gomes 2009 the ndvi ranging from 0 38 to 0 65 was classified as medium vegetation cover and those higher than 0 65 as high vegetation cover class group 2 following trend 2 comprised eight genotypes ansar arm icb dobrynya 71411 redical sahand sararood 1 and ste antares yea762 fig 6c for which the ndvi value increased and ts ta value decreased by supplemental irrigation sararood 1 under stress conditions was the closest genotype to c3 c4 line bare soil with the lowest vegetation cover ndvi this caused sararood 1 to have the lowest by 4179 kg ha 1 and gy 1674 kg ha 1 of this group for the group 2 the supplemental irrigation increased ndvi from 0 03 sahand to 0 18 sararood 1 0 1 on average but decreased ts ta value from 1 9 c sahand to 2 5 c redical 2 2 c on average in addition it decreased wdi by 0 1 0 17 table 3 these conditions eventually resulted in increased gy in this group from 462 kg ha 1 for sahand to 984 kg ha 1 for sararood 1 730 kg ha 1 on average and by from 1495 kg ha 1 sahand to 4504 kg ha 1 sararood 1 2768 kg ha 1 on average table 3 gy and by increases were mainly due to spn m2 except for dobrynya and tkw except for arm icb and 71411 however sn sp decreased for the second group genotypes except for dobrynya and kuban 06 under supplemental irrigation table 3 this was the possible reason for the low gy of sahand and 71411 varieties under supplemental irrigation conditions fig 6e for sararood 1 although its ndvi by and gy increased under supplemental irrigation it had the lowest by and gy among genotypes which may be attributed to the cold damage as this variety is recommended mainly for moderate cold winter regions of iran group 3 following trend 3 included five genotypes chicm an57 albert ghara arpa kuban 06 makouei and sahand c 2504 fig 6d for which the ndvi value did not change while ts ta value decreased by supplemental irrigation in this group ts ta reduction ranged from 0 9 c sahand c 25041 to 1 6 c chicm an57 albert 1 2 c on average which was accompanied by a reduction in wdi 0 1 although wdi was affected by both ndvi and ts ta fig 3 according to the analyses of the second and third groups the wdi variation ranged from 0 1 0 17 led to changes in ndvi value from 0 05 to 0 17 indicating that ndvi vegetation cover had the main effect on wdi variation in this study on the other hand gy and by variations were mainly affected by ts ta reduction and not by ndvi table 3 in the third group by decreasing ts ta by increased from 975 kg ha 1 sahand c 25041 to 2841 kg ha 1 makouei and gy increased from 597 kg ha 1 sahand c 25041 to 973 kg ha 1 kuban 06 while ndvi varied slightly table 3 for the third group sn sp of all genotypes decreased except for kuban 06 under supplemental irrigation in this group the gy increases under the supplemental irrigation conditions could be mainly due to higher spn m2 ranged from 32 to126 and 71 on average and higher tkw in range of 1 3 6 4 gr and 3 gr on average table 3 principal component analysis indicated that there were highly significant negative correlations between wdi and by r 0 73 and gy r 0 61 fig 6e there was a high correlation between ts and wdi r 0 98 hence ts might also be a potential index instead of wdi however ts was not as a discriminative index as wdi to classify genotypes under rainfed conditions water stress 4 discussion the main objective of our study was to evaluate water status of barley genotypes under rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions using wdi index to identify water stress and ts threshold and initial date growing stage of water stress to the accuracy of screening for drought tolerant genotypes in this study barley genotypes did not have full vegetative cover therefore an average temperature of plant and soil ts and vegetation cover ndvi was measured to draw the vit trapezoid according to moran et al 1994 fig 3 this allowed us to evaluate water status of genotypes under rainfed and supplementary conditions using wdi moran et al 1994 the linear relation between wdi and ts ta fig 3a was used to identify water stress threshold under rainfed conditions in this regards hoffmann et al 2016b used vit trapezoid to evaluate water status of spring barley fields in the west of denmark and concluded that wdi is a reliable index to assess water status of plants and to identify proper watering time we found a linear relationship between wdi and ts that was used to identify ts threshold in which water stress started under rainfed conditions fig 4b similar to our finding hakala et al 2012 reported that ts 25 c initial point of ts at the heading stage spiking of barley genotypes from one week before to two weeks after heading caused heat stress which decreased gy and tkw yield significantly due to increased infertile flowers decreased root and water uptake williams 1974 identified 24 8 c as a critical temperature threshold for barley from heading to soft dough stages which is in agreement with our findings according to vit trapezoid theory umesh and ferris 1994 wang et al 2011 the upper limit of ts was identified for barley genotypes under rainfed conditions fig 3 c2 point and table 2 when ts raised over this limit plants experienced severe water and heat stresses due to decreased rwc table 3 and increased et0 and vpd table 2 so gy reduced significantly due to decreased tkw spn m2 sn sp nft water stress table 3 the upper limit of ts is almost equal to stopping the evapotranspiration and photosynthesis of plant idso et al 1981 klink et al 2011 moreover mamnouie et al 2006 reported that ts 35 c was the upper limit for barley genotypes in iran a similar result was reported for rainfed winter wheat ts 31 6 c grown in the same area dari maragheh iran feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b the wdi could be affected by climate factors such as precipitation fig 5b soil temperature fig 5c and wind speed fig 5d there was a highly negative correlation between wdi and precipitation during the growing season fig 5b similar results were found in a nine year study conducted by holifield collins et al 2008 which showed a significant negative correlation between wdi and precipitation the trend of wdi and precipitation variations in the vegetative period indicated that the frequency of rainy days and daily rainfall amount affected wdi the wdi reduction could be happen on the same day if rainfall amount 4 mm in one day or one or two days after the rainfall if rainfall amount 4 mm in one day delayed reduction holifield collins et al 2008 in this study variation of wdi with crop season precipitation fig 5a was used to identify the accurate initial point date of water stress which happened in grain filling stage in this study the wdi was affected by wind speed such that slow to average wind speed decreased heat and water stresses fig 5d the slow to average wind speeds enhanced removing heat from the leaf surface resulting in stomatal conductance and transpiration leading to reduction of leaf temperature and water stress wdi hakala et al 2012 kuo et al 2011 reported that at a wind speed over 6 m s 1 21 6 km h 1 ts was significantly decreased due to stomatal activities transpiration and the measured ts values were slightly higher than those of our study furthermore the stomatal activities can be regulated by wind duration and soil moisture conditions if the light winds last longer e g 1 h the crop will stop stomatal activities to save water davies et al 1978 additionally previous researches showed that in wind sensitive crops or in crops under water stress about 21 26 of stomata were closed to save moisture even at a wind speed of 1 4 m s 1 kuo et al 2011 previous studies have also indicated that for some species such as rhododendron ferrugineum and pinus cembra stomata closed and ts increased under wind speed over 15 m s 1 caldwell 1970 we found a positive correlation between wdi and soil temperature at 5 cm below the surface fig 4c which is in agreement with the values reported by girolimetto and venturini 2013 wang et al 2011 and holifield collins et al 2008 which highlight the significance of wdi for a reliable assessment of water status of plants the vit trapezoid was used to access water and heat stress status of barley genotypes in the current experiment although vit divided into three classes fig 6a but all barley genotypes placed in the second class based on trend of ts ta and ndvi variations of genotypes under rainfed and supplementary irrigation conditions as described in 3 3 this showed that genotypes were under the medium stressed conditions and the plant evapotranspiration had not been decreased significantly however genotypes experienced less water stress under supplementary irrigation closer to c1 in vit trapezoid blue dotes in fig 6a and c blue dot and all of them had higher gy by tkw spn m2 sn sp nft table 3 so watering the genotypes in the initial point of water stress grain filling stage fig 5a based on the identified wdi threshold fig 4a could prevent crop gy reduction successively similar to findings of the present study previous studies have shown decreases in gy by spn m2 sn sp and tkw under rainfed stress conditions specifically after anthesis whereas a supplemental irrigation increased these traits saeidi et al 2013 haddadin 2015 and soleimani et al 2017 supplementary irrigation improved transpiration and photosynthesis of barley genotypes by increasing ndvi more vegetation cover and decreasing ts ta cooler canopy due to more open stomata table 3 as key components of vit trapezoid deery et al 2016 dold et al 2017 saab et al 2019 the ndvi had a main effect on wdi negative correlation fig 5e whereas ts ta mainly affected gy and by negative correlation fig 5e of barley genotypes increased gy under supplementary irrigation mainly was due to spn m2 and tkw compared to the rainfed conditions accordingly tkw and sn sp were the key traits to achieve higher gy as consistently emphasized by plant breeders under rainfed conditions feil 1992 the ndvi and ts as key components of vit have been used to assess the effect of water and heat stresses on plant separately guendouz et al 2012 girolimetto and venturini 2013 ru et al 2020 previous investigations indicated that ndvi depends on both vegetation cover and the number of infertile tillers and plant health crippen and blom 2001 and pettorelli et al 2005 barati et al 2017 showed that high rwc could be used as a water stress tolerance index a study on peace lily plants spathiphyllum lynise also showed that there was a high correlation between ndvi and rwc seelig et al 2008 in other words the plants with higher rwc had higher ndvi compared to the plants under water stress in this study higher ndvi for valfajr could be attributed to its highest rwc under stress conditions even though it had low vegetation cover therefore it was suggested that ndvi could be used as an index to evaluate the water status of plants however ndvi could lead to some error for assessment of water stress because sometimes there was a lack of increase for ndvi even by increasing vegetation cover due to the color of leaves this was observed for chicm an57 albert ghara arpa kuban 06 makouei and sahand c 2504 fig 6d in which their leaf color was light green and ndvi did not increase much in these genotypes han et al 2018 reported that maize with dark green leaves had higher ndvi than maize with light green color at the same growth stage the wdi method based on vit method identified barley genotypes that are more suitable for rainfed ghara arpa kuban 06 and makouei and supplemental irrigation ansar arm icb sahand sararood 1 ste antares yea762 conditions in cold semi arid areas 5 conclusion the wdi based on the vit trapezoidal shape is more efficient index to assess crop water status and identify water and heat stress thresholds starting date of stress to do watering of partially vegetative cover crops such as barley under rainfed conditions given that this index integrates the ndvi vegetation cover and ts ta cooler canopy as the main factors affecting gy and by so it is more reliable than the ndvi and ts tc for assessment of crop water status solely furthermore wdi could be adjusted for target environment due to existing well relationship between this index and climate factors additionally the vit trapezoidal shape and wdi could be efficiently used in the small grain breeding program for screening tolerant and susceptible genotypes to water and heat stresses under rainfed and supplemental conditions it can be inferring that the distance from the c2 point of the vit trapezoidal shape could be used as an index for screening genotypes for their thermal heat and water stress tolerance moreover the development of remote sensing technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicle drones and satellites could provide a great opportunity to collect ndvi ts ta data in short time for hundreds and thousands genotypes in breeding programs to calculate vit and wdi declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

their critical drought stress threshold in the cold semi arid area of iran the field experiments were conducted at the dryland agricultural research institute maragheh iran in 2015 16 and 2017 18 the experimental design was a split plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design with three replications the main plots included two water regimes rainfed stress and supplemental irrigation and the subplots included 15 barley genotypes data were collected for grain yield and its components surface temperature ts taken at six crop growth stages from flag leaf to soft dough and normalized differences vegetative index ndvi at seven crop growth stages from the first node to the soft dough the water deficit index wdi was determined using ndvi and the difference between ts and air temperature ta based on the wdi the critical water stress and temperature thresholds for genotypes were 0 59 and 24 3 c respectively the identified temperature threshold was equivalent to 7 2 mm day 1 evapotranspiration et0 and 4 3 kpa vapor pressure deficient the genotypes experienced a maximum drought stress when the wdi ts and et0 reached 1 01 34 6 c upper limit and 11 6 mm day 1 respectively the critical drought threshold happened 254 days after the sowing date wdi had strong negative correlation with both grain and biological yields according to wdi ghara arpa kuban 06 and ansar genotypes were placed in the drought tolerant group and are suitable for rainfed conditions whereas arm icb sahand sararood1 and ste antares yea762 genotypes were more suitable for supplemental irrigation conditions it can be concluded that wdi could effectively discriminate genotypes into tolerant and susceptible groups and identify the starting time of water stress under rainfed conditions keywords canopy temperature ndvi supplemental irrigation rainfed conditions surface temperature 1 introduction barley is one of the most common crops grown under low input and harsh conditions due to its wide adaptability and tolerance to drought heat and salinity stresses fischbeck 2002 although barley is relatively tolerant to drought stress the water stress results in yield reduction when it occurs during stem elongation and grain filling stages sharifi alhoseini and taherian 2019 in the rainfed areas water stress is often combined with heat stress specifically after anthesis amplifying the adverse effects of water stress via disrupting water uptake of plants elbashier 2012 different strategies have been proposed to improve crop tolerance to water and terminal heat stress breeders primarily focus on genotypes with high water stress tolerance and high water use efficiency agronomists are also using the methods based on plant water status such as pressure chamber method boyer 1967 pressure bomb technique scholander et al 1965 leaf thickness malone 1993 mcburney 1992 and plant based probe zimmermann et al 2008a and leaf stomatal conductance physiological parameter to measure crop water status and its negative effects by identifying the critical period of water stress these methods are not suitable for long term monitoring of plant water status because of their limitations such as complex operation destructive time consuming sensitive to environmental variations and crop moisture status slow and giving only spot measurements ru et al 2020 zimmermann et al 2008a 2008b measurement of canopy temperature tc by infrared thermometry is a non destructive technique that can effectively characterize crop water status fitzgerald et al 2006 ru et al 2020 guendouz et al 2012 correlation between tc and grain yield and stress tolerance indices such as stress tolerance index and mean productivity suggest that tc can be a useful selection index for drought tolerance in plant breeding and predicting water status mishra et al 2016 ru et al 2020 saab et al 2019 cooler tc resulting from increased stomatal conductance and higher transpiration was associated with increased yield in wheat deery et al 2016 the tc was also used to calculate the practical crop water stress index cwsi to detect crop stress status based on the differences between tc and air temperature tc ta idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981a 1981b the cwsi is based on the relationship between tc and transpiration in which canopy s temperature decreases because of evaporating cooling due to more open stomata dold et al 2017 dold et al 2017 also reported that the cwsi had a negative significant correlation with transpiration stomatal conductance carbon dioxide flux daily soil water content and net ecosystem production a negative significant correlation was also found between cwsi and carbon dioxide flux in corn and wheat li et al 2010 feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b reported a positive correlation between cwsi and vapor pressure deficit vpd under both water stressed and supplemental watered conditions it was identified 6 c tc over air temperature ta i e tc ta 6 as an upper limit for non transpiration conditions for rainfed bread wheat using cwsi that caused serious decline in stomatal conductance co2 flux water uptake and photosynthesis hakala et al 2012 hlaváčová et al 2017 rizza et al 2004 in barley the upper limit of tc ta was identified at 5 5 and 6 5 c before and after the heading stage respectively tubaileh et al 1986 and the initial point of tc was identified 28 c for barley genotypes in finland conditions at the heading stage hakala et al 2012 furthermore there was a significant negative correlation between cwsi and grain yield relative water content rwc and precipitation p 0 01 feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b a significant positive relationship was also reported between cwsi and evapotranspiration and depleted water from the soil until 50 cm depth p 0 01 feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b application of the cwsi is generally limited to measuring tc of full cover crops canopy whereas in a partially vegetated field infrared thermometer measures the average temperature of soil and plant moran et al 1994 since the soil temperature can be very different from plant temperature and dominates the average temperature jackson et al 1981a 1981b so tc in a partially vegetated field under rainfed conditions could possibly lead to a serious error in cwsi vani et al 2019 to resolve this bias moran et al 1994 proposed a vegetation index temperature vit trapezoidal shape where soil and canopy temperatures were measured simultaneously as a surface temperature ts they substituted tc ta in cwsi with ts ta and developed water deficit index wdi the trapezoidal vit shape can depict the relationship between the ts ta and partially vegetation cover vc ranging from 0 for bare soil to 1 for full cover canopy based on the trapezoidal shape and soil water deficit theory clarke 1997 moran et al 1994 wang et al 2011 wdi index allows to estimate evapotranspiration rate and soil water deficit for full and partially covered canopies however in the full canopy cover no soil tc is equal ts so wdi is equal to cwsi for the complete canopy wdi is 0 for non stressed plants and is 1 for maximum water stress hoffmann et al 2016a wang et al 2011 conducted a study in 16 locations in the southwest of arizona state of the usa and reported that there was a highly significant negative correlation r 0 67 to 0 92 between wdi and soil surface moisture at 5 cm depth they also reported a negative significant correlation r 0 55 between wdi and annual precipitation girolimetto and venturini 2013 reported that wdi had a positive significant correlation r 0 85 with soil surface temperature and negative significant correlation with soil surface weighted moisture r 0 72 direct method and five days cumulative precipitation r 0 89 these studies highlight the significance of wdi and its related parameters for a reliable assessment of water status of plants which needs to be further explored for various crops and climates identifying the starting date of water stress for a crop is one of the most crucial factors to manage water and heat stress in arid and semi arid regions by supplemental irrigations where possible optimal use of nitrogen fertilizers and weed control feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b moreover identifying the initial date of water stress is helpful for scheduling long term managements e g in conservation agriculture to improve soil structure increase root depth reduce soil water runoff and soil erosions increase soil water storage windbreakers and screening more adapted genotypes for each region stagnari et al 2009 feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b previous studies indicated that wdi had a significant correlation not only with rwc but also had significant correlations with soil moisture soil temperature and daily precipitation which shows that wdi is a highly reliable index to evaluate water balance in the soil plant systems wang et al 2011 and girolimetto and venturini 2013 the objectives of this study were to i evaluate water stress effects on rainfed barley genotypes using ts ii identify the upper limit for ts that can affect performance and reduce grain yield of barley iii determine initial point of water stress and iv apply wdi to screen the most suitable barley genotypes for both rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 field trials rainfed barley genotypes were planted under rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions 50 mm irrigation at sowing time and 30 mm irrigation at booting stage in a vetch barley rotation at the dryland agricultural research

350 mm and an average annual temperature of 5 3 c during the cropping season dari local meteorological data unpublished the characteristics of the field soil 0 25 cm depth was determined prior to sowing supplementary table 1 the experiment was conducted in a split plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design rcbd as a standard design for agricultural experiments petersen 1994 with

demonstrates moran et al 1994 tanriverdi et al 2017 wang et al 2011 the relationship between the range of ts ta c and vegetation cover ndvi fig 1 the vit trapezoid has four corners c1 well watered crop c2 completely stressed crop c3 wet bar soil and c4 dry bar soil the top line between c1 and c2 characterizes the range of ts ta for full vegetation cover while the bottom line between c3 and c4 characterizes the range of ts ta for no vegetation cover soil only the left line of the trapezoid which includes point a describes the range of ts ta for non limiting water status no limitation condition for evapotranspiration et and the right line which contains point b describes the possible range of ts ta for the no available water status the upper limit the point c indicates the actual measurement of ts ta the points a b and c were identified on the vit trapezoid for a given amount of vegetation cover fig 1 the vit trapezoid was used to calculate the water deficit index wdi for each actual data c point using the following equation moran et al 1994 wdi ac ab where ac and ab are distance of ac and ab respectively the estimated wdi was used to classify barley genotypes into tolerant and susceptible groups under rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions as fallowing gomes 2009 table wdi i wdi sd susceptible group wdi sd wdi i wdi sd medium group wdi i wdi sd tolerant group where wdi i is for i th genotype under rainfed or supplemental irrigation wdi is grand mean of wdi for all genotypes under rainfed or supplemental irrigation and sd is standard deviation 2 4 climatic conditions daily rainfall and air temperature during the cropping seasons 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 was illustrated at fig 2 although precipitations in both 2015 2016 and 2017 18 cropping seasons were higher than the long term average precipitation 350 mm supplementary table 2 most of the precipitation occurred in the winter moreover the lower temperatures in april and may caused slow growth of plants along with a 20 day period with temperatures over 25 c 25 30 c during the grain filling period which provided unfavorable environmental conditions for barley genotypes pradhan and prasad 2015 fig 2 2 5 statistical analysis two year cropping season data was used for statistical analysis in which equations were fitted using curveexpert 2 6 3 software charts were drawn in excel the principal component analysis pca was done in xlstat2016 software to uncover the relationships between wdi and gy by tkw spn m2 sn sp hi ts and ndvi the average value of variables for 15 genotypes under rainfed and supplementary conditions total 30 data for each variable was used for pca 3 results the vit trapezoid was drawn using the collected ndvi ts and ta data fig 3 with four corners c1 well watered crop and ideal conditions c2 completely stressed crop c3 wet bar soil and c4 dry bar soil according to vit trapezoid fig 3 for c1 ts and wdi were 10 5 c and 0 01 respectively table 2 at c1 the ts and ta difference was 5 6 c ts ta 5 6 ºc for c2 completely stressed crop fig 3 wdi and ts values were 1 01 and 34 6 c respectively table 2 and ts value was 2 9 c higher than ta value ts ta 2 9 ºc the wdi and et0 values at c3 wet bar soil were significantly lower than those at c4 fig 3 and table 2 3 1 estimating water stress threshold by wdi a scatter plot was drawn between wdi and ts ta and a linear equation was fitted to identify water stress threshold fig 4a the average wdi value at ts ta 0 was 0 59 ranged from 0 56 to 0 60 as the water stress threshold for barley genotypes under rainfed conditions feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981a 1981b fig 4a also this relationship indicated that wdi values was increased by 0 0681 when ts ta increased by 1 c y 0 0681x 0 5898 r2 0 98 fig 4a furthermore three scatter plots were drawn between wdi and ts fig 4b evapotranspiration et0 fig 4c and vpd fig 4d and linear equations were fitted to identify the average threshold for ts et0 and vpd at wdi 0 59 average water stress threshold for barley genotypes the average thresholds for ts et0 and vpd were 24 3 c ts 24 3 c ranged from 22 7 to 25 0 c depending on the genotype and experimental treatments fig 4b 7 3 mm day 1 fig 4c and 4 3 kpa for barley genotypes fig 4d respectively 3 2 relationship between wdi and climate factors the relationship between wdi and days of cropping year was used to determine the starting date of water stress threshold for barley genotypes in which wdi reached or exceeded 0 59 for the first time fig 5a this date was found to be 16th may grain filling stage 254 days after the sowing date october 4 2015 and october 7 2017 fig 5a in this study a negative relationship was found between wdi and precipitation during the growing season r2 0 68 fig 5b the trend of wdi and precipitation variations in the vegetative period late march to maturity stage showed that wdi was affected by rainfall amount such that if the daily rainfall was more than 4 mm wdi decreased on the same day while if daily rainfall was less than 4 mm wdi decreased after one to two days fig 5a in the present study a positive relationship was found between wdi and soil temperature at 5 cm below the surface in which wdi values increased by 0 0427 when soil temperature increased by 1 c y 0 0427 x 0 2764 r2 0 90 fig 5c average daily wind speed during cropping season influenced the wdi where a wind speed over 3 9 m s 1 14 km h 1 could decline wdi resulting in heat and water stress reductions fig 5d by increasing the wind speed of 1 km h 1 after the value of 14 km h 1 the wdi decreased by 0 11 unit on the boundary line right corner in fig 5d which was equivalent to 19 of wdi threshold value our finding showed that slow 2 5 m s 1 to average 5 10 m s 1 wind speed decreased heat and water stress on barley plants fig 5d however the wdi did not re increase probably due to absence of winds over 7 m s 1 25 2 km h 1 3 3 water and heat stress status of barley genotypes the vit trapezoid divided into three classes based on the intensity of heat and water stress on the plant using two year average data here fig 6a class i has wet soil surface with maximum transpiration minimum stress class ii has a dry soil surface without reduced transpiration medium water stress and class iii has a dry soil surface with some degree of plant water stress fig 6a in this study all barley genotypes were categorized in class ii based on their response under rainfed stress and supplemental irrigation non stress conditions according to clarke 1997 fig 6a in this class the supplemental irrigation blue dots improved the condition of plants in terms of moisture stress because most of the genotypes were placed closer to the ideal point c1 equivalent to without water stress in comparison to the rainfed condition red triangles fig 6a the vit trapezoid was drawn for each genotype and the trend of genotypes response to stressed and non stressed conditions was evaluated based on ndvi and ts ta values in class ii three trends were identified as followings 1 ndvi and ts ta values did not change supplemental irrigation did not improve any of these values fig 6b 2 ndvi value increased while ts ta value decreased supplemental irrigation improved both values fig 6c and 3 ndvi value did not change while ts ta value decreased supplemental irrigation only improved ts ta fig 6d based on these three trends in the class ii the barley genotypes were classified into three groups group 1 following trend 1 included abidar and valfajr varieties supplemental irrigation did not change their ndvi and ts ta values fig 6b based on two year average data for valfajr although the supplemental irrigation increased gy 1725 kg ha 1 by 4191 kg ha 1 spn m2 108 tkw 5 gr and sn sp 7 seeds its ndvi and ts ta indices varied only slightly compared with rainfed stress conditions fig 6b and table 3 valfajr had the lowest by 4836 kg ha 1 after sararood 1 due to inadequate vegetation cover under stress conditions table 3 however it had the highest infertile tillers and highest rwc among all the 15 genotypes table 3 leading to increased ndvi and transpiration under stress conditions abidar variety was closer to ideal conditions c1 and supplemental irrigation increased its vegetation cover considerably most likely due to its adequate vegetation cover under rainfed conditions close to vegetation cover threshold the extra vegetation cover did not change its ndvi wdi and ts ta values however gy and by of abidar under supplemental irrigation were higher than those in the rainfed conditions table 3 therefore higher by 8985 kg ha 1 and gy 3169 kg ha 1 of abidar under rainfed conditions were because of its adequate green cover under stress condition table 3 according to gomes 2009 the ndvi ranging from 0 38 to 0 65 was classified as medium vegetation cover and those higher than 0 65 as high vegetation cover class group 2 following trend 2 comprised eight genotypes ansar arm icb dobrynya 71411 redical sahand sararood 1 and ste antares yea762 fig 6c for which the ndvi value increased and ts ta value decreased by supplemental irrigation sararood 1 under stress conditions was the closest genotype to c3 c4 line bare soil with the lowest vegetation cover ndvi this caused sararood 1 to have the lowest by 4179 kg ha 1 and gy 1674 kg ha 1 of this group for the group 2 the supplemental irrigation increased ndvi from 0 03 sahand to 0 18 sararood 1 0 1 on average but decreased ts ta value from 1 9 c sahand to 2 5 c redical 2 2 c on average in addition it decreased wdi by 0 1 0 17 table 3 these conditions eventually resulted in increased gy in this group from 462 kg ha 1 for sahand to 984 kg ha 1 for sararood 1 730 kg ha 1 on average and by from 1495 kg ha 1 sahand to 4504 kg ha 1 sararood 1 2768 kg ha 1 on average table 3 gy and by increases were mainly due to spn m2 except for dobrynya and tkw except for arm icb and 71411 however sn sp decreased for the second group genotypes except for dobrynya and kuban 06 under supplemental irrigation table 3 this was the possible reason for the low gy of sahand and 71411 varieties under supplemental irrigation conditions fig 6e for sararood 1 although its ndvi by and gy increased under supplemental irrigation it had the lowest by and gy among genotypes which may be attributed to the cold damage as this variety is recommended mainly for moderate cold winter regions of iran group 3 following trend 3 included five genotypes chicm an57 albert ghara arpa kuban 06 makouei and sahand c 2504 fig 6d for which the ndvi value did not change while ts ta value decreased by supplemental irrigation in this group ts ta reduction ranged from 0 9 c sahand c 25041 to 1 6 c chicm an57 albert 1 2 c on average which was accompanied by a reduction in wdi 0 1 although wdi was affected by both ndvi and ts ta fig 3 according to the analyses of the second and third groups the wdi variation ranged from 0 1 0 17 led to changes in ndvi value from 0 05 to 0 17 indicating that ndvi vegetation cover had the main effect on wdi variation in this study on the other hand gy and by variations were mainly affected by ts ta reduction and not by ndvi table 3 in the third group by decreasing ts ta by increased from 975 kg ha 1 sahand c 25041 to 2841 kg ha 1 makouei and gy increased from 597 kg ha 1 sahand c 25041 to 973 kg ha 1 kuban 06 while ndvi varied slightly table 3 for the third group sn sp of all genotypes decreased except for kuban 06 under supplemental irrigation in this group the gy increases under the supplemental irrigation conditions could be mainly due to higher spn m2 ranged from 32 to126 and 71 on average and higher tkw in range of 1 3 6 4 gr and 3 gr on average table 3 principal component analysis indicated that there were highly significant negative correlations between wdi and by r 0 73 and gy r 0 61 fig 6e there was a high correlation between ts and wdi r 0 98 hence ts might also be a potential index instead of wdi however ts was not as a discriminative index as wdi to classify genotypes under rainfed conditions water stress 4 discussion the main objective of our study was to evaluate water status of barley genotypes under rainfed and supplemental irrigation conditions using wdi index to identify water stress and ts threshold and initial date growing stage of water stress to the accuracy of screening for drought tolerant genotypes in this study barley genotypes did not have full vegetative cover therefore an average temperature of plant and soil ts and vegetation cover ndvi was measured to draw the vit trapezoid according to moran et al 1994 fig 3 this allowed us to evaluate water status of genotypes under rainfed and supplementary conditions using wdi moran et al 1994 the linear relation between wdi and ts ta fig 3a was used to identify water stress threshold under rainfed conditions in this regards hoffmann et al 2016b used vit trapezoid to evaluate water status of spring barley fields in the west of denmark and concluded that wdi is a reliable index to assess water status of plants and to identify proper watering time we found a linear relationship between wdi and ts that was used to identify ts threshold in which water stress started under rainfed conditions fig 4b similar to our finding hakala et al 2012 reported that ts 25 c initial point of ts at the heading stage spiking of barley genotypes from one week before to two weeks after heading caused heat stress which decreased gy and tkw yield significantly due to increased infertile flowers decreased root and water uptake williams 1974 identified 24 8 c as a critical temperature threshold for barley from heading to soft dough stages which is in agreement with our findings according to vit trapezoid theory umesh and ferris 1994 wang et al 2011 the upper limit of ts was identified for barley genotypes under rainfed conditions fig 3 c2 point and table 2 when ts raised over this limit plants experienced severe water and heat stresses due to decreased rwc table 3 and increased et0 and vpd table 2 so gy reduced significantly due to decreased tkw spn m2 sn sp nft water stress table 3 the upper limit of ts is almost equal to stopping the evapotranspiration and photosynthesis of plant idso et al 1981 klink et al 2011 moreover mamnouie et al 2006 reported that ts 35 c was the upper limit for barley genotypes in iran a similar result was reported for rainfed winter wheat ts 31 6 c grown in the same area dari maragheh iran feiziasl et al 2014a 2014b the wdi could be affected by climate factors such as precipitation fig 5b soil temperature fig 5c and wind speed fig 5d there was a highly negative correlation between wdi and precipitation during the growing season fig 5b similar results were found in a nine year study conducted by holifield collins et al 2008 which showed a significant negative correlation between wdi and precipitation the trend of wdi and precipitation variations in the vegetative period indicated that the frequency of rainy days and daily rainfall amount affected wdi the wdi reduction could be happen on the same day if rainfall amount 4 mm in one day or one or two days after the rainfall if rainfall amount 4 mm in one day delayed reduction holifield collins et al 2008 in this study variation of wdi with crop season precipitation fig 5a was used to identify the accurate initial point date of water stress which happened in grain filling stage in this study the wdi was affected by wind speed such that slow to average wind speed decreased heat and water stresses fig 5d the slow to average wind speeds enhanced removing heat from the leaf surface resulting in stomatal conductance and transpiration leading to reduction of leaf temperature and water stress wdi hakala et al 2012 kuo et al 2011 reported that at a wind speed over 6 m s 1 21 6 km h 1 ts was significantly decreased due to stomatal activities transpiration and the measured ts values were slightly higher than those of our study furthermore the stomatal activities can be regulated by wind duration and soil moisture conditions if the light winds last longer e g 1 h the crop will stop stomatal activities to save water davies et al 1978 additionally previous researches showed that in wind sensitive crops or in crops under water stress about 21 26 of stomata were closed to save moisture even at a wind speed of 1 4 m s 1 kuo et al 2011 previous studies have also indicated that for some species such as rhododendron ferrugineum and pinus cembra stomata closed and ts increased under wind speed over 15 m s 1 caldwell 1970 we found a positive correlation between wdi and soil temperature at 5 cm below the surface fig 4c which is in agreement with the values reported by girolimetto and venturini 2013 wang et al 2011 and holifield collins et al 2008 which highlight the significance of wdi for a reliable assessment of water status of plants the vit trapezoid was used to access water and heat stress status of barley genotypes in the current experiment although vit divided into three classes fig 6a but all barley genotypes placed in the second class based on trend of ts ta and ndvi variations of genotypes under rainfed and supplementary irrigation conditions as described in 3 3 this showed that genotypes were under the medium stressed conditions and the plant evapotranspiration had not been decreased significantly however genotypes experienced less water stress under supplementary irrigation closer to c1 in vit trapezoid blue dotes in fig 6a and c blue dot and all of them had higher gy by tkw spn m2 sn sp nft table 3 so watering the genotypes in the initial point of water stress grain filling stage fig 5a based on the identified wdi threshold fig 4a could prevent crop gy reduction successively similar to findings of the present study previous studies have shown decreases in gy by spn m2 sn sp and tkw under rainfed stress conditions specifically after anthesis whereas a supplemental irrigation increased these traits saeidi et al 2013 haddadin 2015 and soleimani et al 2017 supplementary irrigation improved transpiration and photosynthesis of barley genotypes by increasing ndvi more vegetation cover and decreasing ts ta cooler canopy due to more open stomata table 3 as key components of vit trapezoid deery et al 2016 dold et al 2017 saab et al 2019 the ndvi had a main effect on wdi negative correlation fig 5e whereas ts ta mainly affected gy and by negative correlation fig 5e of barley genotypes increased gy under supplementary irrigation mainly was due to spn m2 and tkw compared to the rainfed conditions accordingly tkw and sn sp were the key traits to achieve higher gy as consistently emphasized by plant breeders under rainfed conditions feil 1992 the ndvi and ts as key components of vit have been used to assess the effect of water and heat stresses on plant separately guendouz et al 2012 girolimetto and venturini 2013 ru et al 2020 previous investigations indicated that ndvi depends on both vegetation cover and the number of infertile tillers and plant health crippen and blom 2001 and pettorelli et al 2005 barati et al 2017 showed that high rwc could be used as a water stress tolerance index a study on peace lily plants spathiphyllum lynise also showed that there was a high correlation between ndvi and rwc seelig et al 2008 in other words the plants with higher rwc had higher ndvi compared to the plants under water stress in this study higher ndvi for valfajr could be attributed to its highest rwc under stress conditions even though it had low vegetation cover therefore it was suggested that ndvi could be used as an index to evaluate the water status of plants however ndvi could lead to some error for assessment of water stress because sometimes there was a lack of increase for ndvi even by increasing vegetation cover due to the color of leaves this was observed for chicm an57 albert ghara arpa kuban 06 makouei and sahand c 2504 fig 6d in which their leaf color was light green and ndvi did not increase much in these genotypes han et al 2018 reported that maize with dark green leaves had higher ndvi than maize with light green color at the same growth stage the wdi method based on vit method identified barley genotypes that are more suitable for rainfed ghara arpa kuban 06 and makouei and supplemental irrigation ansar arm icb sahand sararood 1 ste antares yea762 conditions in cold semi arid areas 5 conclusion the wdi based on the vit trapezoidal shape is more efficient index to assess crop water status and identify water and heat stress thresholds starting date of stress to do watering of partially vegetative cover crops such as barley under rainfed conditions given that this index integrates the ndvi vegetation cover and ts ta cooler canopy as the main factors affecting gy and by so it is more reliable than the ndvi and ts tc for assessment of crop water status solely furthermore wdi could be adjusted for target environment due to existing well relationship between this index and climate factors additionally the vit trapezoidal shape and wdi could be efficiently used in the small grain breeding program for screening tolerant and susceptible genotypes to water and heat stresses under rainfed and supplemental conditions it can be inferring that the distance from the c2 point of the vit trapezoidal shape could be used as an index for screening genotypes for their thermal heat and water stress tolerance moreover the development of remote sensing technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicle drones and satellites could provide a great opportunity to collect ndvi
