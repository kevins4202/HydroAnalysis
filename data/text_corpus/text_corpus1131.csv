5655,small rivers 30 m are significant components of terrestrial river networks and remote sensing is a necessary tool to study them at the global scale however current global hydrography data products generally include only rivers that are wider than 30 m neglecting smaller waterways and thus limiting our understanding of surface water processes especially in remote areas we present a new automated methodology to map two arctic actively flowing river networks kotuy and coleen rivers with study areas of 12 000 km2 and 10 000 km2 respectively including small rivers as narrow as 10 m from sentinel 2 multispectral satellite imagery and high resolution arcticdem digital elevation data first preliminary river network masks were generated by using gabor filtering and path opening morphological operations on normalized difference water index ndwi images second arcticdem data were employed to simulate surface flow paths and the resultant drainage networks were used to create river areas of interest aoi and subsequently eliminate non water features outside the river aoi third gaps along remotely sensed small river channels were filled using the arcticdem modeled drainage networks yielding continuous river networks with high spatial resolution we compared the 10 m sentinel arcticdem merged river network sarn with the national hydrography dataset nhd and four 30 m landsat derived hydrography data products gsw grwl from glc 2017 and g3wbm we conclude 1 sarns have similar quality to the 1st order nhd 70 of nhd streams appear in sarns 2 at a reach scale sarns include more small rivers with the drainage densities at least 4 5 times larger than landsat derived hydrography data products similarly coupling arcticdem data with 30 m landsat satellite images increases resultant drainage densities approximately three fold 3 at a catchment scale merging remotely sensed river networks with arcticdem modeled drainage networks significantly improves river connectivity defined as the longest connected river length with at least a ten fold increase over the other hydrography data products examined here in sum merging high resolution sentinel 2 imagery with arcticdem data enable effective continuous mapping of complex fluvial drainage patterns of arctic rivers keywords small rivers river network mapping sentinel 2 landsat arcticdem arctic 1 introduction terrestrial river networks transport and store large quantities of alluvial material and drive climate and ecosystems via biogeochemical cycles jung et al 2010 raymond et al 2013 sj√∂gersten et al 2014 vorosmarty 2000 small river ecosystems tend to be particularly variable over time and have frequent land atmosphere interactions allen et al 2018 benstead and leigh 2012 meyer et al 2007 peterson 2001 for example during wet periods river network drainage density dd the ratio of river length to the total area for a given catchment may be over eight times greater than during periods with normal water levels benstead and leigh 2012 moreover 50 of global greenhouse gas emissions originate from small rivers and streams allen et al 2018 butman et al 2016 therefore neglecting small rivers in global analyses could underestimate the role that river networks play in the biogeochemical cycle and accurate mapping of river networks is needed the arctic region contains most of the global rivers and lakes allen and pavelsky 2018 pekel et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2015 these rapidly respond to regional water balance and surface groundwater interactions and these dynamics are shifting under recent climate change cooley et al 2017 cooley et al 2019 further the arctic is thought to be a major store of greenhouse gasses set to alter the global carbon budget as permafrost thaws and releases especially methane into the atmosphere raymond et al 2013 therefore mapping arctic river networks in particular is essential to better constrain diverse arctic climatic and physiographic and physiochemical processes river drainage patterns have been traditionally mapped using land surveys following the principle that streams flow down gradient i e downhill for example the national hydrography dataset nhd published by the united states geological survey usgs represents the surface water system of the united states which was generated from detailed topographic maps simley and carswell 2009 currently most continuous drainage networks are commonly modeled from digital elevation models dems fairfield and leymarie 1991 o callaghan and mark 1984 examples include the widely used hydrosheds and hydro1k datasets lehner et al 2006 usgs 2001 this is analogous to the use of a topographical map and successful dem prediction of rivers enables a significant change in our understanding of global hydrology however some errors in dems such as speckle noise stripe noise absolute bias and tree height bias distort the representation of drainage networks at the global scale yamazaki et al 2017 in addition to dems satellite remote sensing has also been widely used in the mapping analysis and dynamic monitoring of actively flowing river networks building off traditional work using aerial surveys allen and pavelsky 2018 alsdorf et al 2007 gleason and smith 2014 mccabe et al 2017 smith 1997 researchers have developed various global hydrography data products in an effort to understand rivers at the global scale for example yamazaki et al 2015 used multi temporal landsat images and an automated algorithm to produce the global 3 arc second water body map g3wbm gong et al 2013 classified landsat images and produced the 30 m finer resolution observation and monitoring global land cover 2017 from glc 2017 map which identified open water classes with relatively high classification accuracy using google earth engine and the entire landsat archive pekel et al 2016 processed over three million satellite images to create the 30 m global surface water gsw dataset the gsw quantified changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of global seasonal and permanent water bodies for 32 years 1984 2015 revealing long term increases and decreases in global surface water extent allen and pavelsky 2018 produced the 30 m global river widths from landsat grwl dataset which includes continuous open water masks and river centerlines the river and stream surface areas calculated by grwl were 45 larger than previous estimates significantly advancing our knowledge of the extent and spatial distribution of surface water around the world these new global data products on surface water extent and river planforms have significantly improved current understanding of the earth s hydrography at a reach scale however because they are derived from landsat imagery and limited to rivers wider than 30 m these miss abundant smaller rivers at present there are no free available remotely sensed hydrography data products with spatial resolutions finer than 30 m there is therefore a knowledge gap in river hydrography that ends at 30 m width which limits our understanding of the morphology and dynamic changes in small rivers and the processes of surface hydrology at a finer reach scale as a result field surveys are currently an important means of studying small rivers and streams for global hydrography work e g allen et al 2018 godsey and kirchner 2014 however it is costly and impractical to carry out large scale field surveys of entire river networks we contend that there are now sensors and computational resources available to dramatically increase the scale of satellite mapped river networks as well as small rivers in addition to the problem of resolution rivers extracted from remotely sensed images are commonly fragmented and lack a proper topology fully connected river networks are required for quantitative analysis and hydrological modeling at a catchment scale czuba and foufoula georgiou 2015 downing et al 2012 seybold et al 2017 and thus current remote sensing techniques can fall short of this goal in contrast drainage networks modeled from dems are typically continuous but have difficulty in predicting whether or not a free flowing river actually occupies a topographic low just because a trough exists does not mean it contains a river therefore integrating satellite imagery with dems should compensate for errors in connectivity and actual presence and consequently generate accurate and continuous river networks that present actual river distributions to that end we combine 10 m sentinel 2 satellite imagery and a high resolution dem in order to map arctic hydrologically continuous river networks with small rivers for kotuy and coleen rivers with study areas of 12 000 km2 and 10 000 km2 respectively specifically we use gabor filtering and path opening morphological operations to extract actively flowing rivers from sentinel 2 images and merge these with arcticdem modeled drainage networks to remove non water features and fill gaps along remotely sensed small river channels results show as expected that river networks derived from 10 m remotely sensed products are far more complete and continuous than those derived from 30 m products at reach and catchment scales thus more accurately depicting actively flowing river networks on the ground we contextualize what this finer resolution network means for associated hydrology of the catchments and give some recommendations for future research 2 data and study area 2 1 remotely sensed datasets the european space agency esa launched sentinel 2 satellites comprised of a constellation of two satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b in 2015 and 2017 respectively the sentinel 2 satellites have a large swath 290 km and a frequent revisit period five days both carry a single multi spectral instrument msi having 13 spectral bands in the visible vis near infrared nir and short wave infrared swir spectral domains with spatial resolutions ranging from 10 m to 60 m drusch et al 2012 we used radiometrically and geometrically corrected level 1c sentinel 2 image products baillarin et al 2012 free available from https earthexplorer usgs gov arcticdem is a high resolution pan arctic topography dataset generated through stereo photogrammetric processing of panchromatic images from worldview 1 2 3 and geoeye 1 satellites morin et al 2016 arcticdem has a vertical precision of approximately 0 3 m dai et al 2018 and in 2018 the polar geospatial center pgc issued arcticdem release 7 http arcticdem org covering all land areas north of 60 n in addition to providing 2 m resolution strip dems the pgc also selected high quality 2 m strip dem files to produce 2 m mosaic dems in which void areas were reduced through re mosaicking of the entire arcticdem domain reduced resolution versions of the mosaic dems are also available at resolutions of 10 m 32 m 100 m 500 m and 1 km this study used the 10 m arcticdem product in order to match the spatial resolution of the sentinel 2 satellite imagery and enhance data processing efficiency 2 2 study area two arctic basins the kotuy and coleen rivers were chosen as testbeds for the methodology presented here fig 1 the kotuy river basin located in krasnoyarsk krai in russia is a typical arctic basin characterized by continuous permafrost tundra vegetation and sparse human population bliss 1981 brown et al 1997 the coleen river basin located in the southern part of the brooks range in alaska is characterized by tundra and taiga vegetation high topographic relief and continuous permafrost with high ground ice content and thick overburden brabets et al 2000 brown et al 1997 both basins are covered with snow and ice for 7 8 months of each year ice and snow melt in these two study areas lasts from june until september ala aho et al 2018 anderson et al 2013 chen et al 2014 and their streamflow typically peaks in mid june brabets et al 2000 shiklomanov et al 2002 these basins have well developed river networks and widely distributed small rivers fig 1 basin areas are 12 000 km2 and 10 000 km2 for the kotuy and coleen rivers respectively we selected a cloudless sentinel 2b image acquired on june 18 2016 l1c tile number t48wvc for the kotuy river to represent its peak streamflow for the coleen river no cloudless sentinel 2 images are available in june thereby a sentinel 2a image acquired on september 17 2017 l1c tile number t07wdr was used to study the coleen river 2 3 datasets for river network comparison the landsat derived gsw grwl from glc 2017 and g3wbm global hydrography datasets were chosen for comparison with the river networks produced in this study table 1 for the coleen river the nhd was also used for validation of rivers the nhd https nhd usgs gov includes all natural and anthropogenic water bodies mapped at a scale of 1 24 000 or better simley and carswell 2009 and represents the most comprehensive and comparative dataset for validation of satellite derived water maps yamazaki et al 2015 the gsw pekel et al 2016 maps open water changes at a global scale over a period of 32 years 1984 2015 including water occurrence and change intensity water seasonality october 2014 october 2015 and annual water recurrence this study utilized maximum water extent data from october 2014 to october 2015 the official from glc website http data ess tsinghua edu cn has recently released 2017 global land cover product which separates water and wetland classifications the water classification includes natural and artificial waterbodies the wetland classification mainly includes inundated marsh land with emergent vegetation and wet muddy bare land such as a wet lake bottom gong et al 2013 we merged these two classifications to obtain the from glc 2017 water extent data the grwl dataset allen and pavelsky 2018 extracts rivers at mean annual discharges from landsat images to build global open water masks and river width products the g3wbm dataset yamazaki et al 2015 contains distributions of permanent and temporal water bodies mapped in 1990 2000 2005 and 2010 the open water data from the four years were combined to obtain the maximum water extent data in sum we have obtained river locations and surface areas from a variety of products for comparison with our proposed method all of these products are landsat based and global save for the nhd we consider the nhd as a gold standard for comparison but also note issues of stream migration between the creation of nhd for the coleen rivers before 1973 and our study made 40 years later in this highly dynamic environment 3 methods 3 1 sentinel 2 river network extraction small and large rivers were extracted separately in this study fig 2 since river channels in the raw sentinel 2 imagery are not easily delineated from visual inspection fig 3 a we calculated the normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 to enhance the appearance of all liquid water bodies in each sentinel 2 satellite image fig 3b larger rivers were then extracted using a ndwi threshold of 0 1 following yang et al 2014 however low spectral contrast between smaller rivers and surrounding land made small rivers difficult to discern using this threshold which agrees with results obtained by cooley et al 2017 and feng et al 2019 to improve detection of small rivers we followed the method of yang et al 2015 to increase the contrast between small rivers and the image background this method used a band pass filter ramped between 1 200 m 1 and 1 40 m 1 to remove low frequency background and high frequency noise fig 3c thus enhancing detection of smaller rivers however even after band pass filtering smaller rivers still exhibit low spectral contrast with the image background a gabor filter was applied to enhance the cross sectional features of small rivers with width less than two pixels fig 3d a parsimonious path opening ppo which is a longitudinal direction path operator was then used to enhance the connectivity of rivers 20 pixels 200 m in length fig 3e these three steps enhanced the linear features of the images and improved the connectivity and completeness of the extracted river networks through trial and error and visual comparison with each original sentinel 2 image a global threshold of 20 i e 20 out of 255 in an 8 bit image was then determined to produce binary open water masks fig 3f these open water masks are simply pixels we define as water and non water and additional processing is needed to transform these into objects recognized programmatically as river channels sentinel 2 river network centerlines were thus produced using the arcscan tool bajjali 2018a from the open water masks 3 2 arcticdem drainage network modeling the above processing produced initial river networks but some patchy misidentified features e g mountain shadows remained in our derived river networks it is difficult to remove these effectively using a single threshold because mountains and clouds obscure the spectral properties of water bodies and shadows have ndwi values similar to those of water bodies feyisa et al 2014 verpoorter et al 2012 additionally xu 2005 discovered that bare land and water bodies have practically identical spectral characteristics in the green and near infrared bands making ndwi based water extraction less effective in the arctic tundra moreover additional gaps appear in the sentinel mapped river networks because we utilized pixel based river extraction methods instead of object based methods therefore it is necessary to remove non water features and fill the gaps in the sentinel mapped river networks to obtain more accurate and continuous river extraction results this is a known problem for river networks derived from satellite images we highlight in the introduction and thus we merged the power of dems and satellite imagery to address this problem the first step in producing dem based stream networks is to produce a flow accumulation map in this study a high resolution flow accumulation map was produced from arcticdem through a sequence of sink filling d8 flow direction calculation and flow accumulation calculation using hydrologic analysis tools in arcgis bajjali 2018b the density of the resulting drainage networks are controlled almost exclusively by the choice of the accumulation area threshold the theoretical land surface area needed to produce an open water river li and wong 2010 this translates to the size of the smallest sub watershed within the basin where streams generation begins a lower area threshold i e smaller sub watersheds will create denser river features to the point where some streams may be too small to actually exist whereas a higher area threshold will reduce the number of river features neglecting some small streams for this reason dem modeled drainage networks are generally not in consistent with the actual distribution of actively flowing surface water kenward 2000 yang et al 2015 therefore in order to determine the river areas of interest i e potential actively flowing river locations we chose an accumulation area threshold a c 0 5 km2 or 5000 pixels to produce an arcticdem modeled drainage network that would cover the entire sentinel mapped river networks fig 3h 3 3 sentinel 2 and arcticdem river network merging from visual inspection river networks extracted from sentinel 2 images accurately reflected the real world drainage patterns of the kotuy and coleen rivers but some gaps in the river networks remained in contrast drainage networks modeled from arcticdem were continuous but did not always accurately determine actively flowing rivers therefore to obtain accurate and continuous river networks we combine both of these derived river networks our first step was to correctly co locate rivers from both datasets to do so we created arcticdem modeled areas of interest aoi by buffering five pixels 50 m in width to remove non water features water bodies from the sentinel mapped open water mask were considered to be correctly extracted if they fell inside the arcticdem modeled aoi and to be incorrectly extracted if they fell outside some erroneously classified water features or small lakes could fall in the low order river aoi therefore based on the fact that the length of such non water features are generally short 300 m in order to ensure the accuracy of the sentinel mapped river networks any segment less than 300 m was removed fig 3g second we merged arcticdem modeled drainage networks with sentinel mapped river networks to connect gaps in remotely sensed river channels fig 3g before connecting the river gaps we identified three spatial relationships between the sentinel mapped river networks and dem modeled drainage networks fig 4 1 a dem segment segment 1 in fig 4a that increases network connectivity by connecting the two dangle points of a sentinel 2 gap segment should be retained while a dem section that forms a tributary segment 2 in fig 4a should be removed 2 dem segments aligned with and connected to a sentinel 2 gap segment segments 1 and 3 in fig 4b should be kept while segments un connected to a gap segment segments 2 4 and 5 in fig 4b should be retained only if they increase network connectivity segment 2 in fig 4b 3 dem segments that are connected to terminal segments of the sentinel mapped river networks and could produce extra n order river segments should be removed fig 4c based on the above spatial relationships we designed an iterative method for deleting redundant dem segments fig 4 river segment vertices were classified into three types sentinel 2 dangle point dem dangle point and intersection point fig 4 each dem segment that should be deleted contained a single dem dangle point therefore we considered such dem dangle points as the basis for deleting redundant dem segments iteratively with each iteration of the algorithm only the lowest order dangling dem segments were deleted so that the dem modeled drainage network became stripped of many redundant segments after the first iteration fig 4a and b however redundant n 1 order dem segments still remained attached to the sentinel 2 segments fig 4c because these dem segments formed a dendritic network and cannot be removed from a single iteration therefore in this study the lowest order of dangling dem segments was removed iteratively until no further changes were made to the total length of the coupled river network that is until all of the extra dem segments were removed fig 4c the described sequence of processing steps produced a final continuous and complete sentinel arcticdem merged river network sarn which exhibits a classic dendritic fluvial drainage pattern fig 3i the presented sarn methodology was implemented using matlab and python and has been published on the github platform https github com njurs 3 4 river morphometric metrics and comparison methodology the motivation for our method lies in its improved spatial resolution but this improved resolution only becomes relevant when deriving river morphometry and other quantities of hydrologic interest thus a comparison between our method and the global landsat products mentioned is in order to elucidate the differences therein in addition we tested our method using landsat data to determine how our method performed against other mapping techniques i e the global products using the same data we obtained landsat 8 images captured in july 22 2016 coleen river and august 6 2017 kotuy river to delineate landsat arcticdem merged river networks larns for this purpose finally the nhd is recognized as the official record of river location by the usgs and we can use this dataset to compare our method against this government issue dataset for the coleen basin to quantitatively compare the hydrologic impact of our sarns with the global products larns and nhd we calculated five morphometric statistics metrics for each these include drainage density dd the ratio of river length to the total area for a given catchment open water fraction owf the ratio of water pixels to the total number of pixels river connectivity l max the longest connected river length and river width we used arcscan to obtain river centerlines and calculate mean river widths for sarns larns gsw from glc 2017 and g3wbm datasets which do not include widths grwl includes estimates of width to analyze the consistency of sarns with nhd we used a positional accuracy measure proposed by goodchild and hunter 1997 computing the proportion of one linear feature length that lies within a buffer of another linear feature and calculated the proportion of nhd appearing in sarns buffer of width 50 m by stream order thus we attempt to ensure that nhd and sarns are producing rivers in the same location in addition to comparing the metrics introduced above because the nhd does not include stream order values we used the automated stream ordering tool in geomorphic network and analysis toolbox gnat https gnat riverscapes xyz index an arcgis python toolbox to label strahler stream orders strahler 1957 for the nhd strahler stream ordering begins at order 1 for the smallest river and increases to number n depending on how many stream junctions are observed in the basin we also projected strahler stream orders of the arcticdem modeled drainage networks onto sarns of the coleen river in alaska by creating a 100 m buffer area 4 results 4 1 comparison of sarns with nhd sarns are able to accurately model larger than 1st order nhd as 70 of nhd appear in a sarn buffer of width 50 m 1st order nhd are captured less well as 68 of nhd rivers do not appear within this 50 m buffer fig 5 and table 2 this performance is encouraging as nhd contains rivers much smaller than represented by our flow accumulation threshold additionally sarns have dd that is 71 of nhd and l max that is 73 of the nhd table 3 in addition to analyzing rivers at the reach scale we selected a sub basin 331 km2 of the coleen river to compare sarns with nhd at the catchment scale fig 6 a and b the sarn method extracts numerous small rivers and the sum river lengths of rivers of orders 2 4 are comparable to their nhd counterparts fig 6c in contrast the sum length of 1st order sarns is 60 shorter than that of 1st nhd while the sum length of 5th order sarns is 30 shorter this is because higher resolution nhd captures more 10 m rivers and its high order large rivers are more braided additionally the sum river lengths of both sarns and nhd are negatively correlated with stream order fig 6c which is consistent with a previous study downing et al 2012 4 2 drainage density analysis due to the finer spatial resolution of both sentinel 2 satellite images and arcticdem sarns are more continuous and contain more small rivers than the gsw grwl from glc 2017 and g3wbm global datasets figs 7 9 estimated dd values of the kotuy and coleen rivers are 0 34 km 1 and 0 57 km 1 respectively and these are 4 8 and 7 2 times greater respectively than the largest dd value of the other four hydrography data products but less than nhd fig 10 and table 3 our method applied to landsat larns also delineates a greater number of complete river networks figs 7 9 for example dd values of the larns of kotuy and coleen rivers are at least 3 2 and 4 6 times greater respectively than corresponding values for the four other landsat derived hydrography data products fig 10 and table 3 therefore existing hydrography datasets derived from landsat imagery could detect much smaller rivers if merged with dems amongst these existing hydrography data products the gsw yields a slightly higher dd than the other datasets fig 10 and table 3 consistent with a previous study aires et al 2018 however in areas covered with bare land and mountain shadows the gsw produces poor results figs 7c 8c and 9 as do the from glc 2017 figs 7e 8e and 9 the grwl based dd in the coleen river is lower than that in the kotuy river because grwl only captures main rivers in the coleen river figs 7d 8d and 10 surprisingly although the resolution of g3wbm is 90 m there is little difference between the resultant dd and those of the existing 30 m hydrography data products figs 7f 8f 9 10 and table 3 4 3 open water fraction analysis in contrast to drainage density open water fraction owf of our sarns is similar to the other datasets the owf values of the kotuy and coleen rivers are no less than 1 05 and 1 59 times greater respectively than those of the other four hydrography data products fig 10 and table 3 this is because owf is influenced primarily by the surface area of large rivers whereas smaller rivers 1 3 pixels wide contribute to dd consistent with allen and pavelsky 2015 larn owf is approximately 30 greater than sarn owf fig 10 because of the limitation in the landsat 8 imagery resolution it is difficult to distinguish the boundaries of large and small rivers from mixed pixels as a result all rivers that are narrower than 30 m were assigned a uniform width of 30 m leading to overestimation of river surface area 4 4 the longest connected river length analysis the sarn method extracts more small rivers and significantly improves river connectivity figs 7 8 and table 3 in the kotuy river the longest connected river length l max of sarns is 2 512 km and in the coleen river l max is 2 876 km the l max values of sarns in the kotuy and coleen rivers are at least 10 times greater than those of the global hydrography data products except grwl in the kotuy river but less than that of nhd table 3 gsw and grwl have higher l max values than other global hydrography data products in the kotuy and coleen rivers respectively table 3 however because gsw and grwl only extracted large rivers they have l max approximately 80 shorter than sarns therefore merging the arcticdem modeled drainage networks with sentinel mapped river networks can significantly improves river connectivity 4 5 river width analysis rivers as narrow as 10 m can be extracted from sentinel 2 images providing a fully complete river width histogram as compared with landsat derived width distributions fig 11 of the four global hydrography data products assessed here grwl provides the most continuous mapping of large river widths to assess the potential benefits of using higher resolution sentinel 2 imagery we selected a 2467 km2 sub basin of the kotuy river for comparison with grwl at the catchment scale fig 12 a sarns clearly contain more rivers that are less than 30 m wide while the grwl dataset only contains large rivers the river width of sarns positively correlates with stream order fig 12b three tributaries in this sub basin were selected from sarns and the relationship between the river width and the distance from the river basin outlet was plotted fig 12 sarns extract a higher number of small rivers with river width less than 30 m and show negative correlation r2 0 58 p 0 01 between river width and the distance from the river basin outlet fig 12d e and f no direct correlation between the river width and distance from the basin outlet is found in grwl fig 12c grwl overestimates the river widths that are less than 90 m failing to identify small rivers in mixed pixels accurately which is consistent with a previous study allen and pavelsky 2018 5 discussion this study merged 10 m resolution sentinel mapped rivers with arcticdem modeled rivers to extract complete and continuous river networks that included small rivers as narrow as 10 m as compared with the national hydrography dataset nhd sentinel arcticdem merged river networks sarns are accurate and consistent for greater than 1st order nhd table 2 shows that this agreement worsens as rivers get larger yet this may be due to a temporal mismatch by comparing nhd with historical landsat images we determined that most of the nhd for the coleen river were obtained before 1973 fig s1 at least 40 years prior to the 2017 sentinel 2 image used here the highly dynamic arctic alluvium coupled with increasing temperatures and thawing permafrost results in shifting thalwegs over this period creating inconsistencies between the sarns and nhd especially for 6th order nhd and larger table 2 this finding also suggests possible obsolescence of the nhd for mapping dynamic arctic rivers at least in the coleen river as compared with existing hydrography data products gsw grwl from glc 2017 and g3wbm produced from 30 m landsat series satellite imagery sarn drainage densities are at least 4 5 times larger than other evaluated hydrography data products fig 10 and table 3 and sarns contain much richer river width information 10 30 m fig 11 further our larns created by imposing our method on landsat imagery revel that existing hydrography data products do not fully utilize the ability of landsat images to detect narrow water bodies because of their necessary computational simplicity for global work and the limited availability of high resolution global dems merging visible nir satellite imagery with arcticdem modeled drainage networks better captures continuous small rivers especially eliminating gaps from mountain shadows and bare land to maintain connectivity finer resolution sarns yield higher drainage density than larns but sarns have lower owf than larns fig 10 we thus conclude that surface area of rivers and streams of larns is overestimated opposite to grwl the river width of sarns shows negative correlation r2 0 58 p 0 01 with the distance from the river basin outlet fig 12 because of the limitation in the landsat 8 imagery resolution it is difficult to distinguish the boundaries of large and small rivers from mixed pixels crapper 1980 lyons et al 2013 yamazaki et al 2015 clearly the use of sentinel 2 images contributed to solving mixed pixel problem delineating the boundaries of large rivers accurately and extracting small rivers that are 10 30 m wide the sarn method significantly improves river connectivity at the catchment scale the river networks of the gsw from glc 2017 and g3wbm datasets have low connectivity with gap segments occurring even in large rivers because these datasets utilize pixel based river extraction methods gong et al 2013 pekel et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2015 thus neglecting the adjacency relationship between continuous river channels merging sentinel 2 with arcticdem topographic information delineates river networks an order of magnitude more continuous than pixel based river network extractions alone this in turn can provide more information at a finer catchment scale and more correctly identify catchment properties like stream order stream length and other important factors figs 6 12 and table 3 we find three areas for improvement with the sarn method first some of the tundra close to river banks is difficult to remove because they are located within the river areas of interest future studies should seek a more effective method of removing tundra features located along river banks for example by generating 10 m resolution modified normalized difference water index mndwi images through swir band sharpening du et al 2016 second the presented sarn method requires use of several thresholds including a low global threshold of the processed sentinel 2 imagery to preserve the connectivity of small rivers a low accumulation area threshold of the arcticdem flow accumulation map that can cover the entire sentinel mapped river networks a low order river interest area threshold to remove non water features and a high ndwi global threshold to extract large rivers the applicability of the threshold values selected here to other locations remains untested third we examined only single sentinel 2 image here future work should incorporate multi temporal sentinel 2 satellite images in order to realize the dynamic monitoring of changes in river networks and to compensate for any lack in the temporal resolution of the nhd 6 conclusion in this paper we presented a methodology to effectively map continuous river networks from 10 m sentinel 2 imagery with arcticdem data at finer reach and catchment scales our sentinel arcticdem merged river networks sarns align well with nhd and their drainage densities are at least 4 5 larger than existing landsat derived hydrography data products in addition merging remotely sensed river networks with arcticdem modeled drainage networks significantly improves river connectivity with at least a ten fold increase over the other landsat derived hydrography data products the presented sarn methodology can be extended to open water extraction over the entire arctic to produce remotely sensed arctic river products growing availability of high resolution dems e g worlddem alongside 10 m sentinel 2 or even 3 5 m cubesat imagery cooley et al 2017 cooley et al 2019 portends our growing capacity to track dynamic surface water processes with unprecedented resolution over space and time credit authorship contribution

5655,small rivers 30 m are significant components of terrestrial river networks and remote sensing is a necessary tool to study them at the global scale however current global hydrography data products generally include only rivers that are wider than 30 m neglecting smaller waterways and thus limiting our understanding of surface water processes especially in remote areas we present a new automated methodology to map two arctic actively flowing river networks kotuy and coleen rivers with study areas of 12 000 km2 and 10 000 km2 respectively including small rivers as narrow as 10 m from sentinel 2 multispectral satellite imagery and high resolution arcticdem digital elevation data first preliminary river network masks were generated by using gabor filtering and path opening morphological operations on normalized difference water index ndwi images second arcticdem data were employed to simulate surface flow paths and the resultant drainage networks were used to create river areas of interest aoi and subsequently eliminate non water features outside the river aoi third gaps along remotely sensed small river channels were filled using the arcticdem modeled drainage networks yielding continuous river networks with high spatial resolution we compared the 10 m sentinel arcticdem merged river network sarn with the national hydrography dataset nhd and four 30 m landsat derived hydrography data products gsw grwl from glc 2017 and g3wbm we conclude 1 sarns have similar quality to the 1st order nhd 70 of nhd streams appear in sarns 2 at a reach scale sarns include more small rivers with the drainage densities at least 4 5 times larger than landsat derived hydrography data products similarly coupling arcticdem data with 30 m landsat satellite images increases resultant drainage densities approximately three fold 3 at a catchment scale merging remotely sensed river networks with arcticdem modeled drainage networks significantly improves river connectivity defined as the longest connected river length with at least a ten fold increase over the other hydrography data products examined here in sum merging high resolution sentinel 2 imagery with arcticdem data enable effective continuous mapping of complex fluvial drainage patterns of arctic rivers keywords small rivers river network mapping sentinel 2 landsat arcticdem arctic 1 introduction terrestrial river networks transport and store large quantities of alluvial material and drive climate and ecosystems via biogeochemical cycles jung et al 2010 raymond et al 2013 sj√∂gersten et al 2014 vorosmarty 2000 small river ecosystems tend to be particularly variable over time and have frequent land atmosphere interactions allen et al 2018 benstead and leigh 2012 meyer et al 2007 peterson 2001 for example during wet periods river network drainage density dd the ratio of river length to the total area for a given catchment may be over eight times greater than during periods with normal water levels benstead and leigh 2012 moreover 50 of global greenhouse gas emissions originate from small rivers and streams allen et al 2018 butman et al 2016 therefore neglecting small rivers in global analyses could underestimate the role that river networks play in the biogeochemical cycle and accurate mapping of river networks is needed the arctic region contains most of the global rivers and lakes allen and pavelsky 2018 pekel et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2015 these rapidly respond to regional water balance and surface groundwater interactions and these dynamics are shifting under recent climate change cooley et al 2017 cooley et al 2019 further the arctic is thought to be a major store of greenhouse gasses set to alter the global carbon budget as permafrost thaws and releases especially methane into the atmosphere raymond et al 2013 therefore mapping arctic river networks in particular is essential to better constrain diverse arctic climatic and physiographic and physiochemical processes river drainage patterns have been traditionally mapped using land surveys following the principle that streams flow down gradient i e downhill for example the national hydrography dataset nhd published by the united states geological survey usgs represents the surface water system of the united states which was generated from detailed topographic maps simley and carswell 2009 currently most continuous drainage networks are commonly modeled from digital elevation models dems fairfield and leymarie 1991 o callaghan and mark 1984 examples include the widely used hydrosheds and hydro1k datasets lehner et al 2006 usgs 2001 this is analogous to the use of a topographical map and successful dem prediction of rivers enables a significant change in our understanding of global hydrology however some errors in dems such as speckle noise stripe noise absolute bias and tree height bias distort the representation of drainage networks at the global scale yamazaki et al 2017 in addition to dems satellite remote sensing has also been widely used in the mapping analysis and dynamic monitoring of actively flowing river networks building off traditional work using aerial surveys allen and pavelsky 2018 alsdorf et al 2007 gleason and smith 2014 mccabe et al 2017 smith 1997 researchers have developed various global hydrography data products in an effort to understand rivers at the global scale for example yamazaki et al 2015 used multi temporal landsat images and an automated algorithm to produce the global 3 arc second water body map g3wbm gong et al 2013 classified landsat images and produced the 30 m finer resolution observation and monitoring global land cover 2017 from glc 2017 map which identified open water classes with relatively high classification accuracy using google earth engine and the entire landsat archive pekel et al 2016 processed over three million satellite images to create the 30 m global surface water gsw dataset the gsw quantified changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of global seasonal and permanent water bodies for 32 years 1984 2015 revealing long term increases and decreases in global surface water extent allen and pavelsky 2018 produced the 30 m global river widths from landsat grwl dataset which includes continuous open water masks and river centerlines the river and stream surface areas calculated by grwl were 45 larger than previous estimates significantly advancing our knowledge of the extent and spatial distribution of surface water around the world these new global data products on surface water extent and river planforms have significantly improved current understanding of the earth s hydrography at a reach scale however because they are derived from landsat imagery and limited to rivers wider than 30 m these miss abundant smaller rivers at present there are no free available remotely sensed hydrography data products with spatial resolutions finer than 30 m there is therefore a knowledge gap in river hydrography that ends at 30 m width which limits our understanding of the morphology and dynamic changes in small rivers and the processes of surface hydrology at a finer reach scale as a result field surveys are currently an important means of studying small rivers and streams for global hydrography work e g allen et al 2018 godsey and kirchner 2014 however it is costly and impractical to carry out large scale field surveys of entire river networks we contend that there are now sensors and computational resources available to dramatically increase the scale of satellite mapped river networks as well as small rivers in addition to the problem of resolution rivers extracted from remotely sensed images are commonly fragmented and lack a proper topology fully connected river networks are required for quantitative analysis and hydrological modeling at a catchment scale czuba and foufoula georgiou 2015 downing et al 2012 seybold et al 2017 and thus current remote sensing techniques can fall short of this goal in contrast drainage networks modeled from dems are typically continuous but have difficulty in predicting whether or not a free flowing river actually occupies a topographic low just because a trough exists does not mean it contains a river therefore integrating satellite imagery with dems should compensate for errors in connectivity and actual presence and consequently generate accurate and continuous river networks that present actual river distributions to that end we combine 10 m sentinel 2 satellite imagery and a high resolution dem in order to map arctic hydrologically continuous river networks with small rivers for kotuy and coleen rivers with study areas of 12 000 km2 and 10 000 km2 respectively specifically we use gabor filtering and path opening morphological operations to extract actively flowing rivers from sentinel 2 images and merge these with arcticdem modeled drainage networks to remove non water features and fill gaps along remotely sensed small river channels results show as expected that river networks derived from 10 m remotely sensed products are far more complete and continuous than those derived from 30 m products at reach and catchment scales thus more accurately depicting actively flowing river networks on the ground we contextualize what this finer resolution network means for associated hydrology of the catchments and give some recommendations for future research 2 data and study area 2 1 remotely sensed datasets the european space agency esa launched sentinel 2 satellites comprised of a constellation of two satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b in 2015 and 2017 respectively the sentinel 2 satellites have a large swath 290 km and a frequent revisit period five days both carry a single multi spectral instrument msi having 13 spectral bands in the visible vis near infrared nir and short wave infrared swir spectral domains with spatial resolutions ranging from 10 m to 60 m drusch et al 2012 we used radiometrically and geometrically corrected level 1c sentinel 2 image products baillarin et al 2012 free available from https earthexplorer usgs gov arcticdem is a high resolution pan arctic topography dataset generated through stereo photogrammetric processing of panchromatic images from worldview 1 2 3 and geoeye 1 satellites morin et al 2016 arcticdem has a vertical precision of approximately 0 3 m dai et al 2018 and in 2018 the polar geospatial center pgc issued arcticdem release 7 http arcticdem org covering all land areas north of 60 n in addition to providing 2 m resolution strip dems the pgc also selected high quality 2 m strip dem files to produce 2 m mosaic dems in which void areas were reduced through re mosaicking of the entire arcticdem domain reduced resolution versions of the mosaic dems are also available at resolutions of 10 m 32 m 100 m 500 m and 1 km this study used the 10 m arcticdem product in order to match the spatial resolution of the sentinel 2 satellite imagery and enhance data processing efficiency 2 2 study area two arctic basins the kotuy and coleen rivers were chosen as testbeds for the methodology presented here fig 1 the kotuy river basin located in krasnoyarsk krai in russia is a typical arctic basin characterized by continuous permafrost tundra vegetation and sparse human population bliss 1981 brown et al 1997 the coleen river basin located in the southern part of the brooks range in alaska is characterized by tundra and taiga vegetation high topographic relief and continuous permafrost with high ground ice content and thick overburden brabets et al 2000 brown et al 1997 both basins are covered with snow and ice for 7 8 months of each year ice and snow melt in these two study areas lasts from june until september ala aho et al 2018 anderson et al 2013 chen et al 2014 and their streamflow typically peaks in mid june brabets et al 2000 shiklomanov et al 2002 these basins have well developed river networks and widely distributed small rivers fig 1 basin areas are 12 000 km2 and 10 000 km2 for the kotuy and coleen rivers respectively we selected a cloudless sentinel 2b image acquired on june 18 2016 l1c tile number t48wvc for the kotuy river to represent its peak streamflow for the coleen river no cloudless sentinel 2 images are available in june thereby a sentinel 2a image acquired on september 17 2017 l1c tile number t07wdr was used to study the coleen river 2 3 datasets for river network comparison the landsat derived gsw grwl from glc 2017 and g3wbm global hydrography datasets were chosen for comparison with the river networks produced in this study table 1 for the coleen river the nhd was also used for validation of rivers the nhd https nhd usgs gov includes all natural and anthropogenic water bodies mapped at a scale of 1 24 000 or better simley and carswell 2009 and represents the most comprehensive and comparative dataset for validation of satellite derived water maps yamazaki et al 2015 the gsw pekel et al 2016 maps open water changes at a global scale over a period of 32 years 1984 2015 including water occurrence and change intensity water seasonality october 2014 october 2015 and annual water recurrence this study utilized maximum water extent data from october 2014 to october 2015 the official from glc website http data ess tsinghua edu cn has recently released 2017 global land cover product which separates water and wetland classifications the water classification includes natural and artificial waterbodies the wetland classification mainly includes inundated marsh land with emergent vegetation and wet muddy bare land such as a wet lake bottom gong et al 2013 we merged these two classifications to obtain the from glc 2017 water extent data the grwl dataset allen and pavelsky 2018 extracts rivers at mean annual discharges from landsat images to build global open water masks and river width products the g3wbm dataset yamazaki et al 2015 contains distributions of permanent and temporal water bodies mapped in 1990 2000 2005 and 2010 the open water data from the four years were combined to obtain the maximum water extent data in sum we have obtained river locations and surface areas from a variety of products for comparison with our proposed method all of these products are landsat based and global save for the nhd we consider the nhd as a gold standard for comparison but also note issues of stream migration between the creation of nhd for the coleen rivers before 1973 and our study made 40 years later in this highly dynamic environment 3 methods 3 1 sentinel 2 river network extraction small and large rivers were extracted separately in this study fig 2 since river channels in the raw sentinel 2 imagery are not easily delineated from visual inspection fig 3 a we calculated the normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 to enhance the appearance of all liquid water bodies in each sentinel 2 satellite image fig 3b larger rivers were then extracted using a ndwi threshold of 0 1 following yang et al 2014 however low spectral contrast between smaller rivers and surrounding land made small rivers difficult to discern using this threshold which agrees with results obtained by cooley et al 2017 and feng et al 2019 to improve detection of small rivers we followed the method of yang et al 2015 to increase the contrast between small rivers and the image background this method used a band pass filter ramped between 1 200 m 1 and 1 40 m 1 to remove low frequency background and high frequency noise fig 3c thus enhancing detection of smaller rivers however even after band pass filtering smaller rivers still exhibit low spectral contrast with the image background a gabor filter was applied to enhance the cross sectional features of small rivers with width less than two pixels fig 3d a parsimonious path opening ppo which is a longitudinal direction path operator was then used to enhance the connectivity of rivers 20 pixels 200 m in length fig 3e these three steps enhanced the linear features of the images and improved the connectivity and completeness of the extracted river networks through trial and error and visual comparison with each original sentinel 2 image a global threshold of 20 i e 20 out of 255 in an 8 bit image was then determined to produce binary open water masks fig 3f these open water masks are simply pixels we define as water and non water and additional processing is needed to transform these into objects recognized programmatically as river channels sentinel 2 river network centerlines were thus produced using the arcscan tool bajjali 2018a from the open water masks 3 2 arcticdem drainage network modeling the above processing produced initial river networks but some patchy misidentified features e g mountain shadows remained in our derived river networks it is difficult to remove these effectively using a single threshold because mountains and clouds obscure the spectral properties of water bodies and shadows have ndwi values similar to those of water bodies feyisa et al 2014 verpoorter et al 2012 additionally xu 2005 discovered that bare land and water bodies have practically identical spectral characteristics in the green and near infrared bands making ndwi based water extraction less effective in the arctic tundra moreover additional gaps appear in the sentinel mapped river networks because we utilized pixel based river extraction methods instead of object based methods therefore it is necessary to remove non water features and fill the gaps in the sentinel mapped river networks to obtain more accurate and continuous river extraction results this is a known problem for river networks derived from satellite images we highlight in the introduction and thus we merged the power of dems and satellite imagery to address this problem the first step in producing dem based stream networks is to produce a flow accumulation map in this study a high resolution flow accumulation map was produced from arcticdem through a sequence of sink filling d8 flow direction calculation and flow accumulation calculation using hydrologic analysis tools in arcgis bajjali 2018b the density of the resulting drainage networks are controlled almost exclusively by the choice of the accumulation area threshold the theoretical land surface area needed to produce an open water river li and wong 2010 this translates to the size of the smallest sub watershed within the basin where streams generation begins a lower area threshold i e smaller sub watersheds will create denser river features to the point where some streams may be too small to actually exist whereas a higher area threshold will reduce the number of river features neglecting some small streams for this reason dem modeled drainage networks are generally not in consistent with the actual distribution of actively flowing surface water kenward 2000 yang et al 2015 therefore in order to determine the river areas of interest i e potential actively flowing river locations we chose an accumulation area threshold a c 0 5 km2 or 5000 pixels to produce an arcticdem modeled drainage network that would cover the entire sentinel mapped river networks fig 3h 3 3 sentinel 2 and arcticdem river network merging from visual inspection river networks extracted from sentinel 2 images accurately reflected the real world drainage patterns of the kotuy and coleen rivers but some gaps in the river networks remained in contrast drainage networks modeled from arcticdem were continuous but did not always accurately determine actively flowing rivers therefore to obtain accurate and continuous river networks we combine both of these derived river networks our first step was to correctly co locate rivers from both datasets to do so we created arcticdem modeled areas of interest aoi by buffering five pixels 50 m in width to remove non water features water bodies from the sentinel mapped open water mask were considered to be correctly extracted if they fell inside the arcticdem modeled aoi and to be incorrectly extracted if they fell outside some erroneously classified water features or small lakes could fall in the low order river aoi therefore based on the fact that the length of such non water features are generally short 300 m in order to ensure the accuracy of the sentinel mapped river networks any segment less than 300 m was removed fig 3g second we merged arcticdem modeled drainage networks with sentinel mapped river networks to connect gaps in remotely sensed river channels fig 3g before connecting the river gaps we identified three spatial relationships between the sentinel mapped river networks and dem modeled drainage networks fig 4 1 a dem segment segment 1 in fig 4a that increases network connectivity by connecting the two dangle points of a sentinel 2 gap segment should be retained while a dem section that forms a tributary segment 2 in fig 4a should be removed 2 dem segments aligned with and connected to a sentinel 2 gap segment segments 1 and 3 in fig 4b should be kept while segments un connected to a gap segment segments 2 4 and 5 in fig 4b should be retained only if they increase network connectivity segment 2 in fig 4b 3 dem segments that are connected to terminal segments of the sentinel mapped river networks and could produce extra n order river segments should be removed fig 4c based on the above spatial relationships we designed an iterative method for deleting redundant dem segments fig 4 river segment vertices were classified into three types sentinel 2 dangle point dem dangle point and intersection point fig 4 each dem segment that should be deleted contained a single dem dangle point therefore we considered such dem dangle points as the basis for deleting redundant dem segments iteratively with each iteration of the algorithm only the lowest order dangling dem segments were deleted so that the dem modeled drainage network became stripped of many redundant segments after the first iteration fig 4a and b however redundant n 1 order dem segments still remained attached to the sentinel 2 segments fig 4c because these dem segments formed a dendritic network and cannot be removed from a single iteration therefore in this study the lowest order of dangling dem segments was removed iteratively until no further changes were made to the total length of the coupled river network that is until all of the extra dem segments were removed fig 4c the described sequence of processing steps produced a final continuous and complete sentinel arcticdem merged river network sarn which exhibits a classic dendritic fluvial drainage pattern fig 3i the presented sarn methodology was implemented using matlab and python and has been published on the github platform https github com njurs 3 4 river morphometric metrics and comparison methodology the motivation for our method lies in its improved spatial resolution but this improved resolution only becomes relevant when deriving river morphometry and other quantities of hydrologic interest thus a comparison between our method and the global landsat products mentioned is in order to elucidate the differences therein in addition we tested our method using landsat data to determine how our method performed against other mapping techniques i e the global products using the same data we obtained landsat 8 images captured in july 22 2016 coleen river and august 6 2017 kotuy river to delineate landsat arcticdem merged river networks larns for this purpose finally the nhd is recognized as the official record of river location by the usgs and we can use this dataset to compare our method against this government issue dataset for the coleen basin to quantitatively compare the hydrologic impact of our sarns with the global products larns and nhd we calculated five morphometric statistics metrics for each these include drainage density dd the ratio of river length to the total area for a given catchment open water fraction owf the ratio of water pixels to the total number of pixels river connectivity l max the longest connected river length and river width we used arcscan to obtain river centerlines and calculate mean river widths for sarns larns gsw from glc 2017 and g3wbm datasets which do not include widths grwl includes estimates of width to analyze the consistency of sarns with nhd we used a positional accuracy measure proposed by goodchild and hunter 1997 computing the proportion of one linear feature length that lies within a buffer of another linear feature and calculated the proportion of nhd appearing in sarns buffer of width 50 m by stream order thus we attempt to ensure that nhd and sarns are producing rivers in the same location in addition to comparing the metrics introduced above because the nhd does not include stream order values we used the automated stream ordering tool in geomorphic network and analysis toolbox gnat https gnat riverscapes xyz index an arcgis python toolbox to label strahler stream orders strahler 1957 for the nhd strahler stream ordering begins at order 1 for the smallest river and increases to number n depending on how many stream junctions are observed in the basin we also projected strahler stream orders of the arcticdem modeled drainage networks onto sarns of the coleen river in alaska by creating a 100 m buffer area 4 results 4 1 comparison of sarns with nhd sarns are able to accurately model larger than 1st order nhd as 70 of nhd appear in a sarn buffer of width 50 m 1st order nhd are captured less well as 68 of nhd rivers do not appear within this 50 m buffer fig 5 and table 2 this performance is encouraging as nhd contains rivers much smaller than represented by our flow accumulation threshold additionally sarns have dd that is 71 of nhd and l max that is 73 of the nhd table 3 in addition to analyzing rivers at the reach scale we selected a sub basin 331 km2 of the coleen river to compare sarns with nhd at the catchment scale fig 6 a and b the sarn method extracts numerous small rivers and the sum river lengths of rivers of orders 2 4 are comparable to their nhd counterparts fig 6c in contrast the sum length of 1st order sarns is 60 shorter than that of 1st nhd while the sum length of 5th order sarns is 30 shorter this is because higher resolution nhd captures more 10 m rivers and its high order large rivers are more braided additionally the sum river lengths of both sarns and nhd are negatively correlated with stream order fig 6c which is consistent with a previous study downing et al 2012 4 2 drainage density analysis due to the finer spatial resolution of both sentinel 2 satellite images and arcticdem sarns are more continuous and contain more small rivers than the gsw grwl from glc 2017 and g3wbm global datasets figs 7 9 estimated dd values of the kotuy and coleen rivers are 0 34 km 1 and 0 57 km 1 respectively and these are 4 8 and 7 2 times greater respectively than the largest dd value of the other four hydrography data products but less than nhd fig 10 and table 3 our method applied to landsat larns also delineates a greater number of complete river networks figs 7 9 for example dd values of the larns of kotuy and coleen rivers are at least 3 2 and 4 6 times greater respectively than corresponding values for the four other landsat derived hydrography data products fig 10 and table 3 therefore existing hydrography datasets derived from landsat imagery could detect much smaller rivers if merged with dems amongst these existing hydrography data products the gsw yields a slightly higher dd than the other datasets fig 10 and table 3 consistent with a previous study aires et al 2018 however in areas covered with bare land and mountain shadows the gsw produces poor results figs 7c 8c and 9 as do the from glc 2017 figs 7e 8e and 9 the grwl based dd in the coleen river is lower than that in the kotuy river because grwl only captures main rivers in the coleen river figs 7d 8d and 10 surprisingly although the resolution of g3wbm is 90 m there is little difference between the resultant dd and those of the existing 30 m hydrography data products figs 7f 8f 9 10 and table 3 4 3 open water fraction analysis in contrast to drainage density open water fraction owf of our sarns is similar to the other datasets the owf values of the kotuy and coleen rivers are no less than 1 05 and 1 59 times greater respectively than those of the other four hydrography data products fig 10 and table 3 this is because owf is influenced primarily by the surface area of large rivers whereas smaller rivers 1 3 pixels wide contribute to dd consistent with allen and pavelsky 2015 larn owf is approximately 30 greater than sarn owf fig 10 because of the limitation in the landsat 8 imagery resolution it is difficult to distinguish the boundaries of large and small rivers from mixed pixels as a result all rivers that are narrower than 30 m were assigned a uniform width of 30 m leading to overestimation of river surface area 4 4 the longest connected river length analysis the sarn method extracts more small rivers and significantly improves river connectivity figs 7 8 and table 3 in the kotuy river the longest connected river length l max of sarns is 2 512 km and in the coleen river l max is 2 876 km the l max values of sarns in the kotuy and coleen rivers are at least 10 times greater than those of the global hydrography data products except grwl in the kotuy river but less than that of nhd table 3 gsw and grwl have higher l max values than other global hydrography data products in the kotuy and coleen rivers respectively table 3 however because gsw and grwl only extracted large rivers they have l max approximately 80 shorter than sarns therefore merging the arcticdem modeled drainage networks with sentinel mapped river networks can significantly improves river connectivity 4 5 river width analysis rivers as narrow as 10 m can be extracted from sentinel 2 images providing a fully complete river width histogram as compared with landsat derived width distributions fig 11 of the four global hydrography data products assessed here grwl provides the most continuous mapping of large river widths to assess the potential benefits of using higher resolution sentinel 2 imagery we selected a 2467 km2 sub basin of the kotuy river for comparison with grwl at the catchment scale fig 12 a sarns clearly contain more rivers that are less than 30 m wide while the grwl dataset only contains large rivers the river width of sarns positively correlates with stream order fig 12b three tributaries in this sub basin were selected from sarns and the relationship between the river width and the distance from the river basin outlet was plotted fig 12 sarns extract a higher number of small rivers with river width less than 30 m and show negative correlation r2 0 58 p 0 01 between river width and the distance from the river basin outlet fig 12d e and f no direct correlation between the river width and distance from the basin outlet is found in grwl fig 12c grwl overestimates the river widths that are less than 90 m failing to identify small rivers in mixed pixels accurately which is consistent with a previous study allen and pavelsky 2018 5 discussion this study merged 10 m resolution sentinel mapped rivers with arcticdem modeled rivers to extract complete and continuous river networks that included small rivers as narrow as 10 m as compared with the national hydrography dataset nhd sentinel arcticdem merged river networks sarns are accurate and consistent for greater than 1st order nhd table 2 shows that this agreement worsens as rivers get larger yet this may be due to a temporal mismatch by comparing nhd with historical landsat images we determined that most of the nhd for the coleen river were obtained before 1973 fig s1 at least 40 years prior to the 2017 sentinel 2 image used here the highly dynamic arctic alluvium coupled with increasing temperatures and thawing permafrost results in shifting thalwegs over this period creating inconsistencies between the sarns and nhd especially for 6th order nhd and larger table 2 this finding also suggests possible obsolescence of the nhd for mapping dynamic arctic rivers at least in the coleen river as compared with existing hydrography data products gsw grwl from glc 2017 and g3wbm produced from 30 m landsat series satellite imagery sarn drainage densities are at least 4 5 times larger than other evaluated hydrography data products fig 10 and table 3 and sarns contain much richer river width information 10 30 m fig 11 further our larns created by imposing our method on landsat imagery revel that existing hydrography data products do not fully utilize the ability of landsat images to detect narrow water bodies because of their necessary computational simplicity for global work and the limited availability of high resolution global dems merging visible nir satellite imagery with arcticdem modeled drainage networks better captures continuous small rivers especially eliminating gaps from mountain shadows and bare land to maintain connectivity finer resolution sarns yield higher drainage density than larns but sarns have lower owf than larns fig 10 we thus conclude that surface area of rivers and streams of larns is overestimated opposite to grwl the river width of sarns shows negative correlation r2 0 58 p 0 01 with the distance from the river basin outlet fig 12 because of the limitation in the landsat 8 imagery resolution it is difficult to distinguish the boundaries of large and small rivers from mixed pixels crapper 1980 lyons et al 2013 yamazaki et al 2015 clearly the use of sentinel 2 images contributed to solving mixed pixel problem delineating the boundaries of large rivers accurately and extracting small rivers that are 10 30 m wide the sarn method significantly improves river connectivity at the catchment scale the river networks of the gsw from glc 2017 and g3wbm datasets have low connectivity with gap segments occurring even in large rivers because these datasets utilize pixel based river extraction methods gong et al 2013 pekel et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2015 thus neglecting the adjacency relationship between continuous river channels merging sentinel 2 with arcticdem topographic information delineates river networks an order of magnitude more continuous than pixel based river network extractions alone this in turn can provide more information at a finer catchment scale and more correctly identify catchment properties like stream order stream length and other important factors figs 6 12 and table 3 we find three areas for improvement with the sarn method first some of the tundra close to river banks is difficult to remove because they are located within the river areas of interest future studies should seek a more effective method of removing tundra features located along river banks for example by generating 10 m resolution modified normalized difference water index mndwi images through swir band sharpening du et al 2016 second the presented sarn method requires use of several thresholds including a low global threshold of the processed sentinel 2 imagery to preserve the connectivity of small rivers a low accumulation area threshold of the arcticdem flow accumulation map that can cover the entire sentinel mapped river networks a low order river interest area threshold to remove non water features and a high ndwi global threshold to extract large rivers the applicability of the threshold values selected here to other locations remains untested third we examined only single sentinel 2 image here future work should incorporate multi temporal sentinel 2 satellite images in order to realize the dynamic monitoring of changes in river networks and to compensate for any lack in the temporal resolution of the nhd 6 conclusion in this paper we presented a methodology to effectively map continuous river networks from 10 m sentinel 2 imagery with arcticdem data at finer reach and catchment scales our sentinel arcticdem merged river networks sarns align well with nhd and their drainage densities are at least 4 5 larger than existing landsat derived hydrography data products in addition merging remotely sensed river networks with arcticdem modeled drainage networks significantly improves river connectivity with at least a ten fold increase over the other landsat derived hydrography data products the presented sarn methodology can be extended to open water extraction over the entire arctic to produce remotely sensed arctic river products growing availability of high resolution dems e g worlddem alongside 10 m sentinel 2 or even 3 5 m cubesat

5656,much attention has been recently focused on the direct hydrological effects dhes such as runoff yield and concentration of climate variability and land use cover change lucc however the influence of lucc on regional climate change and corresponding runoff change indirect hydrological effect ihe have rarely been assessed quantitatively this study employed the mann kendall test and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method to analyze linear and nonlinear trends in potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and runoff and their correlation in typical basin yihe river in eastern china during 1951 2013 this study presents a framework to quantify runoff change in a detection and attribution study based on the soil and water assessment tool swat and weather research and forecasting wrf model and it quantifies the effects of climate variability dhe and ihe of lucc 1990 2010 and other human activities on runoff the results indicate that 1 the annual pet in the yihe river basin had an increasing trend with a rate of 6 3 mm decade while the precipitation and runoff during the period 1951 2013 exhibited decreasing trends at rates of 26 6 mm decade a 0 05 and 0 16 108 m3 decade respectively 2 the runoff pet and precipitation had similar periodic at inter annual scales approximately 3 years and 6 years and inter decadal scales approximately 13 16 years the contribution rate of runoff to total change from the inter annual scale was the largest reaching 58 and those from the inter decadal scale and multi decadal scale were 6 and 11 respectively 3 the results also revealed that climate variability was likely to be the principle cause of an obvious decrease in runoff and the contribution rate was as high as 90 before the 1980s while declining to 66 3 in 1990 1999 furthermore dhe ihe and other human activities were responsible for 18 5 9 2 and 6 0 respectively of the runoff change in the 1990s it is worth noting that the percentage of downward runoff accounted for 35 8 and 21 3 from dhe and ihe respectively during 2000 2013 which implied that human activities have gradually become the dominant factors affecting runoff change with a contribution of 77 1 keywords runoff climate variability lucc indirect hydrological effect human activities 1 introduction given the background of increasing global climate variability and human activities many scholars have attempted to study the effect of climate fluctuation and human activities on runoff and have yielded substantial results ahn and merwade 2014 chen et al 2013 deng and chen 2017 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015a yang et al 2019 many detection and attribution methodologies have been employed to detect changes in climatic factors and other variables jiang et al 2015 jiang et al 2011 liu et al 2017 ye et al 2013 zhan et al 2014b for example many researchers hu et al 2012 yang and yang 2011 zhan et al 2014a zheng et al 2009 have used the elasticity method to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of temperature and evapotranspiration et to runoff changes wang et al 2012 proposed a new method the slope change ratio of the accumulative quantity and calculated the contributions of different factors to the runoff change in the huangfuchuan river basin brikowski 2015 adopted a multi parameter elasticity method to assess water availability in a changing climate e g in texas usa jiang et al 2015 employed the budyko type equations with time varying parameters to investigate the effects of climate factors and human activities on streamflow for the weihe river zhou et al 2016 adopted a new method to test the partitioned climate and catchment effect on runoff based on the budyko complementary relationship wang et al 2015b decoupled the relative impacts of precipitation et and human activity on the runoff changes in the songhua river basin using the slope change ratio of the accumulative quantity method evidently statistical methods such as the double mass curve water balance method elastic theory and budykoe equations were widely used to quantitatively distinguish the impact of climate change and human activities on water resources guo et al 2016 li et al 2016a li et al 2016c wang et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 zeng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 these methods are characterized by two points one is that they quantitatively assess the influence of precipitation and et on runoff the other is that the runoff change that was not caused by precipitation and et was attributed to the impact of human activities on the hydrological processes hence statistical methods can be adopted to effectively identify the climate and hydrology observation data but cannot fully reflect the effects of human activities such as lucc on hydrological change alongside these empirical methods hydrological modeling provides an important means for testing changes in runoff related to physical mechanisms thus it is widely used to assess the influence of climate fluctuation and human activities on water resources zang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 han et al 2019 for example variable infiltration capacity hydrological models can be adopted to quantitatively isolate the relative contributions that climate variability and human activities make to decadal streamflow changes in the jinghe basin located in northwest china chang et al 2016 zang et al 2013 evaluated the impacts of human activities and climate variability on water simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat for the heihe river basin these studies analyzed the effect of climate factors on water resources and estimated the direct impacts such as runoff yield and concentration of lucc on hydrological processes however the influence of other human activities including dam construction river diversion irrigation and other engineering and management practices on runoff has been ignored song et al 2013 indeed the direct hydrological effect dhe caused by lucc has failed to fully reflect the influence of human activities on water resources furthermore lucc may have impacts on climate variation yang and duan 2016 when it has an effect on hydrological processes we call it the indirect hydrological effect ihe of lucc nevertheless few researchers have considered both the dhe and the ihe of lucc however this information is important for improving water management strategies for every basin table 1 presents a summary of the relevant literature on the quantified effects of climate variability and lucc on runoff most scholars have analyzed the linear variation in runoff and climate factors before exploring the effects of climate and human activity on runoff change dong et al 2012 xu et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 however due to complex nonlinear climate and hydrological systems the inner relationship between climate factors and nonlinear trends of hydrological processes remains unclear the mode mixing issue of some methods such as empirical mode decomposition emd in signal analysis leads to a non unique decomposition process resulting in the loss of physical meaning for modal components qin et al 2018 however ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd can overcome this problem this method defines the true intrinsic mode function imf components as the mean of an ensemble of trials each consisting of a signal plus white noise of finite amplitude wu and huang 2009 thus the self adaptability of eemd has higher stability and consistency for decomposition results wu and huang 2009 eemd prevents defects in scale mixing and processes non linear and non stationary time series with high accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods such as moving averages singular spectrum analysis and empirical orthogonal functions bai et al 2015 liu et al 2016 qin et al 2018 the objectives of this paper were to 1 use empirical statistical methods to explore the linear and non linear trends of climate factors potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation and runoff and their relation at different time scales 2 use the swat model to assess climate contribution to changes in runoff and the dhe and 3 use wrf to assess the ihe other human activities were considered as left overs these three objectives provide the structural sub headings used the following sections methods results and discussion sections 3 5 respectively 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site in this study we chose the yihe river basin as a case study the yihe river is one of the largest tributaries of the yishusi water system in the huaihe river and originates from yiyuan county in shandong province fig 1 the river flows from yishui yinan mengyin pingyi tancheng counties into new yihe river in pi county in jiangsu province reaching yanwei port in the yellow sea gong 2014 the basin has a drainage area of 17 000 km2 and a length of 500 km the hilly region in the yihe basin occupies nearly 70 of the basin and plain accounts for approximately 30 the basin belongs to a warm temperate zone with a semi humid continental monsoon climate due to the alternating influence of continental air and maritime air it is characterized by distinct seasons hot summers and cold winters the mean annual rainfall is approximately 815 mm with the most precipitation occurring in summer and autumn over the past 20 years the yihe river basin had a population of 10 million moreover the per capita water resources were less than 1 6 of the national average and water shortages have become a bottleneck for the sustainable development of the social economy additionally the frequency of extreme weather events such as frequent rainstorms and extreme drought has increased remarkably dong et al 2014 li et al 2015 climate fluctuations and human activities in the basin have been identified as two primary causes of changes in water resources thus this study advances our understanding of the hydrological evolution mechanism affected by climate variability and human activity and is of important theoretical and realistic significance to the scientific formulation of water resource management strategies and the sustainable utilization of water resources in the yihe river basin 2 2 data processing in the wrf model the outer domains domains 1 and 2 of control and sensitivity are derived from the united states geological survey and have resolutions of 10 and 2 respectively for land use data the innermost domains domain 3 were extracted from the data center for resources and environmental sciences of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn and have 1 1 km resolution land use data after rearrangement recollection and reformatting in 2010 and 1990 measured data from meteorological stations in the study area were used to evaluate the controlled simulation results daily meteorological data were obtained from the stations at yanzhou yiyuan juxian and xuzhou fig 1 all 4 meteorological stations selected for this study were maintained following the standard of the national meteorological administration of china in the swat model the dem and lucc data were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the runoff data in each river were derived from the local hydrology bureaus the data on the soil properties in the study area were from related references sfss 1993 penman s 1948 formulation as provided by shuttleworth 1993 was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration ep of ep which donohue et al 2010 showed to be the most appropriate form of ep when considering a changing climate the penman formulation of ep is also a physically based form of ep meaning that all the key variables that govern the evaporative process are explicit in the formula mcvicar et al 2012 liu and mcvicar 2012 the ep is calculated as follows 1 e p e pr e pa Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n Œ≥ Œ¥ Œ≥ 6430 1 0 536 u 2 d Œª where ep is the potential evaporation mm day 1 and epr mm day 1 and epa mm day 1 represent the radiative and aerodynamic components of the penman equation respectively rn is the daily net radiation mj m 2 day 1 Œ¥ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 d is the vapor pressure deficit pa u2 is the daily average wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and Œª is the latent heat of vaporization of water 2 45 106 j kg 1 3 methods 3 1 the linear and nonlinear trends of runoff pet and precipitation first we used the mann kendall test to calculate the linear trends in runoff pet and precipitation and then used the eemd method to analyze their nonlinear trends the mann kendall non parametric statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was applied to detect linear trends in the pet runoff and precipitation time series li et al 2020 for a time series x x1 x2 xn in which n 10 the standard normal statistic zc is estimated by the mann kendall method the statistic zc follows the standard normal distribution at a 5 significance level the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if zc 1 96 a positive value of zc denotes an increasing trend and a negative value corresponds to a decreasing trend the mann kendall method is sensitive to autocorrelation so we adopt the method proposed by yue et al 2002 to remove lag 1 autocorrelation details of the method can be found in the literature yue et al 2002 the eemd method was developed from empirical mode decomposition emd emd is an effective method for non stationary series huang and wu 2008 each intrinsic mode function imf contains information from different time scales in a climate system corresponding to different climatic hierarchies however specific climate levels tend to be produced by the common or alternative action of physical factors therefore the steady imf decomposed by the runoff sequence can provide some guidance for runoff forecasting the main decomposition steps are as follows first determine the maxima of the original sequence y t and connect it with a cubic spline to obtain the maxima y max t and minima y min t of the upper and lower envelope sequence take the average of y max t and y min t for each moment and obtain the average envelope sequence m t y max t y min t 2 take the original sequence y t and subtract the average envelope sequence m t to obtain the sequence h t y t m t if the number of extreme and zero crossings are equal or differ at most by one and the mean value of the envelope m t tends to zero then it is the first intrinsic mode function imf1 otherwise take the h t as the original sequence and repeat the above steps until it meets the above definition the eemd algorithm is straightforward and can be described as follows wu and huang 2009 1 add a white noise series to the original signal 2 decompose the signal with added white noise into imfs using emd 3 repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different white noise series each time and 4 obtain the corresponding imf components of the decompositions and adopt the means of the ensemble corresponding to the imfs of the decompositions as the final result to ensure the reasonable results for imfs in this study we adopt the method recommended by rilling et al 2003 to define the criteria the method of stopping criteria for sifting are as follows 2 a t e max e min e max e min where emax emin are upper and lower envelopes respectively the criterion is based on two thresholds Œ∏ 1 0 05 Œ∏ 2 0 5 and a tolerance parameter Œ± 0 05 the sifting is iterated until a t Œ∏ 1 for some prescribed fraction 1 Œ± of the total duration while a t Œ∏ 2 for the remaining fraction in the emd method the fitting of upper and lower envelope lines is a problem so emd s improved algorithm called local emd was used in the eemd method for the detailed algorithm please refer to the reference rilling et al 2003 this algorithm can identify and isolate the local zones where the error remains large rilling et al 2003 which alleviates the defects of the previous emd in upper and lower envelope fitting to a certain extent wu and huang 2009 as a new self adaptive decomposition method eemd has been widely used in the study of nonlinear climate and hydrological changes ji et al 2014 franzke 2014 tan et al 2018 in this study we use the eemd to analyze the nonlinear trends of runoff pet and precipitation 3 2 the dhe of lucc and climate based on the swat model this study estimated the hydrological effect of climate and the dhe of lucc using the swat model according to the physical basis the swat model is considered to be an important indicator for reflecting the impact of climate factors such as precipitation et and lucc and other human factors on hydrological processes when lucc is given only as a variable the swat model can simulate the dhe of lucc including runoff yield and runoff concentration 3 q l u c c 1 q lucct q luccb where qlucc1 is the dhe of lucc in a certain period qlucct is the simulated runoff when lucc is seen only as a variable in the t period qluccb is the simulated runoff when lucc is considered as a variable in the baseline period this study selected the lucc in 1985 as the land use information in the baseline period this value was selected because data from 1985 were the earliest lucc data we were able to obtain according to our knowledge of the study area around that period the impact of human activities on runoff was minimal when climate factors were seen only as variables 4 q c 1 q ct q cb where qc1 is the runoff change caused by the total climate variability qct is the simulated runoff in the t period and qcb is the simulated runoff in the baseline period the total climate variability qc1 is separated into two parts climate variability caused by lucc and climate variability thus 5 q c q c 1 q l u c c 2 where qc is the effect of climate variability except the climate effect of lucc on runoff and qlucc2 is the influence of climate factors caused by lucc on runoff change called the indirect hydrological effect ihe as noted before the runoff change can be attributed to 6 q t q c q h 7 q h q l u c c 1 q l u c c 2 q other where qt is the total runoff change in the t period compared with the baseline period qh is the runoff change caused by human activities qother is the runoff change attributed to other human activities such as water conservancy facilities and water storage this study simulated the runoff in 1951 1990 1991 2000 2001 2008 and 2009 2013 based on the lucc data of 1985 1995 2005 and 2010 respectively 3 3 the ihe of lucc based on the wrf model the wrf model system is a new generation mesoscale numerical weather forecast model and data assimilation system there are highly modular transportable and efficient components in massively parallel computing environments numerous physics options in the model and advanced data assimilation systems that have been developed in tandem with the model itself huang et al 2016 the study employed wrf3 7 to analyze regional climate change caused by lucc and explored the ihe of lucc because precipitation was the leading climate factor influencing the runoff change in the study area gong 2014 this article mainly explores the regional precipitation changes caused by lucc based on the wrf model and its effect on runoff this study included controlled and sensitivity experiments lucc data in 2010 and atmospheric circulation field in 2013 were applied as controlled experiments to simulate the daily precipitation change characteristics during 2013 in the yihe river basin the center of the model domain is located at 35 8 n 118 1 e three nested domains with horizontal grid resolutions of 27 km domain 1 9 km domain 2 and 3 km domain 3 study area were composed of grids containing 27 36 49 67 and 91 130 cells respectively in reference to previous research dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and sensitivity tests we ran the wrf model with the following physics parameterization schemes lin physical scheme rrtm scheme dudhia scheme monin obukhove scheme noah land surface scheme ysu scheme and kain fritsche shallow convection new eta scheme initial and boundary conditions were derived from 1 1 national centers for environmental prediction final analysis reanalysis data provided by the national center for atmospheric research the sensitivity experiment involved the lucc in domain 3 from 1990 to 2010 except for the use of different lucc data all the simulations had the same setup and physical parameterization schemes so that any differences between the controlled and sensitivity experimental results reflected how the lucc in the study area affected regional climate variables in the last 20 years wrf can simulate the weather characteristics better in the short time rather than in the long time therefore it is assumed that lucc has a linear change trend over time and the precipitation variation caused by lucc is proportional to the actual precipitation thus changes in the regional climate caused by lucc can be calculated as follows 8 q l u c c 2 p t p 2013 p 2010 p 1990 2 0 t where qlucc2 is the lucc result in terms of the regional precipitation changes in the t year period pt is the average annual precipitation in the t year period such as 1990 1999 i e 9 year interval so t 9 p2013 is the actual precipitation in 2013 in the study area p2010 and p1990 are the simulated precipitation values in 2013 based on the lucc data of 2010 and 1990 respectively with all other parameters being the same in the wrf model thus p2010 p1990 can reflect precipitation changes caused by lucc over 20 years 4 results 4 1 the linear and nonlinear trends of runoff pet and precipitation the average annual runoff was 21 5 108m3 during 1951 2013 in the yihe river basin the maximum runoff was in 1963 fig 2 a up to 62 1 108 m3 while the minimum appeared in 1989 at only 1 45 108 m3 the mann kendall statistical test showed that runoff had a downward trend with a rate of 0 16 108 m3 decade however runoff exhibited different change trends in other time periods therefore this research attempted to explore its nonlinear characteristics at different time scales due to the complexity of the hydrological evolution process the eemd analysis results showed that the time series of runoff can be decomposed into four imf components imf1 4 and one trend component in the yihe river basin fig 2b imf1 2 reached the 95 confidence interval and imf3 4 reached the 90 confidence interval indicating that all the imfs were significant components the runoff changes clearly exhibited an inter annual scale quasi 3 2 and quasi 5 7 year inter decadal scale quasi 12 6 year and multi decadal scale quasi 31 4 year the variance contribution rate of runoff in the imf1 component to the overall runoff change was the largest reaching 36 this component was followed by imf2 and imf4 with contribution rates of 22 and 11 respectively while the contribution rate of the imf3 component was the lowest at only 6 thus the contribution rate of the nonlinear trend in runoff contributed 25 to the overall runoff change which indicates that the natural fluctuations in the hydrological system trend have an important impact on runoff variability the results also showed that the periods of runoff change were similar to those of pet and precipitation changes at different time scales during the period of 1951 2013 the annual pet exhibited a slight upward trend with a rate of 6 3 mm decade fig 3 a the annual precipitation is between 318 3 and 1017 1 mm and the perennial mean precipitation is 601 0 mm in the yihe river basin fig 3b in the past 60 years the precipitation showed a significant decreasing trend with a rate of 26 6 mm decade a 0 05 which was different from the obvious increase in precipitation observed in southern and northwestern china li et al 2016b wu et al 2018 the diagram revealed that there was more precipitation in the 1950s and precipitation decreased significantly after 1960 while precipitation increased slightly after 1990 but was obviously still lower than that in the 1950s the eemd analysis results show that pet and precipitation can be decomposed into four imf components imf1 4 and one trend component in the yihe river basin fig 4 imf1 2 reached the 90 confidence interval and imf3 4 reached the 80 confidence interval each imf component can reflect the characteristics of inherent vibration frequency and nonlinear trend of climate factors at different time scales and the periodical change of the climate system the pet changes have clearly exhibited an inter annual scale quasi 3 3 and quasi 5 7 year inter decadal scale quasi 15 8 year and multi decadal scale quasi 31 3 year the variance contribution rate of pet in the imf1 component to the overall pet change was the largest reaching 60 this component was followed by imf2 and imf3 with contribution rates of 10 and 19 respectively while the contribution rate of the imf4 component was the lowest at only 6 thus the contribution rate of the nonlinear trend in pet to the overall pet change was up to 5 in addition the precipitation changes have shown an inter annual scale quasi 2 9 and quasi 6 3 year inter decadal scale quasi 12 6 year and multi decadal scale quasi 53 5 year fig 4b the variance contribution rate of precipitation in the imf1 component to the overall precipitation change was the highest reaching 53 this component was followed by imf2 and imf3 with contribution rates of 24 and 8 respectively while the contribution rate of the imf4 component was the lowest at only 5 thus the nonlinear trend in precipitation contributed 10 to the overall precipitation change in 1951 2013 runoff and precipitation were closely linked and showed a significant positive correlation a 0 001 and the correlation coefficient was 0 79 table 2 from the perspective of each component the relationship between the runoff of imf1 and imf2 on an inter annual scale and precipitation decreased and the correlation coefficients were 0 61 and 0 54 respectively but were up to a level of significance of a 0 001 at the inter decadal imf3 and multi decadal imf4 scales the relationship between runoff and precipitation was closer and the correlation coefficients were as high as 0 88 and 0 98 respectively the changes showed significant synchronicity which illustrated that the effect of precipitation on runoff on inter decadal and multi decadal scales was significantly greater than that on inter annual scales from 1951 to 2013 the correlation coefficient between the average pet and runoff in the yihe river basin was 0 55 a 0 001 but its correlation was obviously lower than that between precipitation and runoff from the perspective of different time scales the correlation between pet and runoff in the imf1 and imf2 components were 0 52 and 0 51 respectively while the correlation in the imf3 component increased and the coefficient was 0 63 in particular the correlation coefficient 0 20 in the imf4 component was significantly lower than that in the other components indicating that the influence mechanism of the pet on runoff on inter annual inter decadal and multi decadal scales is significantly different 4 2 the dhe of lucc and climate based on the swat model according to the actual situation in the study area the lucc and other human activity intensities were relatively minor before 1990 while human activities intensified from 1990 over the last 20 years and have exerted increasing influence on the regional climate therefore we chose the land use types in 1990 and 2010 in the yihe river basin as a case study to explore the characteristics of lucc the main types of land cover in the study area are dry lands which covered 70 3 and 68 6 of the total area in 1990 and 2010 respectively and were followed by paddy land with coverages of 11 4 and 11 1 respectively and grassland and forestland with coverages of 5 4 to 7 2 respectively the coverage by other types was very small fig 5 the increase rates in land use types between 1990 and 2010 indicate that construction land shrank the most 177 followed by bare land and water areas which shrank by 106 and 31 respectively shrub land decreased by 11 while paddy land and dry land decreased by 2 8 and 2 5 respectively the changes in other land uses were very small therefore in the past 20 years 2 of land was converted from dry land to construction land 747 km2 and bare land 132 km2 fig 6 demonstrates the relation between simulated annual runoff and measured runoff during 1951 2013 in the study area the results illustrated that the correlation coefficient between the simulated values and measured values was 0 94 reaching a significance level of a 0 001 however there were certain error between the simulation values and the measured values because the average simulated runoff for many years was slightly lower than the measured runoff 2 0 108 m3 and the average error rate was 9 3 evidently this study and previous results gong 2014 show that swat hydrological models are strongly recommended for the research on hydrological processes in the study area due to the high precision of the runoff simulation the field investigation showed that the construction of reservoirs and other water conservancy facilities began in the middle of the 1960s and then the influence of human activities gradually increased over time therefore the average runoff from 1951 to 1959 was taken as the reference value to analyze the runoff change and its attribution in different decades the runoff depth in the yihe river basin decreased by 26 6 mm from 1960 to 1969 relative to that in the period of 1951 1959 which implied that climate change exerted a substantial influence on runoff while the contribution of human activities was only 4 9 table 3 apparently although some reservoirs were constructed in this period human activities had a negligible influence on hydrological processes from 1970 to 1979 the runoff depth in the yihe river basin decreased by 131 4 mm relative to that in the baseline period which was similar to that of the 1960s and the contribution rate of climate change was 96 5 in the 1980s a further reduction in runoff was detected in the yihe river basin human activities e g water conservancy facilities sharply affected runoff and the contribution to runoff was 9 2 however climate fluctuation was still the main driving factor affecting the runoff reduction the runoff depth in the yihe river basin decreased by 158 5 mm from 1990 to 1999 compared with that in the baseline period and the contribution rate of the climate fluctuation decreased by 66 3 the dhe of lucc contributed 18 5 to the runoff variation from 1990 to 1999 in 2000 2013 the climate fluctuation contributed only 22 9 to the runoff decrease while the dhe of lucc increased significantly with a contribution rate of 35 8 4 3 the ihe of lucc based on the wrf model fig 7 shows the relationship between daily precipitation and measured data for 1 4 7 and 10 months in 2013 based on wrf model simulations the results showed that the correlation between the daily simulated precipitation and the measured precipitation in different months reached the significance level of a 0 05 the correlation coefficient between the simulated and the measured values was as high as 0 91 in january fig 7a a 0 001 followed by that in april fig 7b a 0 001 and october fig 7d a 0 01 the correlation coefficients were 0 53 and 0 50 respectively while the simulated precision of daily precipitation in july was relatively low and the correlation coefficient was 0 41 fig 7c a 0 05 at the monthly scale the simulated total precipitation in january and april 2013 was slightly lower than the actual value based on the wrf model and the error rates were 4 8 and 14 3 respectively the simulated total precipitation in july and october was slightly higher and the error rates were 6 7 and 17 1 respectively at the annual scale the simulated total precipitation in 2013 was slightly higher than the measured value and the error rate was 5 1 overall the wrf model is reliable for simulating precipitation in the study area and can reflect the temporal and spatial variation in precipitation in 1990 1999 the ihe of lucc contributed 9 2 to runoff variation table 3 and the impact of other human activities on runoff variation was less at only 6 0 in 2000 2013 the ihe of lucc increased significantly and the contribution rate was 21 3 thus the contribution of other human activities to runoff change also significantly increased to 20 which may be closely related to the rapid socio economic development in the yihe river basin and lucc change represented by urbanization generally before the 1980s the climate fluctuation was the main driving factor affecting the surface runoff variation in the yihe river basin and the contribution rate was more than 90 while after 1990 the runoff reduction implied that climate change was not the main influencing factor affecting runoff instead human activities including lucc industrial and domestic water dam construction river diversion irrigation and other engineering and management practices may also be regarded as the main factors that modify the local hydrological cycles furthermore the temporal and spatial distribution of surface water resources especially the dhe and ihe of lucc increased significantly 5 discussion 5 1 the linear and nonlinear trends of runoff pet and precipitation the pet in the yihe river basin changed significantly in 1960 the annual average pet in the yihe river in the 1950s was 1012 mm obviously lower than that of 1176 mm in 1960 2013 this change is mainly because the average temperature in the 1950s was significantly lower than that after the 1960s tang and ren 2005 the climate and hydrological systems are complex non stationary and nonlinear systems with oscillations at different time scales and periods the latest research indicates that the decomposition results of the eemd method were more stable and avoided the defects of scale mixed processing of non stationary time series compared with the moving average wavelet analysis and the emd method bai et al 2015 qin et al 2018 the eemd method was used to decompose the precipitation pet and runoff in the yihe river basin from 1960 to 2013 and reflected the nonlinear changes at different time scales firstly the climate system itself can change at different time scales secondly the water cycle is not only affected by climate change but also feeds back into the climate system this feedback is also different on different timescales thus the variation in inter annual and inter decadal scales and the general trend of climate change were extracted in the time series which was conducive for clarifying the changes in climate change at different time scales in particular the relationships in different components of climate factors and runoff were obviously different we found that the pet had an increasing trend while the precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend in the study area in recent 60 years these changes will inevitably have a certain impact on the depth of groundwater and soil water but the extent to which groundwater and soil water changes over time affect runoff is unknown therefore the influence mechanism of the climate on runoff at inter annual inter decadal and multi decadal scales had significant differences and must be further studied this study and many other studies have shown that there is a significant correlation between runoff and precipitation at an interannual scale wang et al 2012 2013 this study also showed that the impacts of precipitation on runoff were more significant at a multi decadal scale than on an inter annual scale the reasons for these differences were as follows 1 the sources of runoff supply in the yihe river mainly include precipitation groundwater and a small amount of soil water at a long term scale climatic factors such as precipitation have a greater impact on groundwater than do other factors such as human activities mani et al 2016 therefore at multi interdecadal scales runoff is not only directly related to precipitation but also related to groundwater that is indirectly related to precipitation 2 at the interannual scale groundwater is relatively stable and the factors of human activities and climate fluctuations have a greater impact on runoff taylor et al 2013 therefore runoff is not only related to precipitation it is also related to other natural and human factors which causes runoff to have large interannual fluctuations 3 the interannual fluctuation in runoff has the highest contribution rate to its total change which indicates that the interannual variation in runoff contains the most physical meaning thus it is more affected meanwhile runoff contains the least amount of information at multi interdecadal scales and is mainly influenced by the main controlling factor precipitation while other factors such as human activities are relatively less affected for example in the decades before 1990 climatic factors were the main factors influencing the change in runoff based on the results of nonlinear decomposition in runoff pet and precipitation it can be seen that runoff evaporation and precipitation all have four modes and the change periods at inter annual approximately quasi 3 and quasi 6 year inter decadal approximately quasi 5 7 year and multi annual quasi 31 year scale scales are similar which indicates that there is an intrinsic connection between runoff and evaporation and precipitation therefore climate factors are the main cause of runoff changes during periods of weak human activity 5 2 the dhe of lucc and climate based on the swat model the per capita water resources of the yihe river basin are only 1 6 of the average in china with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization in the basin water consumption has increased substantially and the contradiction between the water supply and demand and the ecological environment has become increasingly prominent gong 2014 the upper limit for the development and utilization of water resources in river basins recognized internationally is 40 while the current utilization rate of surface water in the yihe river basin is 74 xue and tan 2011 therefore the sustainable use of water resources and the sustainable economic and social development in the yihe river basin are facing a severe test this study shows that after 2000 the conversion of cultivated land to construction land and bare land resulted in changes in production and convergence processes in the river basin resulting in a 35 8 reduction in surface runoff in the process of urbanization the regional climate has changed and precipitation has decreased further aggravating the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources in addition human activities such as the river basin industry domestic water consumption and water conservancy facilities contribute 20 to changes in water resources for example there is the world s longest 1135 m rubber dam in the yihe river it was completed in 1997 rubber dams will affect many water hydrological factors such as river level velocity flow and sediment content based on the above attribution analysis of surface runoff in the yihe river basin relevant departments must formulate corresponding strategies to alleviate the pressure caused by water shortages as much as possible thus promoting sustainable economic and social development this study shows that after 2000 the contribution rate of other human activities to runoff changes reached 20 which was related to the rapid economic and social development of the basin from 1961 to 1989 the economy in the yihe river basin developed slowly with an average annual gdp of only approximately 2 2 billion yuan however the economy developed rapidly after 1990 in 2000 the gdp of the basin was 24 8 billion yuan while the gdp increased rapidly and was up to 87 4 billion yuan in 2010 gong 2014 in addition the population was 3 89 million in the 1980s increased by 490 000 in the 1990s and increased to 4 53 million in the 2000s there has been a rapid social and economic development trend since 1990 after 2000 the impact of human activities such as industrial and agricultural water and residential water consumption on runoff has increased significantly this study shows that after 2000 the impact of human activities on runoff was larger than that of climate change this difference was because the total economic output was directly proportional to the consumption of water resources hao et al 2014 from 1961 to 1989 the total gdp in the yihe river basin was only 64 5 billion yuan and was 141 billion yuan in the 1990s while it was as high as 545 4 billion yuan in the 2000s gong 2014 for example in 2000 the total urban water supply in linyi city was 73 67 million cubic meters and was 102 85 million cubic meters in 2005 while the urban water supply increased rapidly to 217 15 million cubic meters in 2013 the water resources used by human activities before 1990 were relatively small after 2000 the urbanization process accelerated and the water consumption of human activities increased significantly the results indicated that swat can be applied to study hydrological processes in the study area but there is uncertainty runoff data were used to calibrate the relevant parameter of swat which inevitably caused error that damaged the precision of study results furthermore there are some spatial differences in soil properties in the study area zhang et al 2013 this causes changes in parameters related to the soil water movement thus field observed data will be used to calculate the relevant parameters of the hydrological model in further research the analysis showed that industrial and domestic water and water infrastructure have important impacts on hydrological processes however these data cannot be obtained in the study area thus this study cannot directly evaluate the impact of water infrastructure such as reservoirs or irrigation projects on runoff we should conduct a detailed investigation into water infrastructure to illustrate its impact on water resources 5 3 the ihe of lucc based on the wrf model after 2000 the ihe in the yihe river basin increased significantly and reached 21 3 which showed that the influence of lucc on the regional climate increased first with the rapid development of the economy the rates of land use change have increased since 2000 the rate of land use change after 2000 was 2 3 times faster than that before 2000 gong 2014 second due to the continuous expansion of the city scale the effects of urban heat islands have gradually increased additionally changes in other land types also showed similar trends lucc is one of the major driving factors affecting climate change the results showed that lucc caused the local climate to change significantly in the past 20 years based on the wrf model which had a large impact on runoff shao and zeng 2012 suggested that the impact of lucc on regional climate is robust the net geophysical impact of lucc results from the competition between the effects of change of albedo evapotranspiration efficiency and surface roughness thus the indirect hydrological effect should be considered and will be the key emphasis of future studies meanwhile the results illustrated that the precipitation effect caused by lucc can be canceled out when positive effects combine with negative effects which is consistent with previous research zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 thus a high temporal and spatial resolution should be used to reveal the impact of lucc on local climate change we chose to use 2010 lucc data mainly because that was the only lucc data available to us for that period it is also based on our consideration that the effect of lucc on climate may appear a few years after the change this study demonstrates that the effect of lucc is detectable with a three year lag unfortunately we do not have lucc data for multiple time points to further investigate this lag but this study provides empirical evidence of such a lag and may have reference value to other similar studies 6 conclusion in 1960 2013 the pet increased slightly with a rate of 6 3 mm decade while the precipitation showed a progressive decline a 0 05 with a rate of 26 6 mm decade meanwhile the pet and precipitation at inter annual 3 years and 6 years and decadal 13 16 years scales had similar periodic changes the runoff showed a downward trend during 1951 2013 with a rate of 0 16 108 m3 decade however before after 1976 the runoff showed a significant downward upward trend runoff also exhibited a nonlinear trend from the inter annual scale quasi 3 and quasi 6 year inter decadal scale quasi 13 year and multi decadal scale quasi 31 year the variance contribution rate of components from the inter annual scale was the largest reaching 58 and those from the inter decadal scale and multi decadal scale were 6 and 11 respectively which indicated that the inter annual change had a strong influence on the overall runoff change the results also implied that the effect of precipitation on runoff at scales of inter decadal and multi decadal variability was more important than that at the other scales which indicated that the impact mechanism of climate factors on runoff had obvious differences at different scales before the 1980s the climate fluctuation was the main factor affecting the runoff change and the contribution rate was above 90 from 1990 to 1999 the contribution rate of climate fluctuations decreased to 66 3 and the dhe and ihe of lucc contributed 18 5 and 9 2 to runoff change respectively other human activities including irrigation dam construction river diversion and other engineering and management practices contributed 6 0 to runoff change from 2000 to 2013 human activity gradually became the main driving force affecting runoff change 77 1 and the contribution rates of dhe and ihe of lucc to runoff changes were 35 8 and 21 3 respectively credit authorship contribution statement baofu li conceptualization data curation formal

5656,much attention has been recently focused on the direct hydrological effects dhes such as runoff yield and concentration of climate variability and land use cover change lucc however the influence of lucc on regional climate change and corresponding runoff change indirect hydrological effect ihe have rarely been assessed quantitatively this study employed the mann kendall test and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method to analyze linear and nonlinear trends in potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and runoff and their correlation in typical basin yihe river in eastern china during 1951 2013 this study presents a framework to quantify runoff change in a detection and attribution study based on the soil and water assessment tool swat and weather research and forecasting wrf model and it quantifies the effects of climate variability dhe and ihe of lucc 1990 2010 and other human activities on runoff the results indicate that 1 the annual pet in the yihe river basin had an increasing trend with a rate of 6 3 mm decade while the precipitation and runoff during the period 1951 2013 exhibited decreasing trends at rates of 26 6 mm decade a 0 05 and 0 16 108 m3 decade respectively 2 the runoff pet and precipitation had similar periodic at inter annual scales approximately 3 years and 6 years and inter decadal scales approximately 13 16 years the contribution rate of runoff to total change from the inter annual scale was the largest reaching 58 and those from the inter decadal scale and multi decadal scale were 6 and 11 respectively 3 the results also revealed that climate variability was likely to be the principle cause of an obvious decrease in runoff and the contribution rate was as high as 90 before the 1980s while declining to 66 3 in 1990 1999 furthermore dhe ihe and other human activities were responsible for 18 5 9 2 and 6 0 respectively of the runoff change in the 1990s it is worth noting that the percentage of downward runoff accounted for 35 8 and 21 3 from dhe and ihe respectively during 2000 2013 which implied that human activities have gradually become the dominant factors affecting runoff change with a contribution of 77 1 keywords runoff climate variability lucc indirect hydrological effect human activities 1 introduction given the background of increasing global climate variability and human activities many scholars have attempted to study the effect of climate fluctuation and human activities on runoff and have yielded substantial results ahn and merwade 2014 chen et al 2013 deng and chen 2017 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015a yang et al 2019 many detection and attribution methodologies have been employed to detect changes in climatic factors and other variables jiang et al 2015 jiang et al 2011 liu et al 2017 ye et al 2013 zhan et al 2014b for example many researchers hu et al 2012 yang and yang 2011 zhan et al 2014a zheng et al 2009 have used the elasticity method to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of temperature and evapotranspiration et to runoff changes wang et al 2012 proposed a new method the slope change ratio of the accumulative quantity and calculated the contributions of different factors to the runoff change in the huangfuchuan river basin brikowski 2015 adopted a multi parameter elasticity method to assess water availability in a changing climate e g in texas usa jiang et al 2015 employed the budyko type equations with time varying parameters to investigate the effects of climate factors and human activities on streamflow for the weihe river zhou et al 2016 adopted a new method to test the partitioned climate and catchment effect on runoff based on the budyko complementary relationship wang et al 2015b decoupled the relative impacts of precipitation et and human activity on the runoff changes in the songhua river basin using the slope change ratio of the accumulative quantity method evidently statistical methods such as the double mass curve water balance method elastic theory and budykoe equations were widely used to quantitatively distinguish the impact of climate change and human activities on water resources guo et al 2016 li et al 2016a li et al 2016c wang et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 zeng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 these methods are characterized by two points one is that they quantitatively assess the influence of precipitation and et on runoff the other is that the runoff change that was not caused by precipitation and et was attributed to the impact of human activities on the hydrological processes hence statistical methods can be adopted to effectively identify the climate and hydrology observation data but cannot fully reflect the effects of human activities such as lucc on hydrological change alongside these empirical methods hydrological modeling provides an important means for testing changes in runoff related to physical mechanisms thus it is widely used to assess the influence of climate fluctuation and human activities on water resources zang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 han et al 2019 for example variable infiltration capacity hydrological models can be adopted to quantitatively isolate the relative contributions that climate variability and human activities make to decadal streamflow changes in the jinghe basin located in northwest china chang et al 2016 zang et al 2013 evaluated the impacts of human activities and climate variability on water simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat for the heihe river basin these studies analyzed the effect of climate factors on water resources and estimated the direct impacts such as runoff yield and concentration of lucc on hydrological processes however the influence of other human activities including dam construction river diversion irrigation and other engineering and management practices on runoff has been ignored song et al 2013 indeed the direct hydrological effect dhe caused by lucc has failed to fully reflect the influence of human activities on water resources furthermore lucc may have impacts on climate variation yang and duan 2016 when it has an effect on hydrological processes we call it the indirect hydrological effect ihe of lucc nevertheless few researchers have considered both the dhe and the ihe of lucc however this information is important for improving water management strategies for every basin table 1 presents a summary of the relevant literature on the quantified effects of climate variability and lucc on runoff most scholars have analyzed the linear variation in runoff and climate factors before exploring the effects of climate and human activity on runoff change dong et al 2012 xu et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 however due to complex nonlinear climate and hydrological systems the inner relationship between climate factors and nonlinear trends of hydrological processes remains unclear the mode mixing issue of some methods such as empirical mode decomposition emd in signal analysis leads to a non unique decomposition process resulting in the loss of physical meaning for modal components qin et al 2018 however ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd can overcome this problem this method defines the true intrinsic mode function imf components as the mean of an ensemble of trials each consisting of a signal plus white noise of finite amplitude wu and huang 2009 thus the self adaptability of eemd has higher stability and consistency for decomposition results wu and huang 2009 eemd prevents defects in scale mixing and processes non linear and non stationary time series with high accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods such as moving averages singular spectrum analysis and empirical orthogonal functions bai et al 2015 liu et al 2016 qin et al 2018 the objectives of this paper were to 1 use empirical statistical methods to explore the linear and non linear trends of climate factors potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation and runoff and their relation at different time scales 2 use the swat model to assess climate contribution to changes in runoff and the dhe and 3 use wrf to assess the ihe other human activities were considered as left overs these three objectives provide the structural sub headings used the following sections methods results and discussion sections 3 5 respectively 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site in this study we chose the yihe river basin as a case study the yihe river is one of the largest tributaries of the yishusi water system in the huaihe river and originates from yiyuan county in shandong province fig 1 the river flows from yishui yinan mengyin pingyi tancheng counties into new yihe river in pi county in jiangsu province reaching yanwei port in the yellow sea gong 2014 the basin has a drainage area of 17 000 km2 and a length of 500 km the hilly region in the yihe basin occupies nearly 70 of the basin and plain accounts for approximately 30 the basin belongs to a warm temperate zone with a semi humid continental monsoon climate due to the alternating influence of continental air and maritime air it is characterized by distinct seasons hot summers and cold winters the mean annual rainfall is approximately 815 mm with the most precipitation occurring in summer and autumn over the past 20 years the yihe river basin had a population of 10 million moreover the per capita water resources were less than 1 6 of the national average and water shortages have become a bottleneck for the sustainable development of the social economy additionally the frequency of extreme weather events such as frequent rainstorms and extreme drought has increased remarkably dong et al 2014 li et al 2015 climate fluctuations and human activities in the basin have been identified as two primary causes of changes in water resources thus this study advances our understanding of the hydrological evolution mechanism affected by climate variability and human activity and is of important theoretical and realistic significance to the scientific formulation of water resource management strategies and the sustainable utilization of water resources in the yihe river basin 2 2 data processing in the wrf model the outer domains domains 1 and 2 of control and sensitivity are derived from the united states geological survey and have resolutions of 10 and 2 respectively for land use data the innermost domains domain 3 were extracted from the data center for resources and environmental sciences of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn and have 1 1 km resolution land use data after rearrangement recollection and reformatting in 2010 and 1990 measured data from meteorological stations in the study area were used to evaluate the controlled simulation results daily meteorological data were obtained from the stations at yanzhou yiyuan juxian and xuzhou fig 1 all 4 meteorological stations selected for this study were maintained following the standard of the national meteorological administration of china in the swat model the dem and lucc data were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the runoff data in each river were derived from the local hydrology bureaus the data on the soil properties in the study area were from related references sfss 1993 penman s 1948 formulation as provided by shuttleworth 1993 was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration ep of ep which donohue et al 2010 showed to be the most appropriate form of ep when considering a changing climate the penman formulation of ep is also a physically based form of ep meaning that all the key variables that govern the evaporative process are explicit in the formula mcvicar et al 2012 liu and mcvicar 2012 the ep is calculated as follows 1 e p e pr e pa Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n Œ≥ Œ¥ Œ≥ 6430 1 0 536 u 2 d Œª where ep is the potential evaporation mm day 1 and epr mm day 1 and epa mm day 1 represent the radiative and aerodynamic components of the penman equation respectively rn is the daily net radiation mj m 2 day 1 Œ¥ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 d is the vapor pressure deficit pa u2 is the daily average wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and Œª is the latent heat of vaporization of water 2 45 106 j kg 1 3 methods 3 1 the linear and nonlinear trends of runoff pet and precipitation first we used the mann kendall test to calculate the linear trends in runoff pet and precipitation and then used the eemd method to analyze their nonlinear trends the mann kendall non parametric statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was applied to detect linear trends in the pet runoff and precipitation time series li et al 2020 for a time series x x1 x2 xn in which n 10 the standard normal statistic zc is estimated by the mann kendall method the statistic zc follows the standard normal distribution at a 5 significance level the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if zc 1 96 a positive value of zc denotes an increasing trend and a negative value corresponds to a decreasing trend the mann kendall method is sensitive to autocorrelation so we adopt the method proposed by yue et al 2002 to remove lag 1 autocorrelation details of the method can be found in the literature yue et al 2002 the eemd method was developed from empirical mode decomposition emd emd is an effective method for non stationary series huang and wu 2008 each intrinsic mode function imf contains information from different time scales in a climate system corresponding to different climatic hierarchies however specific climate levels tend to be produced by the common or alternative action of physical factors therefore the steady imf decomposed by the runoff sequence can provide some guidance for runoff forecasting the main decomposition steps are as follows first determine the maxima of the original sequence y t and connect it with a cubic spline to obtain the maxima y max t and minima y min t of the upper and lower envelope sequence take the average of y max t and y min t for each moment and obtain the average envelope sequence m t y max t y min t 2 take the original sequence y t and subtract the average envelope sequence m t to obtain the sequence h t y t m t if the number of extreme and zero crossings are equal or differ at most by one and the mean value of the envelope m t tends to zero then it is the first intrinsic mode function imf1 otherwise take the h t as the original sequence and repeat the above steps until it meets the above definition the eemd algorithm is straightforward and can be described as follows wu and huang 2009 1 add a white noise series to the original signal 2 decompose the signal with added white noise into imfs using emd 3 repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different white noise series each time and 4 obtain the corresponding imf components of the decompositions and adopt the means of the ensemble corresponding to the imfs of the decompositions as the final result to ensure the reasonable results for imfs in this study we adopt the method recommended by rilling et al 2003 to define the criteria the method of stopping criteria for sifting are as follows 2 a t e max e min e max e min where emax emin are upper and lower envelopes respectively the criterion is based on two thresholds Œ∏ 1 0 05 Œ∏ 2 0 5 and a tolerance parameter Œ± 0 05 the sifting is iterated until a t Œ∏ 1 for some prescribed fraction 1 Œ± of the total duration while a t Œ∏ 2 for the remaining fraction in the emd method the fitting of upper and lower envelope lines is a problem so emd s improved algorithm called local emd was used in the eemd method for the detailed algorithm please refer to the reference rilling et al 2003 this algorithm can identify and isolate the local zones where the error remains large rilling et al 2003 which alleviates the defects of the previous emd in upper and lower envelope fitting to a certain extent wu and huang 2009 as a new self adaptive decomposition method eemd has been widely used in the study of nonlinear climate and hydrological changes ji et al 2014 franzke 2014 tan et al 2018 in this study we use the eemd to analyze the nonlinear trends of runoff pet and precipitation 3 2 the dhe of lucc and climate based on the swat model this study estimated the hydrological effect of climate and the dhe of lucc using the swat model according to the physical basis the swat model is considered to be an important indicator for reflecting the impact of climate factors such as precipitation et and lucc and other human factors on hydrological processes when lucc is given only as a variable the swat model can simulate the dhe of lucc including runoff yield and runoff concentration 3 q l u c c 1 q lucct q luccb where qlucc1 is the dhe of lucc in a certain period qlucct is the simulated runoff when lucc is seen only as a variable in the t period qluccb is the simulated runoff when lucc is considered as a variable in the baseline period this study selected the lucc in 1985 as the land use information in the baseline period this value was selected because data from 1985 were the earliest lucc data we were able to obtain according to our knowledge of the study area around that period the impact of human activities on runoff was minimal when climate factors were seen only as variables 4 q c 1 q ct q cb where qc1 is the runoff change caused by the total climate variability qct is the simulated runoff in the t period and qcb is the simulated runoff in the baseline period the total climate variability qc1 is separated into two parts climate variability caused by lucc and climate variability thus 5 q c q c 1 q l u c c 2 where qc is the effect of climate variability except the climate effect of lucc on runoff and qlucc2 is the influence of climate factors caused by lucc on runoff change called the indirect hydrological effect ihe as noted before the runoff change can be attributed to 6 q t q c q h 7 q h q l u c c 1 q l u c c 2 q other where qt is the total runoff change in the t period compared with the baseline period qh is the runoff change caused by human activities qother is the runoff change attributed to other human activities such as water conservancy facilities and water storage this study simulated the runoff in 1951 1990 1991 2000 2001 2008 and 2009 2013 based on the lucc data of 1985 1995 2005 and 2010 respectively 3 3 the ihe of lucc based on the wrf model the wrf model system is a new generation mesoscale numerical weather forecast model and data assimilation system there are highly modular transportable and efficient components in massively parallel computing environments numerous physics options in the model and advanced data assimilation systems that have been developed in tandem with the model itself huang et al 2016 the study employed wrf3 7 to analyze regional climate change caused by lucc and explored the ihe of lucc because precipitation was the leading climate factor influencing the runoff change in the study area gong 2014 this article mainly explores the regional precipitation changes caused by lucc based on the wrf model and its effect on runoff this study included controlled and sensitivity experiments lucc data in 2010 and atmospheric circulation field in 2013 were applied as controlled experiments to simulate the daily precipitation change characteristics during 2013 in the yihe river basin the center of the model domain is located at 35 8 n 118 1 e three nested domains with horizontal grid resolutions of 27 km domain 1 9 km domain 2 and 3 km domain 3 study area were composed of grids containing 27 36 49 67 and 91 130 cells respectively in reference to previous research dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and sensitivity tests we ran the wrf model with the following physics parameterization schemes lin physical scheme rrtm scheme dudhia scheme monin obukhove scheme noah land surface scheme ysu scheme and kain fritsche shallow convection new eta scheme initial and boundary conditions were derived from 1 1 national centers for environmental prediction final analysis reanalysis data provided by the national center for atmospheric research the sensitivity experiment involved the lucc in domain 3 from 1990 to 2010 except for the use of different lucc data all the simulations had the same setup and physical parameterization schemes so that any differences between the controlled and sensitivity experimental results reflected how the lucc in the study area affected regional climate variables in the last 20 years wrf can simulate the weather characteristics better in the short time rather than in the long time therefore it is assumed that lucc has a linear change trend over time and the precipitation variation caused by lucc is proportional to the actual precipitation thus changes in the regional climate caused by lucc can be calculated as follows 8 q l u c c 2 p t p 2013 p 2010 p 1990 2 0 t where qlucc2 is the lucc result in terms of the regional precipitation changes in the t year period pt is the average annual precipitation in the t year period such as 1990 1999 i e 9 year interval so t 9 p2013 is the actual precipitation in 2013 in the study area p2010 and p1990 are the simulated precipitation values in 2013 based on the lucc data of 2010 and 1990 respectively with all other parameters being the same in the wrf model thus p2010 p1990 can reflect precipitation changes caused by lucc over 20 years 4 results 4 1 the linear and nonlinear trends of runoff pet and precipitation the average annual runoff was 21 5 108m3 during 1951 2013 in the yihe river basin the maximum runoff was in 1963 fig 2 a up to 62 1 108 m3 while the minimum appeared in 1989 at only 1 45 108 m3 the mann kendall statistical test showed that runoff had a downward trend with a rate of 0 16 108 m3 decade however runoff exhibited different change trends in other time periods therefore this research attempted to explore its nonlinear characteristics at different time scales due to the complexity of the hydrological evolution process the eemd analysis results showed that the time series of runoff can be decomposed into four imf components imf1 4 and one trend component in the yihe river basin fig 2b imf1 2 reached the 95 confidence interval and imf3 4 reached the 90 confidence interval indicating that all the imfs were significant components the runoff changes clearly exhibited an inter annual scale quasi 3 2 and quasi 5 7 year inter decadal scale quasi 12 6 year and multi decadal scale quasi 31 4 year the variance contribution rate of runoff in the imf1 component to the overall runoff change was the largest reaching 36 this component was followed by imf2 and imf4 with contribution rates of 22 and 11 respectively while the contribution rate of the imf3 component was the lowest at only 6 thus the contribution rate of the nonlinear trend in runoff contributed 25 to the overall runoff change which indicates that the natural fluctuations in the hydrological system trend have an important impact on runoff variability the results also showed that the periods of runoff change were similar to those of pet and precipitation changes at different time scales during the period of 1951 2013 the annual pet exhibited a slight upward trend with a rate of 6 3 mm decade fig 3 a the annual precipitation is between 318 3 and 1017 1 mm and the perennial mean precipitation is 601 0 mm in the yihe river basin fig 3b in the past 60 years the precipitation showed a significant decreasing trend with a rate of 26 6 mm decade a 0 05 which was different from the obvious increase in precipitation observed in southern and northwestern china li et al 2016b wu et al 2018 the diagram revealed that there was more precipitation in the 1950s and precipitation decreased significantly after 1960 while precipitation increased slightly after 1990 but was obviously still lower than that in the 1950s the eemd analysis results show that pet and precipitation can be decomposed into four imf components imf1 4 and one trend component in the yihe river basin fig 4 imf1 2 reached the 90 confidence interval and imf3 4 reached the 80 confidence interval each imf component can reflect the characteristics of inherent vibration frequency and nonlinear trend of climate factors at different time scales and the periodical change of the climate system the pet changes have clearly exhibited an inter annual scale quasi 3 3 and quasi 5 7 year inter decadal scale quasi 15 8 year and multi decadal scale quasi 31 3 year the variance contribution rate of pet in the imf1 component to the overall pet change was the largest reaching 60 this component was followed by imf2 and imf3 with contribution rates of 10 and 19 respectively while the contribution rate of the imf4 component was the lowest at only 6 thus the contribution rate of the nonlinear trend in pet to the overall pet change was up to 5 in addition the precipitation changes have shown an inter annual scale quasi 2 9 and quasi 6 3 year inter decadal scale quasi 12 6 year and multi decadal scale quasi 53 5 year fig 4b the variance contribution rate of precipitation in the imf1 component to the overall precipitation change was the highest reaching 53 this component was followed by imf2 and imf3 with contribution rates of 24 and 8 respectively while the contribution rate of the imf4 component was the lowest at only 5 thus the nonlinear trend in precipitation contributed 10 to the overall precipitation change in 1951 2013 runoff and precipitation were closely linked and showed a significant positive correlation a 0 001 and the correlation coefficient was 0 79 table 2 from the perspective of each component the relationship between the runoff of imf1 and imf2 on an inter annual scale and precipitation decreased and the correlation coefficients were 0 61 and 0 54 respectively but were up to a level of significance of a 0 001 at the inter decadal imf3 and multi decadal imf4 scales the relationship between runoff and precipitation was closer and the correlation coefficients were as high as 0 88 and 0 98 respectively the changes showed significant synchronicity which illustrated that the effect of precipitation on runoff on inter decadal and multi decadal scales was significantly greater than that on inter annual scales from 1951 to 2013 the correlation coefficient between the average pet and runoff in the yihe river basin was 0 55 a 0 001 but its correlation was obviously lower than that between precipitation and runoff from the perspective of different time scales the correlation between pet and runoff in the imf1 and imf2 components were 0 52 and 0 51 respectively while the correlation in the imf3 component increased and the coefficient was 0 63 in particular the correlation coefficient 0 20 in the imf4 component was significantly lower than that in the other components indicating that the influence mechanism of the pet on runoff on inter annual inter decadal and multi decadal scales is significantly different 4 2 the dhe of lucc and climate based on the swat model according to the actual situation in the study area the lucc and other human activity intensities were relatively minor before 1990 while human activities intensified from 1990 over the last 20 years and have exerted increasing influence on the regional climate therefore we chose the land use types in 1990 and 2010 in the yihe river basin as a case study to explore the characteristics of lucc the main types of land cover in the study area are dry lands which covered 70 3 and 68 6 of the total area in 1990 and 2010 respectively and were followed by paddy land with coverages of 11 4 and 11 1 respectively and grassland and forestland with coverages of 5 4 to 7 2 respectively the coverage by other types was very small fig 5 the increase rates in land use types between 1990 and 2010 indicate that construction land shrank the most 177 followed by bare land and water areas which shrank by 106 and 31 respectively shrub land decreased by 11 while paddy land and dry land decreased by 2 8 and 2 5 respectively the changes in other land uses were very small therefore in the past 20 years 2 of land was converted from dry land to construction land 747 km2 and bare land 132 km2 fig 6 demonstrates the relation between simulated annual runoff and measured runoff during 1951 2013 in the study area the results illustrated that the correlation coefficient between the simulated values and measured values was 0 94 reaching a significance level of a 0 001 however there were certain error between the simulation values and the measured values because the average simulated runoff for many years was slightly lower than the measured runoff 2 0 108 m3 and the average error rate was 9 3 evidently this study and previous results gong 2014 show that swat hydrological models are strongly recommended for the research on hydrological processes in the study area due to the high precision of the runoff simulation the field investigation showed that the construction of reservoirs and other water conservancy facilities began in the middle of the 1960s and then the influence of human activities gradually increased over time therefore the average runoff from 1951 to 1959 was taken as the reference value to analyze the runoff change and its attribution in different decades the runoff depth in the yihe river basin decreased by 26 6 mm from 1960 to 1969 relative to that in the period of 1951 1959 which implied that climate change exerted a substantial influence on runoff while the contribution of human activities was only 4 9 table 3 apparently although some reservoirs were constructed in this period human activities had a negligible influence on hydrological processes from 1970 to 1979 the runoff depth in the yihe river basin decreased by 131 4 mm relative to that in the baseline period which was similar to that of the 1960s and the contribution rate of climate change was 96 5 in the 1980s a further reduction in runoff was detected in the yihe river basin human activities e g water conservancy facilities sharply affected runoff and the contribution to runoff was 9 2 however climate fluctuation was still the main driving factor affecting the runoff reduction the runoff depth in the yihe river basin decreased by 158 5 mm from 1990 to 1999 compared with that in the baseline period and the contribution rate of the climate fluctuation decreased by 66 3 the dhe of lucc contributed 18 5 to the runoff variation from 1990 to 1999 in 2000 2013 the climate fluctuation contributed only 22 9 to the runoff decrease while the dhe of lucc increased significantly with a contribution rate of 35 8 4 3 the ihe of lucc based on the wrf model fig 7 shows the relationship between daily precipitation and measured data for 1 4 7 and 10 months in 2013 based on wrf model simulations the results showed that the correlation between the daily simulated precipitation and the measured precipitation in different months reached the significance level of a 0 05 the correlation coefficient between the simulated and the measured values was as high as 0 91 in january fig 7a a 0 001 followed by that in april fig 7b a 0 001 and october fig 7d a 0 01 the correlation coefficients were 0 53 and 0 50 respectively while the simulated precision of daily precipitation in july was relatively low and the correlation coefficient was 0 41 fig 7c a 0 05 at the monthly scale the simulated total precipitation in january and april 2013 was slightly lower than the actual value based on the wrf model and the error rates were 4 8 and 14 3 respectively the simulated total precipitation in july and october was slightly higher and the error rates were 6 7 and 17 1 respectively at the annual scale the simulated total precipitation in 2013 was slightly higher than the measured value and the error rate was 5 1 overall the wrf model is reliable for simulating precipitation in the study area and can reflect the temporal and spatial variation in precipitation in 1990 1999 the ihe of lucc contributed 9 2 to runoff variation table 3 and the impact of other human activities on runoff variation was less at only 6 0 in 2000 2013 the ihe of lucc increased significantly and the contribution rate was 21 3 thus the contribution of other human activities to runoff change also significantly increased to 20 which may be closely related to the rapid socio economic development in the yihe river basin and lucc change represented by urbanization generally before the 1980s the climate fluctuation was the main driving factor affecting the surface runoff variation in the yihe river basin and the contribution rate was more than 90 while after 1990 the runoff reduction implied that climate change was not the main influencing factor affecting runoff instead human activities including lucc industrial and domestic water dam construction river diversion irrigation and other engineering and management practices may also be regarded as the main factors that modify the local hydrological cycles furthermore the temporal and spatial distribution of surface water resources especially the dhe and ihe of lucc increased significantly 5 discussion 5 1 the linear and nonlinear trends of runoff pet and precipitation the pet in the yihe river basin changed significantly in 1960 the annual average pet in the yihe river in the 1950s was 1012 mm obviously lower than that of 1176 mm in 1960 2013 this change is mainly because the average temperature in the 1950s was significantly lower than that after the 1960s tang and ren 2005 the climate and hydrological systems are complex non stationary and nonlinear systems with oscillations at different time scales and periods the latest research indicates that the decomposition results of the eemd method were more stable and avoided the defects of scale mixed processing of non stationary time series compared with the moving average wavelet analysis and the emd method bai et al 2015 qin et al 2018 the eemd method was used to decompose the precipitation pet and runoff in the yihe river basin from 1960 to 2013 and reflected the nonlinear changes at different time scales firstly the climate system itself can change at different time scales secondly the water cycle is not only affected by climate change but also feeds back into the climate system this feedback is also different on different timescales thus the variation in inter annual and inter decadal scales and the general trend of climate change were extracted in the time series which was conducive for clarifying the changes in climate change at different time scales in particular the relationships in different components of climate factors and runoff were obviously different we found that the pet had an increasing trend while the precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend in the study area in recent 60 years these changes will inevitably have a certain impact on the depth of groundwater and soil water but the extent to which groundwater and soil water changes over time affect runoff is unknown therefore the influence mechanism of the climate on runoff at inter annual inter decadal and multi decadal scales had significant differences and must be further studied this study and many other studies have shown that there is a significant correlation between runoff and precipitation at an interannual scale wang et al 2012 2013 this study also showed that the impacts of precipitation on runoff were more significant at a multi decadal scale than on an inter annual scale the reasons for these differences were as follows 1 the sources of runoff supply in the yihe river mainly include precipitation groundwater and a small amount of soil water at a long term scale climatic factors such as precipitation have a greater impact on groundwater than do other factors such as human activities mani et al 2016 therefore at multi interdecadal scales runoff is not only directly related to precipitation but also related to groundwater that is indirectly related to precipitation 2 at the interannual scale groundwater is relatively stable and the factors of human activities and climate fluctuations have a greater impact on runoff taylor et al 2013 therefore runoff is not only related to precipitation it is also related to other natural and human factors which causes runoff to have large interannual fluctuations 3 the interannual fluctuation in runoff has the highest contribution rate to its total change which indicates that the interannual variation in runoff contains the most physical meaning thus it is more affected meanwhile runoff contains the least amount of information at multi interdecadal scales and is mainly influenced by the main controlling factor precipitation while other factors such as human activities are relatively less affected for example in the decades before 1990 climatic factors were the main factors influencing the change in runoff based on the results of nonlinear decomposition in runoff pet and precipitation it can be seen that runoff evaporation and precipitation all have four modes and the change periods at inter annual approximately quasi 3 and quasi 6 year inter decadal approximately quasi 5 7 year and multi annual quasi 31 year scale scales are similar which indicates that there is an intrinsic connection between runoff and evaporation and precipitation therefore climate factors are the main cause of runoff changes during periods of weak human activity 5 2 the dhe of lucc and climate based on the swat model the per capita water resources of the yihe river basin are only 1 6 of the average in china with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization in the basin water consumption has increased substantially and the contradiction between the water supply and demand and the ecological environment has become increasingly prominent gong 2014 the upper limit for the development and utilization of water resources in river basins recognized internationally is 40 while the current utilization rate of surface water in the yihe river basin is 74 xue and tan 2011 therefore the sustainable use of water resources and the sustainable economic and social development in the yihe river basin are facing a severe test this study shows that after 2000 the conversion of cultivated land to construction land and bare land resulted in changes in production and convergence processes in the river basin resulting in a 35 8 reduction in surface runoff in the process of urbanization the regional climate has changed and precipitation has decreased further aggravating the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources in addition human activities such as the river basin industry domestic water consumption and water conservancy facilities contribute 20 to changes in water resources for example there is the world s longest 1135 m rubber dam in the yihe river it was completed in 1997 rubber dams will affect many water hydrological factors such as river level velocity flow and sediment content based on the above attribution analysis of surface runoff in the yihe river basin relevant departments must formulate corresponding strategies to alleviate the pressure caused by water shortages as much as possible thus promoting sustainable economic and social development this study shows that after 2000 the contribution rate of other human activities to runoff changes reached 20 which was related to the rapid economic and social development of the basin from 1961 to 1989 the economy in the yihe river basin developed slowly with an average annual gdp of only approximately 2 2 billion yuan however the economy developed rapidly after 1990 in 2000 the gdp of the basin was 24 8 billion yuan while the gdp increased rapidly and was up to 87 4 billion yuan in 2010 gong 2014 in addition the population was 3 89 million in the 1980s increased by 490 000 in the 1990s and increased to 4 53 million in the 2000s there has been a rapid social and economic development trend since 1990 after 2000 the impact of human activities such as industrial and agricultural water and residential water consumption on runoff has increased significantly this study shows that after 2000 the impact of human activities on runoff was larger than that of climate change this difference was because the total economic output was directly proportional to the consumption of water resources hao et al 2014 from 1961 to 1989 the total gdp in the yihe river basin was only 64 5 billion yuan and was 141 billion yuan in the 1990s while it was as high as 545 4 billion yuan in the 2000s gong 2014 for example in 2000 the total urban water supply in linyi city was 73 67 million cubic meters and was 102 85 million cubic meters in 2005 while the urban water supply increased rapidly to 217 15 million cubic meters in 2013 the water resources used by human activities before 1990 were relatively small after 2000 the urbanization process accelerated and the water consumption of human activities increased significantly the results indicated that swat can be applied to study hydrological processes in the study area but there is uncertainty runoff data were used to calibrate the relevant parameter of swat which inevitably caused error that damaged the precision of study results furthermore there are some spatial differences in soil properties in the study area zhang et al 2013 this causes changes in parameters related to the soil water movement thus field observed data will be used to calculate the relevant parameters of the hydrological model in further research the analysis showed that industrial and domestic water and water infrastructure have important impacts on hydrological processes however these data cannot be obtained in the study area thus this study cannot directly evaluate the impact of water infrastructure such as reservoirs or irrigation projects on runoff we should conduct a detailed investigation into water infrastructure to illustrate its impact on water resources 5 3 the ihe of lucc based on the wrf model after 2000 the ihe in the yihe river basin increased significantly and reached 21 3 which showed that the influence of lucc on the regional climate increased first with the rapid development of the economy the rates of land use change have increased since 2000 the rate of land use change after 2000 was 2 3 times faster than that before 2000 gong 2014 second due to the continuous expansion of the city scale the effects of urban heat islands have gradually increased additionally changes in other land types also showed similar trends lucc is one of the major driving factors affecting climate change the results showed that lucc caused the local climate to change significantly in the past 20 years based on the wrf model which had a large impact on runoff shao and zeng 2012 suggested that the impact of lucc on regional climate is robust the net geophysical impact of lucc results from the competition between the effects of change of albedo evapotranspiration efficiency and surface roughness thus the indirect hydrological effect should be considered and will be the key emphasis of future studies meanwhile the results illustrated that the precipitation effect caused by lucc can be canceled out when positive effects combine with negative effects which is consistent with previous research zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 thus a high temporal and spatial resolution should be used to reveal the impact of lucc on local climate change we chose to use 2010 lucc data mainly because that was the only lucc data available to us for that period it is also based on our consideration that the effect of lucc on climate may appear a few years after the change this study demonstrates that the effect of lucc is detectable with a three year lag unfortunately we do not have lucc data for multiple time points to further investigate this lag but this study provides empirical evidence of such a lag and may have reference value to other similar studies 6 conclusion in 1960 2013 the pet increased slightly with a rate of 6 3 mm decade while the precipitation showed a progressive decline a 0 05 with a rate of 26 6 mm decade meanwhile the pet and precipitation at inter annual 3 years and 6 years and decadal 13 16 years scales had similar periodic changes the runoff showed a downward trend during 1951 2013 with a rate of 0 16 108 m3 decade however before after 1976 the runoff showed a significant downward upward trend runoff also exhibited a nonlinear trend from the inter annual scale quasi 3 and quasi 6 year inter decadal scale quasi 13 year and multi decadal scale quasi 31 year the variance contribution rate of components from the inter annual scale was the largest reaching 58 and those from the inter decadal scale and multi decadal scale were 6 and 11 respectively which indicated that the inter annual change had a strong influence on the overall runoff change the results also implied that the effect of precipitation on runoff at scales of inter decadal and multi decadal variability was more important than that at the other scales which indicated that the impact mechanism of climate factors on runoff had obvious differences at different scales before the 1980s the climate fluctuation was the main factor affecting the runoff change and the contribution rate was above 90 from 1990 to 1999 the contribution rate of climate fluctuations decreased to 66 3 and the dhe and ihe of lucc contributed 18 5 and 9 2 to runoff change respectively other human activities including irrigation dam construction river diversion and other engineering and management practices contributed 6 0 to runoff change from 2000 to 2013 human activity gradually became the main driving force affecting runoff change 77 1 and the contribution rates of dhe and ihe of lucc to runoff changes were 35 8 and 21 3 respectively credit authorship contribution statement baofu li conceptualization data curation formal

5657,water markets are water management instruments that can support water reallocation from low to high value agricultural uses however unless explicit consideration is given to water uses not directly involved in the trading e g environment water markets may fail to promote sustainable growth in inter basin water markets the reallocation of water withdrawal entitlements from the selling basin typically involves the reallocation of return flows the surface and subsurface water that leaves the agricultural system following withdrawal of irrigation water along with consumptive uses which may impair environmental flows and affect water uses downstream in the selling basin this paper couples using a sequential modular approach a positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup tool that models the behavior of irrigators and the soil and water assessment tool swat eco hydrologic model to i assess the economic and water reallocation potential of a return flow neutral inter basin water market and ii explore the trading return flow tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle methods are applied to the case of agricultural water markets in the tagus segura interconnected basins in spain results show that enforcing a return flow neutral water market can reduce returns from trade by up to eur 1 63 per m3 of conserved streamflow keywords return flow

often constituting the marginal i e least productive uses of freshwater resources fao 2017 in a context of growing scarcity water markets can support the reallocation of water towards agricultural uses with higher added value hence offering an opportunity to enhance economic growth and social welfare damania et al 2017 however unless explicit consideration is given to third party uses not directly involved in the trading e g environment markets may fail to promote sustainable growth critically water entitlements worldwide are usually defined in terms of the right to withdraw water for its application instead of the right to consume it oecd 2015 water markets that trade withdrawal entitlements ignore the fact that irrigation networks are nested within larger systems of water recapture and reuse where non consumed water fractions can feed downstream uses through return flows i e the surface and subsurface water that leaves the agricultural system following withdrawal of irrigation water lankford 2012 return flow externalities can harm downstream users not directly involved in upstream transactions including environmental processes via diminished water supplies perry 2011 therefore where recoverable return flows exist economists recommend avoiding the return flow externalities of water marketing as much as possible by limiting trading to the seller s consumptive water use 1 1 return flow externalities can also have positive effects through reduced pollution loads yet where trading is restricted to the seller s consumptive use transferring water rights away from the donor basin also involves the removal of the pollution load associated to that use without the negative impact of reducing water availability downstream linneman et al 2014 huffaker and whittlesey 2000 yet evidence from water markets in spain palomo hierro et al 2015 australia connor and kaczan 2013 chile donoso 2011 and the us grafton et al 2011 howitt et al 2015 indicates that market institutions do not control for negative feedbacks from return flow externalities on environmental processes and other downstream uses typically low priority agricultural uses the natural questions that follow are what tradeoffs are observed in the selling basin between the amount of water traded and recoverable return flows what is the potential of water markets to enhance economic performance once return flow externalities are internalized research on intra basin water markets and return flow externalities uses economic modeling to assess how asymmetric irrigation technology adoption affects water consumption and return flows and identifies potential negative feedbacks on water availability for downstream uses through water reallocation to more efficient irrigators increased consumption and reduced return flows elsewhere grafton et al 2011 qureshi et al 2010 wheeler et al 2017 however to the best of our knowledge no research to date has quantitatively explored the issue of return flow externalities in an inter basin trading context and or using hydro economic modelling inter basin transfers and trading have grown in relevance during the last decades due to an expanding infrastructure base that makes inter basin trading feasible in a growing number of regions delac√°mara et al 2015a marston and cai 2016 since trading water withdrawal entitlements to a second basin also involves the reallocation of any related return flow away from the selling basin return flow externalities are expected to be further amplified in an inter basin market context this paper assesses the economic and water reallocation potential of a return flow neutral inter basin agricultural water market and explores the trading return flow tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle to this end we use a hydro economic model that couples using a sequential approach a microeconomic module that builds on positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup applications and an eco hydrologic module based on the soil and water assessment tool swat use of modularity makes possible a more complex representation and profound understanding of human agency in hydro economic modeling as compared to conventional piece wise representations of economic agents and the explicit inclusion of two way feedbacks between human and water systems sivapalan et al 2014 the model builds on previous work by the authors essenfelder et al 2018 that has been expanded to allow a more extensive list of combinations between crop varieties and management operations in the coupling protocol which previously limited the number of crops and forced the merge of similar crops into a representative crop variety and to automatize the exchange of information between the models allowing for faster analysis more efficient hydro economic modeling and simulation and more comprehensive scenario analysis both being a prerequisite for the successful development of the present study the resultant hydro economic model is used to explore trading opportunities and return flow externalities emerging from the inter basin market between the highly profitable and water constrained agriculture of the segura river basin srb and the relatively low value added and water abundant agriculture of the upper tagus river basin utrb in spain 2 water trading in the interconnected tagus and segura river basins in spain the utrb and the srb are connected through the tagus segura water transfer tswt which has the capacity to convey up to 1 billion m3 of water every year from the utrb to the srb headwaters 242 km apart from one another fig 1 the tswt was originally designed to support an ordinary transfer i e a reallocation not emerging from market exchanges yet the maximum legally transferable volume was soon capped to 600 million m3 per year a figure that has rarely been reached since the tswt was opened in 1979 the average annual ordinary transfer equals 305 million m3 srba 2014 this leaves significant idle capacity available for trading the spanish water law of 1999 made water trading possible for the first time through spot markets bilateral agreements among water users and water banks where an institution performs an intermediary role to facilitate arrangements e g through gathering and sharing information on supply and demand boe 1999 rigid trading rules and the low administrative charges for conventional water resources have limited the occurrence of formal water trading to drought periods provided the donor basin is not under drought itself where conventional water allotments are progressively constrained and result in growing shadow price differentials between potential traders during drought events spanish interregional basins such as the trb and the srb apply control mechanisms foreseen in drought management plans dmps to restrain water withdrawals srba 2008 trba 2007 dmps use objective indices to resolve the severity of droughts normality prealert alert and emergency and apply predetermined water use restrictions focusing first on low priority agricultural uses boe 2001 in the srb water availability for agriculture is reduced by 10 during drought prealert by 25 in the event of an alert and by 50 in the event of an emergency this applies for every agricultural agent with the exception of plantations of ligneous trees which have a higher priority srba 2008 although these thresholds can be relaxed by the drought steering committee supervising the implementation of the srb s dmp prolonged droughts can significantly strengthen the water availability constraint and increase the shadow price of water p√©rez blanco and guti√©rrez mart√≠n 2017 the royal decree 15 2005 boe 2005 allowed for an extended scope of water markets from intra to inter basin trading during severe droughts making possible the utilization of tswt s significant idle capacity for water trading provided the donor basin is under normality one year later inter basin trading through the tswt had surpassed all previous formal water exchanges within the srb rey et al 2011 rapidly becoming the largest water market in spain delac√°mara et al 2015b the explanation for this outcome lies on the dichotomy between market participants the irrigators of the srb and the utrb fig 1 the srb covers an area of 18 870 km2 in southeastern spain it includes 62 agricultural water demand units awdus of which 38 have access to the tswt the awdu is defined as a group of irrigators sharing a common source of water territorial administrative and hydrological characteristics srba 2014 agents in the pmaup model are the awdus of the utrb and of the srb which are connected to the tswt 2 2 awdus typically feature homogeneous groups of farmers albeit some heterogeneity may exist in some cases an alternative to this problem is offered by clustering g√≥mez lim√≥n et al 2012 application of clustering in the srb and utrb did not differ significantly from awdu aggregation suggesting awdus are relatively homogeneous units in addition clustering let to a few spatially loose agents which complicate the coupling between the pmaup and swat models consequently awdu aggregation was preferred the srb enjoys several competitive advantages for irrigated agriculture and hosts some of the most profitable awdus in europe however water is a binding constraint water use in the srb totals 1 9 billion m3 year 86 from agriculture and available renewable resources are circa 0 76 billion m3 year resulting in a water exploitation index of 250

have marginally expanded the supply base they have also contributed to increase demand even more exacerbating competition for the resource baldassarre et al 2018 and leading to widespread aquifer depletion and the intensification of intermittent river regimes downstream the middle stretches of the segura river g√≥mez and p√©rez blanco 2012 structural water scarcity is aggravated during the recurring drought episodes which have a major impact on irrigation and agricultural production pwc 2013 supported by government subsidization programs farmers have adapted through irrigation modernization l√≥pez gunn et al 2012 making the srb one of the most irrigation efficient basins in europe due to the high ratio of water consumed to water applied return flows are low and water transfers from the utrb are mostly consumed leading to a limited impact on environmental flows in the srb in contrast annual water withdrawals in the trb are estimated at 2 6 billion m3 and water supply at 8 22 billion m3 the supply demand ratio is particularly high in the utrb the trb s area that is directly connected to the srb through the tswt the utrb covers an area of 9 427 5 km2 and comprises 17 awdus trba 2014 the utrb concentrates one tenth of total rainfall and runoff across the trb enough to satisfy agricultural and other marginal uses present in the area and create a significant surplus for downstream uses delac√°mara et al 2015b water is a relatively plentiful resource in the utrb and farmers have not experienced the need to improve the efficiency of irrigation systems which may be as low as 40 in some awdus trba 2014 this results in high average estimated return flows which are critical to meet environmental flows and other downstream demands hern√°ndez mora and del moral 2015 agricultural area corresponds to approximately 37 of the total area of the utrb while natural areas mostly mixed forest and mediterranean scrubland cover approximately 62 the remaining areas being classified as urban environments the most relevant annual crops in the utrb include barley approximately 45 of the total agricultural areas of the utrb sunflower 21 wheat 11 corn 2 rye 2 and oats 1 other annual crops include lentils beans and onions permanent crops sum up to a total of approximately 17 of the total agricultural area of the utrb consisting mainly of vineyards and olive trees conflict lies downstream the utrb the middle trb hosts an extensive irrigated agriculture that largely depends on the water supply surplus and return flows from upstream basins disputed by the 4 g√≥mez et al 2013 to 5 7 gil et al 2009 times more productive irrigated agriculture of the srb perhaps not surprisingly past trading experiences and research suggests water markets between the utrb and the srb may reallocate large amounts of water from low to highly productive agricultural water uses and increase economic output pwc 2013 rey et al 2016 however there are also concerns about the capacity of water institutions to promote water markets that do not hinder third party uses hern√°ndez mora and del moral 2015 past inter basin trading experiences were driven by short sighted financial and political concerns and focused on mitigating drought impact on the strategic srb agriculture subsidized with free transportation costs boe 2005 markets transferred water withdrawal entitlements instead of consumption from the utrb to the srb while paying from little to no attention to potential return flow externalities downstream the utrb even if this is legally binding boe 2003 according to spanish regulation any exchange that reduces environmental flows or damages water ecosystems should be rejected by water authorities yet the rule of positive administrative silence applies meaning that water trading is automatically allowed if there is no institutional response within a predefined time period boe 2003 in the case of the tagus segura inter basin market this possibly led to diminished return flows and reduced water availability in the trb as a whole g√≥mez et al 2013 this outcome is likely to be aggravated due to climate change magrama 2017 whose effects are already felt in the trb available water resources throughout the basin have decreased from 11 billion m3 considering the 1940 2011 series to 8 2 billion m3 considering the 1980 2011 series of which 2 7 billion m3 are committed to the portuguese part of the basin this already required adjustments in the management of available water resources including the modification of the tswt management rules trba 2016 farmers and other stakeholders notably environmental organizations in the middle trb have long contested the tswt operations claiming there is no surplus in the basin that can be spared or traded hern√°ndez mora and del moral 2015 this is opposed by farmers in the srb pwc 2013 research and studies in the area suggest there is potential for trading to enhance economic growth and social welfare without compromising downstream flows in the trb although lower than originally claimed for a review readers may refer to delac√°mara et al 2015b rey et al 2016 conflict has led to institutional lock in and the tagus segura inter basin market has not reopened since 2006 in this paper we compare the outcomes of a market where agents trade water consumption along return flows v a return flow neutral water market to assess the impacts on water availability at the outlet of the utrb as well as economic returns the impact on water availability at the outlet of the utrb serves as a proxy to assess the potential impacts of trading downstream throughout the trb a detailed assessment of downstream impacts is possible using this information but it is out of the scope of the paper note that in both the return flow neutral and non neutral markets the quantity of water that can be traded is limited by the capacity of the tswt and the water transfers already committed albeit this constraint is not binding in any of the simulations implemented suggesting the infrastructure is oversized 3 the microeconomic module 3 1 model setting in a context of droughts and water scarcity positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup modeling has been used as a means to understand the drivers of irrigators behavior and responses and to assess the repercussions of alternative adaptation policies such as irrigation modernization caps pricing and trading among others see e g essenfelder et al 2018 guti√©rrez mart√≠n et al 2014 parrado et al 2019 p√©rez blanco standardi 2019 agents in the pmaup model decide on the crop portfolio x r n decision variable which is defined as the set of possible land allocation water allocation labor allocation machinery allocation and technology adoption choices this means that each possible combination of inputs and technology is defined as a unique crop x i i 1 n within the crop portfolio x r n e g rainfed and irrigated wheat are represented as separate crops which allows for the representation of both the extensive crop portfolio choices and intensive margin of production how water is used on particular crops and any substitution among water labor and irrigation technology irrigators will choose the crop portfolio x including rainfed and non crop choices within the domain f x that maximizes the utility derived from a set of utility relevant attributes z x in the simplest case one attribute may be considered namely profit as an explicit function of prices costs technology and input application notably water and biophysical relationships in line with the conventional approach of modeling irrigator choices using a production function approach howitt 1995 the decision making problem can be made more complex including other attributes such as risk and management complexity avoidance provided they allow for a more accurate representation of observed behavior a comprehensive description of the attributes explored in our research is available in section 3 3 pmaup optimization problem can be mathematically expressed as follows guti√©rrez mart√≠n and g√≥mez 2011 1 m a x u x

observed attribute value to the maximum attribute value attainable within the domain all attributes are delineated so that more is better the closer the attribute value is to 1 the more desirable the

maximizing decision within the feasible set f x the feasible set comprises a number of climatic information policy land agronomic and water constraints the latter of particular relevance for our analysis can be mathematically expressed as 5 i 1 n a i Œ¥ x i w g where w g is the total water allotment in m3 i e the maximum amount of water that can be withdrawn by the irrigator under a given water availability scenario g if the water allotment constraint is binding as happens in both the utrb and srb water allocation matches water withdrawals i e w g i 1 n a i x i where a i is the water withdrawn to irrigate crop i in m3 per hectare the fraction of a i that evapotranspirates is the water consumed by each crop i or a i i e the amount of water effectively contributing to increase biomass production yield the ratio between water consumption and withdrawals i 1 n a i x i i 1 n a i x i denotes the conveyance distribution and irrigation efficiency technologies or Œ¥ accordingly water withdrawals can be converted into water consumption multiplying by Œ¥ and vice versa water consumption can be converted into water withdrawals dividing by Œ¥ the latter is done in the left hand side of eq 5 which states that water withdrawals must be lower or equal to water allocation the difference between water withdrawals and water consumption i 1 n a i x i i 1 n a i x i represents the return flows which can be non recoverable and lost to a sink escape flow regimes or more likely return to the water cycle in the form of recoverable return flows huffaker 2008 a thorough description of the remaining model constraints is available in open access format in essenfelder et al 2018 and is also provided as supplementary material to this paper provided relevant attributes z x are quantifiable a ranking of preferences among all the feasible crop portfolio choices can be established for every agent based on the utility they return positive models aim to elicit an objective

relevant inputs such as nitrate application are assumed to be constant all variables above are obtained as average values from the longitudinal database see description of the database below the microeconomic sub model used in the paper aims to test the null hypothesis of whether the expected profit attribute alone can explain agent s observed behavior i e the agent behaves as a profit maximizer within the domain guti√©rrez mart√≠n g√≥mez 2011 in some cases profit alone can explain agent s responses entirely the agent is revealed as profit maximizer and the crop portfolio is located on the efficient frontier considering only this attribute however in some other cases the observed crop portfolio is not located on the efficient frontier this may happen because the domain is not properly defined e g some relevant constraints are not properly measured or are not accounted for which can artificially shift the efficient frontier away from the origin or because agent s responses are driven by attributes other than profit while our capacity to address the former is limited by information availability and data constraints we can test whether the latter applies by introducing additional attributes into the objective function and measuring the ability of the model to reproduce observed decisions if accuracy improves see supplementary material for a description of the calibration procedure and a definition of calibration errors this can be interpreted as a proof of the relevance of that new attribute in explaining observed behavior g√≥mez lim√≥n et al 2016 sumpsi et al 1997 all attributes explored are defined so that more is better to measure the alternative attributes to be tested other than profit we set the profit maximizing crop portfolio as a reference point from which we can measure changes in those alternative attributes namely risk and management complexity avoidance for example the risk avoided as we move away from the null hypothesis of a profit maximizer individual can be measured as the difference between risk exposure under the profit maximization assumption and risk exposure under an alternative crop portfolio it is possible to observe in our database that the crop portfolio that maximizes profit typically maximizes risk and management complexity because high return crops typically display higher price volatility and are more intensive in production inputs such as labor as a result risk and management complexity are typically at its maximum when profit is maximized note that if we were to observe that riskier and more complex portfolios come along lower profit there would be no tradeoff between the attributes non convexity and the choice would be irrelevant meaning that one of the attributes is irrelevant and could be discarded 3 2 2 z 2 expected risk avoidance 13 z 2 x x œÑ v c v œÄ x x x œÑ v c v œÄ x x being v c v œÄ x the variance covariance matrix quantifying the profit dispersion of the chosen crop

water withdrawal and water application per awdu are available from srba 2014 and trba 2014 water withdrawal and application per crop and per awdu in the srb is available from the srb management plan

trb management plan trba 2014 but it is estimated per crop or per awdu only not for both simultaneously hence water withdrawal is estimated by using the swat model for each crop and awdu individually by feeding the eco hydrologic model with the available information on crop portfolio land management operations irrigation efficiency and irrigation source and spatial distribution of crops and awdus

sharing 3 3 market equilibria the trigger effect in the modeled market is the emergence of a water shortage in the receiving end of the inter basin transfer which creates a supply demand gap that can be partly filled in using external resources from the donor basin it is assumed that the donor basin is under normality otherwise the market is not activated strengthening the water constraint typically precludes some previously realized crop portfolio choices and depresses utility agents in the receiving basin will be willing to acquire water from the donor basin if its price is lower than the foregone utility caused by the shortage while agents in the donor basin will be willing to sell water if the compensation received is larger than the foregone utility caused by the water sale the pmaup model is used to simulate the repercussions of such inter basin market first agents solve the optimization problem in eq 1 4 for marginal decreases of the water constraint w g see eq 5 next the foregone utility for every water constraint w g considered relative to the baseline scenario without trading water restriction g 0 is calculated and the compensating variation that compensates the utility loss is obtained the compensating variation for a given water availability scenario in the pmaup model or c v g is defined as the minimum payment through an increase in the expected profit z 1 in eur m3 that would equalize the utility in the new water constraint scenario w g to the utility of the baseline scenario u 0 and can be mathematically expressed through the following expenditure function e p√©rez blanco and guti√©rrez mart√≠n 2017 6 c v g e u 0 w g e u 0 w 0 where the expenditure function in the baseline scenario without trading water restriction g 0 e u 0 w 0 is 0 i e since no water restriction applies the payment that keeps utility constant is zero this means that the total surplus from trading in the baseline scenario without trade is 0 also the impact on water availability within the utrb and srb is 0 since no water is traded for a given water constraint rational agents will allocate water to the crops with a higher c v g attached and then move to those with a lower c v g until available water a binding constraint is exhausted the c v g is thus the basic information we need to build the water supply ranking c v g in the donor basin from lower to higher value and demand schedules ranking c v g in the receiving basin from higher to lower value and simulate the outcome of alternative kaldor hicks efficient inter basin trading scenarios hicks 1939 without other costs agents will trade water if the compensating variation in the receiving basin c v g s r b is higher than the compensating variation in the donor basin c v g u t r b i e until 7 c v g s r b c v g u t r b however water markets typically face other significant costs that should be accounted for the question that follows is how much water can be traded after considering transportation costs i e transportation fees and interim losses from e g leakages and evaporation during the transportation and after internalizing potential return flow externalities we address this in the next paragraphs 3 3 1 return flow externalities if not properly designed and supervised water markets may reduce water availability for the environment and other downstream uses in the donor basin through return flow externalities in inter basin water transfers this is likely to occur where agents can trade water allocations w g instead of effective water consumption i 1 n w i x i which may result in the reallocation of recoverable return flows away from the selling basin to negate return flow externalities a fraction of the tradable entitlements e n v that is at least equal to the recoverable return flows from irrigation use should remain in the selling area internalizing return flow externalities increases trading costs and the equilibrium market price which is now reached where 8 c v g s r b c v g u t r b 1 e n v 3 3 2 market operation costs inter basin trading between the utrb and the srb have in the past required the intervention of public institutions and was closer

water market in the interconnected utrb and srb exploring the agro environmental tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle requires a hydro economic methodological framework calibrated for the donor area i e utrb to this end this paper couples using a sequential modular approach the microeconomic module with the swat model arnold et al 1998 swat is a comprehensive river basin scale model capable of assessing the impacts from land and water management on the hydrologic cycle and on agricultural yield at a watershed level computationally swat considers a river basin as a mosaic of smaller spatially located units defined as sub basins in turn a sub basin is further spatially split into elements known as hydrological response units hrus an hru in turn is defined as lumped land areas belonging to a sub basin with unique land cover soil slope and management combination fiseha et al 2014 which together form the main inputs to the swat model such subdivision enables the swat model to reflect differences in hydrologic processes as a response from the various land cover and soil types in a watershed both temporally and spatially and also the consequences of human land management actions on eco hydrologic processes krysanova and arnold 2008 land management routines commonly simulated in swat are crop growing and harvesting tillage and irrigation application moreover swat allows for water to be transferred from one water body to any other reservoir or reach in the watershed or outside of the main watershed by means of the consumptive use functionality neitsch et al 2011 thus allowing for the simulation of the water removed from the utrb by means of the tswt swat allows water to be removed from a shallow aquifer a deep aquifer a reach a pond or a reservoir within any sub basin in the watershed swat simulates the hydrologic processes of a river basin in two different yet integrated phases i the land phase and ii the routing phase the land phase is responsible for controlling the amount of water sediment nutrient and pesticide loadings to the main channel in each hru and sub basin while the routing phase is responsible for the computation of the movement of water sediments nutrients and pesticides loadings through the channel network of a watershed neitsch et al 2011 being capable of simulating both hydrologic and land phase processes and due to the fact that the model can simulate human management actions on agricultural systems swat is a relevant tool for studying the connections between human actions on water systems such as for the estimation of water availability at the outlet of the utrb under alternative water scarcity and return flow scenarios 4 2 data the swat model requires a variety of input parameters including information on topography land use soil and hydro meteorological data the digital elevation model dem covering the study is obtained at a spatial resolution of 25x25m from the instituto geogr√°fico nacional de espa√±a ign 2017 the soil information used is the soil geographical database for europe sgdbe v2 0 obtained for whole europe at a scale of 1 1 000 000 from the european soil database the

coupled hydroeconomic model the coupling approach builds on previous work by the authors in essenfelder et al 2018 which combines swat hrus with pmaup s basic computational unit the awdus to create a spatial entity composed of unique land use land management soil topographic and economic characteristics the hydro economic representative unit heru as compared to hrus which are purely physical entities herus offer the advantage of accounting for the decision making process that led to opting for a particular crop portfolio land management schedule and or water trading quantity thereby representing the capability of economic agents within a particular heru of adapting where given the opportunity accordingly herus can be seen as an entity endowed with decision making capability where decisions are taken by the pmaup module and reflected in the swat model as variations in land and water management such as changes in the daily curve number and potential runoff due to land use changes changes in the land phase of swat are carried downstream in the hydrologic cycle of the watershed during the routing phase affecting processes such as stream network flow and reservoirs inflow and outflow processes in turn eco hydrologic outputs that are regarded as relevant in the decision making process of economic agents are passed from the hydrologic module to the economic module notably water availability in eq 5 consequently herus enable the identification of and communication within a common spatial unit among human and water systems essenfelder et al 2018 fig 2 exemplifies how information is exchanged between the pmaup and swat models in a water trading context feedbacks between the microeconomic and hydrologic modules are considered in the modular framework allowing for changes in either water or human systems to affect the dynamics of the whole integrated modular framework in our application non return flow neutral water markets can affect the availability of water for irrigation purposes downstream of the tswt s intake as a result of i the water traded to the srb which is subtracted from the utrb streamflow during the irrigation campaign at the point the tswt links with the utrb and ii the crop portfolio choices of economic agents in the utrb which can impact land use and the rainfall runoff process to spatially connect the crop portfolio of economic agents i e vector x in eqs 1 4 with the land cover and land management as considered by the swat model two considerations are necessary i different combinations of crops and management schemes in the pmaup model i e x vector in eqs 1 4 are assumed to be same crop varieties but under different management schemes in swat and ii due to a limit of land cover classes that can be handled by arcswat winchell et al 2007 during the hru definition phase crops that cover small relative areas are grouped into a same crop variety e g different grape varieties are considered simply as vineyards as compared to previous work in essenfelder et al 2018 the number of crops managed in the coupling protocol has been expanded to allow a more extensive list of combinations between crop varieties and management operations which previously limited the number of crops and forced the merge of similar crops into a representative crop variety this makes possible to individually represent all relevant crop varieties representing at least 0 5 of total agricultural land in the utrb for the utrb the swat model considers a total of 15 different land cover classes 2 different irrigation management schemes i e irrigated or rainfed irrigation 17 economic agents and 14 soil classes producing a final number of 42 sub basins and 1522 herus the increase in the number of crops that can be modeled is feasible due to the automatization of the land use protocol that exchanges information between the models allowing for faster analysis more efficient hydro economic modeling and simulation and more comprehensive scenario analysis for the coupling to work two assumptions are made following essenfelder et al 2018 i the decisions taken by farmers at the beginning of the irrigation season are unchanged throughout the crop growing season this is done to circumvent the temporal divergence between the pmaup which operates on a yearly basis and the swat which operates on a daily basis and ii feedbacks from the swat to the pmaup model are transferred as yearly average values consistent with the definition of the attributes in the pmaup model in section 2 3 6 results 6 1 model calibration 6

swat model is done for the utrb the selling basin with the assistance of the swat cup software abbaspour et al 2007 one of the most common procedures utilized in swat cup is the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 performs a combined optimization and uncertainty analysis using a global search procedure and can deal with a large number of parameters through latin hypercube sampling abbaspour et al 2004 the calibration process is done by running a number of iterations varying from 500 to 999 for each calibration cycle whereas the first calibration cycle always runs 999 iterations as for the objective function both nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias are utilized as metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the calibration and validation processes moriasi et al 2007 seven stream gauge stations are used for calibrating the swat model as shown in fig 3 to incorporate the hydrologic consequences of the operation of the tswt water that is transferred from the utrb is considered as consumed water in the swat model being exported from the watershed swat considers consumptive water use to vary from month to month at an average rate neitsch et al 2011 for each month in a year during the simulation period an average daily volume of water is removed from the specified water consumptive source for this reason stream gauge stations at the outlet of reservoirs and downstream of the tswt i e 3007 bolarque 3043 buend√≠a and 3006 entrepe√±as see fig 3 are not considered for validation purposes being considered instead as daily measured reservoir outflows during the calibration phase the final model performance evaluation metric results are shown in table 2 6 2 simulation scenarios 6 2 1 supply scenarios supply scenarios are articulated through production costs and are obtained from the combination of the compensating variation values obtained for the utrb c v g u t r b and return flow and transportation and market operation costs scenarios see eq 10 production costs are obtained for each awdu separately and then aggregated and ranked considering all awdus to reveal the supply schedule 6 2 2 return flows available estimates of return flows from agricultural water use in the trb set the value of e n v close to 19 e n v 19 yet no specific accounting is available for the utrb where irrigation efficiency is on average lower than in the rest of the basin trba 2014 in this context the precautionary principle advises to limit trading to the seller s consumptive water use cons huffaker and whittlesey 2000 so that for each seller env 1 c o n s in the awdus of the utrb cons ranges between 41 and 85 6 2 3 market operation costs following the estimations by montilla l√≥pez et al 2018 for the segura and j√∫car basins in spain market operation costs can represent up to 0 03 eurocents m3 f mo 03 although they can also be subsidized f mo 0 as happened in previous interbasin exchanges through the tswt 6 2 4 transportation costs water traded through the tswt covers between 242 km length of the water transfer itself and 300 km length of the tswt plus that of other canals used for the distribution of the water within the srb depending on its destination as a result water transfers through this infrastructure face significant transportation costs transportation fees for the tswt equal 10 eurocents m3 f ts 1 and interim losses are estimated at 10 l ats 0 1 srba 2014 trba 2014 it is worthy of note that in past inter basin trading experiences public subsidization sent transportation fees down to zero boe 2005 two transportation and market operation costs scenarios are considered regular transportation f ts 1 and market operation f mo 03 fees scenario and subsidized transportation f ts 0 and market operation f mo 0 fees scenario three return flow scenarios are considered including precautionary approach env 1 c o n s 19 return flow env 19 no return flow env 0 this results in a total of 6 possible supply scenarios and supply schedules s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 see table 3 in order to maintain the management of the reservoirs consistent between the different scenarios and moreover because of the fact that stream gauge stations at the outlet of reservoirs and downstream of the tswt are considered as daily measured reservoir outflows that reflect the management of the reservoirs the amount of water stored during each simulation day in swat is kept constant amongst all scenarios while the reservoirs outflow are variable this means that depending on the amount of water that is transferred through the tswt the amount of water released from the buend√≠a and entrepe√±as reservoirs might be lower than the amount of water released in the baseline scenario without trading the assumption of a consistent management of reservoirs between the scenarios is fundamental for allowing a coherent and understandable assessment and comparison of the impacts of selected scenarios on irrigation water availability and return flows while ensuring the buend√≠a and entrepe√±as reservoirs are not depleted note that reservoirs are located at the outlet of the utrb and the system downstream the reservoirs is not modeled in our application this assumption could be abandoned to assess the consequences of alternative policies using this model e g alternative reservoir management options particularly if downstream systems are represented 6 2 5 demand scenarios demand scenarios are obtained from the compensating variation values obtained for the srb c v g s r b under alternative drought scenarios three drought scenarios are considered defined in accordance to planned drought responses in the srb s dmp srba 2008 prealert where water allocation is reduced by 10 accordingly the water allocation constraint in eq 5 is progressively strengthened in every awdu of the srb to reveal c v g s r b which is then ranked among all awdus to reveal the demand schedule alert where water allocation in every awdu is reduced by 25 emergency where water allocation in every awdu is reduced by 50 in all scenarios it is assumed the trb is under normality i e no drought otherwise trading is not permitted trba 2014 each alternative water allocation constraint in the srb reveals a unique demand schedule resulting in 3 possible demand scenarios which together with supply scenarios result in 18 water market scenarios 3 demand scenarios for each of the 6 supply scenarios 6 3 simulation results 6 3 1 the microeconomic module water availability is limited at regular intervals of 1 for every awdu in the market from 0 to 50 for every water constraint considered agents solve the optimization problem in eqs 1 4 and select the crop portfolio that maximizes utility within the domain next the foregone utility and the compensating variation that keeps utility constant are estimated and the supply and demand schedules are obtained in accordance to the supply and demand scenarios defined in section 6 2 fig 4 shows the market equilibria for each possible combination of supply and demand scenarios table 4 offers detail on the equilibrium price quantity and producer s and consumer s surpluses while fig 5 shows the crop portfolio for selected crops in the utrb wheat barley corn sunflower rye and oats under every water market scenario a critical input to the swat model more restrictive trading conditions lead to higher equilibrium prices and reduce quantities traded as well as consumer s and producer s surpluses the producer s surplus is the benefit of the producer seller i e the area between the equilibrium price and suppliers bid prices willingness to accept along the supply schedule while the consumer s surplus is the benefit of the consumer buyer i e the area between the consumers bid price willingness to pay along the demand schedule and the equilibrium price a net reduction of the total surplus consumer s plus producer s surplus from one scenario to another 4 4 note that under the baseline there is no trading and therefore the quantity traded and total surplus are both 0 negatively affects returns from trade and market performance for example under emergency in the srb the most restrictive supply scenario s6 yields a price that is almost twice as high as that of the least restrictive supply scenario s1 1 21 v 0 63 eur m3 this halves water trading from 58 8 in s1 to 29 6 million m3 in s6 and reduces the total surplus by 37 5 eur 80 2 million in s1 under emergency v eur 50 1 million in s6 under emergency on the other hand and as we will see in the next subsection relevant impacts on water bodies occur as we move away from return flow neutrality s5 s6 we will further reflect on this tradeoff in the discussion section trading constrains water availability in the utrb and results in a shift from irrigated to rainfed crops accordingly the surface of rainfed irrigated barley corn and wheat in the utrb grows diminishes consistently along with irrigation restrictions and higher water demand from the srb the more restrictive the water constraint becomes in the srb demand scenario the more surface allotted to less water intensive or rainfed crops results observed during emergency drought in the srb are consistent with those observed during the past inter basin trading in 2006 magrama 2015b 6 3 2 the eco hydrologic module the crop portfolio and water allocation choices for each supply and demand scenarios in the microeconomic module are used as inputs in the eco hydrologic module to assess their repercussions on the utrb s hydrologic cycle hydrologic simulations are run for the year 2013 while the period from 2010 to 2012 is used to warm up the hydrologic model water traded from the utrb to the srb is taken from the reservoirs 3043 buend√≠a and 3006 entrepe√±as outflows of the reservoirs are adjusted at a daily basis in order to keep water storage levels consistent with the baseline scenario without trading table 5 summarises the hydrologic impacts resulting from the interbasin water market on the donor basin the first row of table 5 displays how much water is traded i e removed from the utrb average water storage in the utrb s reservoirs constant and reservoirs outflows for each of supply and demand scenarios it is possible to verify that the volume of water traded in the hydrologic module is consistent with the water quantity traded at market equilibria table 4 moreover as previously explained the volume of water in the utrb s reservoirs see first row of table 5 is kept constant between scenarios in order to allow for a coherent assessment and comparison of the impacts of each scenario on irrigation water availability and return flows and to ensure that the buend√≠a and entrepe√±as reservoirs are not depleted as the volume of water stored in the reservoirs is kept constant between scenarios the reservoirs outflow is variable in order to mimic the reservoirs storage of the baseline scenario without trading as a consequence supply scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 have a higher reduction in the reservoirs outflow to match the higher amount of water traded to the srb as compared to more restrictive trading conditions with higher production costs in scenarios s5 and s6 the water that is traded from the utrb is physically removed from the reservoirs 3043 buend√≠a and 3006 entrepe√±as however this water is ultimately coming from former irrigation withdrawals that are no longer taking place in the utrb the total amount of irrigation water withdrawals of water that is reaching the field and is useful for crops i e field application and of return flows in the utrb is shown in table 5 second row the lower the production costs of the supply scenario the lower the volume of irrigation withdrawals in the utrb i e the higher the volume traded towards the srb and the higher the reduction of total irrigation withdrawals as compared to the baseline scenario without trading the same pattern is observed for field application and return flows accordingly the most restrictive supply scenario i e s6 yields the highest irrigation withdrawals field application and return flow values the influence of water trading has also consequences on the water balance of the utrb the third row of table 5 shows for each water market scenario the reduction as compared to the baseline scenario without trading in three variables describing fundamental water balance processes in the utrb evapotranspiration surface runoff and water yield evapotranspiration is reduced in all supply demand scenarios evapotranspiration is strictly connected with the reduction of field application water as shown in the table 5 second row similarly surface runoff is reduced in all scenarios being strictly connected instead with the reduction of return flows shown in table 5 second row this is because the water that is traded from the utrb is ultimately coming from reduced irrigation withdrawals which in turn affect the water balance of the donor basin this is clearly shown through the negative changes in water yield table 5 third row a process that shows the volume of water from land areas contributing to streamflow and sums up all the effects of reduced irrigation withdrawals on the water balance of land areas due to the diminishing water yield it is expected a reduction in the utrb s streamflow an information that is shown in table 5 fourth row as shown above less restrictive trading conditions i e s1 s2 s3 and s4 lead to lower total outflow values in the utrb due to higher amounts of water traded to the srb while more restrictive trading conditions i e s5 and s6 are flow neutral scenarios in order to be flow neutral scenarios agents under s5 and s6 are required to reduce their total field application by the same amount as the total water traded from the utrb as a consequence surface runoff and groundwater recharge are also reduced due to decreased return flows however due to lower abstractions of water from the stream channels the basin wide streamflow impact is neutral as shown in the fourth row of table 5 in contrast the less restrictive supply scenario i e s1 yields the highest reduction in streamflow varying from between 3 41 and 9 12 during the crop growing season 1 66 or 15 9 m m3 yearly under the prealert demand scenario to between 4 97 and 10 52 during the crop growing season 1 93 or 18 6 m m3 yearly under the emergency demand scenario to put these number in perspective the total amount of streamflow reduction in s1 during the emergency demand scenario is equivalent to approximately 31 2 of the total yearly irrigation field application water of the whole utrb during the baseline scenario 7 discussion under prealert conditions in the srb less restrictive trading conditions in s1 the scenario that reflects the trading rules applied in the water market of 2005 2006 lead to significant streamflow reduction in the utrb and limited market performance improvements for each m3 of foregone streamflow as compared to the return flow neutral scenario s6 total economic surplus in s1 increases by eur 2 on average this suggests that the excess water traded under prealert in s1 as compared to s6 is largely applied to low value added crops in the srb however under emergency alert in the srb trading can significantly contribute to enhance total economic surplus up to eur 80 2 44 4 million in s1 or 1 63 1 05 eur m3 for each m3 of foregone streamflow as compared to the return flow neutral scenario s6 this suggests that excess water traded under emergency and alert in s1 as compared to s6 is largely applied to high value added crops in the srb fig 6 plots the additional economic surplus attainable in every market scenario against the resulting streamflow reduction the results shown in fig 6 confirm the existence of significant trading return flow tradeoffs in the tagus segura inter basin market under severe drought conditions in the srb significant economic rents can be captured by means of trading the non consumptive fraction away from the selling basin as happened in the 2005 2006 water market with negative impacts on streamflow although water policy often assumes the capacity of public institutions to deploy resource reallocation instruments in line with collectively agreed water policy objectives factors such as incomplete information and political entanglement condition the success of reorganization attempts through institutional transaction costs g√≥mez et al 2017 transaction costs may represent a barrier for institutions to apply return flow neutrality as well as additional rules to prevent other negative impacts of trading on streamflow and the environment e g transportation and market operation costs recovery notably institutions overseeing the market need to understand calculate and enforce return flows to set tradable permits that do not interfere with third parties downstream and this may take significant time and resources loch and gregg 2018 particularly where this is done on a farm by farm basis albeit technologies such as metering devices and remote sensing e g observing soil humidity can significantly reduce these costs also return flow ratios can also be estimated at a larger scale than the farm level to reduce transaction costs although this would come at the expense of rewarding underperforming farmers and penalizing those who outperform the average farmer all the above will necessarily rely on studies that quantify and make visible trading return flow tradeoffs so that environmental and economic performance can be balanced in a transparent way using the best possible information this need is further amplified by the exhaustion of conventional incremental supply side responses to droughts and scarcity e g reservoirs canals wells in areas like the srb the use of new supplies from outside the traditional boundaries of the basin through desalination and the tswt have not made a meaningful contribution either the high costs of desalinated water between 7 and 1 eur m3 are typically above irrigators willingness to pay for water srba 2014 moreover the tswt infrastructure is not a binding constraint in our simulations not even in the least restrictive water market scenarios suggesting this infrastructure is oversized and there is much excess capacity even after factoring trading in in a context of basin closure and inelastic supply as happens in the srb where water supply falls short of commitments to fulfill demand effective responses to droughts and scarcity will necessarily be driven by demand side policies e g markets quotas charges that reallocate available resources oecd 2015 yet demand side policies are not panaceas meinzen dick 2007 sensible and coordinated governance built on robust interdisciplinary and comprehensive scientific evidence are necessary to achieve the greatest collective good within the range of feasible actions an in depth analysis of the complex and interconnected dynamics of nonlinear human water systems is necessary to take informed decisions avoid the reinforcement of trajectories based on exhausted responses and minimize risks in decision making anderies et al 2006 8 conclusion water markets offer a means to enhance economic growth and improve social welfare however unless third party water uses that are not directly involved in the trading are not explicitly considered in an integrative hydro economic framework e g including the environment but also other economic uses such as irrigators downstream trading may fail to promote sustainable economic growth in this context information describing both the socio economic and environmental impacts of trading is necessary to underpin the implementation of water markets this paper couples using a sequential modular approach a pmaup microeconomic model with the swat eco hydrologic model to i assess the economic viability and water reallocation potential of a return flow neutral inter basin water market and ii explore the trading return flow tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle methods are applied to the case of agricultural water markets in the tagus segura interconnected river basins in spain results show that permissive water markets that disregard reserves for return flows and subsidize transportation and market operation costs s1 can reduce streamflow in the utrb between 15 9 prealert and 18 5 emergency million m3 i e between 1 7 and 2 0 yearly and between 3 4 and 10 5 during months in the crop growing season under drought conditions negatively affecting environmental and other uses downstream on the other hand implementing a return flow neutral water market and charging transportation and market operation costs to traders s6 would reduce total economic surplus between eur 3 13 prealert and 30 15 emergency million during drought as compared to the permissive water market s1 further research can contribute to fine tune and extend the modeling approach presented in this paper the pmaup model could be improved by including additional attributes such as the impact of forecasts e g climate forecasts on agents responses or by including additional viable crops into the portfolio although this is conditional on the data availability in the case study site in the swat model water removals from selling watersheds could be expanded to be considered under a variable daily regime rather than the current monthly average the framework presented in this paper could also benefit from the inclusion of additional calibration methods see p√©rez blanco guti√©rrez mart√≠n 2017 for a description of the calibration methods available in the pmaup model and or models at each system scale human and or water system to sample uncertainty and allow for the application of robust decision making methods to deal with the knightian or deep uncertainty inherent to complex social ecological systems such as human water systems in addition integration with other human e g macroeconomy and ecological e g climate systems can help to better understand the behavior of linked socioecological systems beyond the current human microeconomy water interface such multi model multi system ensemble framework would allow a more profound understanding of the complex interlinkages between and within social and ecological systems and could eventually support policy makers in the identification of cost effective and robust water adaptation responses finally the scalable framework proposed here could be expanded to assess the economic impact of reduced return flows and streamflow on third party economic uses such as industry although the value of this contribution for the agricultural utrb would be limited other basins where non agricultural uses are more relevant would benefit from it

5657,water markets are water management instruments that can support water reallocation from low to high value agricultural uses however unless explicit consideration is given to water uses not directly involved in the trading e g environment water markets may fail to promote sustainable growth in inter basin water markets the reallocation of water withdrawal entitlements from the selling basin typically involves the reallocation of return flows the surface and subsurface water that leaves the agricultural system following withdrawal of irrigation water along with consumptive uses which may impair environmental flows and affect water uses downstream in the selling basin this paper couples using a sequential modular approach a positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup tool that models the behavior of irrigators and the soil and water assessment tool swat eco hydrologic model to i assess the economic and water reallocation potential of a return flow neutral inter basin water market and ii explore the trading return flow tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle methods are applied to the case of agricultural water markets in the tagus segura interconnected basins in spain results show that enforcing a return flow neutral water market can reduce returns from trade by up to eur 1 63 per m3 of conserved streamflow keywords return flow externality water market integrated hydro economic modeling swat positive mathematical programming 1 introduction farming accounts for approximately 70 of water withdrawals in the world today while often constituting the marginal i e least productive uses of freshwater resources fao 2017 in a context of growing scarcity water markets can support the reallocation of water towards agricultural uses with higher added value hence offering an opportunity to enhance economic growth and social welfare damania et al 2017 however unless explicit consideration is given to third party uses not directly involved in the trading e g environment markets may fail to promote sustainable growth critically water entitlements worldwide are usually defined in terms of the right to withdraw water for its application instead of the right to consume it oecd 2015 water markets that trade withdrawal entitlements ignore the fact that irrigation networks are nested within larger systems of water recapture and reuse where non consumed water fractions can feed downstream uses through return flows i e the surface and subsurface water that leaves the agricultural system following withdrawal of irrigation water lankford 2012 return flow externalities can harm downstream users not directly involved in upstream transactions including environmental processes via diminished water supplies perry 2011 therefore where recoverable return flows exist economists recommend avoiding the return flow externalities of water marketing as much as possible by limiting trading to the seller s consumptive water use 1 1 return flow externalities can also have positive effects through reduced pollution loads yet where trading is restricted to the seller s consumptive use transferring water rights away from the donor basin also involves the removal of the pollution load associated to that use without the negative impact of reducing water availability downstream linneman et al 2014 huffaker and whittlesey 2000 yet evidence from water markets in spain palomo hierro et al 2015 australia connor and kaczan 2013 chile donoso 2011 and the us grafton et al 2011 howitt et al 2015 indicates that market institutions do not control for negative feedbacks from return flow externalities on environmental processes and other downstream uses typically low priority agricultural uses the natural questions that follow are what tradeoffs are observed in the selling basin between the amount of water traded and recoverable return flows what is the potential of water markets to enhance economic performance once return flow externalities are internalized research on intra basin water markets and return flow externalities uses economic modeling to assess how asymmetric irrigation technology adoption affects water consumption and return flows and identifies potential negative feedbacks on water availability for downstream uses through water reallocation to more efficient irrigators increased consumption and reduced return flows elsewhere grafton et al 2011 qureshi et al 2010 wheeler et al 2017 however to the best of our knowledge no research to date has quantitatively explored the issue of return flow externalities in an inter basin trading context and or using hydro economic modelling inter basin transfers and trading have grown in relevance during the last decades due to an expanding infrastructure base that makes inter basin trading feasible in a growing number of regions delac√°mara et al 2015a marston and cai 2016 since trading water withdrawal entitlements to a second basin also involves the reallocation of any related return flow away from the selling basin return flow externalities are expected to be further amplified in an inter basin market context this paper assesses the economic and water reallocation potential of a return flow neutral inter basin agricultural water market and explores the trading return flow tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle to this end we use a hydro economic model that couples using a sequential approach a microeconomic module that builds on positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup applications and an eco hydrologic module based on the soil and water assessment tool swat use of modularity makes possible a more complex representation and profound understanding of human agency in hydro economic modeling as compared to conventional piece wise representations of economic agents and the explicit inclusion of two way feedbacks between human and water systems sivapalan et al 2014 the model builds on previous work by the authors essenfelder et al 2018 that has been expanded to allow a more extensive list of combinations between crop varieties and management operations in the coupling protocol which previously limited the number of crops and forced the merge of similar crops into a representative crop variety and to automatize the exchange of information between the models allowing for faster analysis more efficient hydro economic modeling and simulation and more comprehensive scenario analysis both being a prerequisite for the successful development of the present study the resultant hydro economic model is used to explore trading opportunities and return flow externalities emerging from the inter basin market between the highly profitable and water constrained agriculture of the segura river basin srb and the relatively low value added and water abundant agriculture of the upper tagus river basin utrb in spain 2 water trading in the interconnected tagus and segura river basins in spain the utrb and the srb are connected through the tagus segura water transfer tswt which has the capacity to convey up to 1 billion m3 of water every year from the utrb to the srb headwaters 242 km apart from one another fig 1 the tswt was originally designed to support an ordinary transfer i e a reallocation not emerging from market exchanges yet the maximum legally transferable volume was soon capped to 600 million m3 per year a figure that has rarely been reached since the tswt was opened in 1979 the average annual ordinary transfer equals 305 million m3 srba 2014 this leaves significant idle capacity available for trading the spanish water law of 1999 made water trading possible for the first time through spot markets bilateral agreements among water users and water banks where an institution performs an intermediary role to facilitate arrangements e g through gathering and sharing information on supply and demand boe 1999 rigid trading rules and the low administrative charges for conventional water resources have limited the occurrence of formal water trading to drought periods provided the donor basin is not under drought itself where conventional water allotments are progressively constrained and result in growing shadow price differentials between potential traders during drought events spanish interregional basins such as the trb and the srb apply control mechanisms foreseen in drought management plans dmps to restrain water withdrawals srba 2008 trba 2007 dmps use objective indices to resolve the severity of droughts normality prealert alert and emergency and apply predetermined water use restrictions focusing first on low priority agricultural uses boe 2001 in the srb water availability for agriculture is reduced by 10 during drought prealert by 25 in the event of an alert and by 50 in the event of an emergency this applies for every agricultural agent with the exception of plantations of ligneous trees which have a higher priority srba 2008 although these thresholds can be relaxed by the drought steering committee supervising the implementation of the srb s dmp prolonged droughts can significantly strengthen the water availability constraint and increase the shadow price of water p√©rez blanco and guti√©rrez mart√≠n 2017 the royal decree 15 2005 boe 2005 allowed for an extended scope of water markets from intra to inter basin trading during severe droughts making possible the utilization of tswt s significant idle capacity for water trading provided the donor basin is under normality one year later inter basin trading through the tswt had surpassed all previous formal water exchanges within the srb rey et al 2011 rapidly becoming the largest water market in spain delac√°mara et al 2015b the explanation for this outcome lies on the dichotomy between market participants the irrigators of the srb and the utrb fig 1 the srb covers an area of 18 870 km2 in southeastern spain it includes 62 agricultural water demand units awdus of which 38 have access to the tswt the awdu is defined as a group of irrigators sharing a common source of water territorial administrative and hydrological characteristics srba 2014 agents in the pmaup model are the awdus of the utrb and of the srb which are connected to the tswt 2 2 awdus typically feature homogeneous groups of farmers albeit some heterogeneity may exist in some cases an alternative to this problem is offered by clustering g√≥mez lim√≥n et al 2012 application of clustering in the srb and utrb did not differ significantly from awdu aggregation suggesting awdus are relatively homogeneous units in addition clustering let to a few spatially loose agents which complicate the coupling between the pmaup and swat models consequently awdu aggregation was preferred the srb enjoys several competitive advantages for irrigated agriculture and hosts some of the most profitable awdus in europe however water is a binding constraint water use in the srb totals 1 9 billion m3 year 86 from agriculture and available renewable resources are circa 0 76 billion m3 year resulting in a water exploitation index of 250 the highest in europe eea 2016 srba 2015a policy responses to water scarcity have focused on supply side approaches aiming at expanding available resources through additional wells increased water storage capacity e g reservoirs non conventional sources e g tswt desalination or increased reuse capacity wastewater treatment avell√° and garc√≠a moll√° 2009 march et al 2014 while these solutions have marginally expanded the supply base they have also contributed to increase demand even more exacerbating competition for the resource baldassarre et al 2018 and leading to widespread aquifer depletion and the intensification of intermittent river regimes downstream the middle stretches of the segura river g√≥mez and p√©rez blanco 2012 structural water scarcity is aggravated during the recurring drought episodes which have a major impact on irrigation and agricultural production pwc 2013 supported by government subsidization programs farmers have adapted through irrigation modernization l√≥pez gunn et al 2012 making the srb one of the most irrigation efficient basins in europe due to the high ratio of water consumed to water applied return flows are low and water transfers from the utrb are mostly consumed leading to a limited impact on environmental flows in the srb in contrast annual water withdrawals in the trb are estimated at 2 6 billion m3 and water supply at 8 22 billion m3 the supply demand ratio is particularly high in the utrb the trb s area that is directly connected to the srb through the tswt the utrb covers an area of 9 427 5 km2 and comprises 17 awdus trba 2014 the utrb concentrates one tenth of total rainfall and runoff across the trb enough to satisfy agricultural and other marginal uses present in the area and create a significant surplus for downstream uses delac√°mara et al 2015b water is a relatively plentiful resource in the utrb and farmers have not experienced the need to improve the efficiency of irrigation systems which may be as low as 40 in some awdus trba 2014 this results in high average estimated return flows which are critical to meet environmental flows and other downstream demands hern√°ndez mora and del moral 2015 agricultural area corresponds to approximately 37 of the total area of the utrb while natural areas mostly mixed forest and mediterranean scrubland cover approximately 62 the remaining areas being classified as urban environments the most relevant annual crops in the utrb include barley approximately 45 of the total agricultural areas of the utrb sunflower 21 wheat 11 corn 2 rye 2 and oats 1 other annual crops include lentils beans and onions permanent crops sum up to a total of approximately 17 of the total agricultural area of the utrb consisting mainly of vineyards and olive trees conflict lies downstream the utrb the middle trb hosts an extensive irrigated agriculture that largely depends on the water supply surplus and return flows from upstream basins disputed by the 4 g√≥mez et al 2013 to 5 7 gil et al 2009 times more productive irrigated agriculture of the srb perhaps not surprisingly past trading experiences and research suggests water markets between the utrb and the srb may reallocate large amounts of water from low to highly productive agricultural water uses and increase economic output pwc 2013 rey et al 2016 however there are also concerns about the capacity of water institutions to promote water markets that do not hinder third party uses hern√°ndez mora and del moral 2015 past inter basin trading experiences were driven by short sighted financial and political concerns and focused on mitigating drought impact on the strategic srb agriculture subsidized with free transportation costs boe 2005 markets transferred water withdrawal entitlements instead of consumption from the utrb to the srb while paying from little to no attention to potential return flow externalities downstream the utrb even if this is legally binding boe 2003 according to spanish regulation any exchange that reduces environmental flows or damages water ecosystems should be rejected by water authorities yet the rule of positive administrative silence applies meaning that water trading is automatically allowed if there is no institutional response within a predefined time period boe 2003 in the case of the tagus segura inter basin market this possibly led to diminished return flows and reduced water availability in the trb as a whole g√≥mez et al 2013 this outcome is likely to be aggravated due to climate change magrama 2017 whose effects are already felt in the trb available water resources throughout the basin have decreased from 11 billion m3 considering the 1940 2011 series to 8 2 billion m3 considering the 1980 2011 series of which 2 7 billion m3 are committed to the portuguese part of the basin this already required adjustments in the management of available water resources including the modification of the tswt management rules trba 2016 farmers and other stakeholders notably environmental organizations in the middle trb have long contested the tswt operations claiming there is no surplus in the basin that can be spared or traded hern√°ndez mora and del moral 2015 this is opposed by farmers in the srb pwc 2013 research and studies in the area suggest there is potential for trading to enhance economic growth and social welfare without compromising downstream flows in the trb although lower than originally claimed for a review readers may refer to delac√°mara et al 2015b rey et al 2016 conflict has led to institutional lock in and the tagus segura inter basin market has not reopened since 2006 in this paper we compare the outcomes of a market where agents trade water consumption along return flows v a return flow neutral water market to assess the impacts on water availability at the outlet of the utrb as well as economic returns the impact on water availability at the outlet of the utrb serves as a proxy to assess the potential impacts of trading downstream throughout the trb a detailed assessment of downstream impacts is possible using this information but it is out of the scope of the paper note that in both the return flow neutral and non neutral markets the quantity of water that can be traded is limited by the capacity of the tswt and the water transfers already committed albeit this constraint is not binding in any of the simulations implemented suggesting the infrastructure is oversized 3 the microeconomic module 3 1 model setting in a context of droughts and water scarcity positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup modeling has been used as a means to understand the drivers of irrigators behavior and responses and to assess the repercussions

withdrawn to irrigate crop i in m3 per hectare the fraction of a i that evapotranspirates is the water consumed by each crop i or a i i e the amount of water effectively contributing to increase biomass production yield the ratio between water consumption and withdrawals i 1 n a i x i i 1 n a i x i denotes the conveyance distribution and irrigation efficiency technologies or Œ¥ accordingly water withdrawals can be converted into water consumption multiplying by Œ¥ and vice versa water consumption can be converted into water withdrawals dividing by Œ¥ the latter is done in the left hand side of eq 5 which states that water withdrawals must be lower or equal to water allocation the difference between water withdrawals and water consumption i 1 n a i x i i 1 n a i x i represents the return flows which can be non recoverable and lost to a sink escape flow regimes or more likely return to the water cycle in the form of recoverable return flows huffaker 2008 a thorough description of the remaining model constraints is available in open access format in essenfelder et al 2018 and is also provided as supplementary material to this paper provided relevant attributes z x are quantifiable a ranking of preferences among all the feasible crop portfolio choices can be established for every agent based on the utility they return positive models aim to elicit an objective function u x that ranks feasible crop portfolio choices so that the optimal decision in the model is coherent with observed choices x o which are assumed to be optimal an in depth description of the

supplementary material to this paper 3 2 data data requirements in the microeconomic module are conditional on the attributes z x explored in the calibration procedure following p√©rez blanco guti√©rrez mart√≠n 2017 we consider the following attributes 3 2 1 z 1 expected profit 11 z 1 x x œÑ œÄ where x is the chosen crop portfolio and œÄ is a vector containing the expected gross variable

yield in kg per hectare for crop i which is a piecewise biophysical function of water withdrawals a i and irrigation technology Œ¥ i e water consumption by the plant loch et al 2019 other potentially relevant inputs such as nitrate application are assumed to be constant all variables above are obtained as average values from the longitudinal database see description of the database below the microeconomic sub model used in the paper aims to test the null hypothesis of whether the expected profit attribute alone can explain agent s observed behavior i e the agent behaves as a profit maximizer within the domain guti√©rrez mart√≠n g√≥mez 2011 in some cases profit alone can explain agent s responses entirely the agent is revealed as profit maximizer and the crop portfolio is located on the efficient frontier considering only this attribute however in some other cases the observed crop portfolio is not located on the efficient frontier this may happen because the domain is not properly defined e g some relevant constraints are not properly measured or are not accounted for which can artificially shift the efficient frontier away from the origin or because agent s responses are driven by attributes other than profit while our capacity to address the former is limited by information availability and data constraints we can test whether the latter applies by introducing additional attributes into the objective function and measuring the ability of the model to reproduce observed decisions if accuracy improves see supplementary material for a description of the calibration procedure and a definition of calibration errors this can be interpreted as a proof of the relevance of that new attribute in explaining observed behavior g√≥mez lim√≥n et al 2016 sumpsi et al 1997 all attributes explored are defined so that more is better to measure the alternative attributes to be tested other than profit we set the profit maximizing crop portfolio as a reference point from which we can measure changes in those alternative attributes namely risk and management complexity avoidance for example the risk avoided as we move away from the null hypothesis of a profit maximizer individual can be measured as the difference between risk exposure under the profit maximization assumption and risk exposure under an alternative crop portfolio it is possible to observe in our database that the crop portfolio that maximizes profit typically maximizes risk and management complexity because high return crops typically display higher price volatility and are more intensive in production inputs such as labor as a result risk and management complexity are typically at its maximum when profit is maximized note that if we were to observe that riskier and more complex portfolios come along lower profit there would be no tradeoff between the attributes non convexity and the choice would be irrelevant meaning that one of the attributes is irrelevant and could be discarded 3 2 2 z 2 expected risk avoidance 13 z 2 x x œÑ v c v œÄ x x x œÑ v c v œÄ x x being v c v œÄ x the variance covariance matrix quantifying the profit dispersion of the chosen crop

values above by the maximum attribute value attainable within the domain in the srb the crop portfolio for the reference calibration year 3 3 microeconomic models for agricultural water managmeent are

utrb the crop portfolio is obtained at an agricultural district scale from magrama 2015b and converted to the awdu scale using geographically referenced information eea 2018 data on water sources water withdrawal and water application per awdu are available from srba 2014 and trba 2014 water withdrawal and application per crop and per awdu in the srb is available from the srb management plan srba 2014 2015b and from murcia regional statistics database regi√≥n de murcia 2015 for the utrb instead information pertaining to water withdrawal and application in the utrb is available from the trb management plan trba 2014 but it is estimated per crop or per awdu only not for both simultaneously hence water withdrawal is estimated by using the swat model for each crop and awdu individually by feeding the eco hydrologic model with the available information on crop portfolio land management operations irrigation efficiency and irrigation source and spatial distribution of crops and awdus eea 2018 trba 2014 this has the additional advantage of providing consistent water input data between the microeconomic and the hydrologic models the database is completed with information at a

sharing 3 3 market equilibria the trigger effect in the modeled market is the emergence of a water shortage in the receiving end of the inter basin transfer which creates a supply demand gap that can be partly filled in using external resources from the donor basin it is assumed that the donor basin is under normality otherwise the market is not activated strengthening the water constraint typically precludes some previously realized crop portfolio choices and depresses utility agents in the receiving basin will be willing to acquire water from the donor basin if its price is lower than the foregone utility caused by the shortage while agents in the donor basin will be willing to sell water if the compensation received is larger than the foregone utility caused by the water sale the pmaup model is used to simulate the repercussions of such inter basin market first agents solve the optimization problem in eq 1 4 for marginal decreases of the water constraint w g see eq 5 next the foregone utility for every water constraint w g considered relative to the baseline scenario without trading water restriction g 0 is calculated and the compensating variation that compensates the utility loss is obtained the compensating variation for a given water availability scenario in the pmaup model or c v g is defined as the minimum payment through an increase in the expected profit z 1 in eur m3 that would equalize the utility in the new water constraint scenario w g to the utility of the baseline scenario u 0 and can be mathematically expressed through the following expenditure function e p√©rez blanco and guti√©rrez mart√≠n 2017 6 c v g e u 0 w g e u 0 w 0 where the expenditure function in the baseline scenario without trading water restriction g 0 e u 0 w 0 is 0 i e since no water restriction applies the payment that keeps utility constant is zero this means that the total surplus from trading in the baseline scenario without trade is 0 also the impact on water availability within the utrb and srb is 0 since no water is traded for a given water constraint rational agents will allocate water to the crops with a higher c v g attached and then move to those with a lower c v g until available water a binding constraint is exhausted the c v g is thus the basic information we need to build the water supply ranking c v g in the donor basin from lower to higher value and demand schedules ranking c v g in the receiving basin from higher to lower value and simulate the outcome of alternative kaldor hicks efficient inter basin trading scenarios hicks 1939 without other costs agents will trade water if the compensating variation in the receiving basin c v g s r b is higher than the compensating variation in the donor basin c v g u t r b i e until 7 c v g s r b c v g u t r b however water markets typically face other significant costs that should be accounted for the question that follows is how much water can be traded after considering transportation costs i e transportation fees and interim losses from e g leakages and evaporation during the transportation and after internalizing potential return flow externalities we address this in the next paragraphs 3 3 1 return flow externalities if not properly designed and supervised water markets may reduce water availability for the environment and other downstream uses in the donor basin through return flow externalities in inter basin water transfers this is likely to occur where agents can trade water allocations w g instead of effective water consumption i 1 n w i x i which may result in the reallocation of recoverable return flows away from the selling basin to negate return flow externalities a fraction of the tradable entitlements e n v that is at least equal to the recoverable return flows from irrigation use should remain in the selling area internalizing return flow externalities increases trading costs and the equilibrium market price which is now reached where 8 c v g s r b c v g u t r b 1 e n v 3 3 2 market operation costs inter basin trading between the utrb and the srb have in the past required the intervention of public institutions and was closer

water market in the interconnected utrb and srb exploring the agro environmental tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle requires a hydro economic methodological framework calibrated for the donor area i e utrb to this end this paper couples using a sequential modular approach the microeconomic module with the swat model arnold et al 1998 swat is a comprehensive river basin scale model capable of assessing the impacts from land and water management on the hydrologic cycle and on agricultural yield at a watershed level computationally swat considers a river basin as a mosaic of smaller spatially located units defined as sub basins in turn a sub basin is further spatially split into elements known as hydrological response units hrus an hru in turn is defined as lumped land areas belonging to a sub basin with unique land cover soil slope and management combination fiseha et al 2014 which together form the main inputs to the swat model such subdivision enables the swat model to reflect differences in hydrologic processes as a response from the various land cover and soil types in a watershed both temporally and spatially and also the consequences of human land management actions on eco hydrologic processes krysanova and arnold 2008 land management routines commonly simulated in swat are crop growing and harvesting tillage and irrigation application moreover swat allows for water to be transferred from one water body to any other reservoir or reach in the watershed or outside of the main watershed by means of the consumptive use functionality neitsch et al 2011 thus allowing for the simulation of the water removed from the utrb by means of the tswt swat allows water to be removed from a shallow aquifer a deep aquifer a reach a pond or a reservoir within any sub basin in the watershed swat simulates the hydrologic processes of a river basin in two different yet integrated phases i the land phase and ii the routing phase the land phase is responsible for controlling the amount of water sediment nutrient and pesticide loadings to the main channel in each hru and sub basin while the routing phase is responsible for the computation of the movement of water sediments nutrients and pesticides loadings through the channel network of a watershed neitsch et al 2011 being capable of simulating both hydrologic and land phase processes and due to the fact that the model can simulate human management actions on agricultural systems swat is a relevant tool for studying the connections between human actions on water systems such as for the estimation of water availability at the outlet of the utrb under alternative water scarcity and return flow scenarios 4 2 data the swat model requires a variety of input parameters including information on topography land use soil and hydro meteorological data the digital elevation model dem covering the study is obtained at a spatial resolution of 25x25m from the instituto geogr√°fico nacional de espa√±a ign 2017 the soil information used is the soil geographical database for europe sgdbe v2 0 obtained for whole europe at a scale of 1 1 000 000 from the european soil database the

meteorological data is obtained at a daily level from 1979 to 2014 and covering the utrb and srb areas from the swat global weather data fuka et al 2014 hydrologic units and the hydrologic network in the case study area are obtained from the confederaci√≥n hidrogr√°fica del segura srba ide 2016 and the confederaci√≥n hidrogr√°fica del tajo trba ide 2017 the spatial characterization of the socio

coupled hydroeconomic model the coupling approach builds on previous work by the authors in essenfelder et al 2018 which combines swat hrus with pmaup s basic computational unit the awdus to create a spatial entity composed of unique land use land management soil topographic and economic characteristics the hydro economic representative unit heru as compared to hrus which are purely physical entities herus offer the advantage of accounting for the decision making process that led to opting for a particular crop portfolio land management schedule and or water trading quantity thereby representing the capability of economic agents within a particular heru of adapting where given the opportunity accordingly herus can be seen as an entity endowed with decision making capability where decisions are taken by the pmaup module and reflected in the swat model as variations in land and water management such as changes in the daily curve number and potential runoff due to land use changes changes in the land phase of swat are carried downstream in the hydrologic cycle of the watershed during the routing phase affecting processes such as stream network flow and reservoirs inflow and outflow processes in turn eco hydrologic outputs that are regarded as relevant in the decision making process of economic agents are passed from the hydrologic module to the economic module notably water availability in eq 5 consequently herus enable the identification of and communication within a common spatial unit among human and water systems essenfelder et al 2018 fig 2 exemplifies how information is exchanged between the pmaup and swat models in a water trading context feedbacks between the microeconomic and hydrologic modules are considered in the modular framework allowing for changes in either water or human systems to affect the dynamics of the whole integrated modular framework in our application non return flow neutral water markets can affect the availability of water for irrigation purposes downstream of the tswt s intake as a result of i the water traded to the srb which is subtracted from the utrb streamflow during the irrigation campaign at the point the tswt links with the utrb and ii the crop portfolio choices of economic agents in the utrb which can impact land use and the rainfall runoff process to spatially connect the crop portfolio of economic agents i e vector x in eqs 1 4 with the land cover and land management as considered by the swat model two considerations are necessary i different combinations of crops and management schemes in the pmaup model i e x vector in eqs 1 4 are assumed to be same crop varieties but under different management schemes in swat and ii due to a limit of land cover classes that can be handled by arcswat winchell et al 2007 during the hru definition phase crops that cover small relative areas are grouped into a same crop variety e g different grape varieties are considered simply as vineyards as compared to previous work in essenfelder et al 2018 the number of crops managed in the coupling protocol has been expanded to allow a more extensive list of combinations between crop varieties and management operations which previously limited the number of crops and forced the merge of similar crops into a representative crop variety this makes possible to individually represent all relevant crop varieties representing at least 0 5 of total agricultural land in the utrb for the utrb the swat model considers a total of 15 different land cover classes 2 different irrigation management schemes i e irrigated or rainfed irrigation 17 economic agents and 14 soil classes producing a final number of 42 sub basins and 1522 herus the increase in the number of crops that can be modeled is feasible due to the automatization of the land use protocol that exchanges information between the models allowing for faster analysis more efficient hydro economic modeling and simulation and more comprehensive scenario analysis for the coupling to work two assumptions are made following essenfelder et al 2018 i the decisions taken by farmers at the beginning of the irrigation season are unchanged throughout the crop growing season this is done to circumvent the temporal divergence between the pmaup which operates on a yearly basis and the swat which operates on a daily basis and ii feedbacks from the swat to the pmaup model are transferred as yearly average values consistent with the definition of the attributes in the pmaup model in section 2 3 6 results 6 1 model calibration 6 1 1 the microeconomic module the pmaup model is calibrated for the 17 awdus of the utrb and the 24 awdus of the srb connected to the tswt estimates of awdu s utility function parameters and the

with high confidence 10 average error in all but 3 awdus which display a moderate 15 calibration error medium confidence p√©rez blanco et al 2015 6 1 2 the eco hydrologic module the calibration of the swat model is done for the utrb the selling basin with the assistance of the swat cup software abbaspour et al 2007 one of the most common procedures utilized in swat cup is the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 performs a combined optimization and uncertainty analysis using a global search procedure and can deal with a large number of parameters through latin hypercube sampling abbaspour et al 2004 the calibration process is done by running a number of iterations varying from 500 to 999 for each calibration cycle whereas the first calibration cycle always runs 999 iterations as for the objective function both nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias are utilized as metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the calibration and validation processes moriasi et al 2007 seven stream gauge stations are used for calibrating the swat model as shown in fig 3 to incorporate the hydrologic consequences of the operation of the tswt water that is transferred from the utrb is considered as consumed water in the swat model being exported from the watershed swat considers consumptive water use to vary from month to month at an average rate neitsch et al 2011 for each month in a year during the simulation period an average daily volume of water is removed from the specified water consumptive source for this reason stream gauge stations at the outlet of reservoirs and downstream of the tswt i e 3007 bolarque 3043 buend√≠a and 3006 entrepe√±as see fig 3 are not considered for validation purposes being considered instead as daily measured reservoir outflows during the calibration phase the final model performance evaluation metric results are shown in table 2 6 2 simulation scenarios 6 2 1 supply scenarios supply scenarios are articulated through production costs and are obtained from the combination of the compensating variation values obtained for the utrb c v g u t r b and return flow and transportation and market operation costs scenarios see eq 10 production costs are obtained for each awdu separately and then aggregated and ranked considering all awdus to reveal the supply schedule 6 2 2 return flows available estimates of return flows from agricultural water use in the trb set the value of e n v close to 19 e n v 19 yet no specific accounting is available for the utrb where irrigation efficiency is on average lower than in the rest of the basin trba 2014 in this context the precautionary principle advises to limit trading to the seller s consumptive water use cons huffaker and whittlesey 2000 so that for each seller env 1 c o n s in the awdus of the utrb cons ranges between 41 and 85 6 2 3 market operation costs following the estimations by montilla l√≥pez et al 2018 for the segura and j√∫car basins in spain market operation costs can represent up to 0 03 eurocents m3 f mo 03 although they can also be subsidized f mo 0 as happened in previous interbasin exchanges through the tswt 6 2 4 transportation costs water traded through the tswt covers between 242 km length of the water transfer itself and 300 km length of the tswt plus that of other canals used for the distribution of the water within the srb depending on its destination as a result water transfers through this infrastructure face significant transportation costs transportation fees for the tswt equal 10 eurocents m3 f ts 1 and interim losses are estimated at 10 l ats 0 1 srba 2014 trba 2014 it is worthy of note that in past inter basin trading experiences public subsidization sent transportation fees down to zero boe 2005 two transportation and market operation costs scenarios are considered regular transportation f ts 1 and market operation f mo 03 fees scenario and subsidized transportation f ts 0 and market operation f mo 0 fees scenario three return flow scenarios are considered including precautionary approach env 1 c o n s 19 return flow env 19 no return flow env 0 this results in a total of 6 possible supply scenarios and supply schedules s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 see table 3 in order to maintain the management of the reservoirs consistent between the different scenarios and moreover because of the fact that stream gauge stations at the outlet of reservoirs and downstream of the tswt are considered as daily measured reservoir outflows that reflect the management of the reservoirs the amount of water stored during each simulation day in swat is kept constant amongst all scenarios while the reservoirs outflow are variable this means that depending on the amount of water that is transferred through the tswt the amount of water released from the buend√≠a and entrepe√±as reservoirs might be lower than the amount of water released in the baseline scenario without trading the assumption of a consistent management of reservoirs between the scenarios is fundamental for allowing a coherent and understandable assessment and comparison of the impacts of selected scenarios on irrigation water availability and return flows while ensuring the buend√≠a and entrepe√±as reservoirs are not depleted note that reservoirs are located at the outlet of the utrb and the system downstream the reservoirs is not modeled in our application this assumption could be abandoned to assess the consequences of alternative policies using this model e g alternative reservoir management options particularly if downstream systems are represented 6 2 5 demand scenarios demand scenarios are obtained from the compensating variation values obtained for the srb c v g s r b under alternative drought scenarios three drought scenarios are considered defined in accordance to planned drought responses in the srb s dmp srba 2008 prealert where water allocation is reduced by 10 accordingly the water allocation constraint in eq 5 is progressively strengthened in every awdu of the srb to reveal c v g s r b which is then ranked among all awdus to reveal the demand schedule alert where water allocation in every awdu is reduced by 25 emergency where water allocation in every awdu is reduced by 50 in all scenarios it is assumed the trb is under normality i e no drought otherwise trading is not permitted trba 2014 each alternative water allocation constraint in the srb reveals a unique demand schedule resulting in 3 possible demand scenarios which together with supply scenarios result in 18 water market scenarios 3 demand scenarios for each of the 6 supply scenarios 6 3 simulation results 6 3 1 the microeconomic module water availability is limited at regular intervals of 1 for every awdu in the market from 0 to 50 for every water constraint considered agents solve the optimization problem in eqs 1 4 and select the crop portfolio that maximizes utility within the domain next the foregone utility and the compensating variation that keeps utility constant are estimated and the supply and demand schedules are obtained in accordance to the supply and demand scenarios defined in section 6 2 fig 4 shows the market equilibria for each possible combination of supply and demand scenarios table 4 offers detail on the equilibrium price quantity and producer s and consumer s surpluses while fig 5 shows the crop portfolio for selected crops in the utrb wheat barley corn sunflower rye and oats under every water market scenario a critical input to the swat model more restrictive trading conditions lead to higher equilibrium prices and reduce quantities traded as well as consumer s and producer s surpluses the producer s surplus is the benefit of the producer seller i e the area between the equilibrium price and suppliers bid prices willingness to accept along the supply schedule while the consumer s surplus is the benefit of the consumer buyer i e the area between the consumers bid price willingness to pay along the demand schedule and the equilibrium price a net reduction of the total surplus consumer s plus producer s surplus from one scenario to another 4 4 note that under the baseline there is no trading and therefore the quantity traded and total surplus are both 0 negatively affects returns from trade and market performance for example under emergency in the srb the most restrictive supply scenario s6 yields a price that is almost twice as high as that of the least restrictive supply scenario s1 1 21 v 0 63 eur m3 this halves water trading from 58 8 in s1 to 29 6 million m3 in s6 and reduces the total surplus by 37 5 eur 80 2 million in s1 under emergency v eur 50 1 million in s6 under emergency on the other hand and as we will see in the next subsection relevant impacts on water bodies occur as we move away from return flow neutrality s5 s6 we will further reflect on this tradeoff in the discussion section trading constrains water availability in the utrb and results in a shift from irrigated to rainfed crops accordingly the surface of rainfed irrigated barley corn and wheat in the utrb grows diminishes consistently along with irrigation restrictions and higher water demand from the srb the more restrictive the water constraint becomes in the srb demand scenario the more surface allotted to less water intensive or rainfed crops results observed during emergency drought in the srb are consistent with those observed during the past inter basin trading in 2006 magrama 2015b 6 3 2 the eco hydrologic module the crop portfolio and water allocation choices for each supply and demand scenarios in the microeconomic module are used as inputs in the eco hydrologic module to assess their repercussions on the utrb s hydrologic cycle hydrologic simulations are run for the year 2013 while the period from 2010 to 2012 is used to warm up the hydrologic model water traded from the utrb to the srb is taken from the reservoirs 3043 buend√≠a and 3006 entrepe√±as outflows of the reservoirs are adjusted at a daily basis in order to keep water storage levels consistent with the baseline scenario without trading table 5 summarises the hydrologic impacts resulting from the interbasin water market on the donor basin the first row of table 5 displays how much water is traded i e removed from the utrb average water storage in the utrb s reservoirs constant and reservoirs outflows for each of supply and demand scenarios it is possible to verify that the volume of water traded in the hydrologic module is consistent with the water quantity traded at market equilibria table 4 moreover as previously explained the volume of water in the utrb s reservoirs see first row of table 5 is kept constant between scenarios in order to allow for a coherent assessment and comparison of the impacts of each scenario on irrigation water availability and return flows and to ensure that the buend√≠a and entrepe√±as reservoirs are not depleted as the volume of water stored in the reservoirs is kept constant between scenarios the reservoirs outflow is variable in order to mimic the reservoirs storage of the baseline scenario without trading as a consequence supply scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 have a higher reduction in the reservoirs outflow to match the higher amount of water traded to the srb as compared to more restrictive trading conditions with higher production costs in scenarios s5 and s6 the water that is traded from the utrb is physically removed from the reservoirs 3043 buend√≠a and 3006 entrepe√±as however this water is ultimately coming from former irrigation withdrawals that are no longer taking place in the utrb the total amount of irrigation water withdrawals of water that is reaching the field and is useful for crops i e field application and of return flows in the utrb is shown in table 5 second row the lower the production costs of the supply scenario the lower the volume of irrigation withdrawals in the utrb i e the higher the volume traded towards the srb and the higher the reduction of total irrigation withdrawals as compared to the baseline scenario without trading the same pattern is observed for field application and return flows accordingly the most restrictive supply scenario i e s6 yields the highest irrigation withdrawals field application and return flow values the influence of water trading has also consequences on the water balance of the utrb the third row of table 5 shows for each water market scenario the reduction as compared to the baseline scenario without trading in three variables describing fundamental water balance processes in the utrb evapotranspiration surface runoff and water yield evapotranspiration is reduced in all supply demand scenarios evapotranspiration is strictly connected with the reduction of field application water as shown in the table 5 second row similarly surface runoff is reduced in all scenarios being strictly connected instead with the reduction of return flows shown in table 5 second row this is because the water that is traded from the utrb is ultimately coming from reduced irrigation withdrawals which in turn affect the water balance of the donor basin this is clearly shown through the negative changes in water yield table 5 third row a process that shows the volume of water from land areas contributing to streamflow and sums up all the effects of reduced irrigation withdrawals on the water balance of land areas due to the diminishing water yield it is expected a reduction in the utrb s streamflow an information that is shown in table 5 fourth row as shown above less restrictive trading conditions i e s1 s2 s3 and s4 lead to lower total outflow values in the utrb due to higher amounts of water traded to the srb while more restrictive trading conditions i e s5 and s6 are flow neutral scenarios in order to be flow neutral scenarios agents under s5 and s6 are required to reduce their total field application by the same amount as the total water traded from the utrb as a consequence surface runoff and groundwater recharge are also reduced due to decreased return flows however due to lower abstractions of water from the stream channels the basin wide streamflow impact is neutral as shown in the fourth row of table 5 in contrast the less restrictive supply scenario i e s1 yields the highest reduction in streamflow varying from between 3 41 and 9 12 during the crop growing season 1 66 or 15 9 m m3 yearly under the prealert demand scenario to between 4 97 and 10 52 during the crop growing season 1 93 or 18 6 m m3 yearly under the emergency demand scenario to put these number in perspective the total amount of streamflow reduction in s1 during the emergency demand scenario is equivalent to approximately 31 2 of the total yearly irrigation field application water of the whole utrb during the baseline scenario 7 discussion under prealert conditions in the srb less restrictive trading conditions in s1 the scenario that reflects the trading rules applied in the water market of 2005 2006 lead to significant streamflow reduction in the utrb and limited market performance improvements for each m3 of foregone streamflow as compared to the return flow neutral scenario s6 total economic surplus in s1 increases by eur 2 on average this suggests that the excess water traded under prealert in s1 as compared to s6 is largely applied to low value added crops in the srb however under emergency alert in the srb trading can significantly contribute to enhance total economic surplus up to eur 80 2 44 4 million in s1 or 1 63 1 05 eur m3 for each m3 of foregone streamflow as compared to the return flow neutral scenario s6 this suggests that excess water traded under emergency and alert in s1 as compared to s6 is largely applied to high value added crops in the srb fig 6 plots the additional economic surplus attainable in every market scenario against the resulting streamflow reduction the results shown in fig 6 confirm the existence of significant trading return flow tradeoffs in the tagus segura inter basin market under severe drought conditions in the srb significant economic rents can be captured by means of trading the non consumptive fraction away from the selling basin as happened in the 2005 2006 water market with negative impacts on streamflow although water policy often assumes the capacity of public institutions to deploy resource reallocation instruments in line with collectively agreed water policy objectives factors such as incomplete information and political entanglement condition the success of reorganization attempts through institutional transaction costs g√≥mez et al 2017 transaction costs may represent a barrier for institutions to apply return flow neutrality as well as additional rules to prevent other negative impacts of trading on streamflow and the environment e g transportation and market operation costs recovery notably institutions overseeing the market need to understand calculate and enforce return flows to set tradable permits that do not interfere with third parties downstream and this may take significant time and resources loch and gregg 2018 particularly where this is done on a farm by farm basis albeit technologies such as metering devices and remote sensing e g observing soil humidity can significantly reduce these costs also return flow ratios can also be estimated at a larger scale than the farm level to reduce transaction costs although this would come at the expense of rewarding underperforming farmers and penalizing those who outperform the average farmer all the above will necessarily rely on studies that quantify and make visible trading return flow tradeoffs so that environmental and economic performance can be balanced in a transparent way using the best possible information this need is further amplified by the exhaustion of conventional incremental supply side responses to droughts and scarcity e g reservoirs canals wells in areas like the srb the use of new supplies from outside the traditional boundaries of the basin through desalination and the tswt have not made a meaningful contribution either the high costs of desalinated water between 7 and 1 eur m3 are typically above irrigators willingness to pay for water srba 2014 moreover the tswt infrastructure is not a binding constraint in our simulations not even in the least restrictive water market scenarios suggesting this infrastructure is oversized and there is much excess capacity even after factoring trading in in a context of basin closure and inelastic supply as happens in the srb where water supply falls short of commitments to fulfill demand effective responses to droughts and scarcity will necessarily be driven by demand side policies e g markets quotas charges that reallocate available resources oecd 2015 yet demand side policies are not panaceas meinzen dick 2007 sensible and coordinated governance built on robust interdisciplinary and comprehensive scientific evidence are necessary to achieve the greatest collective good within the range of feasible actions an in depth analysis of the complex and interconnected dynamics of nonlinear human water systems is necessary to take informed decisions avoid the reinforcement of trajectories based on exhausted responses and minimize risks in decision making anderies et al 2006 8 conclusion water markets offer a means to enhance economic growth and improve social welfare however unless third party water uses that are not directly involved in the trading are not explicitly considered in an integrative hydro economic framework e g including the environment but also other economic uses such as irrigators downstream trading may fail to promote sustainable economic growth in this context information describing both the socio economic and environmental impacts of trading is necessary to underpin the implementation of water markets this paper couples using a sequential modular approach a pmaup microeconomic model with the swat eco hydrologic model to i assess the economic viability and water reallocation potential of a return flow neutral inter basin water market and ii explore the trading return flow tradeoffs that stem from relaxing the neutrality principle methods are applied to the case of agricultural water markets in the tagus segura interconnected river basins in spain results show that permissive water markets that disregard reserves for return flows and subsidize transportation and market operation costs s1 can reduce streamflow in the utrb between 15 9 prealert and 18 5 emergency million m3 i e between 1 7 and 2 0 yearly and between 3 4 and 10 5 during months in the crop growing season under drought conditions negatively affecting environmental and other uses downstream on the other hand implementing a return flow neutral water market and charging transportation and market operation costs to traders s6 would reduce total economic surplus between eur 3 13 prealert and 30 15 emergency million during drought as compared to the permissive water market s1 further research can contribute to fine tune and extend the modeling approach presented in this paper the pmaup model could be improved by including additional attributes such as the impact of forecasts e g climate forecasts on agents responses or by including additional viable crops into the portfolio although this is conditional on the data availability in the case study site in the swat model water removals from selling watersheds could be expanded to be considered under a variable daily regime rather than the current monthly average the framework presented in this paper could also benefit from the inclusion of additional calibration methods see p√©rez blanco guti√©rrez mart√≠n 2017 for a description of the calibration methods available in the pmaup model and or models at each system scale human and or water system to sample uncertainty and allow for the application of robust decision making methods to deal with the knightian or deep uncertainty inherent to complex social ecological systems such as human water systems in addition integration with other human e g macroeconomy and ecological e g climate systems can help to better understand the behavior of linked socioecological systems beyond the current human microeconomy water interface such multi model multi system ensemble framework would allow a more profound understanding of the complex interlinkages between and within social and ecological systems and could eventually support policy makers in the identification of cost effective and robust water adaptation responses finally the scalable framework proposed here could be expanded to assess the economic impact of reduced return flows and streamflow on third party economic uses such as industry although the value of this contribution for the agricultural utrb would be limited other basins where non agricultural uses are more relevant would benefit from it

5658,recent changes in climate anthropogenic activities and land use patterns have significantly altered the hydrological cycle and thus led to the presence of non stationarity in hydrological data series existing conventional approaches for hydrological frequency analysis hfa have commonly overlooked non stationarity and consequently they might produce false estimates of hydrological design events assessing the effect of non stationarity through uncertainty quantification is a potentially feasible approach for hfa this paper proposed to incorporate the particle filter pf into hfa here flood frequency analysis ffa was exemplified named pf ffa for quantifying prediction uncertainty in flood quantile estimates the feasibility of the pf ffa was verified through comparison with the conventional l moment based ffa lm ffa as well as the random sampling based ffa rs ffa in terms of both accuracy and precision respectively using several selected evaluation indices furthermore the comparison of the use of constant and varying shape parameter in the pf ffa demonstrated that the use of constant shape parameter would deteriorate the performance in both accuracy and precision especially for datasets showing a high level degree of non stationarity through these elaborate investigations the pf ffa was shown to be an effective approach when dealing with non stationary datasets as it successfully captured the effect of non stationarity compared to the lm ffa and rs ffa keywords flood frequency analysis particle filter non stationarity uncertainty quantification 1 introduction extreme rainfall and flooding are among the natural disasters which cause huge damage to the built environment and the eco system unfortunately the occurrence of such extreme events can never be avoided and likewise their obvious consequences more often than not the impact of extreme events significantly exceeds the resilience of society economy and environment frequently updating water resources structures for adapting to temporal changes is cost prohibitive therefore reliable information on risk and vulnerability assessment is indispensable balica et al 2013 yazdi and salehi neyshabouri 2014 for instance a reliable estimate of design flow can in fact avert an immediate need of replacing exiting infrastructures by suitably tuning their operational strategies housh 2017 therefore the hydrological frequency analysis hfa has been an important tool for water resources management typically the hfa is often carried out on the observed annual maximum series the datasets are fitted with a selected probability distribution function pdf and the distribution parameters are then estimated using several different approaches such as the l moment method hosking 1990 and the method of moment ashkar and bob√©e 1987 there are no single method and pdf that always outperforms the others as their selections are largely dependent on the datasets the conventional hfa has been developed typically on the fundamental basis that the datasets are temporally stationary namely the statistical characteristics of the datasets and consequently the distribution parameters and estimated design events remain constant drissia et al 2019 heidarpour et al 2017 however when performing the hfa hydrological datasets often violate the fundamental basis of stationarity due to the changes occurring in the hydrosphere posed by the changing climate and changes in land use etc especially recent observations in many geographical regions show extremely high magnitude floods which have never been reported before vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2015 in addition recent analysis on extreme rainfall showed that rainfall events of extreme intensity in short spell are replacing the mild to medium range long spell rainfall events roxy et al 2017 as a result the conventional hfa cannot capture the effect of non stationarity and consequently may misestimate the magnitude of design events therefore there is an increasing consensus that it is indispensable to develop feasible approaches for dealing with non stationary data in the hfa e g olsen et al 1999 kiang et al 2011 rootz√©n and katz 2013 the most recent review articles by bayazit 2015 and salas et al 2017 especially highlight the importance of developing new methods for addressing the non stationary hydrological variables to deal with non stationary datasets in the hfa several previous papers have proposed to capture the temporal evolution by introducing an additional variable for instance time salas and obeysekera 2014 and covariates e g temperature rainfall population and land use pattern khaliq et al 2006 villarini et al 2009 which have been used to explain the variations in the distribution parameters of the selected pdf from statistics point of view for non stationary datasets e g detecting temporal trend in datasets due to the violation of the ergodicity for statistical inference from data itself a priori knowledge describing the evolution of the related physical process es is required to ensure a good performance of the non stationary approach koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 in other words an appropriate model structure to capture the non stationarity is a necessity in the non stationary approach a covariate time or climate index has been commonly introduced into either the distribution parameters or moments to capture the non stationarity among the covariates time has been argued to avoid due to its lack of physical meaning in addition the dependency of the non stationarity on the covariates has often been relatively low to medium olsen et al 1999 read and vogel 2015 salas et al 2018 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 therefore it is expected that the introduction of the covariate into the analysis adds another significant source of the uncertainty a most recent study by ouarda et al 2018 demonstrated that the weakness of the nonstationary approaches lies in the uncertainty which might hinder the use of complex model for improving the fit to capture the nonstationarity therefore it has been argued that the stationary approach should be retained e g serinaldi and kilsby 2015 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 thus the approaches which include assessing uncertainty mainly for capturing the effect of the non stationarity in hfa can be considered as the promising alternative stedinger and griffis 2011 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 several methods to quantify uncertainty for the hfa have been reported in the literature for instance the uncertainty in the distribution parameters is quantified using bayesian inferencing technique with the assumption of the normal or log normal distribution in the parameters reis and stedinger 2005 however applying such an assumption to the distribution parameters may incorporate bias in the estimation sen and bhattacharya 2018 model structure uncertainty was investigated by tang 1980 through averaging design flood estimation from different pdfs the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method glue cameron and beven 2000 and the limits of acceptability approach blazkova and beven 2009 an improvisation of the glue approach have been adopted to quantify the distribution parameter uncertainty in the hfa in addition several papers have applied the monte carlo simulation approach lee and kim 2008 liang et al 2012 to construct an unbiased distribution furthermore obeysekera and salas 2014 compared various uncertainty quantification approaches including delta and profile likelihood method analytical method bootstrap method statistical method and concluded that each method has its own merits and demerits which are evaluated in terms of computational efficiency simplicity in mathematical formulation assumption on asymptotic property of maximum likelihood and symmetric confidence interval note that most of these aforementioned existing parametric uncertainty quantification approaches are performed in a forward manner such that they are typically computationally expensive and are not expected to be always optimal zucchini and adamson 1989 in addition a recent study by kasiviswanathan et al 2017 demonstrated that the use of the newly developed two stage approach can successfully capture the uncertainty in terms of prediction interval in estimated quantiles this two stage approach consists of estimating the initial distribution parameters and then quantifying the prediction interval uncertainty of quantiles through the combination of the ensemble simulation and the multi objective optimization this approach however cannot represent a true level of uncertainty due to the absence of a quantitative linkage of the prediction interval with probability on the contrary an inverse approach which quantifies the uncertainty in prediction and subsequently maps it into parameter space inversely could be feasible for assessing parametric uncertainty it should be noted that similar to the forward approach the inverse approach also defines the uncertainty in the prediction level through parameter uncertainty however with inverse approach the prediction uncertainty in the form of error or error covariance in the model prediction is estimated first which is then inversely mapped as feedback to parameter space to update its prior belief bayesian filtering beck 2010 classified as an inverse approach has emerged as an efficient alternative for uncertainty quantification particle filter pf method moral 1996 being from the family of bayesian filtering techniques has been acknowledged as a robust approach arulampalam et al 2002 and it is capable of handling nonlinear models as well as non gaussian model parameters the pf has been widely applied in several fields including the parameter estimation in hydrological modelling zhang et al 2017 abbaszadeh et al 2018 moradkhani et al 2018 pathiraja et al 2018 and flood forecasting xu et al 2017 as discussed previously when datasets are non stationary the difficulty in identifying the model structure to describe the non stationarity challenges the use of the non stationary ffa in practices in hydrological modeling and analysis including ffa uncertainty originates from various sources including observation model structure and parameters and imperfect or unknown information due to ignorance and or indolence of some physical processes the violation of the stationary assumption also hinders the use of the conventional ffa therefore if using the stationary ffa framework to deal with non stationary datasets the uncertainty from the apparent ignorance of the non stationary which might be a primary uncertainty source in such cases should be taken into account in both the theory and hydrological modelling pf has been demonstrated to be a promising way to quantifying uncertainty it may be noted that the proposed approach is not an extension or alternative of the method developed by kasiviswanathan et al 2017 as it quantifies the level of uncertainty in a completely different way and has the potential to represent the level of uncertainty associated with probability therefore this paper proposed to incorporate the pf into the hfa in which the pf is used to optimally estimate the distribution parameters along with their uncertainties especially resulting from the non stationarity of datasets and thus to quantify the uncertainty in flood quantiles in this paper the proposed approach was exemplified for the flood frequency analysis ffa thus the proposed approach is named as pf ffa throughout this paper to employ the pf ffa the system was defined in a state space domain which was introduced in this paper the pf ffa was demonstrated and verified through a case study in which annual maximum daily flow series collected from two flow gauge stations on the bow river in alberta canada were analyzed this paper also further demonstrated the efficacy of the pf ffa through comparing it with the conventional l moment lm based ffa lm ffa and random sampling based ffa rs ffa approaches 2 methodology as aforementioned the effect of non stationarity in the hfa can be dealt by incorporating the stationary approach with a suitable uncertainty assessment serinaldi and kilsby 2015 thus this paper proposed to use the pf which is an inverse stochastic estimation and is realized by defining its control parameters i e distribution parameters in the hfa in the stochastic domain as stochastic variables to quantify the prediction uncertainty the descriptions of the pf as well as the evaluation of model accuracy and precision are provided in the following sections it may be noted that the hfa has been well described in literature khaliq et al 2006 and therefore is not included herein for brevity detailed comparisons were made to show the improved performance of the proposed pf ffa approach in terms of model accuracy and precision by employing l moment and random sampling approach respectively the flow chart below fig 1 describes the entire modeling framework presented in this paper 2 1 particle filtering approach the pf belongs to the family of bayesian filters that uses bayes update rule to infer new information on state estimates however differing from bayesian updating the pf does not enforce any prior belief on states ensuring unbiased estimates apart from that general bayesian updating is a very costly approach since it requires a large number of model simulations to propagate the uncertainty between parameter space and prediction space pf on the contrary employs an ensemble of particles and thus overcomes the limitations on the force of prior belief and computational demand in a typical filtering based inverse estimation problem the following two steps are recursively employed till the error covariance minimizes i bayesian belief propagation i e chapman kolmogorov equation which propagates the prior belief on the parameter estimates to the next iteration and ii subsequent correction of the propagated estimates based on their likelihood against the available measurement to execute the chapman kolmogorov equation typically a state space model of the system is prepared in the state space model the system dynamics is defined as a function of unobserved internal variables termed as states stacked in a vector termed as state vector x k the system dynamics is thus described by the temporal evolution of this state vector the estimate of the states x k at the kth time step conditioned on all its past estimates can be defined as p x k x k 1 x k 2 x 0 additionally the markov assumption made on the states enables the following modification 1 p x k x k 1 x k 2 x 0 p x k x k 1 chapman kolmogorov equation enables temporal propagation of the prior state estimates from p x k 1 y 1 k 1 to p x k y 1 k 1 by the following equation 2 p x k y 1 k 1 p x k x k 1 p x k 1 y 1 k 1 d x k 1 where p x i y j k signifies the estimate of state x at ith time step incorporating information from jth to kth time step this propagated yet unobservable state estimate p x k y 1 k 1 is subsequently observed through a second equation that maps the states to corresponding measurements and measures the corresponding likelihood i e p y k x k the current estimate of states conditioned on all the available measurements i e y 1 k is then obtained using bayesian update rule expressed as 3 p x k y 1 k p x k y 1 k 1 p y k x k p x k y 1 k 1 p y k x k d x k in filtering based parameter estimation approaches the state space model is prepared with the model parameters as its states thus differing from typical filtering for parameter estimation problems the states evolve in pseudo time with time replaced by iteration steps in the following the parameter estimation problem is defined in state space domain with parameters being the states evolving over time 4 Œ∏ k Œ∏ k 1 v k 5 y k f Œ∏ k w k where Œ∏ k is the parameter set considered in this formulation as state vector the state vector evolves over pseudo time only perturbed by a process noise v k however these system parameters and associated uncertainties are not directly observable and can only be observed through recorded measurements y k f Œ∏ k is the mapping of states that propagates the uncertainty in parameters to corresponding output for the sake of practicality this output is further assumed to be contaminated with negligible measurement noise w k that yields the recorded measurement y k typically the noises v k and w k are modelled as gaussian white noise with known covariance thus eq 4 of this state space model termed as process equation describes the dynamics of the parameters while eq 5 termed as measurement equation observes the parameters obviously due to the nonlinear mapping f Œ∏ k parameter estimation problems are inherently nonlinear in any filtering based estimations bayesian belief propagation chapman kolmogorov equation is required to be performed through an explicit analytical integration eq 2 over the entire domain of states for linear problems this step is still straight forward whereas the explicit analytical integration over the entire parameter space is not possible in case of nonlinear problems therefore the pf attempts a particle approximation of this integration by propagating the system uncertainty through a cloud of n independent parameter particles Œæ k Œæ k 1 Œæ k 2 Œæ k n replacing the integration by a summation approximation in the initiation of the pf based estimation these particles are realized from an arbitrarily selected prior distribution the parameter evolution is defined by the evolution of the particle set over time at a time step k the evolution of an arbitrary particle from Œæ k 1 i to Œæ k i is basically a random perturbation around its current position the chapman kolmogorov equation i e p Œæ k i y 1 k 1 can thus be expressed as 6 p Œæ k i y 1 k 1 p Œæ k 1 i y 1 k 1 n Œ¥ Œæ k œÉ k Œæ this probabilistic expression when written in terms of particles can be presented as 7 Œæ k i Œæ k 1 i n Œ¥ Œæ k œÉ k Œæ where the gaussian perturbation n Œ¥ Œæ k œÉ k Œæ is added to the prior belief on particle distribution to propagate them in pseudo time Œ¥ Œæ k is the magnitude and œÉ k Œæ is the spread of this perturbation added to the initial particle Œæ k 1 i we further define w Œæ k 1 i as the weight of each particle acting as the prior distribution each of these particles Œæ k i is then propagated through the process with Œæ k i being one realization for Œ∏ k and corresponding outputs are collected these predicted estimates are subsequently compared against the measured output y k and the mismatch is calculated as innovation Œµ k i 8 Œµ k i e y k f Œæ k i where e y k f Œæ k i is the error function that compares its arguments and returns the error measures the log likelihood for each of the particles is then estimated as 9 p y k Œæ k i exp Œµ k i r 1 Œµ k it with these likelihood estimates bayesian update rule is then employed to update the prior distribution of the particles i e w Œæ k i in contrast to eq 3 this operation is performed in the pf approach only on the particle set by updating their weights as 10 w Œæ k i w Œæ k 1 i p y k Œæ k i j 1 n w Œæ k 1 i p y k Œæ k i the particle approximation of the parameter estimate is then obtained as 11 Œ∏ k j 1 n w Œæ k i Œæ k i the above section details the problem definition within the filtering environment in the proposed pf ffa the distribution parameters are the Œ∏ k and the uncertainty in parameters propagates through the ffa model the nonlinear mapping namely f Œ∏ k to model outputs y k cf eq 4 and 5 2 2 evaluation of model accuracy and precision assessment of model accuracy is performed using several selected error and bias metrics the error metrics r2 and root mean square error rmse are mainly used to test how closely the model output fits with the observation an ideal value of r2 is one and it ranges from 1 1 whereas rmse ranges between 0 with 0 signifying the perfect fit mathematical expressions for these error measures are given below 12 r 2 i 1 n q i q q i q i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n q i q 2 2 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n q i q i 2 where n is the number of data points q i and q i are the observed and estimated flood quantiles at an instance i respectively q and q are the mean of the observed and estimated flood quantiles respectively the bias has been investigated through a bias index termed as normalized forecast metric bias nfm it is calculated using the following equation 14 nfm q i q i q i q i typically nfm ranges between 1 1 where high negative and positive values signify under and over estimate respectively and the value of zero signifies an ideal unbiased estimation the model precision is evaluated in terms of the prediction interval using several statistical indices including containing ratio cr average band width abw average relative band width arbw average asymmetric degree aad average deviation amplitude ada and average relative deviation amplitude arda xiong et al 2009 cr is the percentage ratio of the observations falling within the prediction interval an ideal value of cr is 100 which means that all observations are contained within the prediction interval 15 cr 1 n i 1 n c i 100 where ci is truth function that takes the value of 1 if the i th observation falls within the prediction interval q u i q i l otherwise ci is equal to 0 q u i and q l i are the upper and lower bound prediction of the i th sample respectively abw is the average bandwidth of prediction interval calculated from the difference between upper and lower limits of prediction corresponding to each observation point typically the width should be as narrow as possible and the ideal value should be zero which means that the model prediction is in turn deterministic having no uncertainty in prediction 16 abw 1 n i 1 n q u i q i l arwb is a dimensionless index and mainly useful for comparing the relative magnitude of prediction uncertainty resulted from different models it is the ratio of bandwidth to the corresponding observation at the i th sample 17 arbw 1 n i 1 n q u i q i l q i while indices cr and arw have been frequently employed in several papers zhang et al 2009 alvisi and franchini 2011 kasiviswanathan et al 2013 the asymmetry degree of prediction band of upper and lower bound trajectories with respect to observation has rarely been considered it is desirable that the prediction bound should not only cover the maximum number of observations within the minimal abw but also preferably be symmetrical about the observations xiong et al 2009 it is very difficult to model such symmetrical prediction due to high non linearity in the hydrological processes however models which render acceptable symmetrical prediction around observations would be more accurate and robust when estimating point forecast prediction xiong et al 2009 three indices including aad ada and arda have therefore been used to quantify the asymmetric degree of prediction interval about observation the formulation of these indices is mainly to assess the position of the observation relative to the middle of the prediction interval namely the degree of deviation of the prediction interval centre from the observation the aad is obtained as 18 aad 1 n i 1 n q u i q i q u i q i l 0 5 evidently aad is zero if all observations fall exactly in the middle of the prediction interval hence a value close to zero is preferred when assessing the symmetry of the prediction interval a value greater or less than zero indicates the under or over estimation of overall prediction interval index ada behaves very similar to aad however it estimates the deviation in the unit of model output for which the prediction interval is derived hence a positive or negative magnitude of ada indicates consistent under and over estimation of prediction interval respectively 19 ada 1 n i 1 n 0 5 q u i q i l q i arda the dimensionless variant of ada is mainly used for selecting the best model among the candidates that results the most symmetric prediction interval 20 arda 1 n i 1 n 0 5 q u i q i l q i q i 3 study area and data description bow glacier is a part of the wapta icefield which supplies water to bow river watershed the bow river flows through three different distinct geographical regions including mountains the foothills and the prairies where one third of the total population of alberta has a settlement snowmelt from rocky mountains contributes more than three fourth of the total river flow as a result the river has quite dynamic flow characteristics including extremely high to low flow arising from high variability in the snowfall from year to year the average annual flow in the upstream to downstream reach is adequate to meet the requirement of environmental flow for most of the year this geographic location has mixed weather conditions that vary between long cold winter to short summer the summer and winter temperatures vary largely between 12 c and 18 c while the average annual precipitation in the upper bow river ranges from 500 to 700 mm half of the precipitation is in the form of snow whereas in the middle reaches near the city of calgary receives the average annual precipitation of 412 mm in which 78 is in the form of rainfall and the remaining is snow recent flood in the year 2013 has been recorded as a calgary s worst natural disaster in its history since 1932 extremely high rainfall along with significant snow melt over rocky mountains and foothills for several days led to high water levels especially in the middle reaches of the bow river the flood resulted in significant loss of as much as 6 billion and damage to property mainly due to overland flooding rising groundwater level storm water backup and sewer backup the existing storages including dams and reservoirs that control the total volume of flow into the river systems failed to mitigate such extreme flooding due to their limited flood reduction potential in this paper the daily flow recorded at banff 05bb001 and calgary 05bh004 stations fig 2 are considered mainly for four reasons i it has a sufficiently long historical data from 1909 to 2013 at banff station and from 1912 to 2013 at calgary station ii the data is representative of upper and middle reaches of the river iii while the flow recorded at banff is completely unregulated natural the flow in particular the annual maximum daily flow at calgary is minimally affected by the upstream dams and reservoirs iv overall the data has largely varying flow magnitude to demonstrate the proposed method 4 results and discussion 4 1 investigation of nonstationarity in the datasets the annual maximum daily flow collected at banff and calgary were used to demonstrate the pf based ffa the city of calgary experienced a record flooding in 2013 with maximum flows of 439 and 1750 m3 s measured at banff and calgary respectively two data series one without 2013 flow and another including 2013 flow at each station were used these datasets are named as b1 without 2013 flow and b2 with 2013 flow at banff and c1 without 2013 flow and c2 with 2013 flow at calgary the first four statistical moments for each dataset are presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 the datasets b1 and b2 do not show large deviations in their statistics while more prominent deviations in all these statistics except mean are noted between the datasets c1 and c2 thus the inclusion of the single data point 2013 peak flow can significantly change the statistical characteristics of the datasets especially for calgary and in turn it is expected that the inclusion of 2013 flow would result in different estimates in the ffa to test the non stationarity of the datasets the non parametric mann kendall test mkt was applied to assess the presence of monotonic trend the mkt results are also presented in table 1 if the stationarity is defined as the time invariance in the first order moment often applied in the statistically analysis for hydrological datasets in the literature the significant presence of temporal trend is indicative of the presence of non stationarity here the non parametric mann kendall test mkt was applied to assess the presence of monotonic trend the mkt results are also presented in table 1 the results clearly demonstrate the non stationarity of the datasets especially c1 and c2 as significant downward trends were detected from these two datasets in addition the temporal trends also show that the inclusion of the high peak flow in 2013 leads to the decreased magnitude of the downward trend of c2 however as also shown in table 1 the standard deviation of c2 is largely higher than that of c1 therefore the quantification of the degree of non stationarity only according to the temporal trend in the first order moment might be not sufficient it is recommended to develop a generic framework for defining the degree of non stationarity as one future research topic 4 2 selection of distribution for ffa and determination of initial conditions for the pf based on a previous study by kasiviswanathan et al 2017 conducted at the same stations current paper explored three parameter distributions including generalized extreme value distribution gev generalized pareto distribution gpd and generalized logistic distribution gl at both calgary and banff stations for the sake of brevity only gev related results pertinent to the impact of particle size and uncertainty in distribution parameters are presented note that similar results were obtained for both gpd and gl results and discussions on the performance of different distributions in terms of accuracy and precision are however presented in the following sections the estimation of the distribution parameters namely shape Œ∫ scale Œ± and location parameters Œæ initiates with a prior distribution for these parameters this initial distribution can be randomly selected and usually have no effect on the final converged solution selection of a good initial distribution may only affect the iterations to converge to the optimal solution a set of realizations for these parameters are then sampled from the prior distribution as particles n such ensemble comprising different particle sets are then propagated through the ffa and subsequently updated using the available measurements this process is performed recursively until one of the stopping criteria which are commonly employed in literature satisfies i r2 0 995 ii r2 0 95 and the number of iterations reaching 5000 or iii unlimited iterations until r2 fit is 0 95 in the pf the whole dataset is being unitized in a batch mode for multiple times denoted as iterations here two initial conditions including the number of particle size and the number of iterations are needed to be determined as the initial conditions are problem specific experimental investigation was conducted herein in fact the number of particle sets defines the final level of precision in the converged solution however with increasing number of particles the computational demand increases exponentially the improvement in accuracy and precision with respect to the increase in particle size was examined and the results are presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the use of 500 particles appear to yield sufficient accuracy for datasets b1 b2 and c1 whereas it requires at least 1000 particles for the dataset c2 to converge the particle size of beyond 1000 would aggravate the computational demand without further enhancing the model accuracy therefore the particle size of 1000 was determined for all datasets besides the number of iterations allowed for the solutions to converge should be determined in this paper a sufficiently large number of iterations was allowed so that the solution convergence was guaranteed figs 4 and 5 present a sample convergence of the three gev distribution parameters Œ± Œæ and Œ∫ for all the datasets among these four datasets the maximum number of iterations required for the parameter convergence was found from the dataset c2 which required 5000 iterations thus maximum allowable iterations were limited to 5000 provided the r2 is not less than 0 95 4 3 uncertainty in the model parameter estimation the pf yields the optimal solution that consists of a set of particles and their converged weights a particle approximation i e weighted mean can then be performed to estimate the mean position of the distribution parameters according to eq 11 figs 4 and 5 demonstrate the convergence of the particle means and covariance estimates respectively evidently the convergence is smooth and prompt occasionally and no obvious oscillation was observed when the parameters approach convergence in addition fig 6 illustrates the histogram of finally converged parameter particles for Œ± Œæ and Œ∫ of gev distribution corresponding to all four datasets b1 b2 c1 and c2 respectively furthermore these histograms were fitted with a distribution curve using kernel density estimate kde and these distributions appear to closely resemble the gaussian distribution this suggests that the variability in the parameters in fact arises from the uncertainty inherent in the model and thus is the epistemic uncertainty fig 6 also illustrates that the inclusion of 2013 flow impacted the parametric uncertainty as the parameter distributions for b2 and c2 datasets are wider than those for b1 and c1 datasets in general it can also be seen in fig 6 that the mean estimates of the scale and location parameters of the datasets b1 and c1 are not largely different from those of the datasets b2 and c2 respectively however the mean estimates of shape parameter for b1 and c1 have been observed to shift significantly from those for b2 and c2 respectively as well as the increase in parameter variability for b2 and c2 fig 6 in the following section of this paper the mean estimates of the distribution parameters and the percentage change in the parameters due to the inclusion of 2013 flood are presented in table 2 if describing the degree of non stationarity of datasets solely based on the estimated trend slopes from the mkt the inclusion of 2013 flow did not result in the increase of the degree of non stationarity however note that the inclusion of 2013 flow led to large changes in the standard deviation table 1 these suggest that the degree of non stationarity in the datasets is increased due to the inclusion of 2013 flow especially at calgary and the quantification of the degree of non stationarity needs to be considered both for the mean and variance of datasets the increase in the degree of non stationarity is reflected by the increase in uncertainty in all distribution parameters among which the shape parameter is observed to be impacted the most additionally bias in the estimates have been explored and presented in fig 7 a bias index termed as nfm bias has been calculated for all the datasets the mathematical expression for nfm bias is presented in section cf eq 14 it has been observed that the prediction is very much unbiased with nfm index distributed narrowly around zero evidently all these verification studies argue that pf ffa is capable of quantifying the uncertainty in the distribution parameters 4 4 comparison of the pf ffa and the conventional lm estimation to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed pf ffa approach the proposed method was compared against the conventional lm ffa in terms of model accuracy unlike the pf ffa the lm ffa approach is deterministic that estimates the optimal deterministic value of distribution parameters thus the particle means of the distribution parameters obtained from the pf ffa were compared against corresponding deterministic lm ffa estimates the estimated distribution parameters pertaining only to gev are presented in table 2 in addition the percentage changes in the estimates due to the inclusion of 2013 flow is also included in table 2 table 2 explicitly demonstrates that the inclusion of the extreme flow data here 2013 flood significantly affected the parameter estimates especially the shape parameters in both the pf ffa and lm ffa note that similar investigations were also conducted for gpd and gl distribution and similar results not shown here were obtained the error and bias metrics r2 and rmse were reported for all three candidate distributions in table 3 overall the pf ffa performs equivalently to the lm ffa for the datasets b1 and b2 in both datasets significant temporal trend is absent while the pf ffa is superior to the lm ffa especially in rmse for the dataset c1 and c2 recall that larger higher moments standard deviation skewness and kurtosis were calculated from c1 and c2 and that prominent changes in the higher moments were detected due to the inclusion of 2013 flood at calgary table 1 these results argue that the superiority of the pf ffa becomes more prominent when data are more spread out and skewed furthermore fig 8 illustrates the frequency curves generated by the pf ffa and lm ffa for the gev distribution as shown in fig 8 the superior performance of the pf ffa is more prominent in the tail region of the frequency curves as the pf ffa is more successful in capturing the sparse and extreme high observations in the tail region as illustrated in supplementary fig 8a similar behaviour was found in other two distributions gl and gpd fitted for the datasets b1 b2 c1 and c2 therefore the pf ffa is observed to be more adaptive to the changes in statistics of datasets and thus has the potential to deal with non stationary datasets it is expected that the annual maximum daily flow series would become more spread out and skewed under the changing climatic and hydrological conditions 4 5 quantification of prediction uncertainty the performance of the pf ffa was also assessed in terms of uncertainty in estimated quantiles using selected six indices which quantify the prediction interval of quantiles in terms of bandwidth coverage and symmetry table 4 summarizes calculated six indices for the dataset b1 b2 c1 and c2 fitted using candidate distribution functions while fig 9 presents only the prediction interval of quantile estimates for the dataset c2 with gev distribution for brevity please refer the supplementary fig 9a that illustrates the quantification of uncertainty performed by all the chosen distributions as presented in table 4 the cr is sufficiently high 96 for all cases and the prediction interval encapsulated the majority of the observations however the other two metrics for assessing the bandwidth of prediction interval namely abw and arbw demonstrated obvious variations among the three candidate distribution and between datasets with and without 2013 flow comparing these three candidate distributions it appears that a much wider bandwidth was resulted in for gpd the results also demonstrated that the inclusion of 2013 flow led to a wider bandwidth especially at calgary note that the prediction interval of quantiles having a high cr with a less bandwidth is always preferred however these two uncertainty metrics are conflicting in nature as to increase the cr a wider bandwidth would often be required kasiviswanathan et al 2017 the investigation of the conflicting nature of cr and bandwidth is beyond the scope of this paper in addition among the three candidate distributions the prediction interval quantified by both awb and arwb for gev and gl are considerably narrower than that of gpd for all datasets thus from perspective of the bandwidth of prediction interval gdp is inferior to gev and gl for all datasets b1 b2 c1 and c2 note that the selection of optimal distribution s is dependent on the statistical characteristics of the datasets and it can be challenging when multiple evaluation metrics are considered in the selection as for the symmetricity of prediction interval the pf ffa slightly under estimated the overall prediction interval for all cases as calculated aad ada and arda are all positive and aad and arda are in the ranges of 0 06 0 23 and 0 02 0 09 respectively table 4 it appears that the inclusion of 2013 flow did not lead to obvious changes in these metrics at banff b1 and b2 whereas obvious increases in these metrics were seen at calgary c1 and c2 comparing among the distributions gev is superior to gl and gpd for b1 and b2 while for c1 and c2 gl slightly outperformed gev all results suggest that gev and gl are the more suitable distribution candidates for both banff and calgary the results of both bandwidth and symmetricity of prediction interval argue that the inclusion of 2013 flood overall led to a higher degree of uncertainty as a wider bandwidth and an increased deviation from centre were identified especially at calgary these results demonstrate that the increased degree of non stationarity presenting in higher order moments of the datasets e g the standard deviation due to the addition of extremely high flow in 2013 might be associated with the increased degree of uncertainty on the other hand among all three candidate distribution gev and gl in general performed equivalently and both are superior to gpd at these two study stations these results might be explained by the fact that the selection of distribution in ffa is another measure for reducing uncertainty as discussed previously the pf ffa was found to outperform the lm ffa in terms of model accuracy to verify if the pf ffa is also superior in terms of model precision prediction interval the comparison of the pf ffa and an alternate approach for uncertainty quantification was conducted to generate the prediction uncertainty the rs ffa in which random sampling bootstrap technique is applied to sample 50 of data points in each realization was used to generate 1000 realizations and subsequently the prediction interval is quantified the use of 50 data points in the bootstrap sampling was determined through experimental runs for different percentages e g 50 70 and 90 the differences in the uncertainty metrics among these percentages appeared to be not significant not presented here for brevity the prediction interval pertaining only to c2 dataset and gev distribution obtained from the pf ffa and the rs ffa are illustrated in fig 10 as an example the mean quantile estimates produced by these two approaches are also shown in fig 10 it was observed that a much wider prediction interval which is undesired when managing water resources and designing water infrastructure was yielded by the rs ffa in addition the rs ffa is also found to be inferior to the pf ffa in terms of model accuracy as a higher r2 and a lower rmse were produced by the pf ffa these results demonstrate the efficacy of the pf ffa for quantifying uncertainty 4 6 influence of shape parameter in prediction uncertainty in many previous papers e g mondal and mujumdar 2015 that deal with non stationary datasets the shape parameter has often been assumed constant this is due to the facts that the uncertainty in the shape parameter estimated from high order moments is relatively higher than those in other two distribution parameters and consequently precise estimation of shape parameter is always computationally difficult coles 2001 northrop 2004 mondal and mujumdar 2015 argued the feasibility of the use of constant shape parameter if a high degree of non stationarity presents in datasets thus this paper also explored the uncertainty introduced through the shape parameter and a comparison between two cases in which the shape parameter was treated as a constant pf ffa d and a stochastic variable pf ffa s respectively was carried out in the pf ffa in the both pf ffa d and pr ffa s the location and scale parameters were treated as stochastic parameters the comparison was performed only for calgary s datasets c1 and c2 as the inclusion of 2013 flow led to obvious change in the prediction uncertainty the results including estimated shape parameters r2 and rmse and several uncertainty metrics are shown in table 5 as illustrated in table 5 both the pf ffa d and pf ffa s performed equivalently in terms of r2 whereas the pf ffa s obviously outperformed the pf ffa d in terms of rmse therefore the pf ffa s is overall superior to the pf ffa d in terms of model accuracy regarding the model precision the prediction interval produced by the pf ffa s contained all observations for both c1 and c2 while a low cr was yielded from the pf ffa d also the pf ffa s generated a wider bandwidth abw and arbw than the pf ffa d these results suggest that the degree of uncertainty was underestimated by the pf ffa d as of the symmetricity of the prediction interval the pf ffa s outperformed the pf ffa d as the metrics including aad ada and arda from the pf ffa s are in general lower than those from the pf ffa d especially for c2 all the results argue that the use of a constant shape parameter when conducting non stationary ffa might be questionable as the limitation on the shape parameter led to inferior performance in accuracy and precision in the model prediction especially when dealing with datasets with a high level degree of non stationarity c2 dataset here as a result it might be necessary to allow the shape parameter to vary when dealing with non stationary datasets in ffa for better capturing the extreme data point s 5 concluding remarks the conventional hfa is challenged due to the observed non stationarity in many hydrological datasets under a changing environment this paper explored if the proposed pf ffa is feasible to capture the effect of non stationarity through quantifying prediction interval namely uncertainty the applicability of the pf ffa was examined through comparing with the lm ffa and rs ffa the comparison results demonstrate that the pf ffa outperforms the lm ffa and rs ffa in terms of both accuracy and precision the superiority of the pf ffa is more prominent when dealing with datasets of a high degree of non stationarity furthermore the comparison between the pf ffa s and the pf ffa d demonstrated that allowing the shape parameter to vary in ffa is in fact beneficial since it yielded more reliable prediction intervals which contain all or majority of observations and is also more symmetric about the observations therefore the proposed pf ffa is found to be promising in dealing with non stationary datasets in ffa and capable of capturing the effect of non stationarity through quantifying uncertainty note that the pf ffa is proposed to deal with non stationarity using the prediction uncertainty which is different from the approach in which the non stationarity is modeled through introducing covariates e g time and climatic indexes into ffa this paper did not intend to compare these two different approaches but verifying the use of the prediction uncertainty in ffa when dealing with non stationary datasets however the proposed approach considers the data to be minimally noise contaminated with an assumption on the noise to be gaussian only this idealization may get violated leading to an incorrect estimation a noise robust pf based algorithm is therefore required to ensure better estimation accuracy in addition this paper assumed that the distribution parameters are independent to each other in the future studies investigating the validity of these assumptions using a spectrum of datasets is recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare

5658,recent changes in climate anthropogenic activities and land use patterns have significantly altered the hydrological cycle and thus led to the presence of non stationarity in hydrological data series existing conventional approaches for hydrological frequency analysis hfa have commonly overlooked non stationarity and consequently they might produce false estimates of hydrological design events assessing the effect of non stationarity through uncertainty quantification is a potentially feasible approach for hfa this paper proposed to incorporate the particle filter pf into hfa here flood frequency analysis ffa was exemplified named pf ffa for quantifying prediction uncertainty in flood quantile estimates the feasibility of the pf ffa was verified through comparison with the conventional l moment based ffa lm ffa as well as the random sampling based ffa rs ffa in terms of both accuracy and precision respectively using several selected evaluation indices furthermore the comparison of the use of constant and varying shape parameter in the pf ffa demonstrated that the use of constant shape parameter would deteriorate the performance in both accuracy and precision especially for datasets showing a high level degree of non stationarity through these elaborate investigations the pf ffa was shown to be an effective approach when dealing with non stationary datasets as it successfully captured the effect of non stationarity compared to the lm ffa and rs ffa keywords flood frequency analysis particle filter non stationarity uncertainty quantification 1 introduction extreme rainfall and flooding are among the natural disasters which cause huge damage to the built environment and the eco system unfortunately the occurrence of such extreme events can never be avoided and likewise their obvious consequences more often than not the impact of extreme events significantly exceeds the resilience of society economy and environment frequently updating water resources structures for adapting to temporal changes is cost prohibitive therefore reliable information on risk and vulnerability assessment is indispensable balica et al 2013 yazdi and salehi neyshabouri 2014 for instance a reliable estimate of design flow can in fact avert an immediate need of replacing exiting infrastructures by suitably tuning their operational strategies housh 2017 therefore the hydrological frequency analysis hfa has been an important tool for water resources management typically the hfa is often carried out on the observed annual maximum series the datasets are fitted with a selected probability distribution function pdf and the distribution parameters are then estimated using several different approaches such as the l moment method hosking 1990 and the method of moment ashkar and bob√©e 1987 there are no single method and pdf that always outperforms the others as their selections are largely dependent on the datasets the conventional hfa has been developed typically on the fundamental basis that the datasets are temporally stationary namely the statistical characteristics of the datasets and consequently the distribution parameters and estimated design events remain constant drissia et al 2019 heidarpour et al 2017 however when performing the hfa hydrological datasets often violate the fundamental basis of stationarity due to the changes occurring in the hydrosphere posed by the changing climate and changes in land use etc especially recent observations in many geographical regions show extremely high magnitude floods which have never been reported before vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2015 in addition recent analysis on extreme rainfall showed that rainfall events of extreme intensity in short spell are replacing the mild to medium range long spell rainfall events roxy et al 2017 as a result the conventional hfa cannot capture the effect of non stationarity and consequently may misestimate the magnitude of design events therefore there is an increasing consensus that it is indispensable to develop feasible approaches for dealing with non stationary data in the hfa e g olsen et al 1999 kiang et al 2011 rootz√©n and katz 2013 the most recent review articles by bayazit 2015 and salas et al 2017 especially highlight the importance of developing new methods for addressing the non stationary hydrological variables to deal with non stationary datasets in the hfa several previous papers have proposed to capture the temporal evolution by introducing an additional variable for instance time salas and obeysekera 2014 and covariates e g temperature rainfall population and land use pattern khaliq et al 2006 villarini et al 2009 which have been used to explain the variations in the distribution parameters of the selected pdf from statistics point of view for non stationary datasets e g detecting temporal trend in datasets due to the violation of the ergodicity for statistical inference from data itself a priori knowledge describing the evolution of the related physical process es is required to ensure a good performance of the non stationary approach koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 in other words an appropriate model structure to capture the non stationarity is a necessity in the non stationary approach a covariate time or climate index has been commonly introduced into either the distribution parameters or moments to capture the non stationarity among the covariates time has been argued to avoid due to its lack of physical meaning in addition the dependency of the non stationarity on the covariates has often been relatively low to medium olsen et al 1999 read and vogel 2015 salas et al 2018 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 therefore it is expected that the introduction of the covariate into the analysis adds another significant source of the uncertainty a most recent study by ouarda et al 2018 demonstrated that the weakness of the nonstationary approaches lies in the uncertainty which might hinder the use of complex model for improving the fit to capture the nonstationarity therefore it has been argued that the stationary approach should be retained e g serinaldi and kilsby 2015 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 thus the approaches which include assessing uncertainty mainly for capturing the effect of the non stationarity in hfa can be considered as the promising alternative stedinger and griffis 2011 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 several methods to quantify uncertainty for the hfa have been reported in the literature for instance the uncertainty in the distribution parameters is quantified using bayesian inferencing technique with the assumption of the normal or log normal distribution in the parameters reis and stedinger 2005 however applying such an assumption to the distribution parameters may incorporate bias in the estimation sen and bhattacharya 2018 model structure uncertainty was investigated by tang 1980 through averaging design flood estimation from different pdfs the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method glue cameron and beven 2000 and the limits of acceptability approach blazkova and beven 2009 an improvisation of the glue approach have been adopted to quantify the distribution parameter uncertainty in the hfa in addition several papers have applied the monte carlo simulation approach lee and kim 2008 liang et al 2012 to construct an unbiased distribution furthermore obeysekera and salas 2014 compared various uncertainty quantification approaches including delta and profile likelihood method analytical method bootstrap method statistical method and concluded that each method has its own merits and demerits which are evaluated in terms of computational efficiency simplicity in mathematical formulation assumption on asymptotic property of maximum likelihood and symmetric confidence interval note that most of these aforementioned existing parametric uncertainty quantification approaches are performed in a forward manner such that they are typically computationally expensive and are not expected to be always optimal zucchini and adamson 1989 in addition a recent study by kasiviswanathan et al 2017 demonstrated that the use of the newly developed two stage approach can successfully capture the uncertainty in terms of prediction interval in estimated quantiles this two stage approach consists of estimating the initial distribution parameters and then quantifying the prediction interval uncertainty of quantiles through the combination of the ensemble simulation and the multi objective optimization this approach however cannot represent a true level of uncertainty due to the absence of a quantitative linkage of the prediction interval with probability on the contrary an inverse approach which quantifies the uncertainty in prediction and subsequently maps it into parameter space inversely could be feasible for assessing parametric uncertainty it should be noted that similar to the forward approach the inverse approach also defines the uncertainty in the prediction level through parameter uncertainty however with inverse approach the prediction uncertainty in the form of error or error covariance in the model prediction is estimated first which is then inversely mapped as feedback to parameter space to update its prior belief bayesian filtering beck 2010 classified as an inverse approach has emerged as an efficient alternative for uncertainty quantification particle filter pf method moral 1996 being from the family of bayesian filtering techniques has been acknowledged as a robust approach arulampalam et al 2002 and it is capable of handling nonlinear models as well as non gaussian model parameters the pf has been widely applied in several fields including the parameter estimation in hydrological modelling zhang et al 2017 abbaszadeh et al 2018 moradkhani et al 2018 pathiraja et al 2018 and flood forecasting xu et al 2017 as discussed previously when datasets are non stationary the difficulty in identifying the model structure to describe the non stationarity challenges the use of the non stationary ffa in practices in hydrological modeling and analysis including ffa uncertainty originates from various sources including observation model structure and parameters and imperfect or unknown information due to ignorance and or indolence of some physical processes the violation of the stationary assumption also hinders the use of the conventional ffa therefore if using the stationary ffa framework to deal with non stationary datasets the uncertainty from the apparent ignorance of the non stationary which might be a primary uncertainty source in such cases should be taken into account in both the theory and hydrological modelling pf has been demonstrated to be a promising way to quantifying uncertainty it may be noted that the proposed approach is not an extension or alternative of the method developed by kasiviswanathan et al 2017 as it quantifies the level of uncertainty in a completely different way and has the potential to represent the level of uncertainty associated with probability therefore this paper proposed to incorporate the pf into the hfa in which the pf is used to optimally estimate the distribution parameters along with their uncertainties especially resulting from the non stationarity of datasets and thus to quantify the uncertainty in flood quantiles in this paper the proposed approach was exemplified for the flood frequency analysis ffa thus the proposed approach is named as pf ffa throughout this paper to employ the pf ffa the system was defined in a state space domain which was introduced in this paper the pf ffa was demonstrated and verified through a case study in which annual maximum daily flow series collected from two flow gauge stations on the bow river in alberta canada were analyzed this paper also further demonstrated the efficacy of the pf ffa through comparing it with the conventional l moment lm based ffa lm ffa and random sampling based ffa rs ffa approaches 2 methodology as aforementioned the effect of non stationarity in the hfa can be dealt by incorporating the stationary approach with a suitable uncertainty assessment serinaldi and kilsby 2015 thus this paper proposed to use the pf which is an inverse stochastic estimation and is realized by defining its control parameters i e distribution parameters in the hfa in the stochastic domain as stochastic variables to quantify the prediction uncertainty the descriptions of the pf as well as the evaluation of model accuracy and precision are provided in the following sections it may be noted that the hfa has been well described in literature khaliq et al 2006 and therefore is not included herein for brevity detailed comparisons were made to show the improved performance of the proposed pf ffa approach in terms of model accuracy and precision by employing l moment and random sampling approach respectively the flow chart below fig 1 describes the entire modeling framework presented in this paper 2 1 particle filtering approach the pf belongs to the family of bayesian filters that uses bayes update rule to infer new information on state estimates however differing from bayesian updating the pf does not enforce any prior belief on states ensuring unbiased estimates apart from that general bayesian updating is a very costly approach since it requires a large number of model simulations to propagate the uncertainty between parameter space and prediction space pf on the contrary employs an ensemble of particles and thus overcomes the limitations on the force of prior belief and computational demand in a typical filtering based inverse estimation problem the following two steps are recursively employed till the error covariance minimizes i bayesian belief propagation i e chapman kolmogorov equation which propagates the prior belief on the parameter estimates to the next iteration and ii subsequent correction of the propagated estimates based on their likelihood against the available measurement to execute the chapman kolmogorov equation typically a state space model of the system is prepared in the state space model the system dynamics is defined as a function of unobserved internal variables termed as states stacked in a vector termed as state vector x k the system dynamics is thus described by the temporal evolution of this state vector the estimate of the states x k at the kth time step conditioned on all its past estimates can be defined as p x k x k 1 x k 2 x 0 additionally the markov assumption made on the states enables the following modification 1 p x k x k 1 x k 2 x 0 p x k x k 1 chapman kolmogorov equation enables temporal propagation of the prior state estimates from p x k 1 y 1 k 1 to p x k y 1 k 1 by the following equation 2 p x k y 1 k 1 p x k x k 1 p x k 1 y 1 k 1 d x k 1 where p x i y j k signifies the estimate of state x at ith time step incorporating information from jth to kth time step this propagated yet unobservable state estimate p x k y 1 k 1 is subsequently observed through a second equation that maps the states to corresponding measurements and measures the corresponding likelihood i e p y k x k the current estimate of states conditioned on all the available measurements i e y 1 k is then obtained using bayesian update rule expressed as 3 p x k y 1 k p x k y 1 k 1 p y k x k p x k y 1 k 1 p y k x k d x k in filtering based parameter estimation approaches the state space model is prepared with the model parameters as its states thus differing from typical filtering for parameter estimation problems the states evolve in pseudo time with time replaced by iteration steps in the following the parameter estimation problem is defined in state space domain with parameters being the states evolving over time 4 Œ∏ k Œ∏ k 1 v k 5 y k f Œ∏ k w k where Œ∏ k is the parameter set considered in this formulation as state vector the state vector evolves over pseudo time only perturbed by a process noise v k however these system parameters and associated uncertainties are not directly observable and can only be observed through recorded measurements y k f Œ∏ k is the mapping of states that propagates the uncertainty in parameters to corresponding output for the sake of practicality this output is further assumed to be contaminated with negligible measurement noise w k that yields the recorded measurement y k typically the noises v k and w k are modelled as gaussian white noise with known covariance thus eq 4 of this state space model termed as process equation describes the dynamics of the parameters while eq 5 termed as measurement equation observes the parameters obviously due to the nonlinear mapping f Œ∏ k parameter estimation problems are inherently nonlinear in any filtering based estimations bayesian belief propagation chapman kolmogorov equation is required to be performed through an explicit analytical integration eq 2 over the entire domain of states for linear problems this step is still straight forward whereas the explicit analytical integration over the entire parameter space is not possible in case of nonlinear problems therefore the pf attempts a particle approximation of this integration by propagating the system uncertainty through a cloud of n independent parameter particles Œæ k Œæ k 1 Œæ k 2 Œæ k n replacing the integration by a summation approximation in the initiation of the pf based estimation these particles are realized from an arbitrarily selected prior distribution the parameter evolution is defined by the evolution of the particle set over time at a time step k the evolution of an arbitrary particle from Œæ k 1 i to Œæ k i is basically a random perturbation around its current position the chapman kolmogorov equation i e p Œæ k i y 1 k 1 can thus be expressed as 6 p Œæ k i y 1 k 1 p Œæ k 1 i y 1 k 1 n Œ¥ Œæ k œÉ k Œæ this probabilistic expression when written in terms of particles can be presented as 7 Œæ k i Œæ k 1 i n Œ¥ Œæ k œÉ k Œæ where the gaussian perturbation n Œ¥ Œæ k œÉ k Œæ is added to the prior belief on particle distribution to propagate them in pseudo time Œ¥ Œæ k is the magnitude and œÉ k Œæ is the spread of this perturbation added to the initial particle Œæ k 1 i we further define w Œæ k 1 i as the weight of each particle acting as the prior distribution each of these particles Œæ k i is then propagated through the process with Œæ k i being one realization for Œ∏ k and corresponding outputs are collected these predicted estimates are subsequently compared against the measured output y k and the mismatch is calculated as innovation Œµ k i 8 Œµ k i e y k f Œæ k i where e y k f Œæ k i is the error function that compares its arguments and returns the error measures the log likelihood for each of the particles is then estimated as 9 p y k Œæ k i exp Œµ k i r 1 Œµ k it with these likelihood estimates bayesian update rule is then employed to update the prior distribution of the particles i e w Œæ k i in contrast to eq 3 this operation is performed in the pf approach only on the particle set by updating their weights as 10 w Œæ k i w Œæ k 1 i p y k Œæ k i j 1 n w Œæ k 1 i p y k Œæ k i the particle approximation of the parameter estimate is then obtained as 11 Œ∏ k j 1 n w Œæ k i Œæ k i the above section details the problem definition within the filtering environment in the proposed pf ffa the distribution parameters are the Œ∏ k and the uncertainty in parameters propagates through the ffa model the nonlinear mapping namely f Œ∏ k to model outputs y k cf eq 4 and 5 2 2 evaluation of model accuracy and precision assessment of model accuracy is performed using several selected error and bias metrics the error metrics r2 and root mean square error rmse are mainly used to test how closely the model output fits with the observation an ideal value of r2 is one and it ranges from 1 1 whereas rmse ranges between 0 with 0 signifying the perfect fit mathematical expressions for these error measures are given below 12 r 2 i 1 n q i q q i q i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n q i q 2 2 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n q i q i 2 where n is the number of data points q i and q i are the observed and estimated flood quantiles at an instance i respectively q and q are the mean of the observed and estimated flood quantiles respectively the bias has been investigated through a bias index termed as normalized forecast metric bias nfm it is calculated using the following equation 14 nfm q i q i q i q i typically nfm ranges between 1 1 where high negative and positive values signify under and over estimate respectively and the value of zero signifies an ideal unbiased estimation the model precision is evaluated in terms of the prediction interval using several statistical indices including containing ratio cr average band width abw average relative band width arbw average asymmetric degree aad average deviation amplitude ada and average relative deviation amplitude arda xiong et al 2009 cr is the percentage ratio of the observations falling within the prediction interval an ideal value of cr is 100 which means that all observations are contained within the prediction interval 15 cr 1 n i 1 n c i 100 where ci is truth function that takes the value of 1 if the i th observation falls within the prediction interval q u i q i l otherwise ci is equal to 0 q u i and q l i are the upper and lower bound prediction of the i th sample respectively abw is the average bandwidth of prediction interval calculated from the difference between upper and lower limits of prediction corresponding to each observation point typically the width should be as narrow as possible and the ideal value should be zero which means that the model prediction is in turn deterministic having no uncertainty in prediction 16 abw 1 n i 1 n q u i q i l arwb is a dimensionless index and mainly useful for comparing the relative magnitude of prediction uncertainty resulted from different models it is the ratio of bandwidth to the corresponding observation at the i th sample 17 arbw 1 n i 1 n q u i q i l q i while indices cr and arw have been frequently employed in several papers zhang et al 2009 alvisi and franchini 2011 kasiviswanathan et al 2013 the asymmetry degree of prediction band of upper and lower bound trajectories with respect to observation has rarely been considered it is desirable that the prediction bound should not only cover the maximum number of observations within the minimal abw but also preferably be symmetrical about the observations xiong et al 2009 it is very difficult to model such symmetrical prediction due to high non linearity in the hydrological processes however models which render acceptable symmetrical prediction around observations would be more accurate and robust when estimating point forecast prediction xiong et al 2009 three indices including aad ada and arda have therefore been used to quantify the asymmetric degree of prediction interval about observation the formulation of these indices is mainly to assess the position of the observation relative to the middle of the prediction interval namely the degree of deviation of the prediction interval centre from the observation the aad is obtained as 18 aad 1 n i 1 n q u i q i q u i q i l 0 5 evidently aad is zero if all observations fall exactly in the middle of the prediction interval hence a value close to zero is preferred when assessing the symmetry of the prediction interval a value greater or less than zero indicates the under or over estimation of overall prediction interval index ada behaves very similar to aad however it estimates the deviation in the unit of model output for which the prediction interval is derived hence a positive or negative magnitude of ada indicates consistent under and over estimation of prediction interval respectively 19 ada 1 n i 1 n 0 5 q u i q i l q i arda the dimensionless variant of ada is mainly used for selecting the best model among the candidates that results the most symmetric prediction interval 20 arda 1 n i 1 n 0 5 q u i q i l q i q i 3 study area and data description bow glacier is a part of the wapta icefield which supplies water to bow river watershed the bow river flows through three different distinct geographical regions including mountains the foothills and the prairies where one third of the total population of alberta has a settlement snowmelt from rocky mountains contributes more than three fourth of the total river flow as a result the river has quite dynamic flow characteristics including extremely high to low flow arising from high variability in the snowfall from year to year the average annual flow in the upstream to downstream reach is adequate to meet the requirement of environmental flow for most of the year this geographic location has mixed weather conditions that vary between long cold winter to short summer the summer and winter temperatures vary largely between 12 c and 18 c while the average annual precipitation in the upper bow river ranges from 500 to 700 mm half of the precipitation is in the form of snow whereas in the middle reaches near the city of calgary receives the average annual precipitation of 412 mm in which 78 is in the form of rainfall and the remaining is snow recent flood in the year 2013 has been recorded as a calgary s worst natural disaster in its history since 1932 extremely high rainfall along with significant snow melt over rocky mountains and foothills for several days led to high water levels especially in the middle reaches of the bow river the flood resulted in significant loss of as much as 6 billion and damage to property mainly due to overland flooding rising groundwater level storm water backup and sewer backup the existing storages including dams and reservoirs that control the total volume of flow into the river systems failed to mitigate such extreme flooding due to their limited flood reduction potential in this paper the daily flow recorded at banff 05bb001 and calgary 05bh004 stations fig 2 are considered mainly for four reasons i it has a sufficiently long historical data from 1909 to 2013 at banff station and from 1912 to 2013 at calgary station ii the data is representative of upper and middle reaches of the river iii while the flow recorded at banff is completely unregulated natural the flow in particular the annual maximum daily flow at calgary is minimally affected by the upstream dams and reservoirs iv overall the data has largely varying flow magnitude to demonstrate the proposed method 4 results and discussion 4 1 investigation of nonstationarity in the datasets the annual maximum daily flow collected at banff and calgary were used to demonstrate the pf based ffa the city of calgary experienced a record flooding in 2013 with maximum flows of 439 and 1750 m3 s measured at banff and calgary respectively two data series one without 2013 flow and another including 2013 flow at each station were used these datasets are named as b1 without 2013 flow and b2 with 2013 flow at banff and c1 without 2013 flow and c2 with 2013 flow at calgary the first four statistical moments for each dataset are presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 the datasets b1 and b2 do not show large deviations in their statistics while more prominent deviations in all these statistics except mean are noted between the datasets c1 and c2 thus the inclusion of the single data point 2013 peak flow can significantly change the statistical characteristics of the datasets especially for calgary and in turn it is expected that the inclusion of 2013 flow would result in different estimates in the ffa to test the non stationarity of the datasets the non parametric mann kendall test mkt was applied to assess the presence of monotonic trend the mkt results are also presented in table 1 if the stationarity is defined as the time invariance in the first order moment often applied in the statistically analysis for hydrological datasets in the literature the significant presence of temporal trend is indicative of the presence of non stationarity here the non parametric mann kendall test mkt was applied to assess the presence of monotonic trend the mkt results are also presented in table 1 the results clearly demonstrate the non stationarity of the datasets especially c1 and c2 as significant downward trends were detected from these two datasets in addition the temporal trends also show that the inclusion of the high peak flow in 2013 leads to the decreased magnitude of the downward trend of c2 however as also shown in table 1 the standard deviation of c2 is largely higher than that of c1 therefore the quantification of the degree of non stationarity only according to the temporal trend in the first order moment might be not sufficient it is recommended to develop a generic framework for defining the degree of non stationarity as one future research topic 4 2 selection of distribution for ffa and determination of initial conditions for the pf based on a previous study by kasiviswanathan et al 2017 conducted at the same stations current paper explored three parameter distributions including generalized extreme value distribution gev generalized pareto distribution gpd and generalized logistic distribution gl at both calgary and banff stations for the sake of brevity only gev related results pertinent to the impact of particle size and uncertainty in distribution parameters are presented note that similar results were obtained for both gpd and gl results and discussions on the performance of different distributions in terms of accuracy and precision are however presented in the following sections the estimation of the distribution parameters namely shape Œ∫ scale Œ± and location parameters Œæ initiates with a prior distribution for these parameters this initial distribution can be randomly selected and usually have no effect on the final converged solution selection of a good initial distribution may only affect the iterations to converge to the optimal solution a set of realizations for these parameters are then sampled from the prior distribution as particles n such ensemble comprising different particle sets are then propagated through the ffa and subsequently updated using the available measurements this process is performed recursively until one of the stopping criteria which are commonly employed in literature satisfies i r2 0 995 ii r2 0 95 and the number of iterations reaching 5000 or iii unlimited iterations until r2 fit is 0 95 in the pf the whole dataset is being unitized in a batch mode for multiple times denoted as iterations here two initial conditions including the number of particle size and the number of iterations are needed to be determined as the initial conditions are problem specific experimental investigation was conducted herein in fact the number of particle sets defines the final level of precision in the converged solution however with increasing number of particles the computational demand increases exponentially the improvement in accuracy and precision with respect to the increase in particle size was examined and the results are presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the use of 500 particles appear to yield sufficient accuracy for datasets b1 b2 and c1 whereas it requires at least 1000 particles for the dataset c2 to converge the particle size of beyond 1000 would aggravate the computational demand without further enhancing the model accuracy therefore the particle size of 1000 was determined for all datasets besides the number of iterations allowed for the solutions to converge should be determined in this paper a sufficiently large number of iterations was allowed so that the solution convergence was guaranteed figs 4 and 5 present a sample convergence of the three gev distribution parameters Œ± Œæ and Œ∫ for all the datasets among these four datasets the maximum number of iterations required for the parameter convergence was found from the dataset c2 which required 5000 iterations thus maximum allowable iterations were limited to 5000 provided the r2 is not less than 0 95 4 3 uncertainty in the model parameter estimation the pf yields the optimal solution that consists of a set of particles and their converged weights a particle approximation i e weighted mean can then be performed to estimate the mean position of the distribution parameters according to eq 11 figs 4 and 5 demonstrate the convergence of the particle means and covariance estimates respectively evidently the convergence is smooth and prompt occasionally and no obvious oscillation was observed when the parameters approach convergence in addition fig 6 illustrates the histogram of finally converged parameter particles for Œ± Œæ and Œ∫ of gev distribution corresponding to all four datasets b1 b2 c1 and c2 respectively furthermore these histograms were fitted with a distribution curve using kernel density estimate kde and these distributions appear to closely resemble the gaussian distribution this suggests that the variability in the parameters in fact arises from the uncertainty inherent in the model and thus is the epistemic uncertainty fig 6 also illustrates that the inclusion of 2013 flow impacted the parametric uncertainty as the parameter distributions for b2 and c2 datasets are wider than those for b1 and c1 datasets in general it can also be seen in fig 6 that the mean estimates of the scale and location parameters of the datasets b1 and c1 are not largely different from those of the datasets b2 and c2 respectively however the mean estimates of shape parameter for b1 and c1 have been observed to shift significantly from those for b2 and c2 respectively as well as the increase in parameter variability for b2 and c2 fig 6 in the following section of this paper the mean estimates of the distribution parameters and the percentage change in the parameters due to the inclusion of 2013 flood are presented in table 2 if describing the degree of non stationarity of datasets solely based on the estimated trend slopes from the mkt the inclusion of 2013 flow did not result in the increase of the degree of non stationarity however note that the inclusion of 2013 flow led to large changes in the standard deviation table 1 these suggest that the degree of non stationarity in the datasets is increased due to the inclusion of 2013 flow especially at calgary and the quantification of the degree of non stationarity needs to be considered both for the mean and variance of datasets the increase in the degree of non stationarity is reflected by the increase in uncertainty in all distribution parameters among which the shape parameter is observed to be impacted the most additionally bias in the estimates have been explored and presented in fig 7 a bias index termed as nfm bias has been calculated for all the datasets the mathematical expression for nfm bias is presented in section cf eq 14 it has been observed that the prediction is very much unbiased with nfm index distributed narrowly around zero evidently all these verification studies argue that pf ffa is capable of quantifying the uncertainty in the distribution parameters 4 4 comparison of the pf ffa and the conventional lm estimation to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed pf ffa approach the proposed method was compared against the conventional lm ffa in terms of model accuracy unlike the pf ffa the lm ffa approach is deterministic that estimates the optimal deterministic value of distribution parameters thus the particle means of the distribution parameters obtained from the pf ffa were compared against corresponding deterministic lm ffa estimates the estimated distribution parameters pertaining only to gev are presented in table 2 in addition the percentage changes in the estimates due to the inclusion of 2013 flow is also included in table 2 table 2 explicitly demonstrates that the inclusion of the extreme flow data here 2013 flood significantly affected the parameter estimates especially the shape parameters in both the pf ffa and lm ffa note that similar investigations were also conducted for gpd and gl distribution and similar results not shown here were obtained the error and bias metrics r2 and rmse were reported for all three candidate distributions in table 3 overall the pf ffa performs equivalently to the lm ffa for the datasets b1 and b2 in both datasets significant temporal trend is absent while the pf ffa is superior to the lm ffa especially in rmse for the dataset c1 and c2 recall that larger higher moments standard deviation skewness and kurtosis were calculated from c1 and c2 and that prominent changes in the higher moments were detected due to the inclusion of 2013 flood at calgary table 1 these results argue that the superiority of the pf ffa becomes more prominent when data are more spread out and skewed furthermore fig 8 illustrates the frequency curves generated by the pf ffa and lm ffa for the gev distribution as shown in fig 8 the superior performance of the pf ffa is more prominent in the tail region of the frequency curves as the pf ffa is more successful in capturing the sparse and extreme high observations in the tail region as illustrated in supplementary fig 8a similar behaviour was found in other two distributions gl and gpd fitted for the datasets b1 b2 c1 and c2 therefore the pf ffa is observed to be more adaptive to the changes in statistics of datasets and thus has the potential to deal with non stationary datasets it is expected that the annual maximum daily flow series would become more spread out and skewed under the changing climatic and hydrological conditions 4 5 quantification of prediction uncertainty the performance of the pf ffa was also assessed in terms of uncertainty in estimated quantiles using selected six indices which quantify the prediction interval of quantiles in terms of bandwidth coverage and symmetry table 4 summarizes calculated six indices for the dataset b1 b2 c1 and c2 fitted using candidate distribution functions while fig 9 presents only the prediction interval of quantile estimates for the dataset c2 with gev distribution for brevity please refer the supplementary fig 9a that illustrates the quantification of uncertainty performed by all the chosen distributions as presented in table 4 the cr is sufficiently high 96 for all cases and the prediction interval encapsulated the majority of the observations however the other two metrics for assessing the bandwidth of prediction interval namely abw and arbw demonstrated obvious variations among the three candidate distribution and between datasets with and without 2013 flow comparing these three candidate distributions it appears that a much wider bandwidth was resulted in for gpd the results also demonstrated that the inclusion of 2013 flow led to a wider bandwidth especially at calgary note that the prediction interval of quantiles having a high cr with a less bandwidth is always preferred however these two uncertainty metrics are conflicting in nature as to increase the cr a wider bandwidth would often be required kasiviswanathan et al 2017 the investigation of the conflicting nature of cr and bandwidth is beyond the scope of this paper in addition among the three candidate distributions the prediction interval quantified by both awb and arwb for gev and gl are considerably narrower than that of gpd for all datasets thus from perspective of the bandwidth of prediction interval gdp is inferior to gev and gl for all datasets b1 b2 c1 and c2 note that the selection of optimal distribution s is dependent on the statistical characteristics of the datasets and it can be challenging when multiple evaluation metrics are considered in the selection as for the symmetricity of prediction interval the pf ffa slightly under estimated the overall prediction interval for all cases as calculated aad ada and arda are all positive and aad and arda are in the ranges of 0 06 0 23 and 0 02 0 09 respectively table 4 it appears that the inclusion of 2013 flow did not lead to obvious changes in these metrics at banff b1 and b2 whereas obvious increases in these metrics were seen at calgary c1 and c2 comparing among the distributions gev is superior to gl and gpd for b1 and b2 while for c1 and c2 gl slightly outperformed gev all results suggest that gev and gl are the more suitable distribution candidates for both banff and calgary the results of both bandwidth and symmetricity of prediction interval argue that the inclusion of 2013 flood overall led to a higher degree of uncertainty as a wider bandwidth and an increased deviation from centre were identified especially at calgary these results demonstrate that the increased degree of non stationarity presenting in higher order moments of the datasets e g the standard deviation due to the addition of extremely high flow in 2013 might be associated with the increased degree of uncertainty on the other hand among all three candidate distribution gev and gl in general performed equivalently and both are superior to gpd at these two study stations these results might be explained by the fact that the selection of distribution in ffa is another measure for reducing uncertainty as discussed previously the pf ffa was found to outperform the lm ffa in terms of model accuracy to verify if the pf ffa is also superior in terms of model precision prediction interval the comparison of the pf ffa and an alternate approach for uncertainty quantification was conducted to generate the prediction uncertainty the rs ffa in which random sampling bootstrap technique is applied to sample 50 of data points in each realization was used to generate 1000 realizations and subsequently the prediction interval is quantified the use of 50 data points in the bootstrap sampling was determined through experimental runs for different percentages e g 50 70 and 90 the differences in the uncertainty metrics among these percentages appeared to be not significant not presented here for brevity the prediction interval pertaining only to c2 dataset and gev distribution obtained from the pf ffa and the rs ffa are illustrated in fig 10 as an example the mean quantile estimates produced by these two approaches are also shown in fig 10 it was observed that a much wider prediction interval which is undesired when managing water resources and designing water infrastructure was yielded by the rs ffa in addition the rs ffa is also found to be inferior to the pf ffa in terms of model accuracy as a higher r2 and a lower rmse were produced by the pf ffa these results demonstrate the efficacy of the pf ffa for quantifying uncertainty 4 6 influence of shape parameter in prediction uncertainty in many previous papers e g mondal and mujumdar 2015 that deal with non stationary datasets the shape parameter has often been assumed constant this is due to the facts that the uncertainty in the shape parameter estimated from high order moments is relatively higher than those in other two distribution parameters and consequently precise estimation of shape parameter is always computationally difficult coles 2001 northrop 2004 mondal and mujumdar 2015 argued the feasibility of the use of constant shape parameter if a high degree of non stationarity presents in datasets thus this paper also explored the uncertainty introduced through the shape parameter and a comparison between two cases in which the shape parameter was treated as a constant pf ffa d and a stochastic variable pf ffa s respectively was carried out in the pf ffa in the both pf ffa d and pr ffa s the location and scale parameters were treated as stochastic parameters the comparison was performed only for calgary s datasets c1 and c2 as the inclusion of 2013 flow led to obvious change in the prediction uncertainty the results including estimated shape parameters r2 and rmse and several uncertainty metrics are shown in table 5 as illustrated in table 5 both the pf ffa d and pf ffa s performed equivalently in terms of r2 whereas the pf ffa s obviously outperformed the pf ffa d in terms of rmse therefore the pf ffa s is overall superior to the pf ffa d in terms of model accuracy regarding the model precision the prediction interval produced by the pf ffa s contained all observations for both c1 and c2 while a low cr was yielded from the pf ffa d also the pf ffa s generated a wider bandwidth abw and arbw than the pf ffa d these results suggest that the degree of uncertainty was underestimated by the pf ffa d as of the symmetricity of the prediction interval the pf ffa s outperformed the pf ffa d as the metrics including aad ada and arda from the pf ffa s are in general lower than those from the pf ffa d especially for c2 all the results argue that the use of a constant shape parameter when conducting non stationary ffa might be questionable as the limitation on the shape parameter led to inferior performance in accuracy and precision in the model prediction especially when dealing with datasets with a high level degree of non stationarity c2 dataset here as a result it might be necessary to allow the shape parameter to vary when dealing with non stationary datasets in ffa for better capturing the extreme data point s 5 concluding remarks the conventional hfa is challenged due to the observed non stationarity in many hydrological datasets under a changing environment this paper explored if the proposed pf ffa is feasible to capture the effect of non stationarity through quantifying prediction interval namely uncertainty the applicability of the pf ffa was examined through comparing with the lm ffa and rs ffa the comparison results demonstrate that the pf ffa outperforms the lm ffa and rs ffa in terms of both accuracy and precision the superiority of the pf ffa is more prominent when dealing with datasets of a high degree of non stationarity furthermore the comparison between the pf ffa s and the pf ffa d demonstrated that allowing the shape parameter to vary in ffa is in fact beneficial since it yielded more reliable prediction intervals which contain all or majority of observations and is also more symmetric about the observations therefore the proposed pf ffa is found to be promising in dealing with non stationary datasets in ffa and capable of capturing the effect of non stationarity through quantifying uncertainty note that the pf ffa is proposed to deal with non stationarity using the prediction uncertainty which is different from the approach in which the non stationarity is modeled through introducing covariates e g time and climatic indexes into ffa this paper did not intend to compare these two different approaches but verifying the use of the prediction uncertainty in ffa when dealing with non stationary datasets however the proposed approach considers the data to be minimally noise contaminated with an assumption on the noise to be gaussian only this idealization may get violated leading to an incorrect estimation a noise robust pf based algorithm is therefore required to ensure better estimation accuracy in addition this paper assumed that the distribution parameters are independent to each other in the future studies investigating the validity of these assumptions using a spectrum of datasets is recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare

5659,economic pressures on natural resources have led to a modification of natural surface water patterns this has affected the hydrologic cycle at a global scale with multiple environmental and socioeconomic implications this study evaluates long term trends in surface water occurrence and related climate variables in a large agricultural catchment of australia to understand trends in evaporative water losses from open water bodies surface water detection was based on a supervised classification of landsat images between 1988 and 2018 to obtain inundation and surface water frequencies across the catchment which were compared with other surface water products climate trends were based on monthly silo gridded datasets open water evaporation was estimated using the fao56 methodology and compared with the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 pml v2 product evaporation trends were analysed using the mann kendall mk test and the sen s slope ss generally open water frequencies showed significant negative trends though these varied spatially the number of dams on the other hand had an increasing trend temperatures are increasing in the catchment while rainfall and relative humidity are decreasing resulting in an overall positive trend for reference evapotranspiration etr across 90 of the catchment even though etr and evaporation per unit area of water show positive trends lumped open water evaporation showed a negative trend possibly associated with an average decrease in surface water frequencies annual evaporative losses averaged 201 9 gl exceeding annual total account usage of surface water in the catchment all the studied changes imply a loss of blue and green water in the catchment and provide evidence of an overall intensification of the hydrologic cycle as predicted under climate change keywords surface water evaporation losses climatic trends 1 introduction the increasing anthropogenic pressure on natural resources has been widely reported castello and macedo 2015 schandl et al 2016 aukema et al 2017 visbeck 2018 this trend also includes water resources which are impacted by overexploitation affecting associated ecosystems castello and macedo 2015 dalin et al 2017 russo and lall 2017 surface water is a component of the hydrological cycle which allows both ecosystem functioning and socio economic activities davis et al 2015 however pressures on surface waters such as land use change and economic activities lead to the modification of natural surface water patterns gerbens leenes et al 2010 castello and macedo 2015 jin et al 2015 scanlon et al 2017 agriculture i e food production represents approximately 70 of blue water use water in rivers reservoirs and aquifers and around 90 of consumptive water use while domestic water consumption accounts for only 10 of water use hoekstra and chapagain 2006 davis et al 2015 scanlon et al 2017 importantly most water usage relies on surface water sources connor et al 2009 according to fao 2016 world surface water represents over 70 of total water withdrawals for consumptive use additionally gerten et al 2013 estimated global blue water consumption to be on average 1 831 km3 y 1 which corresponds to 11 2 and 65 4 of accessible blue water and the freshwater planetary boundary which if exceeded would endanger earth systems respectively meteorological variability results in a fluctuation of available blue water affecting agricultural water supplies and food security dry periods reduce available water for irrigation while wet years cause a water surplus which is transferred into runoff if no water harvesting alternatives are promoted hashemi et al 2015 scanlon et al 2016 however this also affects the availability of soil moisture green water and consequently productive evapotranspiration in most cases this temporal variability is addressed individually by farmers through building on farm dams and ring tanks while at the regional scale reservoir building is used for management cosgrove and loucks 2015 pittock 2016 both alter the natural hydrological pattern and impact environmental assets castello and macedo 2015 fowler et al 2015 however other human activities can further strengthen climatic variability effects on surface water pattern modifications for example land use changes might lead to an intensification of the hydrological cycle which modifies the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of water resources jin et al 2015 davis et al 2015 energy needs also change the natural spatiotemporal distribution of surface water through the dams for hydropower generation modifying the natural hydrological cycle on a large scale pringle et al 2000 these activities have affected the sustainability of natural resources and have also resulted in large changes in the landscape water balance castello and macedo 2015 several alternatives have been proposed for an integrated management of hydrologic resources to address these issues arguments for a more integrated approach focus on improving the sustainability of water resources and improving the environmental functioning of streams and wetlands but also consider a more efficient water use which implies reduced water losses poff et al 2015 among several alternatives to improve water storage managed aquifer recharge mar has gained attention mainly because it involves replenishing of groundwater resources by recharging aquifers in years of water surplus which can then be used in dry periods rawluk et al 2013 dillon et al 2018 additionally mar might reduce evaporation losses dillon et al 2009 dillon and arshad 2016 however few studies have analysed long term changes in surface water evaporation losses particularly at regional scales zhao and gao 2019 most studies have focused on reference and potential evapotranspiration changes with contradictory results depending on the study locations shenbin et al 2006 kingston et al 2009 wang et al 2011 dinpashoh et al 2018 since open water evaporation constitutes a response to both evaporation and open water extent dynamic changes in these might impact regional evaporation estimates in a warming global climate with spatially variable changes in frequency and intensity of rainfall westra et al 2014 ishak et al 2013 such changes need to be understood to identify optimal ways of water storage water reservoirs can involve large volumetric evaporation losses for instance zhao and gao 2019 reported annual evaporation losses from big reservoirs in the united states to be equivalent to 93 of the annual public water supply of the country craig et al 2005 reported annual evaporation losses up to 40 of farm dam storages in queensland and new south wales in australia however most studies refer to short term assessments or are based on particular water reservoirs gibson 2002 craig 2006 liu et al 2009 in contrast long term changes on surface water pattern at regional scales might lead to a change in the dynamics of evaporative losses this aspect has rarely been studied but would increase our understanding of regional water balances moreover for mar to be an acceptable alternative for water storage we need to understand the variability in evaporative losses and how this relates to open water storage and flood occurrence development of remote sensing in the last decades has improved monitoring of surface water palmer et al 2015 donchyts et al 2016 since water has a distinctive spectral signature it can be detected from space using satellites that capture the surface reflectance at different wavelengths ji et al 2009 different alternatives for water detection from surface reflectance data are possible surface reflectance images can be integrated with supervised or unsupervised classification algorithms to accurately detect surface water fuentes et al 2019a even though this methodology was better than others i e munasinghe et al 2018 it is difficult to extrapolate accurately outside the reference study areas alternatively several spectral indices have been proposed for water detection in a more automated manner gao 1996 xu 2006 feyisa et al 2014 but these require definition of empirical thresholds even though a freely available synthetic aperture radar dataset at high spatial resolution 10 m has been released sentinel 1 copernicus allowing observation of the land surface through clouds it has only been in operation for a short time from october 2014 which limits long term monitoring studies zhou et al 2017 on the other hand surface reflectance products derived from the landsat satellites have accumulated for more than 30 years of monitoring donchyts et al 2016 this dataset now offers a valuable dataset to study long term changes in surface processes and at relatively high spatial resolution 30 m this study aims to evaluate the long term trend in surface water occurrence and the associated evolution of evaporative water losses in a large agricultural catchment in australia using more than 30 years of landsat imagery and gridded climate data the study area datasets used and pre processing steps are detailed first followed by a description of the water detection method and the categorization of surface water bodies subsequently the open water evaporation methodology is described which is followed by the results and a discussion regarding the observed open water trends and their relation to evaporative losses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was based on the namoi basin located in new south wales australia fig 1 this basin was selected for this study because agriculture is strongly developed and due to its large surface area 42 000 km2 cotton is the dominant irrigated crop in the catchment covering over 60 of the irrigated area in the basin green et al 2011 cotton is highly dependent on the availability of water resources which has been supported by the building of three dams named keepit splitrock and chaffey however these dams were also designed for flood mitigation thurtell and wettin 2012 the namoi catchment is characterised by two main k√∂ppen geiger climate types humid subtropical to the east and hot steppe to the west peel et al 2007 mean annual rainfall varies between 449 and 1135 mm decreasing to the west most rainfall occurs in summer and the coefficient of variation ranges from 14 7 in the upper namoi high rainfall eastern areas that feed water reservoirs to 38 6 in lower namoi areas low rainfall areas to the west where most irrigated agriculture takes place annual pan evaporation ranges from 1000 mm to around 2200 mm and increases in a westerly direction green et al 2011 the main hydrologic feature in the catchment is the namoi river and its tributaries which have deposited the alluvial sediments on which most agriculture takes place the namoi river flows to the west from the higher elevations in the east of the catchment welsh et al 2014 streamflow variability in the catchment changes depending on the river reach with a coefficient of variation up to one order of magnitude higher than the mean streamflow 2 2 data and preprocessing steps images from the tier 1 surface reflectance collections of landsat 5 7 and 8 were used in this study the catchment is included in 8 tiles of the landsat data set fig 2 the data from 1986 to 08 19 to 2019 06 22 used in this study correspond to a total of 6 575 landsat images table 1 the bands between the different collections landsat 5 7 and landsat 8 were homogenised and clouds and shadows were removed from all images through the pixel qa band contained in the image collection additionally the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi and the modified normalised difference water index mndwi xu 2006 were calculated and added as bands of the landsat images based on 1 n d v i œÅ nir œÅ red œÅ nir œÅ red 2 m n d w i œÅ green œÅ mir œÅ green œÅ mir where œÅnir œÅred œÅgreen and œÅmir are the reflectance for landsat images in the wavelength range of approximately 0 7 0 9 0 6 0 7 0 5 0 6 and 1 5 1 7 Œºm respectively the collection was subsequently filtered to images between 1988 and 01 01 and 2019 01 01 which results in 31 years of monitoring since images before 1988 have a lower frequency this reduced the collection to a total of 6 351 landsat images gridded datasets for daily minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax mean temperature tmean mean relative humidity rhmean rainfall and short crop reference evapotranspiration etr were downloaded from the silo webpage https www longpaddock qld gov au silo for the study period this daily data has a spatial resolution of 5 km and is the result of an interpolation jeffrey et al 2001 of observed weather variables the downloaded datasets were clipped to the extent of the study catchment monthly averaged or summed and subsequently analysed additionally the water body evaporation band from the coupled evapotranspiration and gross primary product pml v2 was used as a reference to evaluate the estimated open water evaporation from the silo collection in this dataset penman evaporation was considered as the actual evaporation from the water bodies and it was derived from the gldas collection rodell et al 2004 and modis imagery zhang et al 2019 the smoothed australian digital elevation model dem s was used in the water detection gallant et al 2011 and discharge data from a gauging station located in the namoi river at goangra in the western downstream reach of the catchment was also used it was downloaded from the water nsw webpage https realtimedata waternsw com au in order to evaluate the results of the surface water classification two surface water datasets were used these correspond to the monthly water history of the joint research centre jrc pekel et al 2016 and the water observations from space map wofs https www ga gov au scientific topics community safety flood wofs finally major reservoirs and the main path of the namoi river and its tributaries were obtained from the australian hydrologic geofabric dataset bureau of meteorology 2012 2 3 surface water detection a random forest model rf was trained with a mosaic based on eight landsat images covering the study area table 2 the images selected for training the rf classifier were based on images that coincided with flood events in the catchment two images with high solar zenith angles within the collection to differentiate between the spectral signature of water and mountain shadows and a few randomly selected images the classification used all surface reflectance bands and the ndvi and mndwi appended bands however since the study area contains flat and mountainous landscapes the slope from the dem s was also added as a band to the landsat images to serve as an additional input to the classifier table 3 the hill shadow of the images was also estimated through the dem s together with the zenithal and azimuthal angles of the images and this was appended as an additional band to the images however this band was not used to train the rf classifier but in a subsequent step in the hill shadow mask of the images polygons of the major reservoirs keepit chaffey and split rock dams and goran lake were buffered by 300 m and assumed to be free of shadows a set of 105 polygons for surface water and 245 polygons of dry land end member pixels were manually delineated from the landsat training mosaic fig 3 surface reflectance pixels within those polygons were sampled and randomly split into a training subset containing 90 of the original pixels within polygons 41 078 pixels and a validation subset containing the remaining 10 4 521 pixels the rf classifier was trained using the training subset with one rifle decision tree per class a size of terminal nodes set to 1 a fraction of input to bag per tree of 0 5 and the square root of the number of variables per split after the classification the estimated hill shadow band in the images was used to mask the classified images this takes into account that apart from some of the major reservoirs which were removed from the hill shadow mask no other water bodies are present in areas with steep terrain in the catchment the evaluation of the classification was based on a confusion matrix which gives the overall accuracy and the kappa value for the classifier and for the validation subset and also the producer and consumer accuracies the performance evaluation was based on the training mosaic image using the validation subset polygons and four other randomly selected landsat images in which 400 dry points and 100 water points were delineated additionally an annual recurrence map was obtained through the sum of maximum annual inundated areas in the catchment and a per pixel probability of water occurrence map were also used as validation sources for the implemented classifier the jrc product was used to compare the results of the rf classified dataset in addition 10 000 random points were sampled from the wofs product which only provides historical probabilities of water occurrence to compare with the probabilities of water occurrence derived from the rf classification 2 4 surface water classes and trend analysis the monthly and annual frequency of the occurrence of surface water in the classified images was analysed this was assessed for each pixel in both the classified collection and the jrc monthly water history dataset by summing the times that the pixel appears as inundated within a year or month and dividing it by the number of times that it is within the collection in the year monthly surface water frequency images were obtained for the evaluation of evaporation since this is strongly seasonal gaps in the monthly surface water data were filled by linearly interpolating the surface water frequency images assuming that surface water variation is linear three classes of inundated pixels were defined for the annual water frequencies 1 permanent water bodies with an annual frequency greater or equal than 0 75 which imply that these surfaces are inundated most of the year 2 seasonal water bodies with a frequency smaller than 0 75 and greater or equal than 0 25 which imply that these surfaces are inundated between 1 and 3 seasons per year and 3 episodic water bodies which have an annual frequency lower than 0 25 meaning inundation during less than one season per year additionally the annual average area of surface water was estimated as the sum of pixel areas multiplied by the water frequency as shown in eq 3 xia et al 2019 3 a i j 1 n a i j n i j m i j where ƒÅ is the annual lumped average surface water occurrence i j corresponds to the row and column of each pixel in the image n is the total number of pixels in the image ai j is the pixel area ni j are the times that water occurs in each pixel during the year and mi j are the times that the pixel occurs within the year on farm dams were annually evaluated assuming that these corresponded to surface water areas with a frequency higher than 0 33 and surface inundated areas between 5 000 and 500 000 m2 the resulting masked rasters were subsequently vectorized filtering out polygons that intersected the main river and reservoirs from those polygons were counted annually and their total area was estimated trend analysis of monthly data was carried out after a seasonal decomposition analysis to remove the seasonality in the data while annually lumped data was directly evaluated trends were obtained through the mann kendall mk test and the sen s slope ss these allowed quantification of the magnitude direction and the significance of trends 2 5 evaporation from open water the daily evaporation of open water bodies was calculated from the silo gridded etr data which uses the fao penman monteith equation fao56 this corresponds to the short crop etr of the asce standardised reference evapotranspiration equation eq 4 allen et al 1998 walter et al 2000 4 et r 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 c d u 2 where etr is the daily standardised etr Œ¥ is the saturation vapor pressure temperature slope rn is the net radiation g the soil heat flux Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant t is the mean daily temperature u2 the mean daily wind speed at 2 m es the saturation vapor pressure ea the actual pressure vapor and cn and cd are constant values associated to the short crops equivalent to 900 and 0 34 respectively etr was monthly and annually summed in order to get lumped etr evaporation of water surfaces can be calculated by scaling etr with a constant crop factor allen et al 1998 craig 2006 jensen 2010 as shown in eq 5 5 e a et r k c where ea is actual evaporation from open water bodies and kc is the crop coefficient which for open water bodies ranges from 1 05 to 1 25 depending on the water depth being 1 25 for deep open water bodies allen et al 1998 additionally since no flux tower measurements are available glenn et al 2011 in the study catchment the pml v2 dataset was used as a reference for validation of the estimated evaporation values the water evaporation band from this data set was sampled at 4 different locations in known surface water bodies keepit splitrock and chaffey dams and goran lake this dataset has been recognised as one of the state of the art sources for actual evapotranspiration and evaporation values and has been compared favourably with several eddy covariance flux towers zhang et al 2019 yet the pml v2 product was mainly intended for evapotranspiration monitoring from land surfaces and was not validated with open water evaporation measurements this dataset was used as a reference for validation and not directly for lumped evaporation since the time interval of the images covers from 2002 to 2017 which would lead to a reduction in the analysed time series in addition its resolution at 500 m for evaporation of water bodies neglects several of the farm dams in the catchment which have lower spatial dimensions these farm dams are one of the agricultural characteristics in the catchment for which we want to assess the evaporation for the validation estimated evaporation values from the silo dataset were averaged to the time scale of the pml v2 dataset which is based on 8 day composite images derived from modis by using the monthly surface water rasters and the total monthly evaporation rasters monthly water losses by evaporation were calculated and lumped to the catchment scale yet the spatial analysis of evaporation trends was carried out using the series of total annual evaporation 3 results 3 1 water detection the performance of the water detection method is given in table 4 overall the detection can be classified as very good for the different evaluated dates kappa greater than 0 8 and overall accuracies greater than 0 9 the lowest performance can be observed using the landsat 7 collection followed by landsat 8 in this case these are associated with lower producer s accuracy since some water bodies are not being classified as water however these omission errors are only a very small fraction of the pixels actually belonging to the different classes which explains the high accuracy and kappa values xia et al 2019 also found higher errors using landsat 7 to evaluate surface water in china other issues such as the presence of mixed pixels at the perimeter of water bodies lead to confusion in both the user reference data and the algorithm however this is more related to the resolution of the data than a problem of the algorithm which cannot be analysed with the current performance analysis the annual water recurrence map which integrates the entire collection of images is shown in fig 4 inundated areas from the recurrence map generated from landsat images are similar to products generated from modis imagery fuentes et al 2019b in the map major reservoirs in the catchment can be easily distinguished because of the high recurrence of surface water the ephemeral lake goran water body in the lower centre of the catchment can also be easily recognised and the flood inundation pattern in the catchment indicated by yellowish and greenish colours in the map follows the main alluvium in the catchment and the associated floodplains since the topography in the west of the catchment consists mainly of flat areas major inundation extents can be observed in those sectors a comparison with the 10 000 samples of the wofs product gives an r 2 of 0 91 and an rmse of 1 8 there is a bias in the data towards the wofs product not shown however wofs includes data until 2012 while the rf classification includes data from 1988 to 2018 with the period 2012 2018 characterised by worsening drought conditions which might explain this shift an annual animation of water frequencies can be found in the supplementary data in this animation the spatio temporal pattern of water frequencies can be observed and how this changes through time note also the small on farm dam water bodies showing as small blue pixels in the west of the catchment wet years such as 2010 or 2012 are clearly visible 3 2 water categories and trends the classification of surface water into episodic seasonal and permanent extents is highlighted in fig 5 for both the rf classified images and the jrc dataset all surface water fractions display some degree of temporal oscillation reflecting dry and wet periods the episodic extent responds quite obviously to large climatic events which result in floods for example flood events can be observed in 1998 2000 2010 and 2012 which coincide with discharge peaks recorded at the gauging station in the namoi river at goangra located in the western area of the catchment fig 5c while small differences in the permanent and seasonal water fractions between both datasets can be observed with a higher seasonal water fraction in the jrc compared with the rf classified images strong differences in the episodic fraction are also presented an evaluation of the classification on flood and dry dates was carried out comparing both datasets supplementary material since the jrc datasets relates to a single image per month and even though it is based on the surface reflectance images it misses large surface water extents during floods possibly associated with a smoothing effect in contrast during dry dates it leads to slightly larger water extents than the rf classified images for the lumped surface water fractions significant trends were not observed p value 0 05 using both datasets however both datasets indicated negative trends for lumped average surface water and also for permanent and episodic water fractions the mean of annual average surface water extents for the jrc and for the rf classified images was 103 5 km2 and 102 8 km2 while the coefficient of variation was 50 and 40 5 respectively average surface water extent in the catchment is autocorrelated at a 1 year time lag however after the first year the autocorrelation is not significant fig 6 there appears to be a 6 7 year non significant oscillating cycle in the autocorrelation of the surface water which may be an effect of major climatic cycles such as el ni√±o and la ni√±a even though lumped surface water fractions did not show significant trends the mk and ss analysis on the water frequency images detects negative trends in some of the main water reservoirs in the catchment over the study period fig 7 yet the p value of the trend indicates clear spatial variability results in the main water reservoirs show strong evidence of negative trends mostly on the perimeter while the ephemeral goran lake indicates significant negative trends p value 0 05 over the whole area using the jrc dataset an area of 106 km2 equivalent to 0 25 of the catchment area indicates strong evidence p values 0 05 of water frequency trends at on average 0 005 per year this implies an overall loss in surface water frequency and a reduction of around 2 days of inundation per year within this extent 18 5 km2 present strong evidence of increasing frequency trends at on average 0 017 per year the rf classified images indicated 156 km2 with strong evidence of surface water frequency changes with an average surface water frequency change of 0 004 per year within this extent 21 km2 presented positive trends of surface water frequencies at on average 0 012 per year in fig 7 blue spots in the mk and ss maps indicate positive trends which are mainly associated with on farm dams in agricultural areas the presence of on farm dams is shown in fig 8 the average number of on farm dams in the catchment is 397 using the rf classifier covering an area of 30 1 km2 using the jrc dataset an annual average of 557 dams was obtained covering 38 3 km2 however these are temporally variable in both cases oscillating depending on the total available water in the catchment for instance fig 8 shows that during wet years such as 1998 2005 2010 2012 and 2016 which correspond to years with a water surplus the number and extent of on farm dams increases while decreasing in dry years matching the climatic fluctuation in available water discharge or rainfall the coefficient of variation for the number of on farm dams and their extent in both cases averages 25 1 and 30 6 respectively additionally strong evidence p value 0 05 of an increasing number of dams occurs in both the jrc dataset and using the rf classifier with a mean sen s slope of 5 25 dam y 1 the area covered by on farm dams increased significantly p value 0 05 in the jrc dataset with a sen s slope of 0 7 km2 y 1 3 3 reference evapotranspiration and climatic trends the trend analysis of the climatic variables shows an intensification in the hydrologic cycle on the one hand temperatures minimum maximum and mean significantly increased in the last 31 years in large extents of the catchment supplementary material minimum temperatures show strong evidence of increasing temperatures in around 48 of the catchment area at a mean rate of 0 026 c year 1 but ranging between 0 027 c year 1 and 0 073 c year 1 maximum temperatures present strong evidence of increasing temperatures in 99 of the catchment extent at on average 0 043 c year 1 within a range of 0 009 c year 1 and 0 076 c year 1 mean temperatures show strong evidence of increasing in almost the entire catchment area at an average rate of 0 026 c year 1 ranging between 0 015 c year 1 and 0 047 c year 1 on the other hand rainfall and relative humidity rh are in general decreasing however negative trends in rainfall cover a smaller spatial extent of the catchment as a result there is an overall increase in etr supplementary material strong evidence p value 0 05 of decreasing precipitation takes place in 10 000 km2 23 of the catchment extent at a mean rate of 0 48 mm year 1 this translates into a total loss of 148 gl of rainfall from the beginning of the study period 1988 relative humidity indicates strong evidence of negative trends in around 92 of the catchment area at a rate of on average 0 144 year 1 these lead to overall strong evidence of an increase in reference evapotranspiration in about 91 of the catchment extent at on average 0 28 mm year 1 to evaluate the relationship between annual average surface water and annual climate variables a cross correlation was carried out for rainfall and etr the cross correlation with average surface water is significant for the first two lags here rainfall is directly related while etr is inversely related to average annual surface water fig 9 the positive cross correlation between rainfall and mean annual surface water extent in the first two lags may be explained by the rainfall occurrence and the residence time most rainfall in the catchment occurs in summer especially in december which has caused several floods in the past this rainfall creates a pool of water resources that are stored in the main reservoirs lasting a period of around two years the negative cross correlation between etr and mean annual surface water extent may be explained by moist wet climate conditions reducing etr 3 4 open water evaporation the open water evaporation estimated through the silo short crop etr fao56 using an open water coefficient of 1 25 is well correlated with the pml v2 evaporation dataset fig 10 a this is also shown in a selected part of the time series plot of both datasets for the period 2012 2015 for the keepit reservoir fig 10b only a small section of the overall time series is shown to highlight the close agreement between the series the open water evaporation estimates are correlated with the reference dataset with an r2 of 0 94 a bias of 0 09 and a rmse of 0 57 mm this was considered sufficient for the subsequent analysis of lumped actual open water evaporation at the catchment scale 3 5 open water evaporation in the catchment spatial annual evaporation trends are shown in fig 11 these must be interpreted as a product of the combination of surface water and etr agricultural areas in the middle of the catchment have a mixed behaviour due to the change in on farm dams upper panels these present a salt and pepper effect of blue and red colours associated with negative and positive evaporation trends respectively however increased evaporation trends seem to dominate the agricultural sector towards the east of the catchment it can be seen how lake goran lower panels has significantly decreasing evaporation trends which may be explained by the significant decrease in surface water frequencies as lake goran is an ephemeral and mostly terminal lake overall around 162 km2 in the catchment indicates strong evidence p value 0 05 of evaporation changes decreasing on average by 7 09 mm y 1 using the jrc dataset however these trends are spatially variable within this extent 37 km2 experiences increasing evaporation trends with on average 28 mm y 1 using the rf classified images 169 km2 highlights strong evidence of decreasing trends decreasing on average by 5 mm y 1 however within this area 22 km2 has increasing evaporation trends on average by 24 mm y 1 the monthly lumped evaporation for the rf classified images is in fig 12 a strong seasonal behaviour can be observed in the signal the mean annual evaporation with the rf classified images is 178 3 gl with a standard deviation of 90 9 gl while using the jrc dataset the mean and standard deviation were 225 5 gl and 90 gl respectively the maximum annual evaporation estimated is 446 7 gl using rf and 397 gl using the jrc dataset both maxima in annual lumped evaporation values occur in 2012 when large floods took place on the other hand the minimum annual evaporation was 57 7 gl using the rf classified images and 90 5 gl using the jrc dataset both minimum lumped annual evaporation values occurred in 2007 after several years of drought in fig 12 the effect of the millennium drought van dijk et al 2013 for the study area can be clearly observed in this period between 2001 and 2009 only a small seasonal evaporation fluctuation can be observed and evaporation values remained below average a seasonal decomposition of the monthly evaporation signal can be used to evaluate the evaporation trends at the catchment scale fig 13 the deseasonalised signal of the lumped open water evaporation is decreasing at the catchment scale the z score of the mk test for the lumped evaporation using the rf classified images was 4 13 with a p value of 3 57e 05 and a ss of 0 192 gl year 1 while using the jrc dataset a mk z score of 4 77 was estimated with a p value of 1 78e 06 and a ss of 0 228 gl year 1 additionally a small but significant positive trend p value 0 05 in the evaporation surface water ratio was detected fig 14 this can be explained by the positive trend in etr thus independently of the decrease in the catchment lumped total evaporation more water is being evaporated per unit of surface water therefore under current climate conditions more evaporative losses are occurring per unit of exposed surface water evaluating the correlation between the three fractions of surface water episodic seasonal and permanent suggests that at least permanent and episodic water fractions were significantly p value 0 05 correlated spearman correlation with annual lumped water evaporation correlation coefficients of 0 95 and 0 93 exist between permanent water and annual lumped evaporation for the rf classified images and the jrc dataset respectively and between the seasonal water fraction and the lumped evaporation for the rf classified images the correlation was 0 53 while for the jrc dataset it was 0 45 since episodic water exists in the landscape for a smaller fraction of time the contribution to open water evaporation is smaller despite the much greater extent 4 discussion overall this study indicates that there is a clear change in the landscape water balance over the study period 1988 2018 while temperature has strongly increased rainfall and rh have decreased on approximately 23 and 92 of the catchment extent respectively in contrast reference et etr has increased over a large part of the catchment open water evaporation is a significant part of the catchment water losses and this is correlated with permanent and seasonal surface water bodies evaporation losses are spatially variable decreasing in lake goran in the upper namoi in contrast they are increasing in agricultural sectors of the catchment due to the presence of on farm dams all trends in this study need to be considered in relation to the issues raised by serinaldi et al 2018 related to interpreting the results of null hypothesis significance tests therefore trend values estimated are limited to the study catchment and study period 1988 2018 and should not be used to model future conditions or be extrapolated beyond the study area the trend tests are preliminary screening tools further analysis using knowledge of physical processes taking place in the study area should be done to confirm that the trends make sense furthermore the use of annual summaries for the trend estimates can lead to underestimation of the temporal dependencies in the data however as more than 5 years of data was available the approach was considered valid whiters and nadarajah 2015 there are several sources of uncertainty that should be considered in this study landsat images have an average recurrence of 16 days per satellite which limits water detection to days when the satellite passes fuentes et al 2019b furthermore clouds and shadows can limit the detection of surface water especially after anomalous weather events such as storms this leads to a loss of information on surface water extent monitoring schumann and moller 2015 additionally the classification step may also lead to water detection uncertainties difficulties in the water recognition may be due to mixed pixels transfer errors or due to the classification algorithms fuentes et al 2019a as mentioned by feyisa et al 2014 mixed pixels can be an important source of error especially at large scales furthermore detection errors in steep areas as a result of elevation shadows whose spectral signature resembles water may be a potential source of errors during the classification feyisa et al 2014 however by using the hill shadow mask we believe these errors were reduced even though clouds and cloud shadows were removed from landsat images using the cfmask algorithm foga et al 2017 remnant clouds and cloud shadows may still be observed in some images which affects the surface water detection and contributes to the uncertainty in the classification xia et al 2019 the different wavelength ranges in the sensors of the different landsat satellites also introduce some noise in the classification this might result in classification errors which may add to the errors derived from the scan line corrector fail in the landsat 7 satellite other sources of uncertainty that may be propagated into the results are associated with the reference datasets used for instance the silo etr dataset has some limitations that should be considered even though it is a well recognised dataset developed using the established fao56 formulae allen et al 1998 eq 4 the dataset assumes a constant wind speed of 2 m s 1 which might cause errors in the evaporation calculation it also might propagate the uncertainties derived from the forcing data temperature relative humidity and radiation in the case of the jrc dataset pekel et al 2016 it tends to miss significant surface water during floods and therefore would lead to underestimation of evaporation in these events therefore and regardless of the value of the jrc dataset for global scale use its application at regional scales for monitoring episodic events such as floods must be carefully considered the evaporation layer contained in the pml v2 dataset zhang et al 2019 used to validate our evaporation estimates implies another source of uncertainty since it was primarily developed to obtain penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration evaporation in the pml v2 was estimated using the penman equation but not validated all flux towers for evaporation and transpiration validation are located in land areas and therefore do not measure open water evaporation moreover open water evaporation is rather seldom measured and therefore this hinders the validation of results this is the main reason for using the pml v2 evaporation in this study additionally the use of fao56 evapotranspiration and a single open water coefficient results in an oversimplification of the evaporation estimation allen et al 1998 jensen 2010 but is used here in order to monitor evaporation at the catchment scale and is not constrained to the main reservoirs thus the open water coefficient used is only acceptable if the surface water bodies are generally deep enough however since the heat storage capacity of a water body is mainly influenced by its depth finch and hall 2001 different water body depths will lead to different coefficients as mentioned the etr calculation also has some limitations for example the assumption of no heat flux as a consequence heat storage was not considered in this approach however finch and hall 2001 explain that for annual evaporation calculations heat storage plays a small role in total evaporation since seasonal changes tend to cancel each other thus the introduced error might be small due to the uncertain quality of the reference data used for validation and the reasons aforementioned evaporation values should be regarded only as rough estimates clearly there is a need for more evaporation measurements to build and validate open water evaporation models climatic trends suggest an intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to warmer conditions which translates into higher etr in the catchment huntington 2006 and a higher evaporation per unit of surface water in contrast to other studies that show decreasing or no trends in etr e g shenbin et al 2006 wang et al 2011 this study shows spatially variable but significant positive trends covering a large catchment extent this agrees with johnson and sharma 2010 study in which pan evaporation trends were found to be increasing at most weather stations in australia the increase in etr can be linked to significant positive temperature trends across the entire catchment which are not being offset by other weather variables for instance in most of the catchment there is no trend in rainfall together these results imply a decrease in blue and green water availability in the catchment for ecological functioning and human needs including agricultural and domestic water usage these results also agree with the predicted effects of climate change due to global warming collins et al 2013 as a result of temperature and etr trends the annual frequency of surface water occurrence was also found to be mostly decreasing if the loss in water frequency is confirmed as a long term trend then this can ultimately affect ecosystem functioning and led to a degradation of local economies and higher food security risks mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 the namoi catchment hosts over 46 000 ha of wetlands where regular flood events are essential for ecosystem health every two years green et al 2011 spatial negative trends in surface open water frequencies could signify a decrease in the health of these systems several studies have reported a decline in the extent of open surface water bodies as a consequence of anthropogenic activities legesse and ayenew 2006 micklin and aladin 2008 song et al 2012 in the current study such activities were not directly analysed even though open water areas with strong evidence of changes in frequency had mostly negative trends several spots indicate the opposite behaviour yet their spatial extents are small these correspond to on farm dams for irrigation purposes which have been built to secure water for irrigation additionally in spite of climate conditions and water availability fluctuations on farm dams indicated positive trends however water usage by irrigation was not evaluated in this study therefore anthropogenic effects on the overall surface water would require additional water usage data to be conclusive lumped water evaporation at the catchment scale in the study period has decreased despite an increasing etr trend this implies that open water evaporation is dominated by the surface water occurrence and frequency total annual evaporative losses in the catchment average 201 9 gl using both datasets evaluated which corresponds to 47 of the storage capacity of keepit dam preece and jones 2002 and exceeds the annual total account usage of surface water in the catchment burrell et al 2018 since most studies address the impact of climate on evaporation it is still unclear how these changes in open water evaporation could feedback to climate two main conclusions concerning the water footprint may be drawn based on our findings firstly the results reflect a decrease in the availability of blue water open water frequency but also in rainfall and rh secondly there is an increase in evaporation losses per unit water associated with the general increase in temperature this is also associated with a positive trend in etr resulting in a decrease in storage of green water overall these results imply a loss of available water which is a concern for both ecological assets and irrigation activities in the catchment in this study groundwater was not analysed however kelly et al 2014 reported dropping levels in several monitoring boreholes in the catchment which also suggests a loss of groundwater resources possibly due to the reduction in surface water availability this suggests an urgent need to review water management taking into account the increased loss of water in evaporation 5 conclusions the change in open water evaporation was evaluated in the namoi catchment from 1988 to the present through climate variables and surface water detection overall surface water frequencies have mostly been decreasing yet these are spatially variable in the catchment climate variables clearly indicate the predicted intensification of the hydrologic cycle as a result of climate change temperatures have significantly increased in the catchment while rainfall and relative humidity indicate negative trends in large areas together these have led to significant increases in etr across 90 of the catchment extent additionally rainfall and etr were significantly cross correlated to the surface water extent annual lumped open water evaporation losses average more than one third of the main keepit dam storage capacity in the catchment and exceed the annual total usage of all surface water accounts however these losses are spatially and temporally variable with decreasing trends this might be associated with a loss in surface water frequency which partly offsets the increase in etr a key problem for future water management is the increased evaporation per unit surface water extent which might be addressed by the implementation of mar projects credit authorship contribution statement ignacio fuentes methodology data curation investigation writing

5659,economic pressures on natural resources have led to a modification of natural surface water patterns this has affected the hydrologic cycle at a global scale with multiple environmental and socioeconomic implications this study evaluates long term trends in surface water occurrence and related climate variables in a large agricultural catchment of australia to understand trends in evaporative water losses from open water bodies surface water detection was based on a supervised classification of landsat images between 1988 and 2018 to obtain inundation and surface water frequencies across the catchment which were compared with other surface water products climate trends were based on monthly silo gridded datasets open water evaporation was estimated using the fao56 methodology and compared with the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 pml v2 product evaporation trends were analysed using the mann kendall mk test and the sen s slope ss generally open water frequencies showed significant negative trends though these varied spatially the number of dams on the other hand had an increasing trend temperatures are increasing in the catchment while rainfall and relative humidity are decreasing resulting in an overall positive trend for reference evapotranspiration etr across 90 of the catchment even though etr and evaporation per unit area of water show positive trends lumped open water evaporation showed a negative trend possibly associated with an average decrease in surface water frequencies annual evaporative losses averaged 201 9 gl exceeding annual total account usage of surface water in the catchment all the studied changes imply a loss of blue and green water in the catchment and provide evidence of an overall intensification of the hydrologic cycle as predicted under climate change keywords surface water evaporation losses climatic trends 1 introduction the increasing anthropogenic pressure on natural resources has been widely reported castello and macedo 2015 schandl et al 2016 aukema et al 2017 visbeck 2018 this trend also includes water resources which are impacted by overexploitation affecting associated ecosystems castello and macedo 2015 dalin et al 2017 russo and lall 2017 surface water is a component of the hydrological cycle which allows both ecosystem functioning and socio economic activities davis et al 2015 however pressures on surface waters such as land use change and economic activities lead to the modification of natural surface water patterns gerbens leenes et al 2010 castello and macedo 2015 jin et al 2015 scanlon et al 2017 agriculture i e food production represents approximately 70 of blue water use water in rivers reservoirs and aquifers and around 90 of consumptive water use while domestic water consumption accounts for only 10 of water use hoekstra and chapagain 2006 davis et al 2015 scanlon et al 2017 importantly most water usage relies on surface water sources connor et al 2009 according to fao 2016 world surface water represents over 70 of total water withdrawals for consumptive use additionally gerten et al 2013 estimated global blue water consumption to be on average 1 831 km3 y 1 which corresponds to 11 2 and 65 4 of accessible blue water and the freshwater planetary boundary which if exceeded would endanger earth systems respectively meteorological variability results in a fluctuation of available blue water affecting agricultural water supplies and food security dry periods reduce available water for irrigation while wet years cause a water surplus which is transferred into runoff if no water harvesting alternatives are promoted hashemi et al 2015 scanlon et al 2016 however this also affects the availability of soil moisture green water and consequently productive evapotranspiration in most cases this temporal variability is addressed individually by farmers through building on farm dams and ring tanks while at the regional scale reservoir building is used for management cosgrove and loucks 2015 pittock 2016 both alter the natural hydrological pattern and impact environmental assets castello and macedo 2015 fowler et al 2015 however other human activities can further strengthen climatic variability effects on surface water pattern modifications for example land use changes might lead to an intensification of the hydrological cycle which modifies the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of water resources jin et al 2015 davis et al 2015 energy needs also change the natural spatiotemporal distribution of surface water through the dams for hydropower generation modifying the natural hydrological cycle on a large scale pringle et al 2000 these activities have affected the sustainability of natural resources and have also resulted in large changes in the landscape water balance castello and macedo 2015 several alternatives have been proposed for an integrated management of hydrologic resources to address these issues arguments for a more integrated approach focus on improving the sustainability of water resources and improving the environmental functioning of streams and wetlands but also consider a more efficient water use which implies reduced water losses poff et al 2015 among several alternatives to improve water storage managed aquifer recharge mar has gained attention mainly because it involves replenishing of groundwater resources by recharging aquifers in years of water surplus which can then be used in dry periods rawluk et al 2013 dillon et al 2018 additionally mar might reduce evaporation losses dillon et al 2009 dillon and arshad 2016 however few studies have analysed long term changes in surface water evaporation losses particularly at regional scales zhao and gao 2019 most studies have focused on reference and potential evapotranspiration changes with contradictory results depending on the study locations shenbin et al 2006 kingston et al 2009 wang et al 2011 dinpashoh et al 2018 since open water evaporation constitutes a response to both evaporation and open water extent dynamic changes in these might impact regional evaporation estimates in a warming global climate with spatially variable changes in frequency and intensity of rainfall westra et al 2014 ishak et al 2013 such changes need to be understood to identify optimal ways of water storage water reservoirs can involve large volumetric evaporation losses for instance zhao and gao 2019 reported annual evaporation losses from big reservoirs in the united states to be equivalent to 93 of the annual public water supply of the country craig et al 2005 reported annual evaporation losses up to 40 of farm dam storages in queensland and new south wales in australia however most studies refer to short term assessments or are based on particular water reservoirs gibson 2002 craig 2006 liu et al 2009 in contrast long term changes on surface water pattern at regional scales might lead to a change in the dynamics of evaporative losses this aspect has rarely been studied but would increase our understanding of regional water balances moreover for mar to be an acceptable alternative for water storage we need to understand the variability in evaporative losses and how this relates to open water storage and flood occurrence development of remote sensing in the last decades has improved monitoring of surface water palmer et al 2015 donchyts et al 2016 since water has a distinctive spectral signature it can be detected from space using satellites that capture the surface reflectance at different wavelengths ji et al 2009 different alternatives for water detection from surface reflectance data are possible surface reflectance images can be integrated with supervised or unsupervised classification algorithms to accurately detect surface water fuentes et al 2019a even though this methodology was better than others i e munasinghe et al 2018 it is difficult to extrapolate accurately outside the reference study areas alternatively several spectral indices have been proposed for water detection in a more automated manner gao 1996 xu 2006 feyisa et al 2014 but these require definition of empirical thresholds even though a freely available synthetic aperture radar dataset at high spatial resolution 10 m has been released sentinel 1 copernicus allowing observation of the land surface through clouds it has only been in operation for a short time from october 2014 which limits long term monitoring studies zhou et al 2017 on the other hand surface reflectance products derived from the landsat satellites have accumulated for more than 30 years of monitoring donchyts et al 2016 this dataset now offers a valuable dataset to study long term changes in surface processes and at relatively high spatial resolution 30 m this study aims to evaluate the long term trend in surface water occurrence and the associated evolution of evaporative water losses in a large agricultural catchment in australia using more than 30 years of landsat imagery and gridded climate data the study area datasets used and pre processing steps are detailed first followed by a description of the water detection method and the categorization of surface water bodies subsequently the open water evaporation methodology is described which is followed by the results and a discussion regarding the observed open water trends and their relation to evaporative losses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was based on the namoi basin located in new south wales australia fig 1 this basin was selected for this study because agriculture is strongly developed and due to its large surface area 42 000 km2 cotton is the dominant irrigated crop in the catchment covering over 60 of the irrigated area in the basin green et al 2011 cotton is highly dependent on the availability of water resources which has been supported by the building of three dams named keepit splitrock and chaffey however these dams were also designed for flood mitigation thurtell and wettin 2012 the namoi catchment is characterised by two main k√∂ppen geiger climate types humid subtropical to the east and hot steppe to the west peel et al 2007 mean annual rainfall varies between 449 and 1135 mm decreasing to the west most rainfall occurs in summer and the coefficient of variation ranges from 14 7 in the upper namoi high rainfall eastern areas that feed water reservoirs to 38 6 in lower namoi areas low rainfall areas to the west where most irrigated agriculture takes place annual pan evaporation ranges from 1000 mm to around 2200 mm and increases in a westerly direction green et al 2011 the main hydrologic feature in the catchment is the namoi river and its tributaries which have deposited the alluvial sediments on which most agriculture takes place the namoi river flows to the west from the higher elevations in the east of the catchment welsh et al 2014 streamflow variability in the catchment changes depending on the river reach with a coefficient of variation up to one order of magnitude higher than the mean streamflow 2 2 data and preprocessing steps images from the tier 1 surface reflectance collections of landsat 5 7 and 8 were used in this study the catchment is included in 8 tiles of the landsat data set fig 2 the data from 1986 to 08 19 to 2019 06 22 used in this study correspond to a total of 6 575 landsat images table 1 the bands between the different collections landsat 5 7 and landsat 8 were homogenised and clouds and shadows were removed from all images through the pixel qa band contained in the image collection additionally the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi and the modified normalised difference water index mndwi xu 2006 were calculated and added as bands of the landsat images based on 1 n d v i œÅ nir œÅ red œÅ nir œÅ red 2 m n d w i œÅ green œÅ mir œÅ green œÅ mir where œÅnir œÅred œÅgreen and œÅmir are the reflectance for landsat images in the wavelength range of approximately 0 7 0 9 0 6 0 7 0 5 0 6 and 1 5 1 7 Œºm respectively the collection was subsequently filtered to images between 1988 and 01 01 and 2019 01 01 which results in 31 years of monitoring since images before 1988 have a lower frequency this reduced the collection to a total of 6 351 landsat images gridded datasets for daily minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax mean temperature tmean mean relative humidity rhmean rainfall and short crop reference evapotranspiration etr were downloaded from the silo webpage https www longpaddock qld gov au silo for the study period this daily data has a spatial resolution of 5 km and is the result of an interpolation jeffrey et al 2001 of observed weather variables the downloaded datasets were clipped to the extent of the study catchment monthly averaged or summed and subsequently analysed additionally the water body evaporation band from the coupled evapotranspiration and gross primary product pml v2 was used as a reference to evaluate the estimated open water evaporation from the silo collection in this dataset penman evaporation was considered as the actual evaporation from the water bodies and it was derived from the gldas collection rodell et al 2004 and modis imagery zhang et al 2019 the smoothed australian digital elevation model dem s was used in the water detection gallant et al 2011 and discharge data from a gauging station located in the namoi river at goangra in the western downstream reach of the catchment was also used it was downloaded from the water nsw webpage https realtimedata waternsw com au in order to evaluate the results of the surface water classification two surface water datasets were used these correspond to the monthly water history of the joint research centre jrc pekel et al 2016 and the water observations from space map wofs https www ga gov au scientific topics community safety flood wofs finally major reservoirs and the main path of the namoi river and its tributaries were obtained from the australian hydrologic geofabric dataset bureau of meteorology 2012 2 3 surface water detection a random forest model rf was trained with a mosaic based on eight landsat images covering the study area table 2 the images selected for training the rf classifier were based on images that coincided with flood events in the catchment two images with high solar zenith angles within the collection to differentiate between the spectral signature of water and mountain shadows and a few randomly selected images the classification used all surface reflectance bands and the ndvi and mndwi appended bands however since the study area contains flat and mountainous landscapes the slope from the dem s was also added as a band to the landsat images to serve as an additional input to the classifier table 3 the hill shadow of the images was also estimated through the dem s together with the zenithal and azimuthal angles of the images and this was appended as an additional band to the images however this band was not used to train the rf classifier but in a subsequent step in the hill shadow mask of the images polygons of the major reservoirs keepit chaffey and split rock dams and goran lake were buffered by 300 m and assumed to be free of shadows a set of 105 polygons for surface water and 245 polygons of dry land end member pixels were manually delineated from the landsat training mosaic fig 3 surface reflectance pixels within those polygons were sampled and randomly split into a training subset containing 90 of the original pixels within polygons 41 078 pixels and a validation subset containing the remaining 10 4 521 pixels the rf classifier was trained using the training subset with one rifle decision tree per class a size of terminal nodes set to 1 a fraction of input to bag per tree of 0 5 and the square root of the number of variables per split after the classification the estimated hill shadow band in the images was used to mask the classified images this takes into account that apart from some of the major reservoirs which were removed from the hill shadow mask no other water bodies are present in areas with steep terrain in the catchment the evaluation of the classification was based on a confusion matrix which gives the overall accuracy and the kappa value for the classifier and for the validation subset and also the producer and consumer accuracies the performance evaluation was based on the training mosaic image using the validation subset polygons and four other randomly selected landsat images in which 400 dry points and 100 water points were delineated additionally an annual recurrence map was obtained through the sum of maximum annual inundated areas in the catchment and a per pixel probability of water occurrence map were also used as validation sources for the implemented classifier the jrc product was used to compare the results of the rf classified dataset in addition 10 000 random points were sampled from the wofs product which only provides historical probabilities of water occurrence to compare with the probabilities of water occurrence derived from the rf classification 2 4 surface water classes and trend analysis the monthly and annual frequency of the occurrence of surface water in the classified images was analysed this was assessed for each pixel in both the classified collection and the jrc monthly water history dataset by summing the times that the pixel appears as inundated within a year or month and dividing it by the number of times that it is within the collection in the year monthly surface water frequency images were obtained for the evaluation of evaporation since this is strongly seasonal gaps in the monthly surface water data were filled by linearly interpolating the surface water frequency images assuming that surface water variation is linear three classes of inundated pixels were defined for the annual water frequencies 1 permanent water bodies with an annual frequency greater or equal than 0 75 which imply that these surfaces are inundated most of the year 2 seasonal water bodies with a frequency smaller than 0 75 and greater or equal than 0 25 which imply that these surfaces are inundated between 1 and 3 seasons per year and 3 episodic water bodies which have an annual frequency lower than 0 25 meaning inundation during less than one season per year additionally the annual average area of surface water was estimated as the sum of pixel areas multiplied by the water frequency as shown in eq 3 xia et al 2019 3 a i j 1 n a i j n i j m i j where ƒÅ is the annual lumped average surface water occurrence i j corresponds to the row and column of each pixel in the image n is the total number of pixels in the image ai j is the pixel area ni j are the times that water occurs in each pixel during the year and mi j are the times that the pixel occurs within the year on farm dams were annually evaluated assuming that these corresponded to surface water areas with a frequency higher than 0 33 and surface inundated areas between 5 000 and 500 000 m2 the resulting masked rasters were subsequently vectorized filtering out polygons that intersected the main river and reservoirs from those polygons were counted annually and their total area was estimated trend analysis of monthly data was carried out after a seasonal decomposition analysis to remove the seasonality in the data while annually lumped data was directly evaluated trends were obtained through the mann kendall mk test and the sen s slope ss these allowed quantification of the magnitude direction and the significance of trends 2 5 evaporation from open water the daily evaporation of open water bodies was calculated from the silo gridded etr data which uses the fao penman monteith equation fao56 this corresponds to the short crop etr of the asce standardised reference evapotranspiration equation eq 4 allen et al 1998 walter et al 2000 4 et r 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 c d u 2 where etr is the daily standardised etr Œ¥ is the saturation vapor pressure temperature slope rn is the net radiation g the soil heat flux Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant t is the mean daily temperature u2 the mean daily wind speed at 2 m es the saturation vapor pressure ea the actual pressure vapor and cn and cd are constant values associated to the short crops equivalent to 900 and 0 34 respectively etr was monthly and annually summed in order to get lumped etr evaporation of water surfaces can be calculated by scaling etr with a constant crop factor allen et al 1998 craig 2006 jensen 2010 as shown in eq 5 5 e a et r k c where ea is actual evaporation from open water bodies and kc is the crop coefficient which for open water bodies ranges from 1 05 to 1 25 depending on the water depth being 1 25 for deep open water bodies allen et al 1998 additionally since no flux tower measurements are available glenn et al 2011 in the study catchment the pml v2 dataset was used as a reference for validation of the estimated evaporation values the water evaporation band from this data set was sampled at 4 different locations in known surface water bodies keepit splitrock and chaffey dams and goran lake this dataset has been recognised as one of the state of the art sources for actual evapotranspiration and evaporation values and has been compared favourably with several eddy covariance flux towers zhang et al 2019 yet the pml v2 product was mainly intended for evapotranspiration monitoring from land surfaces and was not validated with open water evaporation measurements this dataset was used as a reference for validation and not directly for lumped evaporation since the time interval of the images covers from 2002 to 2017 which would lead to a reduction in the analysed time series in addition its resolution at 500 m for evaporation of water bodies neglects several of the farm dams in the catchment which have lower spatial dimensions these farm dams are one of the agricultural characteristics in the catchment for which we want to assess the evaporation for the validation estimated evaporation values from the silo dataset were averaged to the time scale of the pml v2 dataset which is based on 8 day composite images derived from modis by using the monthly surface water rasters and the total monthly evaporation rasters monthly water losses by evaporation were calculated and lumped to the catchment scale yet the spatial analysis of evaporation trends was carried out using the series of total annual evaporation 3 results 3 1 water detection the performance of the water detection method is given in table 4 overall the detection can be classified as very good for the different evaluated dates kappa greater than 0 8 and overall accuracies greater than 0 9 the lowest performance can be observed using the landsat 7 collection followed by landsat 8 in this case these are associated with lower producer s accuracy since some water bodies are not being classified as water however these omission errors are only a very small fraction of the pixels actually belonging to the different classes which explains the high accuracy and kappa values xia et al 2019 also found higher errors using landsat 7 to evaluate surface water in china other issues such as the presence of mixed pixels at the perimeter of water bodies lead to confusion in both the user reference data and the algorithm however this is more related to the resolution of the data than a problem of the algorithm which cannot be analysed with the current performance analysis the annual water recurrence map which integrates the entire collection of images is shown in fig 4 inundated areas from the recurrence map generated from landsat images are similar to products generated from modis imagery fuentes et al 2019b in the map major reservoirs in the catchment can be easily distinguished because of the high recurrence of surface water the ephemeral lake goran water body in the lower centre of the catchment can also be easily recognised and the flood inundation pattern in the catchment indicated by yellowish and greenish colours in the map follows the main alluvium in the catchment and the associated floodplains since the topography in the west of the catchment consists mainly of flat areas major inundation extents can be observed in those sectors a comparison with the 10 000 samples of the wofs product gives an r 2 of 0 91 and an rmse of 1 8 there is a bias in the data towards the wofs product not shown however wofs includes data until 2012 while the rf classification includes data from 1988 to 2018 with the period 2012 2018 characterised by worsening drought conditions which might explain this shift an annual animation of water frequencies can be found in the supplementary data in this animation the spatio temporal pattern of water frequencies can be observed and how this changes through time note also the small on farm dam water bodies showing as small blue pixels in the west of the catchment wet years such as 2010 or 2012 are clearly visible 3 2 water categories and trends the classification of surface water into episodic seasonal and permanent extents is highlighted in fig 5 for both the rf classified images and the jrc dataset all surface water fractions display some degree of temporal oscillation reflecting dry and wet periods the episodic extent responds quite obviously to large climatic events which result in floods for example flood events can be observed in 1998 2000 2010 and 2012 which coincide with discharge peaks recorded at the gauging station in the namoi river at goangra located in the western area of the catchment fig 5c while small differences in the permanent and seasonal water fractions between both datasets can be observed with a higher seasonal water fraction in the jrc compared with the rf classified images strong differences in the episodic fraction are also presented an evaluation of the classification on flood and dry dates was carried out comparing both datasets supplementary material since the jrc datasets relates to a single image per month and even though it is based on the surface reflectance images it misses large surface water extents during floods possibly associated with a smoothing effect in contrast during dry dates it leads to slightly larger water extents than the rf classified images for the lumped surface water fractions significant trends were not observed p value 0 05 using both datasets however both datasets indicated negative trends for lumped average surface water and also for permanent and episodic water fractions the mean of annual average surface water extents for the jrc and for the rf classified images was 103 5 km2 and 102 8 km2 while the coefficient of variation was 50 and 40 5 respectively average surface water extent in the catchment is autocorrelated at a 1 year time lag however after the first year the autocorrelation is not significant fig 6 there appears to be a 6 7 year non significant oscillating cycle in the autocorrelation of the surface water which may be an effect of major climatic cycles such as el ni√±o and la ni√±a even though lumped surface water fractions did not show significant trends the mk and ss analysis on the water frequency images detects negative trends in some of the main water reservoirs in the catchment over the study period fig 7 yet the p value of the trend indicates clear spatial variability results in the main water reservoirs show strong evidence of negative trends mostly on the perimeter while the ephemeral goran lake indicates significant negative trends p value 0 05 over the whole area using the jrc dataset an area of 106 km2 equivalent to 0 25 of the catchment area indicates strong evidence p values 0 05 of water frequency trends at on average 0 005 per year this implies an overall loss in surface water frequency and a reduction of around 2 days of inundation per year within this extent 18 5 km2 present strong evidence of increasing frequency trends at on average 0 017 per year the rf classified images indicated 156 km2 with strong evidence of surface water frequency changes with an average surface water frequency change of 0 004 per year within this extent 21 km2 presented positive trends of surface water frequencies at on average 0 012 per year in fig 7 blue spots in the mk and ss maps indicate positive trends which are mainly associated with on farm dams in agricultural areas the presence of on farm dams is shown in fig 8 the average number of on farm dams in the catchment is 397 using the rf classifier covering an area of 30 1 km2 using the jrc dataset an annual average of 557 dams was obtained covering 38 3 km2 however these are temporally variable in both cases oscillating depending on the total available water in the catchment for instance fig 8 shows that during wet years such as 1998 2005 2010 2012 and 2016 which correspond to years with a water surplus the number and extent of on farm dams increases while decreasing in dry years matching the climatic fluctuation in available water discharge or rainfall the coefficient of variation for the number of on farm dams and their extent in both cases averages 25 1 and 30 6 respectively additionally strong evidence p value 0 05 of an increasing number of dams occurs in both the jrc dataset and using the rf classifier with a mean sen s slope of 5 25 dam y 1 the area covered by on farm dams increased significantly p value 0 05 in the jrc dataset with a sen s slope of 0 7 km2 y 1 3 3 reference evapotranspiration and climatic trends the trend analysis of the climatic variables shows an intensification in the hydrologic cycle on the one hand temperatures minimum maximum and mean significantly increased in the last 31 years in large extents of the catchment supplementary material minimum temperatures show strong evidence of increasing temperatures in around 48 of the catchment area at a mean rate of 0 026 c year 1 but ranging between 0 027 c year 1 and 0 073 c year 1 maximum temperatures present strong evidence of increasing temperatures in 99 of the catchment extent at on average 0 043 c year 1 within a range of 0 009 c year 1 and 0 076 c year 1 mean temperatures show strong evidence of increasing in almost the entire catchment area at an average rate of 0 026 c year 1 ranging between 0 015 c year 1 and 0 047 c year 1 on the other hand rainfall and relative humidity rh are in general decreasing however negative trends in rainfall cover a smaller spatial extent of the catchment as a result there is an overall increase in etr supplementary material strong evidence p value 0 05 of decreasing precipitation takes place in 10 000 km2 23 of the catchment extent at a mean rate of 0 48 mm year 1 this translates into a total loss of 148 gl of rainfall from the beginning of the study period 1988 relative humidity indicates strong evidence of negative trends in around 92 of the catchment area at a rate of on average 0 144 year 1 these lead to overall strong evidence of an increase in reference evapotranspiration in about 91 of the catchment extent at on average 0 28 mm year 1 to evaluate the relationship between annual average surface water and annual climate variables a cross correlation was carried out for rainfall and etr the cross correlation with average surface water is significant for the first two lags here rainfall is directly related while etr is inversely related to average annual surface water fig 9 the positive cross correlation between rainfall and mean annual surface water extent in the first two lags may be explained by the rainfall occurrence and the residence time most rainfall in the catchment occurs in summer especially in december which has caused several floods in the past this rainfall creates a pool of water resources that are stored in the main reservoirs lasting a period of around two years the negative cross correlation between etr and mean annual surface water extent may be explained by moist wet climate conditions reducing etr 3 4 open water evaporation the open water evaporation estimated through the silo short crop etr fao56 using an open water coefficient of 1 25 is well correlated with the pml v2 evaporation dataset fig 10 a this is also shown in a selected part of the time series plot of both datasets for the period 2012 2015 for the keepit reservoir fig 10b only a small section of the overall time series is shown to highlight the close agreement between the series the open water evaporation estimates are correlated with the reference dataset with an r2 of 0 94 a bias of 0 09 and a rmse of 0 57 mm this was considered sufficient for the subsequent analysis of lumped actual open water evaporation at the catchment scale 3 5 open water evaporation in the catchment spatial annual evaporation trends are shown in fig 11 these must be interpreted as a product of the combination of surface water and etr agricultural areas in the middle of the catchment have a mixed behaviour due to the change in on farm dams upper panels these present a salt and pepper effect of blue and red colours associated with negative and positive evaporation trends respectively however increased evaporation trends seem to dominate the agricultural sector towards the east of the catchment it can be seen how lake goran lower panels has significantly decreasing evaporation trends which may be explained by the significant decrease in surface water frequencies as lake goran is an ephemeral and mostly terminal lake overall around 162 km2 in the catchment indicates strong evidence p value 0 05 of evaporation changes decreasing on average by 7 09 mm y 1 using the jrc dataset however these trends are spatially variable within this extent 37 km2 experiences increasing evaporation trends with on average 28 mm y 1 using the rf classified images 169 km2 highlights strong evidence of decreasing trends decreasing on average by 5 mm y 1 however within this area 22 km2 has increasing evaporation trends on average by 24 mm y 1 the monthly lumped evaporation for the rf classified images is in fig 12 a strong seasonal behaviour can be observed in the signal the mean annual evaporation with the rf classified images is 178 3 gl with a standard deviation of 90 9 gl while using the jrc dataset the mean and standard deviation were 225 5 gl and 90 gl respectively the maximum annual evaporation estimated is 446 7 gl using rf and 397 gl using the jrc dataset both maxima in annual lumped evaporation values occur in 2012 when large floods took place on the other hand the minimum annual evaporation was 57 7 gl using the rf classified images and 90 5 gl using the jrc dataset both minimum lumped annual evaporation values occurred in 2007 after several years of drought in fig 12 the effect of the millennium drought van dijk et al 2013 for the study area can be clearly observed in this period between 2001 and 2009 only a small seasonal evaporation fluctuation can be observed and evaporation values remained below average a seasonal decomposition of the monthly evaporation signal can be used to evaluate the evaporation trends at the catchment scale fig 13 the deseasonalised signal of the lumped open water evaporation is decreasing at the catchment scale the z score of the mk test for the lumped evaporation using the rf classified images was 4 13 with a p value of 3 57e 05 and a ss of 0 192 gl year 1 while using the jrc dataset a mk z score of 4 77 was estimated with a p value of 1 78e 06 and a ss of 0 228 gl year 1 additionally a small but significant positive trend p value 0 05 in the evaporation surface water ratio was detected fig 14 this can be explained by the positive trend in etr thus independently of the decrease in the catchment lumped total evaporation more water is being evaporated per unit of surface water therefore under current climate conditions more evaporative losses are occurring per unit of exposed surface water evaluating the correlation between the three fractions of surface water episodic seasonal and permanent suggests that at least permanent and episodic water fractions were significantly p value 0 05 correlated spearman correlation with annual lumped water evaporation correlation coefficients of 0 95 and 0 93 exist between permanent water and annual lumped evaporation for the rf classified images and the jrc dataset respectively and between the seasonal water fraction and the lumped evaporation for the rf classified images the correlation was 0 53 while for the jrc dataset it was 0 45 since episodic water exists in the landscape for a smaller fraction of time the contribution to open water evaporation is smaller despite the much greater extent 4 discussion overall this study indicates that there is a clear change in the landscape water balance over the study period 1988 2018 while temperature has strongly increased rainfall and rh have decreased on approximately 23 and 92 of the catchment extent respectively in contrast reference et etr has increased over a large part of the catchment open water evaporation is a significant part of the catchment water losses and this is correlated with permanent and seasonal surface water bodies evaporation losses are spatially variable decreasing in lake goran in the upper namoi in contrast they are increasing in agricultural sectors of the catchment due to the presence of on farm dams all trends in this study need to be considered in relation to the issues raised by serinaldi et al 2018 related to interpreting the results of null hypothesis significance tests therefore trend values estimated are limited to the study catchment and study period 1988 2018 and should not be used to model future conditions or be extrapolated beyond the study area the trend tests are preliminary screening tools further analysis using knowledge of physical processes taking place in the study area should be done to confirm that the trends make sense furthermore the use of annual summaries for the trend estimates can lead to underestimation of the temporal dependencies in the data however as more than 5 years of data was available the approach was considered valid whiters and nadarajah 2015 there are several sources of uncertainty that should be considered in this study landsat images have an average recurrence of 16 days per satellite which limits water detection to days when the satellite passes fuentes et al 2019b furthermore clouds and shadows can limit the detection of surface water especially after anomalous weather events such as storms this leads to a loss of information on surface water extent monitoring schumann and moller 2015 additionally the classification step may also lead to water detection uncertainties difficulties in the water recognition may be due to mixed pixels transfer errors or due to the classification algorithms fuentes et al 2019a as mentioned by feyisa et al 2014 mixed pixels can be an important source of error especially at large scales furthermore detection errors in steep areas as a result of elevation shadows whose spectral signature resembles water may be a potential source of errors during the classification feyisa et al 2014 however by using the hill shadow mask we believe these errors were reduced even though clouds and cloud shadows were removed from landsat images using the cfmask algorithm foga et al 2017 remnant clouds and cloud shadows may still be observed in some images which affects the surface water detection and contributes to the uncertainty in the classification xia et al 2019 the different wavelength ranges in the sensors of the different landsat satellites also introduce some noise in the classification this might result in classification errors which may add to the errors derived from the scan line corrector fail in the landsat 7 satellite other sources of uncertainty that may be propagated into the results are associated with the reference datasets used for instance the silo etr dataset has some limitations that should be considered even though it is a well recognised dataset developed using the established fao56 formulae allen et al 1998 eq 4 the dataset assumes a constant wind speed of 2 m s 1 which might cause errors in the evaporation calculation it also might propagate the uncertainties derived from the forcing data temperature relative humidity and radiation in the case of the jrc dataset pekel et al 2016 it tends to miss significant surface water during floods and therefore would lead to underestimation of evaporation in these events therefore and regardless of the value of the jrc dataset for global scale use its application at regional scales for monitoring episodic events such as floods must be carefully considered the evaporation layer contained in the pml v2 dataset zhang et al 2019 used to validate our evaporation estimates implies another source of uncertainty since it was primarily developed to obtain penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration evaporation in the pml v2 was estimated using the penman equation but not validated all flux towers for evaporation and transpiration validation are located in land areas and therefore do not measure open water evaporation moreover open water evaporation is rather seldom measured and therefore this hinders the validation of results this is the main reason for using the pml v2 evaporation in this study additionally the use of fao56 evapotranspiration and a single open water coefficient results in an oversimplification of the evaporation estimation allen et al 1998 jensen 2010 but is used here in order to monitor evaporation at the catchment scale and is not constrained to the main reservoirs thus the open water coefficient used is only acceptable if the surface water bodies are generally deep enough however since the heat storage capacity of a water body is mainly influenced by its depth finch and hall 2001 different water body depths will lead to different coefficients as mentioned the etr calculation also has some limitations for example the assumption of no heat flux as a consequence heat storage was not considered in this approach however finch and hall 2001 explain that for annual evaporation calculations heat storage plays a small role in total evaporation since seasonal changes tend to cancel each other thus the introduced error might be small due to the uncertain quality of the reference data used for validation and the reasons aforementioned evaporation values should be regarded only as rough estimates clearly there is a need for more evaporation measurements to build and validate open water evaporation models climatic trends suggest an intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to warmer conditions which translates into higher etr in the catchment huntington 2006 and a higher evaporation per unit of surface water in contrast to other studies that show decreasing or no trends in etr e g shenbin et al 2006 wang et al 2011 this study shows spatially variable but significant positive trends covering a large catchment extent this agrees with johnson and sharma 2010 study in which pan evaporation trends were found to be increasing at most weather stations in australia the increase in etr can be linked to significant positive temperature trends across the entire catchment which are not being offset by other weather variables for instance in most of the catchment there is no trend in rainfall together these results imply a decrease in blue and green water availability in the catchment for ecological functioning and human needs including agricultural and domestic water usage these results also agree with the predicted effects of climate change due to global warming collins et al 2013 as a result of temperature and etr trends the annual frequency of surface water occurrence was also found to be mostly decreasing if the loss in water frequency is confirmed as a long term trend then this can ultimately affect ecosystem functioning and led to a degradation of local economies and higher food security risks mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 the namoi catchment hosts over 46 000 ha of wetlands where regular flood events are essential for ecosystem health every two years green et al 2011 spatial negative trends in surface open water frequencies could signify a decrease in the health of these systems several studies have reported a decline in the extent of open surface water bodies as a consequence of anthropogenic activities legesse and ayenew 2006 micklin and aladin 2008 song et al 2012 in the current study such activities were not directly analysed even though open water areas with strong evidence of changes in frequency had mostly negative trends several spots indicate the opposite behaviour yet their spatial extents are small these correspond to on farm dams for irrigation purposes which have been built to secure water for irrigation additionally in spite of climate conditions and water availability fluctuations on farm dams indicated positive trends however water usage by irrigation was not evaluated in this study therefore anthropogenic effects on the overall surface water would require additional water usage data to be conclusive lumped water evaporation at the catchment scale in the study period has decreased despite an increasing etr trend this implies that open water evaporation is dominated by the surface water occurrence and frequency total annual evaporative losses in the catchment average 201 9 gl using both datasets evaluated which corresponds to 47 of the storage capacity of keepit dam preece and jones 2002 and exceeds the annual total account usage of surface water in the catchment burrell et al 2018 since most studies address the impact of climate on evaporation it is still unclear how these changes in open water evaporation could feedback to climate two main conclusions concerning the water footprint may be drawn based on our findings firstly the results reflect a decrease in the availability of blue water open water frequency but also in rainfall and rh secondly there is an increase in evaporation losses per unit water associated with the general increase in temperature this is also associated with a positive trend in etr resulting in a decrease in storage of green water overall these results imply a loss of available water which is a concern for both ecological assets and irrigation activities in the catchment in this study groundwater was not analysed however kelly et al 2014 reported dropping levels in several monitoring boreholes in the catchment which also suggests a loss of groundwater resources possibly due to the reduction in surface water availability this suggests an urgent need to review water management taking into account the increased loss of water in evaporation 5 conclusions the change in open water evaporation was evaluated in the namoi catchment from 1988 to the present through climate variables and surface water detection overall surface water frequencies have mostly been decreasing yet these are spatially variable in the catchment climate variables clearly indicate the predicted intensification of the hydrologic cycle as a result of climate change temperatures have significantly increased in the catchment while rainfall and relative humidity indicate negative trends in large areas together these have led to significant increases in etr across 90 of the catchment extent additionally rainfall and etr were significantly cross correlated to the surface water extent annual lumped open water evaporation losses average more than one third of the main keepit dam storage capacity in the catchment and exceed the annual total usage of all surface water accounts however these losses are spatially and temporally variable with decreasing trends this might be associated with a loss in surface water frequency which partly offsets the increase in etr a key problem for future water management is the increased evaporation per unit surface water extent which might be addressed by the implementation of mar projects credit authorship contribution statement ignacio fuentes methodology data curation investigation writing
