16140,the lack of dissolved oxygen and weak substrate removal capacity in constructed wetlands cw leads to terrible removal of nitrogen and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in this study automatic tidal flow cw microcosms were constructed by improving the oxygen environment siphon and air duct and substrate magnetite to enhance purification performance and the mechanism was explored the results showed that the addition of air duct could improve the oxygen collection and thus improved the nh4 removal efficiency additionally nitrogen removal was improved greatly due to the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in aerobic layer with the addition of magnetite mass balance indicated the microbial degradation dominated 32 62 the removal of pahs metagenomic analysis proved the existence of magnetite enhanced the number of pahs degrading bacteria functional groups and metabolic pathways and thus greatly improved the microbial degradation of pahs furthermore fe2 fe3 cycle played an important role in promoting the anaerobic degradation of pahs which might be served as an electron conduit to establish the direct interspecies electron transfer between iron reducing bacteria e g deltaproteobacteria bacterium and anaerolineae bacterium to degrade pahs efficiently this study provided better understanding of the simultaneous removal of pahs and nitrogen in tidal flow cws graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tidal flow constructed wetland pahs nitrogen fe2 fe3 cycle anaerolineae 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah is mainly produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and organic matter wang et al 2020 it had a great threat to the ecosystem and human health because of the significant mutagenesis carcinogenicity and toxicity luo et al 2018 pahs were widely detected in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtp for example the effluent concentration of benzopyrene b a p was 10 0 22 7 μg l 1 which was much higher than the usepa standard 0 2 μg l 1 saber et al 2020 yao et al 2017 hence it is urgent to find a high performance and suitable technology to remove pahs from wastewater in downstream of the wwtp various techniques are applied to remove pahs from aqueous solution for example advanced oxidation chen et al 2020 adsorption cai et al 2019 however these methods are greatly restrained in application due to high cost and adsorbent regeneration which are difficult to apply in large scale wastewater treatment process constructed wetland cw as a green ecological technology is considered as a suitable technology for wastewater treatment which always stood at the downstream of wastewater treatment plant and applied to remove pahs because of its low cost and easy operation jia et al 2018 the insufficient dissolved oxygen do was considered as the important factor leading to terrible removal efficiency re of organic pollutants e g pahs in traditional cw tcw guo et al 2020 xu and zhou 2017 which was also the major reason to inhibit nitrogen removal in tcw jia et al 2020 recently tidal flow cw tfcw has been applied to improve oxygen supply in cw and significantly increased nitrogen re cheng et al 2021 due to the rhythmic filling and draining of wastewater process the effluent do 4 47 6 03 mg l 1 was higher than that of influent do 1 07 5 58 mg l 1 and total nitrogen removal was 72 8 83 0 which was higher than that of tradition cw 40 0 55 0 liu et al 2020 vymazal 2007 however tfcw still needs pumps to achieve the cycle of filling and draining stage resulting in high operating costs and contrary to the original intention of choosing cw siphon cw scw an improved tfcw has been proposed based on our previous studies which relies on the siphon actions to realize the alternation of anoxic and aerobic environment in cw and realize efficient unpowered oxygenation lu et al 2020 however biofilm and solid suspended solids in the upper substrate have been proved to hinder atmospheric reaeration and limit nitrification through the long run which was also found in previous studies saeed and sun 2017 hence the air ducts of different heights on both sides which was used in sand filters schudel and boller 1990 was inserted in scw in this study in order to further increase the do and improve pollutant re notably low oxygen diffusion is considered as the limiting factor hindering simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd occurred which could be obtained better nitrogen removal hu et al 2012 hence it may play an important role in nitrogen conversion in cw with siphon and airduct in addition c n ratio is considered a major influencing factor limiting nitrogen removal in cw zhi and ji 2014 research showed that when the influent c n of wetland is 10 1 high tn removal 90 could be obtained fan et al 2013 jia et al found the tn removal could increase from 3 98 2 12 to 32 64 2 78 as the c n ratio increased from 0 5 to 5 0 jia et al 2018 however existing studies only focused on the effect of c n ratio on nitrogen removal and few studies concentrated on the effect of c n ratio on pahs removal oxygen plays an important role in ring opening and the improvement of terminal electron acceptor activity in the degradation of pahs nzila 2018 hence pahs could be effectively degraded in tfcw due to the o2 supply in the draining period nevertheless the degradation of pahs under anaerobic conditions filling period is difficult and stagnant due to the lack of oxygen and the high complexity of pahs it was reported that fe3 was proved to be used as terminal electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions and promote the degradation of pahs wang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 meanwhile the operation mode of tidal flow in cw can drive the fe2 fe3 cycle which could improve the intracellular and extracellular mass transfer efficiency of microbial degradation of pahs han et al 2017 shuai and jaffe 2019 besides it has been proved that fe2 could further participate in fe ii mediated autotrophic denitrification as an electron donor which could significantly improve the nitrogen re si et al 2020 therebefore iron was the key substrate to ensure the efficient removal of pahs and nitrogen additionally microbial degradation is an important way to remove pahs however up to now the research only quantifies the contribution of plants and substrates to the removal of pahs kang et al 2019 and there is still no study direct quantifying the contribution of microbial degradation to pahs removal because b a p has the characteristics of wide distribution strong toxicity and carcinogenicity it is selected as a typical pah in this study in view of the above limitations and gaps in the research field four cws with different design parameters were constructed for the purpose 1 to evaluate the potential removal of b a p and nitrogen of cws 2 to explore the treatment performance under different c n ratios of different cws 3 to quantify the contribution of cws components to the b a p removal pathway for a better understanding of b a p removal mechanism in cws 4 to explore the involvement of the biological process in the iron cycle and the correlation between microorganisms and b a p in cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of lab scale cw systems four laboratory scale cws namely tcw scw air duct inserted scw ascw and ascw coupled with magnetite ascw m with length of 40 cm width of 20 cm and height of 60 cm were used which were built in shandong university a perforated pvc pipe was placed in the center of the system to measure do in each cw at the bottom of each cw quartz sand 1 3 cm in diameter is placed with a height of 5 cm the main substrates are mainly composed of quartz sand 4 8 mm in diameter with a height of 55 cm except ascw m which was substituted for a mixture of magnetite and washed gravel in a volume of 1 2 the reactor was provided with an outlet every 10 cm along the height direction the tcw discharged water through the ordinary water pipe while the other three cws used a siphon pipe to discharge water in addition two u shaped air ducts with different heights were added to the ascw and acw m one end was 80 cm the other end was 150 cm and the bottom of the u shaped tube was 15 cm wide which were evenly perforated to provide sufficient oxygen fig 1 four cws were all continuous and vertical subsurface flow the hydraulic retention time hrt of each system was 3 days each cw was planted with iris pseudacorus at a density of 6 rhizomes 2 2 operation of lab scale cw systems after inoculating the activated sludge plants and microorganisms were then domesticated by synthetic wastewater and the experiment began after all cws were stable synthetic wastewater was prepared from tap water by adding sucrose nh4 2so4 kno3 kh2po4 and trace elements in addition the influent with different c n was treated by changing the amount of sucrose in order to explore the effect of different cw removal under different c n ratios i e c n 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 based on the reporting data of b a p concentration in wastewater qamar et al 2017 b a p 20 μg l 1 was used in this work the detailed characteristics of the influent are shown in table s1 2 4 sampling and analysis 2 4 1 batch test in order to further understand the nitrogen removal mechanism of different cw batch test was established at the end of the trial in the batch test the ph was adjusted to 7 8 0 1 the temperature was 25 1 c and do remained between 5 8 7 0 mg l hu et al 2012 during the 3 0 h period liquid samples were collected every 15 min and analyzed for nh4 no2 and no3 the nitrogen removal pathway can be determined by the following conversion rates ammonia oxidation nitration raob nitrite oxidation nitration rnob nitrite denitrification rdeni no2 and nitrate denitrification rdeni no3 the detailed experiment and calculation method were shown supporting information 2 4 2 water sampling and analysis water samples of influent and effluent were collected every 3 days and then filtered by 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane with syringe cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn were determined in the laboratory according to the standard method hinman 1955 do meter hq40d hach usa was used to measure the do concentration b a p in water samples was pretreated by solid phase extraction and then measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms using internal standard method the specific method has been introduced in detail in our previous research kang et al 2019 2 4 3 plant sampling and analysis chlorophyll fluorescence instrument walz junior pam germany was used to evaluate the stress of plants before and after adding b a p in addition the content of b a p in plants was also measured the roots and stems of plants were collected and then theses samples were cut into small pieces and freeze dried for 48 h b a p in 5 g plant sample was prepared from 20 ml dichloromethane and methanol with a volume ratio of 1 1 the organic phase was then concentrated to 1 ml by an automatic parallel concentrator lab tech china for measurement 2 4 4 substrate sampling and analysis substrates at 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm were collected screening substrates to remove plant residues and then freeze drying for 48 h according to the standard method hj 783 2016 the concentration of b a p in the substrate was extracted into 20 ml dichloromethane and methanol then b a p in samples was concentrated to 1 ml for measurement 2 4 5 microbial abundance and metabolism analysis when the operation of four cws was finished substrate at 0 20 cm and 40 60 cm of four cws was taken 200 g respectively to prepare for microbial analysis the microbial abundance of 16s rrna gene nitrogen related genes including amoa nxr nirs nirk nosz narg and amx was characterized by quantitative real time pcr qpcr metagenome was based on illumina novaseq hiseq high throughput sequencing platform the more details about qpcr and metagenome sequencing and analysis was shown in supporting information 2 5 characterization of magnetite the magnetite was characterized by sem xrd xps and eds the detailed information was shown in supporting information 2 6 mass balance mass balance analysis was carried out by using the concentration of b a p detected in water substrate and plant samples the detailed calculation of mass loading of b a p in water substrate and plant was shown in supporting information 2 7 statistical analysis spss 25 0 software spss inc chicago usa was utilized to calculate the analysis of variance anova when the p value is lower than 0 05 it is considered that the difference between the data is significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance 3 1 1 nutrients removal performance fig 2 and table s3 exhibited the variation of cod nh4 no3 and tn concentration and re in different cws under different c n ratios it could be seen from fig 2a and that the effluent cod concentration of tcw showed an increasing trend with the increase of c n ratio during the operation period while the effluent cod concentration of scw ascw and ascw m was almost stable as shown in fig s1 the c n ratio possessed strong positive correlations to organics removal rate in four cws which was also proved in previous studies jia et al 2018 however the cod concentration of tcw was significantly higher than scw ascw and ascw m under high c n ratios for example the effluent cod concentration of tcw was 106 29 3 64 mg l at c n 10 0 which was higher than scw 32 43 3 26 mg l ascw 15 07 2 88 mg l and ascw m 9 85 1 45 mg l this was attributed to the difference do concentration of four cws the water level of tcw is constant height and substrates were submerged in wastewater which result in the anaerobic condition less than 0 29 0 04 mg l during the experimental period fig s2 and thus inhibit the degradation of cod based on the lack of do the other three cws was improved tfcws that enabled tidal flow operation by siphoning which had the fill and draining periods in the filling period the wastewater was continuously pumped into cws and the substrate was flooded causing the anaerobic condition when the water level reached the top of the siphon the siphon action was triggered and purified water was drained through the siphon oxygen could thus be diffused into the system when water level was decreasing which was also proved by the do concentration table s4 when the water level dropped to the bottom of the siphon siphon action was destroyed due to the entered air and cws entered filling stage again so as to achieve periodical fill and draining therebefore scw ascw and ascw m had time changes of water level through siphon action which caused them to have alternative anaerobic and aerobic conditions and possessed better organic pollutants removal due to the improved oxygen conditions furthermore oxygen uptake ou was calculated to further understand the oxygen supply content s5 the result of ou was shown that the cw added with air duct ascw and ascw m increased the ou compared with tcw and scw that showed excellent oxygen supply fig s2 and table s5 which might because the air duct could improve the gas transmission problem in the cw and the partial pressure of oxygen is very large even in the upper layer schudel and boller 1990 the high oxygen partial pressure might give rise to microorganism more active to degrade cod and thus the effluent cod concentration of ascw m was lower than that of scw under high c n ratios magnetite had excellent oxidative property so the cod degradation efficiency of ascw m was always higher than that of ascw nitrification was the dominant nh4 removal mechanism in cw which was the aerobic process lu et al 2020 hence similar with the results of cod the nh4 effluent of ascw was lower than that of scw and tcw due to the efficient do supply fig 2b a positive correlation between iron combustion and nh4 re and ferrous ion can be used as a regulator to regulate bacterial biomass and activity and improve nitrification zhimiao et al 2019 which caused the nh4 re of ascw m was significantly higher than that of ascw with the increase of c n ratio the nh4 re was increased in scw ascw and ascw m while tcw kept unchanged basically fig s1 the reason was detailed studied in section 3 1 2 at c n 2 5 the nh4 re of ascw m 73 71 2 71 was 6 69 times higher than that of tcw 11 35 3 52 however the effluent tn concentration of ascw m 29 88 2 14 mg l had no significant difference with tcw 28 82 1 67 mg l at c n 2 5 fig 2d it was because high do and lack of electron donor inhibit denitrification and thus hinder tn re a large accumulation of no3 21 14 1 18 mg l was found in ascw m at c n 2 5 also proved this point with the increase of c n ratio the adequate organic electron donor was provided and thus the effluent no3 of the scw ascw and ascw m all decreased but the effluent no3 of tcw had no obvious decrease due to the severely inhibited nitrification when the c n ratio increased from 5 0 to 10 0 the increase of nh4 and no3 re of scw ascw and ascw m also promoted the increase of tn re with the increase of c n ratio at c n 10 0 the effluent tn concentration of ascw m 9 25 1 02 mg l was significantly higher than that of tcw 21 90 0 66 mg l scw 15 21 1 08 mg l and ascw 12 53 1 96 mg l on the one hand the highest removal of tn was attributed to the best oxygenation effect on the other hand fe ii was introduced to participate in the fe ii mediated autotrophic denitrification as an electron donor due to the addition of magnetite wu et al 2019 3 1 2 nitrogen transformation rate and pathway as the ratio of c n increases nitrifying bacteria cannot compete with heterotrophic bacteria for oxygen which results in a decrease of nh4 removal however with the increase of c n ratio the re of nh4 increased in scw ascw and ascw m in order to explain this phenomenon the nh4 no2 and no3 in different cws along the height direction were measured and shown in fig s3 the results showed the decreased nh4 20 mg l of scw ascw and ascw m at 0 20 cm substrate was more than the increase no3 increase 4 mg l and the no2 showed no obvious accumulation 0 25 mg l hence it was inferred that the snd occurred which could get higher nh4 removal with the increase of c n ratio tan et al 2020 furthermore the batch test was conducted to measure the nitrogen conversion rates table s6 in scw ascw and ascw m it could be seen from table s6 that the generation rate of nitrite raob rdeni no3 was higher than the consumption rate of nitrite rnob rdeni no2 which will lead to the accumulation of nitrite however no obvious accumulation of no2 was found in scw ascw and ascw m table s3 hence these statics proved no2 denitrified via snd was proved in addition the percentage of no2 denitrified via snd pndvs can be measured by the ratio of rdeni no2 rnob rdeni no2 hu et al 2012 the pndvs of scw ascw and ascw m was 32 00 51 89 and 57 98 respectively which indicated the addition of air duct could significantly promote pnvds in cw it was mainly considered that the stratification of the biofilm due to the oxygen diffusion limitation caused snd hu et al 2012 the cw with air duct possessed high partial pressure of oxygen and then would cause high oxygen concentration gradients within the biofilm which could promote the co existence of nitrification and denitrification zhou et al 2018 additionally the addition of iron could greatly promote nitrite reductase nir and enzyme nap encoded by functional gene napa of aerobic denitrification chen et al 2018 therebefore these could explain why the addition of air duct could significantly promote pnvds and the pnvds of ascw m the highest in order to further explore the nitrogen removal mechanism the absolute abundance of nitrogen removal gene was explored through qpcr which was shown in fig s4 and table s7 the amoa and nxra genes in cw with air duct were significantly higher than those in scw which proved that the addition of air duct promoted the growth of nitrifying bacteria and enhanced nitrification notably the amoa gene abundance was higher than that of nxra in scw ascw and ascw m and the abundance of nirs and nirk genes which were considered as indicators of no2 conversion to n2o and no was higher than that of narg and nosz these results verified the occurrence of snd via no2 additionally the ratio of amx gene in the scw ascw and ascw m was at least an order of magnitude smaller than other nitrogen removal genes which indicated that the anammox was not played an important role in the nitrogen removal in these cws although previous studies proved that the annamox could be achieved through the intermittent aeration and the presence of iron the aeration just increased do from 0 to 0 4 mg l yang et al 2021b which was lower than the do concentration 2 mg l in cws when the water level dropped fig s2 yan et al demonstrated that the activity of anammox was inhibited when the do concentration exceeded 2 mg l yan et al 2019 and thus annamox was not dominant removal mechanism in scw ascw and ascw m 3 1 3 b a p removal performance the different cw type showed significant differences on the effluent b a p concentration and b a p re fig 2e on the one hand this was due to the oxygen condition of different cw types it was reported that there was a significant positive correlation between the redox potential and the removal rate of pah and the number of pah degrading bacteria was positively correlated with the redox potential zhao et al 2021 on the other hand the existence of iron could form root iron plaque to promote the adsorption of pah and stimulate the growth of rhizosphere microorganisms to enhance the biodegradation of pah and provide electron acceptor for the degradation of pah therebefore ascw m possessed the best b a p re generally the increase of c n ratio can promote the activity of microorganisms and thus improve the re of pollutants however in this study there was no significant difference in b a p effluent concentration in the same cw fig 2f under different c n ratio which indicated c n ratio had no obvious effect on b a p removal in cws it might because the pah degrading bacteria has a selective advantage to degrade and metabolize pahs at low c n ratio allowing them to compete with faster growing bacteria under nutrient constraints leys et al 2005 therebefore the growth of pah degrading bacteria was not limited by c n ratio and thus no significant difference was observed in pah removal under different c n ratio 3 2 mass balance it could be seen from fig 3 a that the b a p concentration in the aboveground of scw and ascw plants was higher than that of tcw by 39 37 and 56 04 respectively which might due to the larger plant length and biomass and thus could uptake more b a p interestingly unlike the other three cw the concentration of b a p in roots of ascw m was much higher than that in aboveground parts this may be due to the existence of magnetite which formed iron plaque of root on the one hand the iron plaque of roots strengthened the tolerance or defense of plants to toxic substance thus limiting the transfer of b a p to aboveground part wu et al 2019 on the other hand iron would form oxide precipitates and its solubility would be reduced thus limiting the transfer of pollutants from roots to aboveground tissues guo et al 2020 fig 3b showed the order of b a p in substrate was tcw scw ascw ascw m compared with tcw scw and ascw ascw m had lower b a p concentration in the substrate which might because the alternative anoxic and aerobic environment formed by them was beneficial to the microbial degradation of b a p fe3 could effectively degrade and mineralize organic compounds and promote microbial degradation which caused the concentration of b a p in the substrate of ascw m was lowest in addition the concentration of b a p in the upper substrate 0 20 cm of ascw m is only 8 79 1 90 ug kg 1 which is lower than that in the other three wetlands 21 82 3 74 ug kg 1 45 47 3 07 ug kg 1 this obvious decline may be attributed to the existence of iron plaque of the root system that could adsorb of a large amount of b a p plant uptake substrate adsorption microbial degradation volatilization and photolysis are regarded as the mechanism for the removal of pahs in cws zhao et al 2021 in this paper the photolysis and volatilization probability of b a p could be neglected because the cw was covered with opaque tin foil and all cw were designed as subsurface flow cw compared with biodegradation and substrate adsorption hydrolysis is a relatively time consuming process hena et al 2021 in addition b a p has high hydrophobicity and stability which is the reason why it is not easy to hydrolyze therefore considering that the probability of photolysis volatilization and hydrolysis of b a p in hydrate is significantly lower this study identified microbial degradation substrate adsorption and plant uptake as the main ways to remove b a p it could be seen from fig 3c that the removal of b a p in cws was mainly depended on microbial degradation 32 62 however the ratio of substrate adsorption 10 25 and plant uptake 2 12 was relatively small in addition it could be observed that the addition of iron could increase the proportion of microbial degradation compared with the improvement of do 3 3 fe2 fe3 cycle the xrd results fig 4 a showed that the diffraction peaks of original magnetite can be all well indexed the crystal planes of magnetite syn jcpds pdf 19 0629 notably the xrd of the magnetite in the aerobic layer showed an obvious peak at 26 988 after the experiment which belongs to the characteristic peak of feooh jcpds pdf 26 0792 in order to further understand the valence state of iron xps fig 4b were used and analyzed it could be clearly seen that the fe 2p3 2 spectra exhibited characteristic peaks locating at 711 0 0 3 and 714 3 0 4 ev which were assigned to fe3 and fe2 respectively li et al 2019 compared with the ratio of fe3 fe2 of original magnetite the fe3 fe2 ratio of aerobic and anaerobic layer magnetite increased 1 83 to 2 67 and decreased 1 83 to 1 03 respectively based on these results it could be inferred that the fe3 of magnetite in anaerobic layer could be converted into fe2 under the action of iron reducing bacteria resulting in a decrease in the proportion of ferric iron fe2 may enter aerobic layer with the rise of water level and could be converted into fe3 and precipitated as iron oxyhydroxide feooh under the action of iron oxidizing bacteria in aerobic layer that caused the increase of fe3 fe2 ratio to be noted it is reported that the feooh could accumulate as iron plaque on hydrophyte root surfaces khan et al 2016 which could strength the absorption of toxic substances by plants in addition the root exudates produced by plant roots in aerobic zone could act as electron shuttles to improve the electron acceptance of magnetite lovley et al 2004 hence organic compounds such as b a p could be used as electron donors to convert fe3 into fe2 which might be transferred to the anaerobic zone with the decrease of water level and be anaerobically oxidized by no3 fig s5 showed the eds of magnetite that the fe content of magnetite remains basically unchanged before and after the reaction therefore iron constituted a cyclic reaction in the ascw m system fv fm could be a good indicator of plant stress resistance it could be observed from fig 4c that the fv fm of ascw m showed no significant decrease after the experiment and the aboveground and root length of ascw m increased 55 0 and 36 4 respectively compared with ascw which indicated the addition of magnetite was beneficial to the growth of plants longer root lengths might provide more root exudates and benefit the iron cycle based on these results the mechanism and transformation of iron cycle in cw fig 4d was put forward 3 5 microbial mechanism and functional metabolism analysis in order to reveal the microbial diversity mechanism of cws accurately and in detail the metagenome sequencing analysis of anaerobic and aerobic layer of cws was carried out respectively as shown in table s8 9 the ascw m had the highest shannon index that indicated that magnetite addition increased the microbial diversity in the aerobic and anaerobic layer it could be seen from fig 5 a and b that proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroides dominated in both aerobic and anaerobic layer at phylum level while obvious changes have taken place in dominant species below class level the relative abundance of genus was shown in fig 5c and d the addition of air duct increased the relative abundance of pseudoxanthomonas in aerobic layer tcw 0 8 scw 2 8 ascw 4 9 and ascw 5 8 which has been proved to be the key species for degrading pahs patel et al 2012 chryseobacterium and hydrogenophaga were considered as the genus of snd which accounted for 1 7 2 6 and 3 7 in the aerobic layer of scw ascw and ascw m this result reasonably explained the order of pdvds in these cws from the aspect of microorganism in addition the relative abundance of pseudomonas in the aerobic layer of ascw m was highest which was taken as iron oxidation bacteria xu et al 2020 tessaracoccus belongs to the heterotrophic denitrifiers which was dominated in the anaerobic and aerobic layer of scw ascw and ascw m however it was little in the tcw table s10 and s11 this result indicated the aerobic denitrification could be occurred in scw ascw and ascw m while not existed in tcw in the anaerobic layer the ascw m possessed the highest relative abundance of dechloromonas which was the nitrate dependent fe oxidation ndfo bacteria ma et al 2020 hence it might explain why ascw m had the best no3 removal notably the annamox genera for example candidatus scalindua ca brocadia ca anammoximicrobium ca jettenia ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobus yang et al 2021a was not observed in top 20 genera in both aerobic and anaerobic layer table s10 and table s11 which also proved that the anammox was not dominant nitrogen removal mechanism in aerobic layer it could be seen from fig 5e that ascw m had the highest species relative abundance of rhizobiales bacterium which has synergistic effect on plants luensmann et al 2016 synergistic symbiosis on plants might produce more root exudates and support the electronic acceptance of fe3 in magnetite for the degradation of pahs in the anaerobic layer fig 5f it could be seen that the highest species relative abundance of deltaproteobacteria bacterium rbg 16 71 12 and anaerolineaceae bacterium was observed in ascw m it was reported that the anaerolineae required syntrophic association with autotrophic such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens for efficient growth and could degrade organic matter anaerobically hori et al 2015 in addition the unclassed genus of deltaproteobacteria bacterium rbg 16 71 12 belongs to the deltaproteobacteria class which was proved to be the fe3 reducing bacteria slobodkina et al 2012 microbial dissimilatory iron reduction and iron oxidizing microorganisms can work in concert to form the fe2 fe3 cycle which transfer electrons extracellularly to microbial cells of different species jiang et al 2019 therebefore it could be inferred that the fe2 fe3 cycle formed electron conduct to establish the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between anaerolineaceae bacterium and deltaproteobacteria bacterium rbg 16 71 12 and promote the anaerobic degradation of pahs similar results about magnetite establishing diet between microorganisms was also appeared in previous studies liang et al 2022 from the perspective of metabolic pathway it could be seen from fig s6 9 that the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathways of scw ascw and ascw m were all improved compared with tcw this indicated that the alternative anaerobic and aerobic environments may enhance the pahs biodegradation and metabolism pathways and thus promote the degradation of pahs in addition fig s10 showed the venn diagram of functional groups the results showed that ascw m had the most functional groups and unique functional groups in both aerobic and anaerobic layer showing the diversity of its functional organisms which also explained its superior treatment efficiency specifically it could be seen from fig 6 a that the relative abundance of k17686 was enhanced in the aerobic layer of ascw m k17686 belongs to the p type cu transporter ec 7 2 2 8 which could undergo covalent phosphorylation during the inorganic iron transport cycle this indicated that ascw m could achieve ample phosphorylation to get more atp to degrade b a p in addition k01915 was also improved in the anaerobic layer of ascw m fig 6b which was glutamine synthetase ec 6 3 1 2 and could catalyze the incorporation of ammonium into glutamate and was a key enzyme of nitrogen metabolism furthermore functional enzymes predicated by kegg involved in oxidative phosphorylation detailed in table s12 and table s13 as the important process to generate atp was shown in fig 6c and 6d it showed that the anaerobic and aerobic layer of ascw m had higher relative abundance of oxidative phosphorylation than ascw for example nd3 of nadh dehydrogenase sdha and sdhb of succinate dehydrogenase and cox2 and cox3 of cytochrome c oxidase this indicated that the microorganism of ascw m was not affected by b a p and could produce more atp for microbial degradation of b a p in aerobic and anaerobic layers which also reasonably explained that ascw m had the best b a p treatment effect the microbial and functional analysis proved the occurrence of iron cycle and snd in ascw m and explained its excellent nitrogen and b a p re 3 5 proposed mechanism of nitrogen and b a p in ascw m based on these results the potential degradation pathways of nitrogen and b a p in ascw m was put forward fig 7 compare with plant uptake and substrate adsorption microbial degradation dominated in the nitrogen and b a p removal in ascw m in the aerobic layer alternative aerobic and anaerobic condition and high oxygen partial pressure was formed by siphon and air duct which caused the microorganism active this not only enhance the occurrence of snd to improve the nitrogen removal but also promoted the synergistic symbiosis on plants and produce more root exudates to support the electronic acceptance of fe3 in magnetite for the degradation of pahs in the anaerobic layer ndfo was occurred due to the abundant presence of fe2 in addition fe2 fe3 cycle played an important role in promoting the anaerobic degradation of pahs which might be served as an electron conduit to establish the direct interspecies electron transfer between iron reducing bacteria e g deltaproteobacteria bacterium and anaerolineae bacterium to degrade pahs efficiently to sum up the siphon air duct formed periodical time changes of water level and high oxygen partial pressure which boosted the formation of fe2 fe3 cycle in ascw m the alternative aerobic and anaerobic condition and fe2 fe3 cycle greatly increased microbial activity and established the direct interspecies electron transfer thus promoting the nitrogen and b a p removal 4 conclusion this work was proposed a novel tfcw ascw m and attempt to explore the effect of adding air duct on nutrient and pahs b a p treatment performance in cw it indicated that the air duct would improve the oxygen condition and formed high oxygen gradient in cw which could enhance microbial number and diversity besides the addition of magnetite could occur obvious pnvds in the aerobic layer and no3 could be further removed with fe2 as electron donor in anaerobic layer that improved nitrogen removal greatly compared with tcw ascw m improved the microbial degradation of b a p greatly it might because the formed of iron cycle in the ascw m which was formed by time changes of water level the fe2 fe3 cycle played an important role in the anaerobic degradation of pahs which might serve as an electron conduit to establish the diet between iron reducing bacteria and other microorganisms such as anaerolineae bacterium that could improve microbial degradation efficiency of pahs hence it implied the anaerolineae bacterium played an important role in the eliminate pahs in cw with iron declaration of competing interest the

16140,the lack of dissolved oxygen and weak substrate removal capacity in constructed wetlands cw leads to terrible removal of nitrogen and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in this study automatic tidal flow cw microcosms were constructed by improving the oxygen environment siphon and air duct and substrate magnetite to enhance purification performance and the mechanism was explored the results showed that the addition of air duct could improve the oxygen collection and thus improved the nh4 removal efficiency additionally nitrogen removal was improved greatly due to the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in aerobic layer with the addition of magnetite mass balance indicated the microbial degradation dominated 32 62 the removal of pahs metagenomic analysis proved the existence of magnetite enhanced the number of pahs degrading bacteria functional groups and metabolic pathways and thus greatly improved the microbial degradation of pahs furthermore fe2 fe3 cycle played an important role in promoting the anaerobic degradation of pahs which might be served as an electron conduit to establish the direct interspecies electron transfer between iron reducing bacteria e g deltaproteobacteria bacterium and anaerolineae bacterium to degrade pahs efficiently this study provided better understanding of the simultaneous removal of pahs and nitrogen in tidal flow cws graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tidal flow constructed wetland pahs nitrogen fe2 fe3 cycle anaerolineae 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah is mainly produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and organic matter wang et al 2020 it had a great threat to the ecosystem and human health because of the significant mutagenesis carcinogenicity and toxicity luo et al 2018 pahs were widely detected in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtp for example the effluent concentration of benzopyrene b a p was 10 0 22 7 μg l 1 which was much higher than the usepa standard 0 2 μg l 1 saber et al 2020 yao et al 2017 hence it is urgent to find a high performance and suitable technology to remove pahs from wastewater in downstream of the wwtp various techniques are applied to remove pahs from aqueous solution for example advanced oxidation chen et al 2020 adsorption cai et al 2019 however these methods are greatly restrained in application due to high cost and adsorbent regeneration which are difficult to apply in large scale wastewater treatment process constructed wetland cw as a green ecological technology is considered as a suitable technology for wastewater treatment which always stood at the downstream of wastewater treatment plant and applied to remove pahs because of its low cost and easy operation jia et al 2018 the insufficient dissolved oxygen do was considered as the important factor leading to terrible removal efficiency re of organic pollutants e g pahs in traditional cw tcw guo et al 2020 xu and zhou 2017 which was also the major reason to inhibit nitrogen removal in tcw jia et al 2020 recently tidal flow cw tfcw has been applied to improve oxygen supply in cw and significantly increased nitrogen re cheng et al 2021 due to the rhythmic filling and draining of wastewater process the effluent do 4 47 6 03 mg l 1 was higher than that of influent do 1 07 5 58 mg l 1 and total nitrogen removal was 72 8 83 0 which was higher than that of tradition cw 40 0 55 0 liu et al 2020 vymazal 2007 however tfcw still needs pumps to achieve the cycle of filling and draining stage resulting in high operating costs and contrary to the original intention of choosing cw siphon cw scw an improved tfcw has been proposed based on our previous studies which relies on the siphon actions to realize the alternation of anoxic and aerobic environment in cw and realize efficient unpowered oxygenation lu et al 2020 however biofilm and solid suspended solids in the upper substrate have been proved to hinder atmospheric reaeration and limit nitrification through the long run which was also found in previous studies saeed and sun 2017 hence the air ducts of different heights on both sides which was used in sand filters schudel and boller 1990 was inserted in scw in this study in order to further increase the do and improve pollutant re notably low oxygen diffusion is considered as the limiting factor hindering simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd occurred which could be obtained better nitrogen removal hu et al 2012 hence it may play an important role in nitrogen conversion in cw with siphon and airduct in addition c n ratio is considered a major influencing factor limiting nitrogen removal in cw zhi and ji 2014 research showed that when the influent c n of wetland is 10 1 high tn removal 90 could be obtained fan et al 2013 jia et al found the tn removal could increase from 3 98 2 12 to 32 64 2 78 as the c n ratio increased from 0 5 to 5 0 jia et al 2018 however existing studies only focused on the effect of c n ratio on nitrogen removal and few studies concentrated on the effect of c n ratio on pahs removal oxygen plays an important role in ring opening and the improvement of terminal electron acceptor activity in the degradation of pahs nzila 2018 hence pahs could be effectively degraded in tfcw due to the o2 supply in the draining period nevertheless the degradation of pahs under anaerobic conditions filling period is difficult and stagnant due to the lack of oxygen and the high complexity of pahs it was reported that fe3 was proved to be used as terminal electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions and promote the degradation of pahs wang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 meanwhile the operation mode of tidal flow in cw can drive the fe2 fe3 cycle which could improve the intracellular and extracellular mass transfer efficiency of microbial degradation of pahs han et al 2017 shuai and jaffe 2019 besides it has been proved that fe2 could further participate in fe ii mediated autotrophic denitrification as an electron donor which could significantly improve the nitrogen re si et al 2020 therebefore iron was the key substrate to ensure the efficient removal of pahs and nitrogen additionally microbial degradation is an important way to remove pahs however up to now the research only quantifies the contribution of plants and substrates to the removal of pahs kang et al 2019 and there is still no study direct quantifying the contribution of microbial degradation to pahs removal because b a p has the characteristics of wide distribution strong toxicity and carcinogenicity it is selected as a typical pah in this study in view of the above limitations and gaps in the research field four cws with different design parameters were constructed for the purpose 1 to evaluate the potential removal of b a p and nitrogen of cws 2 to explore the treatment performance under different c n ratios of different cws 3 to quantify the contribution of cws components to the b a p removal pathway for a better understanding of b a p removal mechanism in cws 4 to explore the involvement of the biological process in the iron cycle and the correlation between microorganisms and b a p in cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of lab scale cw systems four laboratory scale cws namely tcw scw air duct inserted scw ascw and ascw coupled with magnetite ascw m with length of 40 cm width of 20 cm and height of 60 cm were used which were built in shandong university a perforated pvc pipe was placed in the center of the system to measure do in each cw at the bottom of each cw quartz sand 1 3 cm in diameter is placed with a height of 5 cm the main substrates are mainly composed of quartz sand 4 8 mm in diameter with a height of 55 cm except ascw m which was substituted for a mixture of magnetite and washed gravel in a volume of 1 2 the reactor was provided with an outlet every 10 cm along the height direction the tcw discharged water through the ordinary water pipe while the other three cws used a siphon pipe to discharge water in addition two u shaped air ducts with different heights were added to the ascw and acw m one end was 80 cm the other end was 150 cm and the bottom of the u shaped tube was 15 cm wide which were evenly perforated to provide sufficient oxygen fig 1 four cws were all continuous and vertical subsurface flow the hydraulic retention time hrt of each system was 3 days each cw was planted with iris pseudacorus at a density of 6 rhizomes 2 2 operation of lab scale cw systems after inoculating the activated sludge plants and microorganisms were then domesticated by synthetic wastewater and the experiment began after all cws were stable synthetic wastewater was prepared from tap water by adding sucrose nh4 2so4 kno3 kh2po4 and trace elements in addition the influent with different c n was treated by changing the amount of sucrose in order to explore the effect of different cw removal under different c n ratios i e c n 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 based on the reporting data of b a p concentration in wastewater qamar et al 2017 b a p 20 μg l 1 was used in this work the detailed characteristics of the influent are shown in table s1 2 4 sampling and analysis 2 4 1 batch test in order to further understand the nitrogen removal mechanism of different cw batch test was established at the end of the trial in the batch test the ph was adjusted to 7 8 0 1 the temperature was 25 1 c and do remained between 5 8 7 0 mg l hu et al 2012 during the 3 0 h period liquid samples were collected every 15 min and analyzed for nh4 no2 and no3 the nitrogen removal pathway can be determined by the following conversion rates ammonia oxidation nitration raob nitrite oxidation nitration rnob nitrite denitrification rdeni no2 and nitrate denitrification rdeni no3 the detailed experiment and calculation method were shown supporting information 2 4 2 water sampling and analysis water samples of influent and effluent were collected every 3 days and then filtered by 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane with syringe cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn were determined in the laboratory according to the standard method hinman 1955 do meter hq40d hach usa was used to measure the do concentration b a p in water samples was pretreated by solid phase extraction and then measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms using internal standard method the specific method has been introduced in detail in our previous research kang et al 2019 2 4 3 plant sampling and analysis chlorophyll fluorescence instrument walz junior pam germany was used to evaluate the stress of plants before and after adding b a p in addition the content of b a p in plants was also measured the roots and stems of plants were collected and then theses samples were cut into small pieces and freeze dried for 48 h b a p in 5 g plant sample was prepared from 20 ml dichloromethane and methanol with a volume ratio of 1 1 the organic phase was then concentrated to 1 ml by an automatic parallel concentrator lab tech china for measurement 2 4 4 substrate sampling and analysis substrates at 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm were collected screening substrates to remove plant residues and then freeze drying for 48 h according to the standard method hj 783 2016 the concentration of b a p in the substrate was extracted into 20 ml dichloromethane and methanol then b a p in samples was concentrated to 1 ml for measurement 2 4 5 microbial abundance and metabolism analysis when the operation of four cws was finished substrate at 0 20 cm and 40 60 cm of four cws was taken 200 g respectively to prepare for microbial analysis the microbial abundance of 16s rrna gene nitrogen related genes including amoa nxr nirs nirk nosz narg and amx was characterized by quantitative real time pcr qpcr metagenome was based on illumina novaseq hiseq high throughput sequencing platform the more details about qpcr and metagenome sequencing and analysis was shown in supporting information 2 5 characterization of magnetite the magnetite was characterized by sem xrd xps and eds the detailed information was shown in supporting information 2 6 mass balance mass balance analysis was carried out by using the concentration of b a p detected in water substrate and plant samples the detailed calculation of mass loading of b a p in water substrate and plant was shown in supporting information 2 7 statistical analysis spss 25 0 software spss inc chicago usa was utilized to calculate the analysis of variance anova when the p value is lower than 0 05 it is considered that the difference between the data is significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance 3 1 1 nutrients removal performance fig 2 and table s3 exhibited the variation of cod nh4 no3 and tn concentration and re in different cws under different c n ratios it could be seen from fig 2a and that the effluent cod concentration of tcw showed an increasing trend with the increase of c n ratio during the operation period while the effluent cod concentration of scw ascw and ascw m was almost stable as shown in fig s1 the c n ratio possessed strong positive correlations to organics removal rate in four cws which was also proved in previous studies jia et al 2018 however the cod concentration of tcw was significantly higher than scw ascw and ascw m under high c n ratios for example the effluent cod concentration of tcw was 106 29 3 64 mg l at c n 10 0 which was higher than scw 32 43 3 26 mg l ascw 15 07 2 88 mg l and ascw m 9 85 1 45 mg l this was attributed to the difference do concentration of four cws the water level of tcw is constant height and substrates were submerged in wastewater which result in the anaerobic condition less than 0 29 0 04 mg l during the experimental period fig s2 and thus inhibit the degradation of cod based on the lack of do the other three cws was improved tfcws that enabled tidal flow operation by siphoning which had the fill and draining periods in the filling period the wastewater was continuously pumped into cws and the substrate was flooded causing the anaerobic condition when the water level reached the top of the siphon the siphon action was triggered and purified water was drained through the siphon oxygen could thus be diffused into the system when water level was decreasing which was also proved by the do concentration table s4 when the water level dropped to the bottom of the siphon siphon action was destroyed due to the entered air and cws entered filling stage again so as to achieve periodical fill and draining therebefore scw ascw and ascw m had time changes of water level through siphon action which caused them to have alternative anaerobic and aerobic conditions and possessed better organic pollutants removal due to the improved oxygen conditions furthermore oxygen uptake ou was calculated to further understand the oxygen supply content s5 the result of ou was shown that the cw added with air duct ascw and ascw m increased the ou compared with tcw and scw that showed excellent oxygen supply fig s2 and table s5 which might because the air duct could improve the gas transmission problem in the cw and the partial pressure of oxygen is very large even in the upper layer schudel and boller 1990 the high oxygen partial pressure might give rise to microorganism more active to degrade cod and thus the effluent cod concentration of ascw m was lower than that of scw under high c n ratios magnetite had excellent oxidative property so the cod degradation efficiency of ascw m was always higher than that of ascw nitrification was the dominant nh4 removal mechanism in cw which was the aerobic process lu et al 2020 hence similar with the results of cod the nh4 effluent of ascw was lower than that of scw and tcw due to the efficient do supply fig 2b a positive correlation between iron combustion and nh4 re and ferrous ion can be used as a regulator to regulate bacterial biomass and activity and improve nitrification zhimiao et al 2019 which caused the nh4 re of ascw m was significantly higher than that of ascw with the increase of c n ratio the nh4 re was increased in scw ascw and ascw m while tcw kept unchanged basically fig s1 the reason was detailed studied in section 3 1 2 at c n 2 5 the nh4 re of ascw m 73 71 2 71 was 6 69 times higher than that of tcw 11 35 3 52 however the effluent tn concentration of ascw m 29 88 2 14 mg l had no significant difference with tcw 28 82 1 67 mg l at c n 2 5 fig 2d it was because high do and lack of electron donor inhibit denitrification and thus hinder tn re a large accumulation of no3 21 14 1 18 mg l was found in ascw m at c n 2 5 also proved this point with the increase of c n ratio the adequate organic electron donor was provided and thus the effluent no3 of the scw ascw and ascw m all decreased but the effluent no3 of tcw had no obvious decrease due to the severely inhibited nitrification when the c n ratio increased from 5 0 to 10 0 the increase of nh4 and no3 re of scw ascw and ascw m also promoted the increase of tn re with the increase of c n ratio at c n 10 0 the effluent tn concentration of ascw m 9 25 1 02 mg l was significantly higher than that of tcw 21 90 0 66 mg l scw 15 21 1 08 mg l and ascw 12 53 1 96 mg l on the one hand the highest removal of tn was attributed to the best oxygenation effect on the other hand fe ii was introduced to participate in the fe ii mediated autotrophic denitrification as an electron donor due to the addition of magnetite wu et al 2019 3 1 2 nitrogen transformation rate and pathway as the ratio of c n increases nitrifying bacteria cannot compete with heterotrophic bacteria for oxygen which results in a decrease of nh4 removal however with the increase of c n ratio the re of nh4 increased in scw ascw and ascw m in order to explain this phenomenon the nh4 no2 and no3 in different cws along the height direction were measured and shown in fig s3 the results showed the decreased nh4 20 mg l of scw ascw and ascw m at 0 20 cm substrate was more than the increase no3 increase 4 mg l and the no2 showed no obvious accumulation 0 25 mg l hence it was inferred that the snd occurred which could get higher nh4 removal with the increase of c n ratio tan et al 2020 furthermore the batch test was conducted to measure the nitrogen conversion rates table s6 in scw ascw and ascw m it could be seen from table s6 that the generation rate of nitrite raob rdeni no3 was higher than the consumption rate of nitrite rnob rdeni no2 which will lead to the accumulation of nitrite however no obvious accumulation of no2 was found in scw ascw and ascw m table s3 hence these statics proved no2 denitrified via snd was proved in addition the percentage of no2 denitrified via snd pndvs can be measured by the ratio of rdeni no2 rnob rdeni no2 hu et al 2012 the pndvs of scw ascw and ascw m was 32 00 51 89 and 57 98 respectively which indicated the addition of air duct could significantly promote pnvds in cw it was mainly considered that the stratification of the biofilm due to the oxygen diffusion limitation caused snd hu et al 2012 the cw with air duct possessed high partial pressure of oxygen and then would cause high oxygen concentration gradients within the biofilm which could promote the co existence of nitrification and denitrification zhou et al 2018 additionally the addition of iron could greatly promote nitrite reductase nir and enzyme nap encoded by functional gene napa of aerobic denitrification chen et al 2018 therebefore these could explain why the addition of air duct could significantly promote pnvds and the pnvds of ascw m the highest in order to further explore the nitrogen removal mechanism the absolute abundance of nitrogen removal gene was explored through qpcr which was shown in fig s4 and table s7 the amoa and nxra genes in cw with air duct were significantly higher than those in scw which proved that the addition of air duct promoted the growth of nitrifying bacteria and enhanced nitrification notably the amoa gene abundance was higher than that of nxra in scw ascw and ascw m and the abundance of nirs and nirk genes which were considered as indicators of no2 conversion to n2o and no was higher than that of narg and nosz these results verified the occurrence of snd via no2 additionally the ratio of amx gene in the scw ascw and ascw m was at least an order of magnitude smaller than other nitrogen removal genes which indicated that the anammox was not played an important role in the nitrogen removal in these cws although previous studies proved that the annamox could be achieved through the intermittent aeration and the presence of iron the aeration just increased do from 0 to 0 4 mg l yang et al 2021b which was lower than the do concentration 2 mg l in cws when the water level dropped fig s2 yan et al demonstrated that the activity of anammox was inhibited when the do concentration exceeded 2 mg l yan et al 2019 and thus annamox was not dominant removal mechanism in scw ascw and ascw m 3 1 3 b a p removal performance the different cw type showed significant differences on the effluent b a p concentration and b a p re fig 2e on the one hand this was due to the oxygen condition of different cw types it was reported that there was a significant positive correlation between the redox potential and the removal rate of pah and the number of pah degrading bacteria was positively correlated with the redox potential zhao et al 2021 on the other hand the existence of iron could form root iron plaque to promote the adsorption of pah and stimulate the growth of rhizosphere microorganisms to enhance the biodegradation of pah and provide electron acceptor for the degradation of pah therebefore ascw m possessed the best b a p re generally the increase of c n ratio can promote the activity of microorganisms and thus improve the re of pollutants however in this study there was no significant difference in b a p effluent concentration in the same cw fig 2f under different c n ratio which indicated c n ratio had no obvious effect on b a p removal in cws it might because the pah degrading bacteria has a selective advantage to degrade and metabolize pahs at low c n ratio allowing them to compete with faster growing bacteria under nutrient constraints leys et al 2005 therebefore the growth of pah degrading bacteria was not limited by c n ratio and thus no significant difference was observed in pah removal under different c n ratio 3 2 mass balance it could be seen from fig 3 a that the b a p concentration in the aboveground of scw and ascw plants was higher than that of tcw by 39 37 and 56 04 respectively which might due to the larger plant length and biomass and thus could uptake more b a p interestingly unlike the other three cw the concentration of b a p in roots of ascw m was much higher than that in aboveground parts this may be due to the existence of magnetite which formed iron plaque of root on the one hand the iron plaque of roots strengthened the tolerance or defense of plants to toxic substance thus limiting the transfer of b a p to aboveground part wu et al 2019 on the other hand iron would form oxide precipitates and its solubility would be reduced thus limiting the transfer of pollutants from roots to aboveground tissues guo et al 2020 fig 3b showed the order of b a p in substrate was tcw scw ascw ascw m compared with tcw scw and ascw ascw m had lower b a p concentration in the substrate which might because the alternative anoxic and aerobic environment formed by them was beneficial to the microbial degradation of b a p fe3 could effectively degrade and mineralize organic compounds and promote microbial degradation which caused the concentration of b a p in the substrate of ascw m was lowest in addition the concentration of b a p in the upper substrate 0 20 cm of ascw m is only 8 79 1 90 ug kg 1 which is lower than that in the other three wetlands 21 82 3 74 ug kg 1 45 47 3 07 ug kg 1 this obvious decline may be attributed to the existence of iron plaque of the root system that could adsorb of a large amount of b a p plant uptake substrate adsorption microbial degradation volatilization and photolysis are regarded as the mechanism for the removal of pahs in cws zhao et al 2021 in this paper the photolysis and volatilization probability of b a p could be neglected because the cw was covered with opaque tin foil and all cw were designed as subsurface flow cw compared with biodegradation and substrate adsorption hydrolysis is a relatively time consuming process hena et al 2021 in addition b a p has high hydrophobicity and stability which is the reason why it is not easy to hydrolyze therefore considering that the probability of photolysis volatilization and hydrolysis of b a p in hydrate is significantly lower this study identified microbial degradation substrate adsorption and plant uptake as the main ways to remove b a p it could be seen from fig 3c that the removal of b a p in cws was mainly depended on microbial degradation 32 62 however the ratio of substrate adsorption 10 25 and plant uptake 2 12 was relatively small in addition it could be observed that the addition of iron could increase the proportion of microbial degradation compared with the improvement of do 3 3 fe2 fe3 cycle the xrd results fig 4 a showed that the diffraction peaks of original magnetite can be all well indexed the crystal planes of magnetite syn jcpds pdf 19 0629 notably the xrd of the magnetite in the aerobic layer showed an obvious peak at 26 988 after the experiment which belongs to the characteristic peak of feooh jcpds pdf 26 0792 in order to further understand the valence state of iron xps fig 4b were used and analyzed it could be clearly seen that the fe 2p3 2 spectra exhibited characteristic peaks locating at 711 0 0 3 and 714 3 0 4 ev which were assigned to fe3 and fe2 respectively li et al 2019 compared with the ratio of fe3 fe2 of original magnetite the fe3 fe2 ratio of aerobic and anaerobic layer magnetite increased 1 83 to 2 67 and decreased 1 83 to 1 03 respectively based on these results it could be inferred that the fe3 of magnetite in anaerobic layer could be converted into fe2 under the action of iron reducing bacteria resulting in a decrease in the proportion of ferric iron fe2 may enter aerobic layer with the rise of water level and could be converted into fe3 and precipitated as iron oxyhydroxide feooh under the action of iron oxidizing bacteria in aerobic layer that caused the increase of fe3 fe2 ratio to be noted it is reported that the feooh could accumulate as iron plaque on hydrophyte root surfaces khan et al 2016 which could strength the absorption of toxic substances by plants in addition the root exudates produced by plant roots in aerobic zone could act as electron shuttles to improve the electron acceptance of magnetite lovley et al 2004 hence organic compounds such as b a p could be used as electron donors to convert fe3 into fe2 which might be transferred to the anaerobic zone with the decrease of water level and be anaerobically oxidized by no3 fig s5 showed the eds of magnetite that the fe content of magnetite remains basically unchanged before and after the reaction therefore iron constituted a cyclic reaction in the ascw m system fv fm could be a good indicator of plant stress resistance it could be observed from fig 4c that the fv fm of ascw m showed no significant decrease after the experiment and the aboveground and root length of ascw m increased 55 0 and 36 4 respectively compared with ascw which indicated the addition of magnetite was beneficial to the growth of plants longer root lengths might provide more root exudates and benefit the iron cycle based on these results the mechanism and transformation of iron cycle in cw fig 4d was put forward 3 5 microbial mechanism and functional metabolism analysis in order to reveal the microbial diversity mechanism of cws accurately and in detail the metagenome sequencing analysis of anaerobic and aerobic layer of cws was carried out respectively as shown in table s8 9 the ascw m had the highest shannon index that indicated that magnetite addition increased the microbial diversity in the aerobic and anaerobic layer it could be seen from fig 5 a and b that proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroides dominated in both aerobic and anaerobic layer at phylum level while obvious changes have taken place in dominant species below class level the relative abundance of genus was shown in fig 5c and d the addition of air duct increased the relative abundance of pseudoxanthomonas in aerobic layer tcw 0 8 scw 2 8 ascw 4 9 and ascw 5 8 which has been proved to be the key species for degrading pahs patel et al 2012 chryseobacterium and hydrogenophaga were considered as the genus of snd which accounted for 1 7 2 6 and 3 7 in the aerobic layer of scw ascw and ascw m this result reasonably explained the order of pdvds in these cws from the aspect of microorganism in addition the relative abundance of pseudomonas in the aerobic layer of ascw m was highest which was taken as iron oxidation bacteria xu et al 2020 tessaracoccus belongs to the heterotrophic denitrifiers which was dominated in the anaerobic and aerobic layer of scw ascw and ascw m however it was little in the tcw table s10 and s11 this result indicated the aerobic denitrification could be occurred in scw ascw and ascw m while not existed in tcw in the anaerobic layer the ascw m possessed the highest relative abundance of dechloromonas which was the nitrate dependent fe oxidation ndfo bacteria ma et al 2020 hence it might explain why ascw m had the best no3 removal notably the annamox genera for example candidatus scalindua ca brocadia ca anammoximicrobium ca jettenia ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobus yang et al 2021a was not observed in top 20 genera in both aerobic and anaerobic layer table s10 and table s11 which also proved that the anammox was not dominant nitrogen removal mechanism in aerobic layer it could be seen from fig 5e that ascw m had the highest species relative abundance of rhizobiales bacterium which has synergistic effect on plants luensmann et al 2016 synergistic symbiosis on plants might produce more root exudates and support the electronic acceptance of fe3 in magnetite for the degradation of pahs in the anaerobic layer fig 5f it could be seen that the highest species relative abundance of deltaproteobacteria bacterium rbg 16 71 12 and anaerolineaceae bacterium was observed in ascw m it was reported that the anaerolineae required syntrophic association with autotrophic such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens for efficient growth and could degrade organic matter anaerobically hori et al 2015 in addition the unclassed genus of deltaproteobacteria bacterium rbg 16 71 12 belongs to the deltaproteobacteria class which was proved to be the fe3 reducing bacteria slobodkina et al 2012 microbial dissimilatory iron reduction and iron oxidizing microorganisms can work in concert to form the fe2 fe3 cycle which transfer electrons extracellularly to microbial cells of different species jiang et al 2019 therebefore it could be inferred that the fe2 fe3 cycle formed electron conduct to establish the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between anaerolineaceae bacterium and deltaproteobacteria bacterium rbg 16 71 12 and promote the anaerobic degradation of pahs similar results about magnetite establishing diet between microorganisms was also appeared in previous studies liang et al 2022 from the perspective of metabolic pathway it could be seen from fig s6 9 that the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathways of scw ascw and ascw m were all improved compared with tcw this indicated that the alternative anaerobic and aerobic environments may enhance the pahs biodegradation and metabolism pathways and thus promote the degradation of pahs in addition fig s10 showed the venn diagram of functional groups the results showed that ascw m had the most functional groups and unique functional groups in both aerobic and anaerobic layer showing the diversity of its functional organisms which also explained its superior treatment efficiency specifically it could be seen from fig 6 a that the relative abundance of k17686 was enhanced in the aerobic layer of ascw m k17686 belongs to the p type cu transporter ec 7 2 2 8 which could undergo covalent phosphorylation during the inorganic iron transport cycle this indicated that ascw m could achieve ample phosphorylation to get more atp to degrade b a p in addition k01915 was also improved in the anaerobic layer of ascw m fig 6b which was glutamine synthetase ec 6 3 1 2 and could catalyze the incorporation of ammonium into glutamate and was a key enzyme of nitrogen metabolism furthermore functional enzymes predicated by kegg involved in oxidative phosphorylation detailed in table s12 and table s13 as the important process to generate atp was shown in fig 6c and 6d it showed that the anaerobic and aerobic layer of ascw m had higher relative abundance of oxidative phosphorylation than ascw for example nd3 of nadh dehydrogenase sdha and sdhb of succinate dehydrogenase and cox2 and cox3 of cytochrome c oxidase this indicated that the microorganism of ascw m was not affected by b a p and could produce more atp for microbial degradation of b a p in aerobic and anaerobic layers which also reasonably explained that ascw m had the best b a p treatment effect the microbial and functional analysis proved the occurrence of iron cycle and snd in ascw m and explained its excellent nitrogen and b a p re 3 5 proposed mechanism of nitrogen and b a p in ascw m based on these results the potential degradation pathways of nitrogen and b a p in ascw m was put forward fig 7 compare with plant uptake and substrate adsorption microbial degradation dominated in the nitrogen and b a p removal in ascw m in the aerobic layer alternative aerobic and anaerobic condition and high oxygen partial pressure was formed by siphon and air duct which caused the microorganism active this not only enhance the occurrence of snd to improve the nitrogen removal but also promoted the synergistic symbiosis on plants and produce more root exudates to support the electronic acceptance of fe3 in magnetite for the degradation of pahs in the anaerobic layer ndfo was occurred due to the abundant presence of fe2 in addition fe2 fe3 cycle played an important role in promoting the anaerobic degradation of pahs which might be served as an electron conduit to establish the direct interspecies electron transfer between iron reducing bacteria e g deltaproteobacteria bacterium and anaerolineae bacterium to degrade pahs efficiently to sum up the siphon air duct formed periodical time changes of water level and high oxygen partial pressure which boosted the formation of fe2 fe3 cycle in ascw m the alternative aerobic and anaerobic condition and fe2 fe3 cycle greatly increased microbial activity and established the direct interspecies electron transfer thus promoting the nitrogen and b a p removal 4 conclusion this work was proposed a novel tfcw ascw m and attempt to explore the effect of adding air duct on nutrient and pahs b a p treatment performance in cw it indicated that the air duct would improve the oxygen condition and formed high oxygen gradient in cw which could enhance microbial number and diversity besides the addition of magnetite could occur obvious pnvds in the aerobic layer and no3 could be further removed with fe2 as electron donor in anaerobic layer that improved nitrogen removal greatly compared with tcw ascw m improved the microbial degradation of b a p greatly it might because the formed of iron cycle in the ascw m which was formed by time changes of water level the fe2 fe3 cycle played an important role in the anaerobic degradation of pahs which might serve as an electron conduit to establish the diet between iron reducing bacteria and other microorganisms such as anaerolineae bacterium that could improve microbial degradation efficiency of pahs hence it implied the anaerolineae bacterium played an important role in the eliminate pahs in cw with iron declaration of competing interest the

16141,circumstantial evidence has suggested that jellyfish swarms impair the operation of seawater reverse osmosis desalination facilities however only limited information is currently available on the pretreatment efficiency of jellyfish and their effects on reverse osmosis ro membrane performance here we have comprehensively tested the pretreatment efficiency of a dual media gravity filter and cartridge micro filtration following the addition of jellyfish into the feedwater concurrently the fouling propensity and performance of the ro membranes were examined we show that jellyfish demise resulted in seawater eutrophication that triggered a significant increase in bacterial biomass 50 fold activity 7 fold and release of transparent exopolymer particles 5 fold peaking three days after the addition of jellyfish into the feedwater in parallel a significant reduction in permeate water flux was recorded 10 while trans membrane pressure sharply increased 15 reaching the operation pressure limit of our system 75 bar after five days at the conclusion of the experiments the membrane surface was heavily covered by large chunks of organic rich material and multilayered biofilms our results provide a holistic view on the operational challenges of seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination triggered by jellyfish swarms in coastal areas following the above it can be inferred that freshwater production will likely be halted three days after drawing the jellyfish into the pretreatment system outcomes from these results may lead to the development of science based operational protocols to cope with growing occurrence of jellyfish swarms around the intake of swro desalination facilities worldwide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords jellyfish swarms swro desalination pretreatment efficiency tep microbes 1 introduction at the beginning of the 20th century only 2 of the global population lived under chronic water shortage while rising to 35 by the turn of the 21st century kummu et al 2010 liu et al 2017 one of the most commonly used solutions to increase freshwater availability and minimize freshwater shortage is by seawater desalination currently 65 of the desalinated water worldwide is produced via seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination as its energy requirements are significantly lower than other thermal technologies eke et al 2020 reverse osmosis ro desalination is a membrane separation process in which seawater are pressurized through semi permeable membranes that reject salts and minerals while producing freshwater despite a vast progress in the field of desalination ro membranes still require extensive pretreatment steps to minimize fouling development on their surface thus maintain adequate trans membrane pressure tmp and ensure constant flux of freshwater output anis et al 2019 badruzzaman et al 2019 pretreatment procedures are therefore designed to minimize the concentrations of foulants i e organic and inorganic matter before the ro module stages the pretreatment steps of large scale swro desalination facilities often include i drum screeners to discard large objects drawn with the feedwater such as fish jellyfish and plastics ii addition of coagulants followed by dual media gravity filtration dmf to remove small 0 2 50 µm inorganic and organic material iii cartridge filters pore size 10 25 µm to ensure sand or other particles that passed the dmf will not reach the ro membranes while these pretreatment steps prove to be useful in many cases they are not designed to operate under a burst of feedwater containing high organic loads such as sewage discharges bar zeev et al 2021 similarly jellyfish swarms may impair the pretreatment efficiency and freshwater production as has been suggested to occur at various coastal environments abdul azis et al 2000 daryanabard and dawson 2008 kress et al 2018 jellyfish are ubiquitous in the marine environment found in most oceans and often reach the coastline richardson et al 2009 schaub et al 2018 they are gelatinous zooplanktonic organisms comprised mostly from water 96 97 while their carbon content is only 0 5 arai 1997 pitt et al 2013 these organisms include the cnidaria and ctenophora phyla occasionally forming massive swarms richardson et al 2009 schaub et al 2018 jellyfish swarms can extend from tens square meters to hundreds square

have indicated that appearance of jellyfish swarms has severe effects on several sea based industries such as fisheries and power plants purcell et al 2007 richardson et al 2009 although the frequency of gelatinous outbreaks has increased during the last two decades and the dependency on desalination as a freshwater source is rapidly growing only little is known on the impacts of jellyfish swarms on coastal desalination facilities in this study seawater were pretreated and desalinated after the addition of jellyfish to mimic the occurrence of a swarm as it often occurs in the southeastern mediterranean during winter and summer to this end seawater with or without jellyfish addition were pretreated by gravity and cartridge filtration and desalinated using an inline ro system while maintaining a constant freshwater flux the feedwater properties and removal rates of organic matter by gravity and cartridge filtration were tested daily while ro performance was constantly measured our results highlight the deleterious impacts of jellyfish on the desalination operation once they are drawn into the process 2 materials and methods experimental design coastal seawater collected

classes and genera 3 and 2 of all the otus respectively found in the feedwater samples or on the ro membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of jellyfish breakdown on feedwater properties dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nitrate nitrite ammonium and orthophosphate prior any manipulation ranged in the seawater between 1 3 5 µm and 0 02 0 08 µm respectively fig 2 these low concentrations are within the typical values measured in the oligotrophic southeastern mediterranean coast even during the wintertime raveh et al 2015 during the first day after the addition of shredded jellyfish similar to their physical state after passing through a large scale screen drum the din and orthophosphate concentrations significantly increased by 25 fold on average fig 2 specifically ammonium increased the most within the din pool reaching as high as 33 µm a few days after the jellyfish amendment these results agree with a recent study showing that 24 h of jellyfish degradation the same specie tested here resulted in a release of ammonium to the water column 25 30 µm while orthophosphate levels are only moderately affected guy haim et al 2020 this abrupt release of nutrients into the oligotrophic se mediterranean coastal water lead to a rapid eutrophication thus fuel the proliferation of bacterial activity and biomass while at the same time alter the microbial diversity rahav and bar zeev 2017 raveh et al 2019 correspondingly to the oligotrophic nature of the southeastern mediterranean sea the bacterial activity and abundance were overall low 3 2 9 9 µg c l 1 d 1 and 2 13 108 cells l 1 respectively in the unamended ambient seawater fig 3 a d similarly photosynthetic activity primary production and algal biomass measured as chlorophyll a were overall low 3 9 22 9 µg c l 1 d 1 and 0 08 0 38 µg l 1 respectively with a slight increase in both parameters at the conclusion of the experiments at day 6 fig 3e h surprisingly photosynthetic activity and algal biomass remained constant without any significant impact due to the addition of the jellyfish fig 3e h in contrast to the minimal temporal changes in phytoplankton variables bacterial activity in the feedwater rapidly increased after only one day since the addition of the shredded jellyfish fig 3a resulting in maximal numbers of bacteria 7 109 cells l 1 two days later fig 3c overall the mean bacterial activity and bacterial numbers following the addition of the jellyfish was significantly higher by 48 and 12 fold respectively than the seawater control fig 3b d similarly cells specific activities i e bacterial activity normalized to the number of bacterial cells were 11 times greater after the addition of jellyfish 217 137 fg c cell 1 d 1 compared to the control within a few hours post addition fig s1 tep concentrations in the ambient seawater ranged from 0 35 to 0 87 mg gx l 1 fig 3i j and were typical to previous measurements from the coastal southeastern mediterranean sea bar zeev et al 2012 however two days after the jellyfish addition tep peaked reaching 5 times higher values than the ambient seawater fig 3i j we suggest that heterotrophic bacteria efficiently utilized the nutrients leached from jellyfish biodegradation indicated by their high specific cell activities and swift microbial growth contrary algal biomass remained overall unchanged following the addition of the jellyfish despite the addition of potentially limiting nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus rahav et al 2018 we surmise that algae were outcompeted for the added nutrients by bacteria in accordance with several studies from the se mediterranean sea showing that heterotrophic bacteria often utilize nutrients e g nh4 and po4 much more efficiently that is faster than phytoplankton thingstad et al 2005 rahav et al 2021 it is thus likely that the high concentrations of tep in the feedwater following jellyfish addition up to 4 mg gx l 1 could mostly be a result of bacterial secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps and not by phytoplankton passow 2002 bar zeev et al 2015a indeed a significant linear relationship was found between bacterial abundance and tep concentrations in the feedwater whereas not such relationship was found with algae biomass fig s2 nonetheless it is also possible that tep was formed via spontaneous gelation of monosaccharide tep precursors verdugo 2012 bar zeev et al 2015a that were released via jellyfish biodegradation tep are carbon rich gelatinous small 0 4 300 µm and sticky particles passow 2002 due to their gelatinous characteristics tep were found passing various combinations of pretreatment procedures and act as active agents in the development of ro membrane biofouling villacorte et al 2009 bar zeev et al 2015a 3 2 removal efficiency of jellyfish residuals by swro pretreatment processes the percent removal of bacteria by the pretreatment process i e dual media micronic filtration was significantly higher after the addition of jellyfish 80 relative to the unamended seawater 20 fig 4 a it should be noted that on some occasions a negative percent removal of bacteria was calculated for ambient seawater removal of colloidal and particulate matter including bacteria by the dmf is based on chemical adsorption and physical size exclusion voutchkov 2010 badruzzaman et al 2019 abushaban et al 2021 the removal capacity of such foulants by gravity filtration is often high yet continuous release of particles that slough from the medium into the effluent was previously reported badruzzaman et al 2019 we suggest that the negative values found for bacterial removal from ambient seawater were due to the relatively low bacterial numbers found in the feedwater compared to the jellyfish experiments up to 1 3 109 cells l 1 and 10 109 cells l 1 respectively while at the same time release of bacteria that have sloughed from the media into the filter effluent in contrast we surmise that the high percent removal of bacteria after the addition of the jellyfish resulted from the high number of cells that grew in the feedwater eventhough some bacterial cells have sloughed into the filter effluent likewise the mean removal percentage of tep was significantly higher in the jellyfish amended tanks 73 compared to ambient seawater 46 fig 4c similarly the higher removal percentage was due to the high concentrations of tep in the feedwater compared to the values that sloughed from the sand filter media moreover we suggest that the size spectrum of tep due to jellyfish breakdown was larger than in the ambient seawater as it comprised large gelatinous particles tens of microns thus increasing the filtration efficiency in addition it is likely that the high removal percentage of tep after the jellyfish addition has also indirectly improved the removal efficiency of bacteria as these particles often harbor large numbers of bacteria regardless to the higher removal percentage of bacteria and tep after the addition of the jellyfish the concentrations of both in the mf effluent were still substantially higher 2 times than ambient seawater treatments fig 4b d corresponding to previous reports e g bar zeev et al 2021 the mean percent removal of the algal biomass was high 80 90 for both ambient seawater and after the addition of jellyfish with minimal concentrations of chlorophyll detected in the microfiltration effluent fig 4e f following the above we deduce that even though bacteria and tep were significantly removed in the jellyfish treatments 80 90 their absolute high concentrations found post the pretreatment procedures may increase biofilm propensity on the ro membranes specifically the deposition of bacteria nutrients and carbon rich particles that resulted from the jellyfish breakdown may lead to a swift biofilm growth and the development of severe ro membrane biofouling 3 3 jellyfish swarms impair swro performance permeate water flux of desalinating ambient seawater were maintained constant at 18 0 1 1 l m 2 h 1 along six days of operation fig 5 a similar to other large size desalination facilities at israel corresponding tmp measurements were fairly constant at 60 bar during the same period of time fig 5b the permeate water flux and tmp after jellyfish addition in the feedwater remained constant and similar to ambient seawater treatments at the beginning of the experiment fig 5a however 3 5 days after the addition of the jellyfish into the feedwater a clear reduction 10 16 l m2 h 1 in permeate flux was detected fig 5a the drop in permeate water flux occurred as tmp sharply increased by 15 after 3 5 days reaching the operation pressure limit of this system after five days 75 bar fig 5b microscopic investigation of the ro membranes at the conclusion of the experiments shows that desalination of ambient seawater for six days results in the formation of a uniform conditioning film with some deposition of bacteria 4 106 cells cm 2 and sporadic small 30 µm aggregates fig 6 a the main elements that comprised these aggregates included carbon nitrogen and oxygen 43 4 and 36 respectively according to energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analysis fig 6a pie chart in contrast following jellyfish amendments the ro membranes were heavily fouled at day 6 fig 6b the fouling layer included organic material and vast numbers of bacteria 28 106 cells cm 2 organized in multilayered biofilms the swift development of these biofilms was mostly due to intensive deposition of organic matter and bacteria on the membrane subramani et al 2009 kastl et al 2020 that passed the micronic filter effluent fig 4b c concurrently we suggest that the dissolved nutrients din and orthophosphate that leached during the jellyfish breakdown and passed through the different pretreatments further supported the growth and proliferation of these biofilms in addition numerous chunks of polymeric substances few tens of microns were also attached to the membrane surface fig 6b these particles appeared semitransparent and were often bare of bacteria the chemical composition of these particles was significantly different than those found on ro membranes that desalinated seawater and comprised large fraction of carbon and nitrogen 54 and 16 respectively therefore it is highly likely that the origin of these organic particles were from the shredded jellyfish as polymeric debris that have passed the pretreatment procedures the governmental contracts with large scale desalination facilities often determine that permeate water flux are kept constant while tmp is regulated bar zeev et al 2021 however membrane fouling and scaling often hinder permeate water flux matin et al 2011 she et al 2016 organic fouling of ro membranes hinder permeate water flux by enhancing the hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 kim and dempsey 2013 while at the same time rise the osmotic pressure of the feedwater due to the development of cake enhanced concentration polarization hoek and elimelech 2003 nonetheless permeate can be maintained constant after membrane fouling by enhancing the tmp unfortunately increasing the tmp is accompanied with an upraise in energy and operational costs of swro desalination moreover raising tmp may compact the fouling layer xie et al 2015 thus impede membrane cleaning dreszer et al 2013 she et al 2016 accordingly most swro desalination plants halt freshwater production if the operation pressure increases by 10 15 above the routine tmp taken together the above our results point that desalination operators will be forced to halt the production of potable water about three days after the occurrence a jellyfish swarm around the intake port as tmp will increase by more than 10 3 4 changes in biofilm forming bacterial communities during a jellyfish swarm coastal bacterial communities determined by miseq 16s rrna sequencing had higher otu genera richness in the seawater control n 242 while richness decreased after the addition of shredded jellyfish n 71 these results are similar to the findings of guy haim et al 2020 that showed a decline in bacterial diversity in the overlaying waters above r nomadica degraded fragments six days after the additions similar richness was identified in ambient seawater n 147 and those with the addition of jellyfish n 116 surprisingly the biofilm richness on the ro membranes was much greater after six days of desalinating seawater with shredded jellyfish n 103 than in the control biofilms n 43 we suggest that the ro membrane surface was conditioned by nutrient carbon rich matter thus providing an environment that can support the growth of a wider spectrum of bacteria than the typical oligotrophic characteristics of the ambient southeastern mediterranean sea correspondingly pcoa results indicate that the bacterial communities in ambient water did not significantly change over time fig 7 in contrast the bacterial communities identified few hours after jellyfish addition were different from the ambient seawater at the end of the experiment day 6 the microbial communities identified in jellyfish amended feedwater were different from the initial one and similar to those found in the seawater tanks interestingly the biofilm community structure on the ro membranes was similar regardless to the feedwater source with a few exceptional genera fig 8 it should be noted that multivariate statistical significance using anosim and permanova analysis could not be concluded the bacterial community in the ambient seawater over six days was dominated by protobacteria fig 8 a c comprised mostly by alphaproteobacteria 27 29 gammaproteobacteria 29 30 and flavobacteria 33 39 which is similar to the findings of previous studies basso et al 2019 kramar et al 2019 guy haim et al 2020 immediately after jellyfish addition the bacterial community identified in the feedwater was clearly dominated by gammaproteobacteria 75 the main genera comprising that class were psychrobacter and pseudoalteromonas fig 8d six days since the addition of jellyfish into the feedwater the bacterial community structure was similar to that found in ambient seawater with one clear exception related to the epsilonprotobacteria class 6 fig 8e this class was dominated by the arcobacter genus a gram negative rod shape bacteria previously found in tight association with jellyfish schuett and doepke 2010 gammaproteobacteria are known as particle colonizers simon et al 2002 degrading organic compounds woyke et al 2009 both alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were found to be dominant on the surface of the moon jellyfish aurelia during the senescent phase kramar et al 2019 and are known to have important roles in the degradation succession of jellyfish dom blanchet et al 2015 the biofilm community that formed on the ro membranes following six days of desalinating ambient or jellyfish rich seawater was similar and included mostly alphaproteobacteria 38 39 gammaproteobacteria 27 54 and flavobacteria 7 22 fig 8f these biofilms communities were overall similar to other reports from full scale swro desalination facilities worldwide levi et al 2016 manes et al 2011 and reviewed in nagaraj et al 2018 as well as other pilot experiments form the coastal mediterranean sea bar zeev et al 2021 however similarly to the bacterial community found six days after enriching the seawater feed with jellyfish epsilonprotobacteria class 6 and the arcobacter genus were identified on the ro membranes fig 8f not much is known on the arcobacter genus in respect to biofilm formation in marine environments and especially related to swro desalination however it was suggested that these bacterial genera proliferate in carbon rich environments harrison et al 2014 eenennaam et al 2016 burd et al 2020 similar to those found after the breakdown of jellyfish we stress that identifying arcobacter relative abundance of 14 on the membrane surface is a clear marker that proliferation of jellyfish related bacteria in the feedwater formed biofilm and developed biofouling on the ro membranes it should be noted that various species of this genus were found to be highly pathogenic and can impose serious health risks ferreira et al 2016 ro membranes should theoretically reject bacterial toxins however it is still not clear whether low molecular weight toxins from proliferation of arcobacter biofilms that developed on ro membranes could end up in the freshwater product nevertheless it is clear that additional research should focus on the bacterial community that comprise swro biofilms exposed to jellyfish swarms 4 conclusions our results highlight the detrimental effects of jellyfish swarms on the operation of swro desalination the rapid jellyfish degradation led to an immediate leach of nitrogen and phosphorus the abrupt seawater eutrophication supported bacterial proliferation and tep release in the feedwater as jellyfish were biodegraded due to the gelatinous nature high concentrations of tep were able to pass the pretreatment procedure and reach the ro membranes we deduce that together with high bacterial abundance and the availability of nutrients biofilm formation and biofouling propensity increased dramatically as jellyfish were biodegraded in the feedwater following the above the direct result of jellyfish derived biofouling was a decline in permeate water flux and a sharp increase in tmp around three days after jellyfish addition we surmise that large scale facilities would be forced to halt freshwater production and commence an ro cleaning procedure if a jellyfish swarm will be drawn the desalination industry is advised to 1 apply automated tools such as remote sensing high resolution cameras and image analyses to provide an early warning signal for desalination operators on the occurrence of a jellyfish swarm near the intake ports 2 increase coagulant concentrations and shorten the dmf back washing intervals to better remove negatively charged tep upon jellyfish demise 3 develop new filters that would be specific for tep based on their physicochemical properties e g komlenic et al 2013 these filters could be operated in the presence of a jellyfish swarm at the vicinity of the intake port thus minimizing their impact on ro performance it should be stressed that adopting such approaches may be even more important in coming years as climate change models predict that jellyfish will thrive in the future oceans attrill et al 2007 purcell 2012 thereby potentially threat even more swro desalination worldwide declaration of competing interest the data in this manuscript are all original and have not been submitted

16141,circumstantial evidence has suggested that jellyfish swarms impair the operation of seawater reverse osmosis desalination facilities however only limited information is currently available on the pretreatment efficiency of jellyfish and their effects on reverse osmosis ro membrane performance here we have comprehensively tested the pretreatment efficiency of a dual media gravity filter and cartridge micro filtration following the addition of jellyfish into the feedwater concurrently the fouling propensity and performance of the ro membranes were examined we show that jellyfish demise resulted in seawater eutrophication that triggered a significant increase in bacterial biomass 50 fold activity 7 fold and release of transparent exopolymer particles 5 fold peaking three days after the addition of jellyfish into the feedwater in parallel a significant reduction in permeate water flux was recorded 10 while trans membrane pressure sharply increased 15 reaching the operation pressure limit of our system 75 bar after five days at the conclusion of the experiments the membrane surface was heavily covered by large chunks of organic rich material and multilayered biofilms our results provide a holistic view on the operational challenges of seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination triggered by jellyfish swarms in coastal areas following the above it can be inferred that freshwater production will likely be halted three days after drawing the jellyfish into the pretreatment system outcomes from these results may lead to the development of science based operational protocols to cope with growing occurrence of jellyfish swarms around the intake of swro desalination facilities worldwide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords jellyfish swarms swro

of the 21st century kummu et al 2010 liu et al 2017 one of the most commonly used solutions to increase freshwater availability and minimize freshwater shortage is by seawater desalination currently 65 of the desalinated water worldwide is produced via seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination as its energy requirements are significantly lower than other thermal technologies eke et al 2020 reverse osmosis ro desalination is a membrane separation process in which seawater are pressurized through semi permeable membranes that reject salts and minerals while producing freshwater despite a vast progress in the field of desalination ro membranes still require extensive pretreatment steps to minimize fouling development on their surface thus maintain adequate trans membrane pressure tmp and ensure constant flux of freshwater output anis et al 2019 badruzzaman et al 2019 pretreatment procedures are therefore designed to minimize the concentrations of foulants i e organic and inorganic matter before the ro module stages the pretreatment steps of large scale swro desalination facilities often include i drum screeners to discard large objects drawn with the feedwater such as fish jellyfish and plastics ii addition of coagulants followed by dual media gravity filtration dmf to remove small 0 2 50 µm inorganic and organic material iii cartridge filters pore size 10 25 µm to ensure sand or other particles that passed the dmf will not reach the ro membranes while these pretreatment steps prove to be useful in many cases they are not designed to operate under a burst of feedwater containing high organic loads such as sewage discharges bar zeev et al 2021 similarly jellyfish swarms may impair the pretreatment efficiency and freshwater production as has been suggested to occur at various coastal environments abdul azis et al 2000 daryanabard and dawson 2008 kress et al 2018 jellyfish are ubiquitous in the marine environment found in most oceans and often reach the coastline richardson et al 2009 schaub et al 2018 they are gelatinous zooplanktonic organisms comprised mostly from water 96 97 while their carbon content is only 0 5 arai 1997 pitt et al 2013 these organisms include the cnidaria and ctenophora phyla occasionally forming massive swarms richardson et al 2009 schaub et al 2018 jellyfish swarms can extend from tens square meters to hundreds square kilometers lucas et al 2014 with an estimated total biomass of kilogram of c per m3 of seawater lebrato et al 2013 demise of jellyfish swarms were reported to release 1200 mmol doc m 2 d 1 chelsky et

have indicated that appearance of jellyfish swarms has severe effects on several sea based industries such as fisheries and power plants purcell et al 2007 richardson et al 2009 although the frequency of gelatinous outbreaks has increased during the last two decades and the dependency on desalination as a freshwater source is rapidly growing only little is known on the impacts of jellyfish swarms on coastal desalination facilities in this study seawater were pretreated and desalinated after the addition of jellyfish to mimic the occurrence of a swarm as it often occurs in the southeastern mediterranean during winter and summer to this end seawater with or without jellyfish addition were pretreated by gravity and cartridge filtration and desalinated using an inline ro system while maintaining a constant freshwater flux the feedwater properties and removal rates of organic matter by gravity and cartridge filtration were tested daily while ro performance was constantly measured our results highlight the deleterious impacts of jellyfish on the desalination operation once they are drawn into the process 2 materials and methods experimental design coastal seawater collected

classes and genera 3 and 2 of all the otus respectively found in the feedwater samples or on the ro membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of jellyfish breakdown on feedwater properties dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nitrate nitrite ammonium and orthophosphate prior any manipulation ranged in the seawater between 1 3 5 µm and 0 02 0 08 µm respectively fig 2 these low concentrations are within the typical values measured in the oligotrophic southeastern mediterranean coast even during the wintertime raveh et al 2015 during the first day after the addition of shredded jellyfish similar to their physical state after passing through a large scale screen drum the din and orthophosphate concentrations significantly increased by 25 fold on average fig 2 specifically ammonium increased the most within the din pool reaching as high as 33 µm a few days after the jellyfish amendment these results agree with a recent study showing that 24 h of jellyfish degradation the same specie tested here resulted in a release of ammonium to the water column 25 30 µm while orthophosphate levels are only moderately affected guy haim et al 2020 this abrupt release of nutrients into the oligotrophic se mediterranean coastal water lead to a rapid eutrophication thus fuel the proliferation of bacterial activity and biomass while at the same time alter the microbial diversity rahav and bar zeev 2017 raveh et al 2019 correspondingly to the oligotrophic nature of the southeastern mediterranean sea the bacterial activity and abundance were overall low 3 2 9 9 µg c l 1 d 1 and 2 13 108 cells l 1 respectively in the unamended ambient seawater fig 3 a d similarly photosynthetic activity primary production and algal biomass measured as chlorophyll a were overall low 3 9 22 9 µg c l 1 d 1 and 0 08 0 38 µg l 1 respectively with a slight increase in both parameters at the conclusion of the experiments at day 6 fig 3e h surprisingly photosynthetic activity and algal biomass remained constant without any significant impact due to the addition of the jellyfish fig 3e h in contrast to the minimal temporal changes in phytoplankton variables bacterial activity in the feedwater rapidly increased after only one day since the addition of the shredded jellyfish fig 3a resulting in maximal numbers of bacteria 7 109 cells l 1 two days later fig 3c overall the mean bacterial activity and bacterial numbers following the addition of the jellyfish was significantly higher by 48 and 12 fold respectively than the seawater control fig 3b d similarly cells specific activities i e bacterial activity normalized to the number of bacterial cells were 11 times greater after the addition of jellyfish 217 137 fg c cell 1 d 1 compared to the control within a few hours post addition fig s1 tep concentrations in the ambient seawater ranged from 0 35 to 0 87 mg gx l 1 fig 3i j and were typical to previous measurements from the coastal southeastern mediterranean sea bar zeev et al 2012 however two days after the jellyfish addition tep peaked reaching 5 times higher values than the ambient seawater fig 3i j we suggest that heterotrophic bacteria efficiently utilized the nutrients leached from jellyfish biodegradation indicated by their high specific cell activities and swift microbial growth contrary algal biomass remained overall unchanged following the addition of the jellyfish despite the addition of potentially limiting nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus rahav et al 2018 we surmise that algae were outcompeted for the added nutrients by bacteria in accordance with several studies from the se mediterranean sea showing that heterotrophic bacteria often utilize nutrients e g nh4 and po4 much more efficiently that is faster than phytoplankton thingstad et al 2005 rahav et al 2021 it is thus likely that the high concentrations of tep in the feedwater following jellyfish addition up to 4 mg gx l 1 could mostly be a result of bacterial secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps and not by phytoplankton passow 2002 bar zeev et al 2015a indeed a significant linear relationship was found between bacterial abundance and tep concentrations in the feedwater whereas not such relationship was found with algae biomass fig s2 nonetheless it is also possible that tep was formed via spontaneous gelation of monosaccharide tep precursors verdugo 2012 bar zeev et al 2015a that were released via jellyfish biodegradation tep are carbon rich gelatinous small 0 4 300 µm and sticky particles passow 2002 due to their gelatinous characteristics tep were found passing various combinations of pretreatment procedures and act as active agents in the development of ro membrane biofouling villacorte et al 2009 bar zeev et al 2015a 3 2 removal efficiency of jellyfish residuals by swro pretreatment processes the percent removal of bacteria by the pretreatment process i e dual media micronic filtration was significantly higher after the addition of jellyfish 80 relative to the unamended seawater 20 fig 4 a it should be noted that on some occasions a negative percent removal of bacteria was calculated for ambient seawater removal of colloidal and particulate matter including bacteria by the dmf is based on chemical adsorption and physical size exclusion voutchkov 2010 badruzzaman et al 2019 abushaban et al 2021 the removal capacity of such foulants by gravity filtration is often high yet continuous release of particles that slough from the medium into the effluent was previously reported badruzzaman et al 2019 we suggest that the negative values found for bacterial removal from ambient seawater were due to the relatively low bacterial numbers found in the feedwater compared to the jellyfish experiments up to 1 3 109 cells l 1 and 10 109 cells l 1 respectively while at the same time release of bacteria that have sloughed from the media into the filter effluent in contrast we surmise that the high percent removal of bacteria after the addition of the jellyfish resulted from the high number of cells that grew in the feedwater eventhough some bacterial cells have sloughed into the filter effluent likewise the mean removal percentage of tep was significantly higher in the jellyfish amended tanks 73 compared to ambient seawater 46 fig 4c similarly the higher removal percentage was due to the high concentrations of tep in the feedwater compared to the values that sloughed from the sand filter media moreover we suggest that the size spectrum of tep due to jellyfish breakdown was larger than in the ambient seawater as it comprised large gelatinous particles tens of microns thus increasing the filtration efficiency in addition it is likely that the high removal percentage of tep after the jellyfish addition has also indirectly improved the removal efficiency of bacteria as these particles often harbor large numbers of bacteria regardless to the higher removal percentage of bacteria and tep after the addition of the jellyfish the concentrations of both in the mf effluent were still substantially higher 2 times than ambient seawater treatments fig 4b d corresponding to previous reports e g bar zeev et al 2021 the mean percent removal of the algal biomass was high 80 90 for both ambient seawater and after the addition of jellyfish with minimal concentrations of chlorophyll detected in the microfiltration effluent fig 4e f following the above we deduce that even though bacteria and tep were significantly removed in the jellyfish treatments 80 90 their absolute high concentrations found post the pretreatment procedures may increase biofilm propensity on the ro membranes specifically the deposition of bacteria nutrients and carbon rich particles that resulted from the jellyfish breakdown may lead to a swift biofilm growth and the development of severe ro membrane biofouling 3 3 jellyfish swarms impair swro performance permeate water flux of desalinating ambient seawater were maintained constant at 18 0 1 1 l m 2 h 1 along six days of operation fig 5 a similar to other large size desalination facilities at israel corresponding tmp measurements were fairly constant at 60 bar during the same period of time fig 5b the permeate water flux and tmp after jellyfish addition in the feedwater remained constant and similar to ambient seawater treatments at the beginning of the experiment fig 5a however 3 5 days after the addition of the jellyfish into the feedwater a clear reduction 10 16 l m2 h 1 in permeate flux was detected fig 5a the drop in permeate water flux occurred as tmp sharply increased by 15 after 3 5 days reaching the operation pressure limit of this system after five days 75 bar fig 5b microscopic investigation of the ro membranes at the conclusion of the experiments shows that desalination of ambient seawater for six days results in the formation of a uniform conditioning film with some deposition of bacteria 4 106 cells cm 2 and sporadic small 30 µm aggregates fig 6 a the main elements that comprised these aggregates included carbon nitrogen and oxygen 43 4 and 36 respectively according to energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analysis fig 6a pie chart in contrast following jellyfish amendments the ro membranes were heavily fouled at day 6 fig 6b the fouling layer included organic material and vast numbers of bacteria 28 106 cells cm 2 organized in multilayered biofilms the swift development of these biofilms was mostly due to intensive deposition of organic matter and bacteria on the membrane subramani et al 2009 kastl et al 2020 that passed the micronic filter effluent fig 4b c concurrently we suggest that the dissolved nutrients din and orthophosphate that leached during the jellyfish breakdown and passed through the different pretreatments further supported the growth and proliferation of these biofilms in addition numerous chunks of polymeric substances few tens of microns were also attached to the membrane surface fig 6b these particles appeared semitransparent and were often bare of bacteria the chemical composition of these particles was significantly different than those found on ro membranes that desalinated seawater and comprised large fraction of carbon and nitrogen 54 and 16 respectively therefore it is highly likely that the origin of these organic particles were from the shredded jellyfish as polymeric debris that have passed the pretreatment procedures the governmental contracts with large scale desalination facilities often determine that permeate water flux are kept constant while tmp is regulated bar zeev et al 2021 however membrane fouling and scaling often hinder permeate water flux matin et al 2011 she et al 2016 organic fouling of ro membranes hinder permeate water flux by enhancing the hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 kim and dempsey 2013 while at the same time rise the osmotic pressure of the feedwater due to the development of cake enhanced concentration polarization hoek and elimelech 2003 nonetheless permeate can be maintained constant after membrane fouling by enhancing the tmp unfortunately increasing the tmp is accompanied with an upraise in energy and operational costs of swro desalination moreover raising tmp may compact the fouling layer xie et al 2015 thus impede membrane cleaning dreszer et al 2013 she et al 2016 accordingly most swro desalination plants halt freshwater production if the operation pressure increases by 10 15 above the routine tmp taken together the above our results point that desalination operators will be forced to halt the production of potable water about three days after the occurrence a jellyfish swarm around the intake port as tmp will increase by more than 10 3 4 changes in biofilm forming bacterial communities during a jellyfish swarm coastal bacterial communities determined by miseq 16s rrna sequencing had higher otu genera richness in the seawater control n 242 while richness decreased after the addition of shredded jellyfish n 71 these results are similar to the findings of guy haim et al 2020 that showed a decline in bacterial diversity in the overlaying waters above r nomadica degraded fragments six days after the additions similar richness was identified in ambient seawater n 147 and those with the addition of jellyfish n 116 surprisingly the biofilm richness on the ro membranes was much greater after six days of desalinating seawater with shredded jellyfish n 103 than in the control biofilms n 43 we suggest that the ro membrane surface was conditioned by nutrient carbon rich matter thus providing an environment that can support the growth of a wider spectrum of bacteria than the typical oligotrophic characteristics of the ambient southeastern mediterranean sea correspondingly pcoa results indicate that the bacterial communities in ambient water did not significantly change over time fig 7 in contrast the bacterial communities identified few hours after jellyfish addition were different from the ambient seawater at the end of the experiment day 6 the microbial communities identified in jellyfish amended feedwater were different from the initial one and similar to those found in the seawater tanks interestingly the biofilm community structure on the ro membranes was similar regardless to the feedwater source with a few exceptional genera fig 8 it should be noted that multivariate statistical significance using anosim and permanova analysis could not be concluded the bacterial community in the ambient seawater over six days was dominated by protobacteria fig 8 a c comprised mostly by alphaproteobacteria 27 29 gammaproteobacteria 29 30 and flavobacteria 33 39 which is similar to the findings of previous studies basso et al 2019 kramar et al 2019 guy haim et al 2020 immediately after jellyfish addition the bacterial community identified in the feedwater was clearly dominated by gammaproteobacteria 75 the main genera comprising that class were psychrobacter and pseudoalteromonas fig 8d six days since the addition of jellyfish into the feedwater the bacterial community structure was similar to that found in ambient seawater with one clear exception related to the epsilonprotobacteria class 6 fig 8e this class was dominated by the arcobacter genus a gram negative rod shape bacteria previously found in tight association with jellyfish schuett and doepke 2010 gammaproteobacteria are known as particle colonizers simon et al 2002 degrading organic compounds woyke et al 2009 both alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were found to be dominant on the surface of the moon jellyfish aurelia during the senescent phase kramar et al 2019 and are known to have important roles in the degradation succession of jellyfish dom blanchet et al 2015 the biofilm community that formed on the ro membranes following six days of desalinating ambient or jellyfish rich seawater was similar and included mostly alphaproteobacteria 38 39 gammaproteobacteria 27 54 and flavobacteria 7 22 fig 8f these biofilms communities were overall similar to other reports from full scale swro desalination facilities worldwide levi et al 2016 manes et al 2011 and reviewed in nagaraj et al 2018 as well as other pilot experiments form the coastal mediterranean sea bar zeev et al 2021 however similarly to the bacterial community found six days after enriching the seawater feed with jellyfish epsilonprotobacteria class 6 and the arcobacter genus were identified on the ro membranes fig 8f not much is known on the arcobacter genus in respect to biofilm formation in marine environments and especially related to swro desalination however it was suggested that these bacterial genera proliferate in carbon rich environments harrison et al 2014 eenennaam et al 2016 burd et al 2020 similar to those found after the breakdown of jellyfish we stress that identifying arcobacter relative abundance of 14 on the membrane surface is a clear marker that proliferation of jellyfish related bacteria in the feedwater formed biofilm and developed biofouling on the ro membranes it should be noted that various species of this genus were found to be highly pathogenic and can impose serious health risks ferreira et al 2016 ro membranes should theoretically reject bacterial toxins however it is still not clear whether low molecular weight toxins from proliferation of arcobacter biofilms that developed on ro membranes could end up in the freshwater product nevertheless it is clear that additional research should focus on the bacterial community that comprise swro biofilms exposed to jellyfish swarms 4 conclusions our results highlight the detrimental effects of jellyfish swarms on the operation of swro desalination the rapid jellyfish degradation led to an immediate leach of nitrogen and phosphorus the abrupt seawater eutrophication supported bacterial proliferation and tep release in the feedwater as jellyfish were biodegraded due to the gelatinous nature high concentrations of tep were able to pass the pretreatment procedure and reach the ro membranes we deduce that together with high bacterial abundance and the availability of nutrients biofilm formation and biofouling propensity increased dramatically as jellyfish were biodegraded in the feedwater following the above the direct result of jellyfish derived biofouling was a decline in permeate water flux and a sharp increase in tmp around three days after jellyfish addition we surmise that large scale facilities would be forced to halt freshwater production and commence an ro cleaning procedure if a jellyfish swarm will be drawn the desalination industry is advised to 1 apply automated tools such as remote sensing high resolution cameras and image analyses to provide an early warning signal for desalination operators on the occurrence of a jellyfish swarm near the intake ports 2 increase coagulant concentrations and shorten the dmf back washing intervals to better remove negatively charged tep upon jellyfish demise 3 develop new filters that would be specific for tep based on their physicochemical properties e g komlenic et al 2013 these filters could be operated in the presence of a jellyfish swarm at the vicinity of the intake port thus minimizing their impact on ro performance it should be stressed that adopting such approaches may be even more important in coming years as climate change models predict that jellyfish will thrive in the future oceans attrill et al 2007 purcell 2012 thereby potentially threat even more swro desalination worldwide declaration of competing interest the data in this manuscript are all original and have not been submitted

exports of textile and apparel t a un comtrade 2019 textile manufacturers in china mainly agglomerated in the east coast including shanghai zhejiang jiangsu shandong guangdong and fujian accounting for approximately 77 5 of the total t a in china lu 2016 water resources of these provinces are abundant but water stress is severe due to large amounts of water consumed by water intensive industries such as textile production and dyeing zhao et al 2015 under this circumstance chinese government encouraged t a manufacturers to relocate from the east coast to western china to address this water issue as well as facilitate economic growth in the west miit 2012 however the conservation of local natural resources such as freshwater shall be carefully considered during their relocation zhang et al 2016 hence the innovative technology to reduce water consumption and chemical use is urgently required for the next generation of textile industry hussain and wahab 2018 among these water free technologies nonaqueous solvent dyeing has been developed recently and demonstrated with the advantage of industrial scale up fu et al 2015 s andrade et al 2017 tang and kan 2020 decamethylcyclopentasiloxane d5 solvent served as the dyeing medium has been discovered to help fix color dyes on textile resulting in a significant reduction in water consumption and therefore wastewater generation pei et al 2017 d5 is a cyclomethicone commonly used in cosmetics such as deodorants sun creams hair sprays and skincare products however d5 is classified as a high concern substance by the european union eu due to its persistent bioaccumulative and toxic potential eu 2018 high bioconcentration factor bcf and bioaccumulation factor baf indicate potential possibilities of d5 accumulation in aquatic organisms mueller et al 1995 xu et al 2014 therefore the eu has regulated that the concentration of d5 in wash off cosmetic products should not be greater than 0 1 by weight after 31st of january 2020 eu 2018 despite the advantage of d5 dyeing technology in water consumption reducing the potential effects on water quality of the supply chain remain unknown life cycle assessment lca is a comprehensive method to assess environmental performance of a product or process muthu 2014 it has been used in the traditional textile industry to identify its hotspots baydar et al 2015 gomez campos et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 previous studies mainly focused on global warming potential gwp and water consumption hossain and khan 2020 muthu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 they merely include the toxicity related impacts caused by used chemicals leading to potential bias in their conclusions roos 2015 roos et al 2018 terinte et al 2014 claimed that the incomplete inventory data and the missing toxicity characterization factors cfs of these chemicals hindered the comprehensive assessment the usetox model which was developed by united nations environment program unep as a supplementary model to lca is current best available model for characterizing the freshwater toxicity and human toxicity usetox has been widely applied recently to measure the cfs of eco toxicity of a variety of organic and inorganic materials such as organic solvent for producing perovskite solar cells vidal et al 2021 lignocellulose bioplastic xia et al 2021 copper nanoparticles pu et al 2016 pharmaceuticals personal care products ppcps endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and metals in municipal wastewater rashid and liu 2021 and the specific textile chemicals roos et al 2018 but the cfs of d5 is still lacking in addition existing lca studies for advanced textile technology mainly focused on replacing synthetic chemical dyes with natural biobased dyes agnhage et al 2017 fidan et al 2021 linhares and de amorim 2017 or upgrading the process of textile wastewater treatment via electrochemical approach or membrane bioreactor mbr alvarez et al 2020 nakhate et al 2020 yang et al 2020 however the membrane module in wastewater treatment is normally treated as the infrastructure and excluded from the system boundary thus neglecting their impacts from membrane production overall no research is found to our best knowledge evaluating the sustainability of nonaqueous d5 dyeing from full environmental impacts perspectives to reveal the potential trade offs of this emerging technology in t a revolution and bring potential risks to policy makers attention this study aims to 1 quantify its environmental impacts with focus on eco toxicity 2 reveal potential trade offs between water consumption and water quality in various technology scenarios and 3 provides insights to policy makers and investigators via highlighting the potential risks in the implementation of this technology herein a comprehensive assessment was conducted to compare traditional aqueous dyeing with nonaqueous d5 dyeing of cotton fibers using lca and life cycle costing lcc approaches including their environmental impacts eco toxicity and economic feasibility regionalized eco toxicity impacts of d5 emissions were firstly assessed and taken into accounts in this lca study sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis were also performed in addition this comparative lca considers various wastewater treatment technologies within the system boundary including the production of membrane module finally policy recommendations were given based on our findings to address pros and cons of this nonaqueous dyeing technology to support decisions making 2 methods and data 2 1 technology description the traditional dyeing process includes pre treatment dyeing and post treatment fig 1 a for pre treatment process raw cotton is scoured with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sodium carbonate soda and sodium hydrate naoh in the 98 c water bath for 60 min to remove natural wax and non fibrous impurities in the dyeing process reactive dyes are added at 25 c and then sodium sulfate na2so4 is added twice with an interval of 15 min then the temperature is controlled at 90 c for 60 min during color fixation after dyeing the fibers are washed with a softener solution finally wastewater is collected for a preprocess before sending to the central wastewater treatment plant the nonaqueous dyeing process includes pre treatment dyeing medium recovery and post treatment fig 1b the pre treatment of scouring process is similar to traditional aqueous dyeing but with reduced amount of chemicals used in the dyeing step d5 replaces the traditional water base to form a suspension system with cotton fibers reactive dyes are dissolved in a water microenvironment at 30 c for 25 min then the temperature of the dying system is raised to 60 c followed by adding soda to adjust ph to 10 5 11 after dyeing the cotton fibers are washed and softened the mixed effluents are sent to the oil water separation system to recycle d5 wastewater containing surplus chemicals is sent to the wastewater treatment system 2 2 lca lca includes four stages goal and scope definition life cycle inventory lci life cycle impact assessment lcia and results interpretation iso 2006a 2006b sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the fluctuations of system appendix a3 2 2 1 goal and scope this study intends to carry out a comparative lca study on productions of cotton fibers using various dyeing technologies the functional unit fu is defined as producing 1 ton dry weight of dyed cotton fibers with black reactive dyes the system boundary starts from cotton fibers dry weight received at the dyeing plant gate and includes scouring dyeing washing drying wastewater treatment sludge transport and sludge disposal fig 2 considering the reuse of d5 the recycling process is included in the system boundary of the nonaqueous dyeing system 2 of cut off criteria are applied infrastructure apart from membrane production and land use are out of the system boundary scenarios considered in the analysis includes aqueous traditional s1 nonaqueous baseline s2 nonaqueous demonstration s3 and nonaqueous prospect s4 the differences in s2 s4 are various assumptions on d5 s loss rates during recycling process which are 8 o w f the weight of fabric 6 o w f and 2 o w f respectively details in section 2 2 2 and appendix a1 2 2 2 lci the primary data were obtained via onsite investigations in 2020 from the major manufactures in guangdong province and zhejiang province with the capacity of 87 000 tons yr and 3000 tons yr for traditional aqueous dyeing system and nonaqueous d5 dyeing system respectively furthermore an in depth material balance analysis was carried out for the inventory data secondary data were obtained from the literature gabi 10 database and ecoinvent 3 7 1 database lci for four scenarios and membrane production are in appendix a1 table a1 and a2 data sources are summarized as follows s1 aqueous traditional scenario was adopted from pei et al 2021 for chemicals consumptions energy inputs and water use were obtained from the survey investigation the process data of wastewater treatment was extracted from an lca study from nakhate et al 2020 with a 50 water reuse rate s2 nonaqueous baseline scenario was based on the trials of d5 solvent dyeing cotton fiber and nylon fiber reported by pei et al 2021 and saleem et al 2021 respectively d5 solvent consumption was calculated taking five repeated dyeing cycles of the bath solution and 98 recyclability into account with dyeing carried out a 1 20 fabric to liquor ratio saleem et al 2021 the wastewater treatment process is the same as s1 s3 nonaqueous demonstration design refers to a pilot scale production 100 kg d from pei et al 2021 the loss of the d5 solvent is controlled 6 o w f i e 60 kg the wastewater treatment data are the same as s1 s4 nonaqueous prospect design combines the field investigation of the nonaqueous dyeing factory which considered a further lowest d5 loss rate of 2 o w f i e 20 kg the wastewater treatment process using the uf nanofiltration nf ro membrane system and the water reuse rate can reach 90 2 2 3 lcia methods lcia uses cfs to convert inventory results to their environmental and human health impacts bovea and gallardo 2006 gilbertson et al 2015 inventory data are assigned to different impact categories followed by different lcia methods korre et al 2010 in order to reveal the potential trade off between the environmental and toxicity concerns cfs are selected as comprehensive as possible by means of the lcia methods of cml 2001 and usetox 2 12 indicators selected are resource depletion indicators of abiotic depletion potential elements adp elements kg sb eq and abiotic depletion potential fossil adp fossil mj greenhouse gas effect indicators of global warming potential gwp kg co2 eq and ozone depletion potential odp kg r11 eq water quality indicator of eutrophication potential ep kg phosphate eq air quality indicators of acidification potential ap kg so2 eq and photochemical ozone creation potential pocp kg ethene eq toxicity indicators of marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp kg dcb eq terrestrial ecotoxicity potential tetp kg dcb eq ecotoxicity paf m3 d human toxicity cancer disease cases and human toxicity non cancer disease cases moreover considering the water consumption is a crucial issue to identify the sustainability of the textile industry freshwater consumption wcp m3 is calculated as the net water consumption in processes and water consumption from the production of lci inputs 2 2 4 eco toxicity assessment by usetox model eco toxicity indicators of freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity are included in numerous lcia models but vary due to different scopes model principles and assumptions in methods leading to inconsistent results in these models with 12 orders of magnitude variation between the cfs of the different chemicals hauschild et al 2008 westh et al 2015 therefore the usetox model was developed by the unep setac life cycle initiative as a scientific consensus model to support more robust life cycle toxicity assessments which could improve the precision to 2 or 3 orders of magnitude rosenbaum et al 2008 it also has advantages in providing comprehensive coverage of cfs for contaminants and considering the geographical diversities of cfs belyanovskaya et al 2019 henderson et al 2011 usetox model treats the environmental compartments as well mixed boxes containing and exchanging contaminants mass de garcía et al 2017 fantke et al 2017 the model implies a cause effect chain from a contaminant entering the environment till generating freshwater ecotoxicity or human toxicity including three steps as environmental fate exposure and effect fantke et al 2017 the cfs could be calculated as eq 1 1 c f f f x f e f i f e f where ff is the fate factor refers to the environmental residence time of contaminant calculated by its physicochemical properties xf is the exposure factor refers to the fraction of contaminant dissolved and available for organism ef is the effect factor refers to the eco toxicological impacts on aquatic environment or human health if intake fraction a summary metric of organism exposure concerning emissions calculated by a matrix multiplication of ff with xf ultimately the cfs of freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity at the midpoint are expressed in comparative toxicity units ctue kg emitted and ctuh kg emitted respectively for freshwater ecotoxicity cfeco is the potentially affected fraction of species paf over the exposed water volume m3 and time d induced by per kg of contaminant emission paf m3 d kg emitted for human toxicity cfhum is the cumulative cases of cancer or non cancer diseases caused by per kg of contaminant emission cases kg emitted the mechanism framework of the usetox model is described in the fig 3 and detailed calculations are displayed in appendix a2 input parameters for usetox model simulation are classified as physic chemical properties degradation in the environment exposure human carcinogenic and non carcinogenic toxicities and ecotoxicity an extensive literature review was conducted to obtain these parameters from scientific published articles or public chemical information repositories detailed information is given in table 1 the experimental data is taken precedence over the estimated data for data collection parameters of kdoc and baffish are particularly referring to the cosmede database cosmede database is a comprehensive platform for substance documentation developed by the environment and energy mastery agency and the french normalization agency provided cfs for cosmetic and detergent substances via usetox model 1 01 version roos et al 2018 the ecotoxicity of d5 was included in cosmede database however the cfs need to be updated due to their out of date input parameters and the lack of those for human toxicity for noncarcinogenic toxicity d5 has observed effect on the respiratory tract liver and lung due to its induction in enzymes the induction patterns of d5 resemble phenobarbital in hepatic microsomal enzymes mckim et al 1999 for carcinogenic toxicity d5 did not demonstrate neoplastic effects in the 2 year bioassay in f344 rats though the uterine endometrial adenocarcinomas were found in the female group of highest exposure due to the dopamine agonist activity of d5 causing estrogen dominance however these species specific tumor data could not be used for human either qualitatively or quantitatively because dopamine agonists do not lead to estrogen dominance in women dekant and klaunig 2016 jean et al 2016 klaunig et al 2016 usepa 2005 as a result human toxicity cancer impact of d5 emissions was excluded in the current study 2 3 economic performance analysis lcc as an addition to lca applies the life cycle thinking to economic analysis integrated with lca dynamic interconnect the costs and the environmental impacts of each life cycle stage resende et al 2019 all costs were calculated and expressed in usd using an annual average exchange rate of 1 usd 6 8974 cny in 2020 national bureau of statistics of china 2021 the lcc input data for traditional aqueous dyeing factory s1 and nonaqueous dyeing demonstration plant s3 were collected from field investigation the lcc analysis carried out in this study follows the eq 2 innocenzi et al 2021 considering capital cost and operational cost 2 l c c n r c r c where nrc is non recurring costs i e capital expenditure capex including the capital investment of infrastructure equipment and piping which is amortized in lifetime years rc is recurring costs i e operating expense opex including the costs of raw materials chemicals energy water maintenance medium recycling waste disposal and labor 3 results and discussions prior to performing lca of nonaqueous dyeing system cfs of d5 emitted to various environmental compartments were calculated first 3 1 eco toxicity assessment of d5 emissions eco toxicity categories are specific the inclusion of their spatial difference could enhance the accuracy of lca results kounina et al 2014 central asia include western china and eastern china were selected to export regional cfs for different environmental compartments i e taking cf of central asia and eastern china to represent west cn and east cn respectively and compared with the default setting of the global average in the usetox model west cn in the usetox 2 12 model includes chinese provinces of xinjiang tibet qinghai and gansu while the rest of the provinces belong to east cn jolliet 2021 landscape setting of subcontinent could be found in appendix b sheet b1 additionally sensitivity and uncertainty analysis were conducted to indicate the key parameters and robustness for eco toxicity calculation appendix a3 1 3 1 1 eco toxicity results of d5 emissions in general cfs of d5 emissions in east cn are higher than those in west cn fig 4 within the characterization model eq 1 fate and exposure factors could be region specific while effect factors linear with ec50 and ed50 are not residence time as an influential parameter to fate factor is affected by chemical degradation and freshwater depth which are influenced by local environment kounina et al 2014 d5 intake fraction through human exposure factor is affected by inhalation population density and dietary behavior which are regional specific for example lower intake of meat fish and below ground products and lower population density in west cn would result lower cfs the variations in regional exposure are mainly attribute to inhalation and fish ingestion whose key drivers are degradation partitioning and bioaccumulation i e t1 2air t1 2water kow baffish appendix b sheet b2 it has been reported that d5 has long half life periods in water and sediment t1 2water 70 4 days t1 2sediment 3100 days and high bioaccumulation in fish minnow flounder and ragworm kierkegaard et al 2011 parrott et al 2013 the variations in ecotoxicity cfs of different compartments depend on the intermedia transfer of d5 from them to the final receiving media freshwater for the highest cfs of direct emissions to freshwater the effect factor strongly affects the freshwater ecotoxicity by 2 orders of magnitude while fate factor has less impact ecotoxicity cfs of d5 emitted to sea water appear the minimum due to the lack of characterization module for marine ecotoxicity in usetox model however could be improved in the future model development in this study the dyeing process is operated in a sealed container d5 release mainly happen in the treatment of process wastewater the proportions of d5 between its destinations are about 73 in sludge which is eventually to soil and 22 to air assuming it is not readily biodegradable echa 2015 the remaining 5 is assumed releasing to the water phase combing the above calculated cfs in each environmental compartment and their corresponding fractions of d5 the eco toxicity of d5 in different scenarios can be calculated as appendix a2 eq a 4 and results are as shown in table 2 the eco toxicity of d5 emission decreased directly with the reduction of d5 loss fraction from 8 o w f in s2 to 2 o w f in s4 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis of usetox model sensitivity analysis is performed to reveal the relatively sensitive input parameters of the usetox model via varying them by 10 the full sensitivity results are shown in fig 5 a b and appendix b sheet b3 for ecotoxicity fig 5a avlogec50 is a main sensitive parameter in all the environmental compartments because it directly influences the effect factor this finding in accordance with the conclusions from igos et al 2014 kh25c and kdega show high sensitivities to cfeco in the compartment of rural air and sea water with an opposite trend kdegw is also sensitive in sea water compartment kdegsl is sensitive in urban air and both two soil compartments it is observed that the cfs of d5 released to the rural air and sea water is more easily affected by input parameters and it is noted that the effect of regional setting on cfeco sensitivity is not significant except for kdega for human toxicity non cancer fig 5b ed50 from inhalation pathway shows a high sensitivity in atmospheric environment and soil environment for effects on human toxicity non cancer category from d5 emissions to water ed50 from ingestion pathway baffish and kdegw are the main sensitive parameters additionally kdega is sensitive to cfhum in the emission compartments of rural air natural soil and agriculture soil at the same time kdega also displays a regional sensitivity overall the most influential parameters are the basis for calculating ef i e ec50 and ed50 the physic chemical parameters of d5 do not heavily influence its cfs more attentions could be on the collection of relevant toxicity data which is considered as an obstacle of the reliability and availability of the cf of human toxicity 3 1 3 uncertainty of eco toxicity results considering the usetox input parameters are from different data sources an uncertainty analysis was performed to test the reliability of eco toxicity results usetox inputs parameters were firstly clustered into three groups with a descending order of quality the group 1 values same as those in table 1 are set as a baseline values in group 2 and 3 are derived from alternative sources of usetox 3 0 beta database and cosmede database respectively appendix a4 table a3 an exhaustive method is then used to generate a dataset containing 7776 independent combinations of all required input parameters for usetox calculation calculation based on 7776 combinations generates ranges for each impact categories shown as bars with the mean values noted as black dots in fig 6 results calculated by group 1 baseline are within these ranges approximately 5 63 10 17 different from mean values of ecotoxicity and 4 86 10 31 away from human noncarcinogenic toxicity mean values these indicate that group 1 parameters could generate reasonably reliable eco toxicity results and used for further full lcia analysis in addition the coefficients of variations cvs of ecotoxicity and human noncarcinogenic toxicity are 13 03 20 65 and 20 92 25 94 respectively appendix a4 table a4 human toxicity non cancer representing a higher uncertainty in the cfs results 3 2 lca results integrated with eco toxicity of d5 the comprehensive impacts of different production options are displayed in this section the full results between different scenarios are considered firstly followed by the contributing substances within the scenarios corresponding sensitivity analysis are performed in appendix a3 2 3 2 1 scenario analysis the comparative results of four scenarios integrated with regionalized eco toxicity results are shown in fig 7 the eco toxicity of d5 emissions is presented by adding columns filled with oblique lines d5 emissions play a significant role in eco toxicity categories thus the exclusion will result in a biased conclusion the impacts of including d5 emissions on ecotoxicity and human noncarcinogenic toxicity are more severe in east cn than in wets cn and decrease along the drop in the loss rate of d5 in s2 s4 the overall results reveal that nonaqueous scenarios are superior in almost all categories except for adp elements and ecotoxicity the high score of adp elements of s2 is caused by the production of d5 while that of freshwater ecotoxicity is due to d5 released to the environment the odp of s4 is highest in nonaqueous scenarios due to its greater amount of membrane used although the mbr treatment elevates the odp this more efficient wastewater treatment method increases the water reuse rate from 50 to 90 thereby decreasing the overall wcp in s4 nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology results in over 40 of ghg emissions reduction and 60 80 water consumption reduction compared to the traditional technology in summary nonaqueous technology has the potential to reduce environmental impacts significantly delivering the promising results by s4 where the d5 loss rate is controlled below 2 o w f 3 2 2 contribution analysis as the nonaqueous demonstration plant is located in zhejiang province in eastern china the contribution analysis is integrated with the usetox east cn results fig 8 a b c and d present the main contributors of s1 s2 s3 s4 respectively detailed lcia of four scenarios could be found in appendix b sheet b4 for traditional aqueous technology fig 8a soda and sodium sulfate are the two dominant contributors to the adp elements due to their large amount of use adp fossil gwp ap pocp and maetp are mainly attribute to steam sodium sulfate is the main contributor to ep accounts for 76 97 wastewater treatment is the dominant factor in the odp category mainly attributes to the tetrafluoroethylene use in the membrane production stamford and azapagic 2014 2018 fluorocarbon gasses emitted during tetrafluoroethylene manufacturing leading to the ozone layer depletion eventually have significant impacts on the odp and gwp duclos et al 2017 in addition the significant amount of wastewater generation in traditional aqueous process caused relatively large impacts on tetp and human toxicity sodium sulfate and wastewater treatment both have significant impacts on ecotoxicity which mainly attribute to mercury and iron emissions into freshwater during the production of sodium sulfate and detergent ingredients dewaele et al 2006 moreover sulfate as a potent phytotoxin also significantly affects aquatic plants resulting substantial contributions to the ecotoxicity lamers et al 2013 1998 for nonaqueous technology fig 8b c d d5 production is critical to adp elements and tetp similar to s1 adp fossil gwp ap ep pocp and maetp are mainly caused by steam odp which results from the halogenated gas release to atmosphere is mainly attribute to softener and membrane production sodium sulfate is no longer the main contributor to the ep because of its elimination in the nonaqueous dyeing process after integrating usetox results d5 plays a significant role in a series of toxicity indicators except for maetp because the experimental toxicity data showed d5 has no adverse effects to pelagic aquatic organisms at the concentration nearly reach to water solubility environment canada and health canada 2008 fig 8 b and c demonstrate that d5 production and d5 emissions are important factors to ecotoxicity and human toxicity when the loss of d5 are 80 kg and 60 kg s2 and s3 it is suggested that d5 s loss should be minimized via more efficient recycling process 3 3 lcc analysis table 3 summarizes the lcc results of the traditional aqueous dyeing technology s1 and nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology s3 the capacity of producing 5000 tons of cotton fiber per year and a lifetime of 15 years are considered for the traditional system while the d5 dyeing system has the annual capacity of 3000 tons of cotton fiber per year for 15 years lifetime capital cost is depreciated linearly over their lifetimes in general the lcc of nonaqueous technology is 3621 25 ton slightly higher than the traditional technology of 3559 55 ton nrc of nonaqueous technology is higher than traditional aqueous technology owing to the equipment investment rc is the main component of the total cost in both cases which is attributes to the raw cotton cost over 60 of rc cotton price is the major contributor to rc and fluctuates along the market it will impact the absolute economic performance of nonaqueous technology but not the comparison except for raw material and maintenance the operating cost of nonaqueous technology is lower than traditional aqueous technology comparing to traditional aqueous technology nonaqueous technology reduced 90 24 of water consumption cost 41 06 of chemicals cost 20 97 of energy cost 80 00 of the wastewater treatment cost however the rc of nonaqueous technology is higher than traditional aqueous technology due to the extra expense of media recovery and recycling d5 solvent used as dyeing media in nonaqueous technology recycled by the water oil separation when the dyeing completed resulting in cost of 362 46 ton additionally the capital investment in nonaqueous technology required more costs for facilities maintenance and staff training 3 4 policy implications since the beginning of china s 12th five year plan fyp china government s regional restructuring policies encouraged structural adjustment through regional industrial distribution taking account of their natural endowments e g motivate t a industry relocation from the east coastal region to the west indeed western china is still at the stage of nascent industrialization and abundant with relatively cheaper labor but the water resource conservation and ecological environment are critical the western regions are the origin of the vital rivers in china and its land characteristics with salinization intensified human activities will lead to further environmental issues such as land quality deterioration land desertification and source water pollution li et al 2018 wu et al 2017 traditional aqueous dyeing with high water demand and salinity wastewater will worsen these environmental issues nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology assessed in this study shows a remarkable water saving ability resulting reduction in water consumption 61 30 79 86 and wastewater discharge 72 50 94 50 however nonaqueous technology underperformed in eco toxicity categories while over 2 o w f d5 emissions released to the environment therefore loss rates of d5 should be closely monitored and controlled below the above level to manage potential risks for headwater conservation in addition under the recent 2060 carbon neutrality ambition china s 14th fyp set a goal for the t a sector to reduce co2 emissions and energy consumption per unit of industrial value added by 18 00 and 13 50 cumulatively by 2025 compared to 2021 cntac 2021 our study shows nonaqueous d5 technology could reduce approximately 43 70 of ghg emissions 48 20 of adp fossil and 19 23 of electricity consumption comparing to traditional aqueous technology in addition nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology was invented for container production which enabling modular assembly thus reducing land use and the associated costs 4 conclusions this study comprehensively compared nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology with aqueous traditional dyeing technology including their environmental performances toxicities and economic feasibilities regionalized cfs for eco toxicity of d5 solvent are firstly supplemented by usetox 2 12 model for comprehensive lca assessment main conclusions are summarized as follows full lca results indicate that nonaqueous dyeing technology is superior to traditional aqueous technology in all categories if the loss rate of d5 is controlled below 2 o w f more attention should concentrate on the d5 emissions which lead to a subversive conclusion in the ecotoxicity category regionalized eco toxicity assessment shows d5 in eastern china is relatively higher than that in western china caused by differences in geographies conditions population density pollutant migration etc the cfs of d5 are not too sensitive to its physic chemical parameters avlogec50 is a main sensitive parameter for ecotoxicity ed50 baffish kdegw and kdega are the sensitive parameters for human noncarcinogenic toxicity contribution analysis revealed that steam consumption is the main contributor to adp fossil gwp ap ep pocp and maetp in all scenarios while odp is attribute to softener and membrane production except for steam d5 and sodium sulfate are the dominant contributor for nonaqueous and aqueous dyeing respectively in terms of economic feasibility the lcc of nonaqueous technology is slightly higher than the traditional technology due its higher maintenance cost 3559 55 ton v s 3621 25 ton overall nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology results in 43 70 of ghg emissions reduction compared to the traditional technology contributing positively to china s 2060 carbon neutrality ambition in addition its ability in water consumption reduction 61 30 79 86 could potentially enable relocating textile industry from the east

16142,fashion industry consumes over 60 of global fibers and attracts increasing attentions due to its environmentally polluting supply chain in addition to natural fibers cultivation wet processes of textile manufacturing are also important contributors to water related impacts due to their large freshwater consumption and the production of chemicals containing wastewater despite of efforts made in improving efficiency of water use and wastewater treatment in textile industry innovative water free technologies such as nonaqueous dyeing technology using organic solvent have been developed and demonstrated to reduce water consumption significantly however the potential impact on water quality by organic solvents induced in supply chain of this emerging technology remains unassessed posing an unknown risk of its promotion hence in the present study a comprehensive life cycle assessment is applied to evaluate its full environmental impacts including those on ecosystem and human health caused by decamethylcyclopentasiloxane d5 as the solvent used further the nonaqueous dyeing system is compared with traditional aqueous dyeing technology from both environmental and economic perspectives results indicate that nonaqueous dyeing system is advanced in most of environment categories except for abiotic depletion potential adp and ecotoxicity however scenarios analysis reveal that these findings are influenced by the loss fraction of d5 during the solvent recovery process it is suggested that the loss fraction should be controlled below 2 o w f for the nonaqueous dyeing technology to be advanced throughout all environmental categories nonaqueous d5 dyeing could reduce water consumption by 61 30 79 95 and greenhouse gas emissions by 43 70 compared to the traditional

for approximately 77 5 of the total t a in china lu 2016 water resources of these provinces are abundant but water stress is severe due to large amounts of water consumed by water intensive industries such as textile production and dyeing zhao et al 2015 under this circumstance chinese government encouraged t a manufacturers to relocate from the east coast to western china to address this water issue as well as facilitate economic growth in the west miit 2012 however the conservation of local natural resources such as freshwater shall be carefully considered during their relocation zhang et al 2016 hence the innovative technology to reduce water consumption and chemical use is urgently required for the next generation of textile industry hussain and wahab 2018 among these water free technologies nonaqueous solvent dyeing has been developed recently and demonstrated with the advantage of industrial scale up fu et al 2015 s andrade et al 2017 tang and kan 2020 decamethylcyclopentasiloxane d5 solvent served as the dyeing medium has been discovered to help fix color dyes on textile resulting in a significant reduction in water consumption and therefore wastewater generation pei et al 2017 d5 is a cyclomethicone commonly used in cosmetics such as deodorants sun creams hair sprays and skincare products however d5 is classified as a high concern substance by the european union eu due to its persistent bioaccumulative and toxic potential eu 2018 high bioconcentration factor bcf and bioaccumulation factor baf indicate potential possibilities of d5 accumulation in aquatic organisms mueller et al 1995 xu et al 2014 therefore the eu has regulated that the concentration of d5 in wash off cosmetic products should not be greater than 0 1 by weight after 31st of january 2020 eu 2018 despite the advantage of d5 dyeing technology in water consumption reducing the potential effects on water quality of the supply chain remain unknown life cycle assessment lca is a comprehensive method to assess environmental performance of a product or process muthu 2014 it has been used in the traditional textile industry to identify its hotspots baydar et al 2015 gomez campos et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 previous studies mainly focused on global warming potential gwp and water consumption hossain and khan 2020 muthu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 they merely include the toxicity related impacts caused by used chemicals leading to potential bias in their conclusions roos 2015 roos et al 2018 terinte et al 2014 claimed that the incomplete inventory data and the missing toxicity characterization factors cfs of these chemicals hindered the comprehensive assessment the usetox model which was developed by united nations environment program unep as a supplementary model to lca is current best available model for characterizing the freshwater toxicity and human toxicity usetox has been widely applied recently to measure the cfs of eco toxicity of a variety of organic and inorganic materials such as organic solvent for producing perovskite solar cells vidal et al 2021 lignocellulose bioplastic xia et al 2021 copper nanoparticles pu et al 2016 pharmaceuticals personal care products ppcps endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and metals in municipal wastewater rashid and liu 2021 and the specific textile chemicals roos et al 2018 but the cfs of d5 is still lacking in addition existing lca studies for advanced textile technology mainly focused on replacing synthetic chemical dyes with natural biobased dyes agnhage et al 2017 fidan et al 2021 linhares and de amorim 2017 or upgrading the process of textile wastewater treatment via electrochemical approach or membrane bioreactor mbr alvarez et al 2020 nakhate et al 2020 yang et al 2020 however the membrane module in wastewater treatment is normally treated as the infrastructure and excluded from the system boundary thus neglecting their impacts from membrane production overall no research is found to our best knowledge evaluating the sustainability of nonaqueous d5 dyeing from full environmental impacts perspectives to reveal the potential trade offs of this emerging technology in t a revolution and bring potential risks to policy makers attention this study aims to 1 quantify its environmental impacts with focus on eco toxicity 2 reveal potential trade offs between water consumption and water quality in various technology scenarios and 3 provides insights to policy makers and investigators via highlighting the potential risks in the implementation of this technology herein a comprehensive assessment was conducted to compare traditional aqueous dyeing with nonaqueous d5 dyeing of cotton fibers using lca and life cycle costing lcc approaches including their environmental impacts eco toxicity and economic feasibility regionalized eco toxicity impacts of d5 emissions were firstly assessed and taken into accounts in this lca study sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis were also performed in addition this comparative lca considers various wastewater treatment technologies within the system boundary including the production of membrane module finally policy recommendations were given based on our findings to address pros and cons of this nonaqueous dyeing technology to support decisions making 2 methods and data 2 1 technology description the traditional dyeing process includes pre treatment dyeing and post treatment fig 1 a for pre treatment process raw cotton is scoured with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sodium carbonate soda and sodium hydrate naoh in the 98 c water bath for 60 min to remove natural wax and non fibrous impurities in the dyeing process reactive dyes are added at 25 c and then sodium sulfate na2so4 is added twice with an interval of 15 min then the temperature is controlled at 90 c for 60 min during color fixation after dyeing the fibers are washed with a softener solution finally wastewater is collected for a preprocess before sending to the central wastewater treatment plant the nonaqueous dyeing process includes pre treatment dyeing medium recovery and post treatment fig 1b the pre treatment of scouring process is similar to traditional aqueous dyeing but with reduced amount of chemicals used in the dyeing step d5 replaces the traditional water base to form a suspension system with cotton fibers reactive dyes are dissolved in a water microenvironment at 30 c for 25 min then the temperature of the dying system is raised to 60 c followed by adding soda to adjust ph to 10 5 11 after dyeing the cotton fibers are washed and softened the mixed effluents are sent to the oil water separation system to recycle d5 wastewater containing surplus chemicals is sent to the wastewater treatment system 2 2 lca lca includes four stages goal and scope definition life cycle inventory lci life cycle impact assessment lcia and results interpretation iso 2006a 2006b sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the fluctuations of system appendix a3 2 2 1 goal and scope this study intends to carry out a comparative lca study on productions of cotton fibers using various dyeing technologies the functional unit fu is defined as producing 1 ton dry weight of dyed cotton fibers with black reactive dyes the system boundary starts from cotton fibers dry weight received at the dyeing plant gate and includes scouring dyeing washing drying wastewater treatment sludge transport and sludge disposal fig 2 considering the reuse of d5 the recycling process is included in the system boundary of the nonaqueous dyeing system 2 of cut off criteria are applied infrastructure apart from membrane production and land use are out of the system boundary scenarios considered in the analysis includes aqueous traditional s1 nonaqueous baseline s2 nonaqueous demonstration s3 and nonaqueous prospect s4 the differences in s2 s4 are various assumptions on d5 s loss rates during recycling process which are 8 o w f the weight of fabric 6 o w f and 2 o w f respectively details in section 2 2 2 and appendix a1 2 2 2 lci the primary data were obtained via onsite investigations in 2020 from the major manufactures in guangdong province and zhejiang province with the capacity of 87 000 tons yr and 3000 tons yr for traditional aqueous dyeing system and nonaqueous d5 dyeing system respectively furthermore an in depth material balance analysis was carried out for the inventory data secondary data were obtained from the literature gabi 10 database and ecoinvent 3 7 1 database lci for four scenarios and membrane production are in appendix a1 table a1 and a2 data sources are summarized as follows s1 aqueous traditional scenario was adopted from pei et al 2021 for chemicals consumptions energy inputs and water use were obtained from the survey investigation the process data of wastewater treatment was extracted from an lca study from nakhate et al 2020 with a 50 water reuse rate s2 nonaqueous baseline scenario was based on the trials of d5 solvent dyeing cotton fiber and nylon fiber reported by pei et al 2021 and saleem et al 2021 respectively d5 solvent consumption was calculated taking five repeated dyeing cycles of the bath solution and 98 recyclability into account with dyeing carried out a 1 20 fabric to liquor ratio saleem et al 2021 the wastewater treatment process is the same as s1 s3 nonaqueous demonstration design refers to a pilot scale production 100 kg d from pei et al 2021 the loss of the d5 solvent is controlled 6 o w f i e 60 kg the wastewater treatment data are the same as s1 s4 nonaqueous prospect design combines the field investigation of the nonaqueous dyeing factory which considered a further lowest d5 loss rate of 2 o w f i e 20 kg the wastewater treatment process using the uf nanofiltration nf ro membrane system and the water reuse rate can reach 90 2 2 3 lcia methods lcia uses cfs to convert inventory results to their environmental and human health impacts bovea and gallardo 2006 gilbertson et al 2015 inventory data are assigned to different impact categories followed by different lcia methods korre et al 2010 in order to reveal the potential trade off between the environmental and toxicity concerns cfs are selected as comprehensive as possible by means of the lcia methods of cml 2001 and usetox 2 12 indicators selected are resource depletion indicators of abiotic depletion potential elements adp elements kg sb eq and abiotic depletion potential fossil adp fossil mj greenhouse gas effect indicators of global warming potential gwp kg co2 eq and ozone depletion potential odp kg r11 eq water quality indicator of eutrophication potential ep kg phosphate eq air quality indicators of acidification potential ap kg so2 eq and photochemical ozone creation potential pocp kg ethene eq toxicity indicators of marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp kg dcb eq terrestrial ecotoxicity potential tetp kg dcb eq ecotoxicity paf m3 d human toxicity cancer disease cases and human toxicity non cancer disease cases moreover considering the water consumption is a crucial issue to identify the sustainability of the textile industry freshwater consumption wcp m3 is calculated as the net water consumption in processes and water consumption from the production of lci inputs 2 2 4 eco toxicity assessment by usetox model eco toxicity indicators of freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity are included in numerous lcia models but vary due to different scopes model principles and assumptions in methods leading to inconsistent results in these models with 12 orders of magnitude variation between the cfs of the different chemicals hauschild et al 2008 westh et al 2015 therefore the usetox model was developed by the unep setac life cycle initiative as a scientific consensus model to support more robust life cycle toxicity assessments which could improve the precision to 2 or 3 orders of magnitude rosenbaum et al 2008 it also has advantages in providing comprehensive coverage of cfs for contaminants and considering the geographical diversities of cfs belyanovskaya et al 2019 henderson et al 2011 usetox model treats the environmental compartments as well mixed boxes containing and exchanging contaminants mass de garcía et al 2017 fantke et al 2017 the model implies a cause effect chain from a contaminant entering the environment till generating freshwater ecotoxicity or human toxicity including three steps as environmental fate exposure and effect fantke et al 2017 the cfs could be calculated as eq 1 1 c f f f x f e f i f e f where ff is the fate factor refers to the environmental residence time of contaminant calculated by its physicochemical properties xf is the exposure factor refers to the fraction of contaminant dissolved and available for organism ef is the effect factor refers to the eco toxicological impacts on aquatic environment or human health if intake fraction a summary metric of organism exposure concerning emissions calculated by a matrix multiplication of ff with xf ultimately the cfs of freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity at the midpoint are expressed in comparative toxicity units ctue kg emitted and ctuh kg emitted respectively for freshwater ecotoxicity cfeco is the potentially affected fraction of species paf over the exposed water volume m3 and time d induced by per kg of contaminant emission paf m3 d kg emitted for human toxicity cfhum is the cumulative cases of cancer or non cancer diseases caused by per kg of contaminant emission cases kg emitted the mechanism framework of the usetox model is described in the fig 3 and detailed calculations are displayed in appendix a2 input parameters for usetox model simulation are classified as physic chemical properties degradation in the environment exposure human carcinogenic and non carcinogenic toxicities and ecotoxicity an extensive literature review was conducted to obtain these parameters from scientific published articles or public chemical information repositories detailed information is given in table 1 the experimental data is taken precedence over the estimated data for data collection parameters of kdoc and baffish are particularly referring to the cosmede database cosmede database is a comprehensive platform for substance documentation developed by the environment and energy mastery agency and the french normalization agency provided cfs for cosmetic and detergent substances via usetox model 1 01 version roos et al 2018 the ecotoxicity of d5 was included in cosmede database however the cfs need to be updated due to their out of date input parameters and the lack of those for human toxicity for noncarcinogenic toxicity d5 has observed effect on the respiratory tract liver and lung due to its induction in enzymes the induction patterns of d5 resemble phenobarbital in hepatic microsomal enzymes mckim et al 1999 for carcinogenic toxicity d5 did not demonstrate neoplastic effects in the 2 year bioassay in f344 rats though the uterine endometrial adenocarcinomas were found in the female group of highest exposure due to the dopamine agonist activity of d5 causing estrogen dominance however these species specific tumor data could not be used for human either qualitatively or quantitatively because dopamine agonists do not lead to estrogen dominance in women dekant and klaunig 2016 jean et al 2016 klaunig et al 2016 usepa 2005 as a result human toxicity cancer impact of d5 emissions was excluded in the current study 2 3 economic performance analysis lcc as an addition to lca applies the life cycle thinking to economic analysis integrated with lca dynamic interconnect the costs and the environmental impacts of each life cycle stage resende et al 2019 all costs were calculated and expressed in usd using an annual average exchange rate of 1 usd 6 8974 cny in 2020 national bureau of statistics of china 2021 the lcc input data for traditional aqueous dyeing factory s1 and nonaqueous dyeing demonstration plant s3 were collected from field investigation the lcc analysis carried out in this study follows the eq 2 innocenzi et al 2021 considering capital cost and operational cost 2 l c c n r c r c where nrc is non recurring costs i e capital expenditure capex including the capital investment of infrastructure equipment and piping which is amortized in lifetime years rc is recurring costs i e operating expense opex including the costs of raw materials chemicals energy water maintenance medium recycling waste disposal and labor 3 results and discussions prior to performing lca of nonaqueous dyeing system cfs of d5 emitted to various environmental compartments were calculated first 3 1 eco toxicity assessment of d5 emissions eco toxicity categories are specific the inclusion of their spatial difference could enhance the accuracy of lca results kounina et al 2014 central asia include western china and eastern china were selected to export regional cfs for different environmental compartments i e taking cf of central asia and eastern china to represent west cn and east cn respectively and compared with the default setting of the global average in the usetox model west cn in the usetox 2 12 model includes chinese provinces of xinjiang tibet qinghai and gansu while the rest of the provinces belong to east cn jolliet 2021 landscape setting of subcontinent could be found in appendix b sheet b1 additionally sensitivity and uncertainty analysis were conducted to indicate the key parameters and robustness for eco toxicity calculation appendix a3 1 3 1 1 eco toxicity results of d5 emissions in general cfs of d5 emissions in east cn are higher than those in west cn fig 4 within the characterization model eq 1 fate and exposure factors could be region specific while effect factors linear with ec50 and ed50 are not residence time as an influential parameter to fate factor is affected by chemical degradation and freshwater depth which are influenced by local environment kounina et al 2014 d5 intake fraction through human exposure factor is affected by inhalation population density and dietary behavior which are regional specific for example lower intake of meat fish and below ground products and lower population density in west cn would result lower cfs the variations in regional exposure are mainly attribute to inhalation and fish ingestion whose key drivers are degradation partitioning and bioaccumulation i e t1 2air t1 2water kow baffish appendix b sheet b2 it has been reported that d5 has long half life periods in water and sediment t1 2water 70 4 days t1 2sediment 3100 days and high bioaccumulation in fish minnow flounder and ragworm kierkegaard et al 2011 parrott et al 2013 the variations in ecotoxicity cfs of different compartments depend on the intermedia transfer of d5 from them to the final receiving media freshwater for the highest cfs of direct emissions to freshwater the effect factor strongly affects the freshwater ecotoxicity by 2 orders of magnitude while fate factor has less impact ecotoxicity cfs of d5 emitted to sea water appear the minimum due to the lack of characterization module for marine ecotoxicity in usetox model however could be improved in the future model development in this study the dyeing process is operated in a sealed container d5 release mainly happen in the treatment of process wastewater the proportions of d5 between its destinations are about 73 in sludge which is eventually to soil and 22 to air assuming it is not readily biodegradable echa 2015 the remaining 5 is assumed releasing to the water phase combing the above calculated cfs in each environmental compartment and their corresponding fractions of d5 the eco toxicity of d5 in different scenarios can be calculated as appendix a2 eq a 4 and results are as shown in table 2 the eco toxicity of d5 emission decreased directly with the reduction of d5 loss fraction from 8 o w f in s2 to 2 o w f in s4 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis of usetox model sensitivity analysis is performed to reveal the relatively sensitive input parameters of the usetox model via varying them by 10 the full sensitivity results are shown in fig 5 a b and appendix b sheet b3 for ecotoxicity fig 5a avlogec50 is a main sensitive parameter in all the environmental compartments because it directly influences the effect factor this finding in accordance with the conclusions from igos et al 2014 kh25c and kdega show high sensitivities to cfeco in the compartment of rural air and sea water with an opposite trend kdegw is also sensitive in sea water compartment kdegsl is sensitive in urban air and both two soil compartments it is observed that the cfs of d5 released to the rural air and sea water is more easily affected by input parameters and it is noted that the effect of regional setting on cfeco sensitivity is not significant except for kdega for human toxicity non cancer fig 5b ed50 from inhalation pathway shows a high sensitivity in atmospheric environment and soil environment for effects on human toxicity non cancer category from d5 emissions to water ed50 from ingestion pathway baffish and kdegw are the main sensitive parameters additionally kdega is sensitive to cfhum in the emission compartments of rural air natural soil and agriculture soil at the same time kdega also displays a regional sensitivity overall the most influential parameters are the basis for calculating ef i e ec50 and ed50 the physic chemical parameters of d5 do not heavily influence its cfs more attentions could be on the collection of relevant toxicity data which is considered as an obstacle of the reliability and availability of the cf of human toxicity 3 1 3 uncertainty of eco toxicity results considering the usetox input parameters are from different data sources an uncertainty analysis was performed to test the reliability of eco toxicity results usetox inputs parameters were firstly clustered into three groups with a descending order of quality the group 1 values same as those in table 1 are set as a baseline values in group 2 and 3 are derived from alternative sources of usetox 3 0 beta database and cosmede database respectively appendix a4 table a3 an exhaustive method is then used to generate a dataset containing 7776 independent combinations of all required input parameters for usetox calculation calculation based on 7776 combinations generates ranges for each impact categories shown as bars with the mean values noted as black dots in fig 6 results calculated by group 1 baseline are within these ranges approximately 5 63 10 17 different from mean values of ecotoxicity and 4 86 10 31 away from human noncarcinogenic toxicity mean values these indicate that group 1 parameters could generate reasonably reliable eco toxicity results and used for further full lcia analysis in addition the coefficients of variations cvs of ecotoxicity and human noncarcinogenic toxicity are 13 03 20 65 and 20 92 25 94 respectively appendix a4 table a4 human toxicity non cancer representing a higher uncertainty in the cfs results 3 2 lca results integrated with eco toxicity of d5 the comprehensive impacts of different production options are displayed in this section the full results between different scenarios are considered firstly followed by the contributing substances within the scenarios corresponding sensitivity analysis are performed in appendix a3 2 3 2 1 scenario analysis the comparative results of four scenarios integrated with regionalized eco toxicity results are shown in fig 7 the eco toxicity of d5 emissions is presented by adding columns filled with oblique lines d5 emissions play a significant role in eco toxicity categories thus the exclusion will result in a biased conclusion the impacts of including d5 emissions on ecotoxicity and human noncarcinogenic toxicity are more severe in east cn than in wets cn and decrease along the drop in the loss rate of d5 in s2 s4 the overall results reveal that nonaqueous scenarios are superior in almost all categories except for adp elements and ecotoxicity the high score of adp elements of s2 is caused by the production of d5 while that of freshwater ecotoxicity is due to d5 released to the environment the odp of s4 is highest in nonaqueous scenarios due to its greater amount of membrane used although the mbr treatment elevates the odp this more efficient wastewater treatment method increases the water reuse rate from 50 to 90 thereby decreasing the overall wcp in s4 nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology results in over 40 of ghg emissions reduction and 60 80 water consumption reduction compared to the traditional technology in summary nonaqueous technology has the potential to reduce environmental impacts significantly delivering the promising results by s4 where the d5 loss rate is controlled below 2 o w f 3 2 2 contribution analysis as the nonaqueous demonstration plant is located in zhejiang province in eastern china the contribution analysis is integrated with the usetox east cn results fig 8 a b c and d present the main contributors of s1 s2 s3 s4 respectively detailed lcia of four scenarios could be found in appendix b sheet b4 for traditional aqueous technology fig 8a soda and sodium sulfate are the two dominant contributors to the adp elements due to their large amount of use adp fossil gwp ap pocp and maetp are mainly attribute to steam sodium sulfate is the main contributor to ep accounts for 76 97 wastewater treatment is the dominant factor in the odp category mainly attributes to the tetrafluoroethylene use in the membrane production stamford and azapagic 2014 2018 fluorocarbon gasses emitted during tetrafluoroethylene manufacturing leading to the ozone layer depletion eventually have significant impacts on the odp and gwp duclos et al 2017 in addition the significant amount of wastewater generation in traditional aqueous process caused relatively large impacts on tetp and human toxicity sodium sulfate and wastewater treatment both have significant impacts on ecotoxicity which mainly attribute to mercury and iron emissions into freshwater during the production of sodium sulfate and detergent ingredients dewaele et al 2006 moreover sulfate as a potent phytotoxin also significantly affects aquatic plants resulting substantial contributions to the ecotoxicity lamers et al 2013 1998 for nonaqueous technology fig 8b c d d5 production is critical to adp elements and tetp similar to s1 adp fossil gwp ap ep pocp and maetp are mainly caused by steam odp which results from the halogenated gas release to atmosphere is mainly attribute to softener and membrane production sodium sulfate is no longer the main contributor to the ep because of its elimination in the nonaqueous dyeing process after integrating usetox results d5 plays a significant role in a series of toxicity indicators except for maetp because the experimental toxicity data showed d5 has no adverse effects to pelagic aquatic organisms at the concentration nearly reach to water solubility environment canada and health canada 2008 fig 8 b and c demonstrate that d5 production and d5 emissions are important factors to ecotoxicity and human toxicity when the loss of d5 are 80 kg and 60 kg s2 and s3 it is suggested that d5 s loss should be minimized via more efficient recycling process 3 3 lcc analysis table 3 summarizes the lcc results of the traditional aqueous dyeing technology s1 and nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology s3 the capacity of producing 5000 tons of cotton fiber per year and a lifetime of 15 years are considered for the traditional system while the d5 dyeing system has the annual capacity of 3000 tons of cotton fiber per year for 15 years lifetime capital cost is depreciated linearly over their lifetimes in general the lcc of nonaqueous technology is 3621 25 ton slightly higher than the traditional technology of 3559 55 ton nrc of nonaqueous technology is higher than traditional aqueous technology owing to the equipment investment rc is the main component of the total cost in both cases which is attributes to the raw cotton cost over 60 of rc cotton price is the major contributor to rc and fluctuates along the market it will impact the absolute economic performance of nonaqueous technology but not the comparison except for raw material and maintenance the operating cost of nonaqueous technology is lower than traditional aqueous technology comparing to traditional aqueous technology nonaqueous technology reduced 90 24 of water consumption cost 41 06 of chemicals cost 20 97 of energy cost 80 00 of the wastewater treatment cost however the rc of nonaqueous technology is higher than traditional aqueous technology due to the extra expense of media recovery and recycling d5 solvent used as dyeing media in nonaqueous technology recycled by the water oil separation when the dyeing completed resulting in cost of 362 46 ton additionally the capital investment in nonaqueous technology required more costs for facilities maintenance and staff training 3 4 policy implications since the beginning of china s 12th five year plan fyp china government s regional restructuring policies encouraged structural adjustment through regional industrial distribution taking account of their natural endowments e g motivate t a industry relocation from the east coastal region to the west indeed western china is still at the stage of nascent industrialization and abundant with relatively cheaper labor but the water resource conservation and ecological environment are critical the western regions are the origin of the vital rivers in china and its land characteristics with salinization intensified human activities will lead to further environmental issues such as land quality deterioration land desertification and source water pollution li et al 2018 wu et al 2017 traditional aqueous dyeing with high water demand and salinity wastewater will worsen these environmental issues nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology assessed in this study shows a remarkable water saving ability resulting reduction in water consumption 61 30 79 86 and wastewater discharge 72 50 94 50 however nonaqueous technology underperformed in eco toxicity categories while over 2 o w f d5 emissions released to the environment therefore loss rates of d5 should be closely monitored and controlled below the above level to manage potential risks for headwater conservation in addition under the recent 2060 carbon neutrality ambition china s 14th fyp set a goal for the t a sector to reduce co2 emissions and energy consumption per unit of industrial value added by 18 00 and 13 50 cumulatively by 2025 compared to 2021 cntac 2021 our study shows nonaqueous d5 technology could reduce approximately 43 70 of ghg emissions 48 20 of adp fossil and 19 23 of electricity consumption comparing to traditional aqueous technology in addition nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology was invented for container production which enabling modular assembly thus reducing land use and the associated costs 4 conclusions this study comprehensively compared nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology with aqueous traditional dyeing technology including their environmental performances toxicities and economic feasibilities regionalized cfs for eco toxicity of d5 solvent are firstly supplemented by usetox 2 12 model for comprehensive lca assessment main conclusions are summarized as follows full lca results indicate that nonaqueous dyeing technology is superior to traditional aqueous technology in all categories if the loss rate of d5 is controlled below 2 o w f more attention should concentrate on the d5 emissions which lead to a subversive conclusion in the ecotoxicity category regionalized eco toxicity assessment shows d5 in eastern china is relatively higher than that in western china caused by differences in geographies conditions population density pollutant migration etc the cfs of d5 are not too sensitive to its physic chemical parameters avlogec50 is a main sensitive parameter for ecotoxicity ed50 baffish kdegw and kdega are the sensitive parameters for human noncarcinogenic toxicity contribution analysis revealed that steam consumption is the main contributor to adp fossil gwp ap ep pocp and maetp in all scenarios while odp is attribute to softener and membrane production except for steam d5 and sodium sulfate are the dominant contributor for nonaqueous and aqueous dyeing respectively in terms of economic feasibility the lcc of nonaqueous technology is slightly higher than the traditional technology due its higher maintenance cost 3559 55 ton v s 3621 25 ton overall nonaqueous d5 dyeing technology results in 43 70 of ghg emissions reduction compared to the traditional technology contributing positively to china s 2060 carbon neutrality ambition in addition its ability in water consumption reduction 61 30 79 86 could potentially enable relocating textile industry from the east to the west of china as long as the eco toxicity impact of this technology is managed properly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16143,microplastics act as a source of organic contaminants in aquatic environments and thus affect their environmental fate and toxicity because of the weak and reversible interactions between microplastics and organic species the organic coronas vary with their surrounding environments thus in order to evaluate the possible environmental risks of microplastics methods for evaluating the dynamic uptake of organic contaminants onto suspended microplastics in aquatic environments are greatly desired in this work a uv vis spectroscopy based approach was developed for in situ monitoring organic contaminants uptake onto suspended microplastics after correcting the light scattering interference from microplastics suspensions and establishing the nonlinear relationship between concentration and light absorbance of organic species the inverse adding doubling method based on radiative transfer theory was adopted to correct the light scattering effect of suspensions then the resulting mixed absorption spectra were decomposed to calculate the concentrations of the aqueous and adsorbed organic species simultaneously with a nonlinear calibration method the uptake processes of bisphenol a and p nitrophenol onto nylon 66 microparticles were monitored with this approach and confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis the approach was validated by applying it to natural water samples and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be interfered mainly by the protein like substances this approach has high accuracy good reproducibility remarkable universality and ease of handling and also provides a potential tool for characterizing the corona formation process on suspended particles both in natural and artificial environments such as eco corona formation and engineering surface modification on nano micro particles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics contaminants adsorption uv vis spectroscopy in situ

organic pollutants would be significantly changed with the widespread microplastics such as mistaken ingestion by aquatic animals atugoda et al 2021 dong et al 2020a dong et al 2020b li et al 2021a

pedriza and jaumot 2020 schultz et al 2021 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 therefore investigations into the organic contaminants uptake onto microplastics are of great importance in evaluating their biological toxicity and ecological risks several techniques have been developed to quantify the corona on microplastics in aquatic environments they can be divided into three main categories 1 ex situ quantification through isolation e g centrifugal operation 2 direct measurement of the adsorbed species on microplastics e g quartz crystal microbalance and attenuated total reflectance fourier

concentration and separation pretreatment operations like centrifuging and washing might destroy the weak attachment of the surface corona on microplastics lai et al 2021 moreover the time consuming procedures are incompetent for real time monitoring of contaminant uptake heskett et al 2012 atr ftir and quartz crystal microbalance are commonly and enable directly quantify the adsorption kinetics by measuring the light absorption or mass change on the liquid solid interface harms et al 2012 mudunkotuwa et al 2014 however a lab made polymer film is required to represent the microplastics in measurement thus the representativeness of the processes under suspension conditions is questionable scattering based techniques such as dynamic light scattering can quantify the contaminant uptake through size measurements junaid and wang 2021 however it is effective only for microplastics with colloidally stable corona and narrow size distribution it is also challenging to capture the size change when the difference of the reflective index between the microplastics and organic corona is not significant or the thicknesses of the coronas are small bhattacharjee 2016 moreover no chemical composition information could be obtained with scattering based methods consequently quantitative approaches of in situ probing the organic contaminant uptake kinetics on suspended microplastics under realistic aquatic environments are largely needed ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy is a conventional technique to quantify organic chemicals in solution by beer lambert s law however two issues should be solved to monitor the organic contaminant uptake onto suspended microplastics first beer lambert s law is ineffective in suspensions due to the light scattering effect numerous empirical and semi empirical light methods have been developed to obtain the pure light absorption portions such as extended multiplicative scatter correction harald martens 2003 geladi et al 1985 and optical path length estimation and correction chen et al 2006 jin et al 2012 the chemometrics methods are built on specific databases and therefore can t work when variations in scattering are significant among those physical based approaches using radiative transfer theory might have the potential to be applied to all types of heterogeneous systems huffman 1983 pickering et al 1993 prahl 1993 2011 secondly after light scattering correction the light absorption of the aqueous organic molecules in the supernatant and the adsorbed organic molecules on microplastics should be decomposed and quantified respectively in previous works the linear decomposition methods were reported for the simultaneous quantification of multiple components steponavicius and thennadil 2009 2011 however the molecules in adsorbed phase don t conform to linear lambert beer s law due to the molecule aggregation effect argudo et al 2021 barnett et al 2015 and interaction between molecules and particles thus calibration is needed in this work a two step uv vis spectroscopic approach was developed to in situ probe the uptake kinetics of organic contaminants onto suspended microplastics in the first step the inverse adding doubling iad method based on radiative transfer theory was adopted to correct the scattering effect of microplastics suspensions then a nonlinear spectra calibration method was established to estimate the concentrations of the aqueous organic molecules in the supernatant and adsorbed molecules on microplastics bisphenol a bpa and p nitrophenol p np were chosen as the target organic pollutants and their uptake by nylon 66 microparticles was monitored to validate the effectiveness of this approach finally the practical application of this approach was evaluated under four types of natural aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bpa and p np were purchased from aladdin co china polyamide microparticles 70 30 μm in diameter fig s1a and thermoplastic polyurethanes microplastics 150 20 μm in diameter fig s1b were purchased from sinopec maoming petrochemical co china silica nanosphere 200 nm in diameter was bought from tianjin baseline chromtech research centre china humic acid was purchased from sigma aldrich all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification 2 2 measurement setup total transmittance and reflectance spectra were acquired using a scanning spectrophotometer lambda 650 s perkinelmer inc usa equipped with a 60 mm integrating sphere the spectral data of bpa were collected at the wavelength range from 250 to 325 nm 250 to 500 nm for p np at a 1 nm interval with an integration time of 0 2 s the suspension samples were placed in a 5 mm path length cuvette made of quartz glass for spectra measurement a homemade stirring device was used to prevent the microparticles from settling down in the suspension during spectra collection fig s2 2 3 extraction of optical absorption properties with iad method radiative transfer theory describes the wave propagation through a medium characterized by a random distribution of absorbers and scatters huffman 1983 steponavicius and thennadil 2009 total transmittance spectra total reflectance spectra were obtained for decoupling of absorption coefficient spectra μ a and scattering coefficient spectra μ s through inverting the radiative transport equation which for a specific wavelength λ is giving by 1 d i r s λ d s μ t λ i r s λ μ s λ 4 π 4 π p s s λ i r s λ d ω 2 μ t λ μ a λ μ s λ where i r s λ is the light intensity at a distance r from the light source along with the directional vector s μ t λ cm 1 is the total extinction coefficient p s s λ is the phase function and ω is the solid angle particularly μ t λ is the sum of absorption coefficient μ a λ and the scattering coefficient μ s λ the iad method was applied for the inversion of the radiative transport equation prahl 2011 in brief the iad program worked by iterating an adding doubling solution which was generated and numerical of the radiative transport equation until the estimated values of the reflection and transmission matched the measured ones the refractive index of the sample was set to equal to the refractive index of water 1 33 and the value of g was fixed to 0 9 according to the literature hu et al 2020 other parameters needed for the iad program are listed in table s1 the obtained absorption coefficient spectra were then processed by baseline correction for further concentrations estimation 2 4 estimation of aqueous and adsorbed substances beer lambert s law which relates the light absorption to the concentrations of the materials is given by 3 μ a b l λ 2 3 ε λ c where μ a b l λ is the absorption coefficient corresponded with beer lambert s law ε λ is the molar absorbance coefficient however since the law fails to maintain the linear relationship at a high concentration of absorption species the high concentration of adsorbed molecules on the particle s surface cannot be quantified with their light absorbance using beer lambert s law therefore the relationship between absorbance and concentration is expressed as 4 μ a λ f λ c where f λ is a nonlinear function since the relationship between concentration and absorbance at each wavelength is different f λ should be determined at each wavelength fortunately we found that the actual absorbance and the absorbance estimated with beer lambert s law share the same relationship at each wavelength thus combining eqs 3 and 4 generates the following relationship 5 μ a f λ μ a b l λ ε λ f μ a b l where f is a monotone nonlinear function independent to the wavelength there are two absorption species in an organic microplastics adsorption sample molecules in the aqueous phase with a low concentration in the supernatant and adsorbed molecules on the surface of particles since their contributions to the light absorption are independent guo et al 2019 mudunkotuwa et al 2014 sit et al 2020 the absorbance of the sample is the sum of their absorbance i e μ a s a m p l e μ a p a r t i c l e μ a s u p e r n a t a n t μ a p a r t i c l e is given by 6 μ a p a r t i c l e f μ a a d s o r b e d μ a a q u e o u s where μ a a d s o r b e d ε a d s o r b e d c a d s o r b e d and μ a q u e o u s ε a q u e o u s c a q u e o u s ε a d s o r b e d was estimated with a low concentration of molecules the relationship between absorbance and concentration of molecules in the aqueous phase maintains a linear relationship since μ a a q u e o u s ε a q u e o u s 1 r c a q u e o u s the absorbance of the sample can be expressed as 7 μ a f ε a d s o r b e d r c a d s o r b e d ε a q u e o u s r c a q u e o u s ε a q u e o u s 1 r c a q u e o u s where r is estimated with the volume ratio of the particle and the sample when the particles are precipitated since eq 7 is applicable to all wavelengths we can solve the concentrations of molecules in the adsorbed and aqueous phases 2 5 experimental design a set of suspended samples consisting of sio2 nanospheres 12 5 and 25 mg l 1 a commonly used pure scattering material and bpa 30 mg l 1 were used to validate the scattering correction efficiency of the iad method the total transmittance spectra were collected to compare with the absorption coefficient spectra inversed from the total reflectance spectra and collimated transmitted spectra the calibration curves of the absorption coefficient spectra of bpa p np in the aqueous and adsorbed phases were constructed described in detail in supporting information three parallel samples consisting of bpa in the aqueous phase 13 mg l 1 bpa in adsorbed phase 27 mg l 1 and nylon 66 microplastics 10 45 g l 1 were measured to verify the approach the uptake kinetics of bpa 40 mg l 1 and p np 10 mg l 1 on nylon 66 microplastics 10 45 g l 1 in ultra pure water was used as models to verify the efficiency for kinetic monitoring at time intervals of 1 min and 2 min within 25 times respectively notably to obtain the kinetic data within an acceptable time a higher concentration of organic contaminants and microplastics were used as models because low concentrations of analyte environment relevant may take hours to days duan et al 2012 sheehan and whitman 2005 also the adsorption kinetics at a relatively lower concentration bpa in 4 mg l 1 and nylon 66 microplastics in 1 g l 1 were monitored to evaluate the method s applicability in the environmental concentration range according to literature dong et al 2020a qian et al 2021 wang et al 2016 xie et al 2020 yao et al 2020 yin and shang 2020 further the uptake kinetics of bpa 40 mg l 1 on nylon 66 microplastics 10 45 g l 1 in alkaline ph 11 0 adjusted with 0 1 mol l 1 potassium hydroxide and acidic ph 3 0 adjusted with 0 1 mol l 1 perchloric acid aquatic environments were monitored to verify the practicability of our method at various ph values moreover the uptake kinetics of bpa 40 mg l 1 onto thermoplastic polyurethanes microplastics 5 2 g l 1 with an average diameter around 150 μm fig s1b in ultra pure water were also evaluated to verify the robustness of our method for different types of microplastics for practical applications the uptake kinetics of bpa on nylon 66 microplastics was monitored in a humic acid simulated sample 5 mg toc l 1 and three natural water samples collected from yanjing lake chaohu lake and nanfei river hefei china 2 6 computational calculations the bpa and nylon 66 monomer mpa were selected to investigate the interaction mechanism between bpa and microplastics the structure of bpa was firstly optimized then two bpa and one mpa molecule were constructed to simulate the interactions and final optimized structures were obtained density functional theory dft calculations were performed in materials studio the geometric optimization mulliken charge distribution and molecular orbital energy of free bpa and bpa bpa mpa complex were conducted with dmol3 module delley 1990 2000 the generalized gradient approximation with perdew burke ernzerhof functional was used to describe the exchange correlation energy perdew et al 1996 the convergence of energy and force for structure relaxation were set to 1 0 10 5 hartree and 2 10 3 hartree å for all molecules the van der waals interactions were introduced with tkatchenko scheffler method tkatchenko and scheffler 2009 the solvation effects of water were also taken into account using conductor like screening model solvation method klamt and schüürmann 1993 york and karplus 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the method the iad method is a powerful tool to correct the scattering effect in a heterogeneous system for concentration estimation of absorption species in suspensions prahl 1993 2011 steponavicius and thennadil 2009 2011 thus it was used to extract the light absorption coefficient spectra of the suspensions and its effectiveness was validated with a suspension system consisting of bpa and sio2 nanospheres commonly used pure scattering materials the light extinction intensity increased with the rising concentration of sio2 nanospheres due to the scattering effect raised by sio2 nanospheres leading to the overestimation of bpa concentration fig 1 a after correcting the light scattering effect through the total transmittance and total reflectance spectra with the iad method the estimated absorption coefficient spectra of the suspension in different amounts of sio2 nanospheres kept the same fig 1b two light absorption species molecules in the aqueous phase and the adsorbed phase contributed to the extracted absorption coefficient spectra of the suspension the absorption spectrum of the aqueous molecules was significantly different from that of the adsorbed ones fig s3 the characteristic peak of bpa molecules in aqueous phase at 273 nm red shifted and widened when adsorbed on nylon 66 microplastics dft calculation shows that the phenolic groups of bpa interacted with mpa mainly through hydrogen bonding fig s4 as for the charge transfer process all the atomic mulliken charges table s2 together with the atomic corresponding coordinates text s1 were provided before interaction both bpa and mpa were almost neutral however after forming the bpa bpa mpa complex the total charge density was redistributed again and the atoms with the largest charge differences in mpa and bpa were c1 and c101 0 068 and 0 080 e in table s2 belonging to the atoms without directly bonding with other molecules furthermore through separating the charge density to different moieties we found that compared with the almost neutral molecules for both free bpa and mpa before interaction the bpa moieties held a negative charge 0 154 and 0 061 e while the mpa moiety held a positive charge 0 211 e table s3 suggesting the electron transfer from mpa to bpa such an interaction might lead to the band structure alteration therefore the homo and lumo energy of the molecules before and after complexation was determined fig s4 compared with free bpa the band gap between homo and lumo energy of the bpa mpa complex decreased from 3 89 to 3 73 ev the decrease of the band gap facilitates the electron transition between various energy levels and consequently results in a red shift of uv vis absorption spectra which is coincident with the experimental results however due to the strong basal signal raised by nylon 66 microplastics the interaction between bpa and nylon 66 microplastics was undetectable in raman or fourier transform infrared spectra fig s5 the second step aimed to decompose the extracted absorption coefficient spectra of the suspension based on the spectra difference between the molecules in aqueous and adsorbed phases followed by quantifying the concentration of the solutes in both phases the absorption coefficient of bpa in aqueous phase complied well with beer lambert s law fig s3a thus the concentration normalized spectrum of bpa in 50 mg l 1 could be used as the standard absorption spectrum of bpa in aqueous phase fig 2 a nevertheless the absorption coefficient of bpa in the adsorbed phase was nonlinear with concentration fig s3b due to the aggregation of bpa molecules on the surface of microplastics therefore a nonlinear calibration of the spectra for the adsorbed bpa is needed fortunately the relationship between the experimentally measured and estimated absorption spectra through beer lambert s law at different wavelengths follow the same nonlinear function fig 2c by using the locally weighted linear regression the theoretical absorption spectra of the absorbed bpa can be estimated without expression function f in eq 5 after calibration a linear decomposition was used to estimate the bpa concentrations in aqueous and adsorbed phases the spectrum of 4 7 mg l 1 adsorbed bpa was used as the standard absorption spectrum of the adsorbed bpa at such a low concentration the nonlinear effect might be negligible fig 2b with this approach the concentrations of bpa in the aqueous phase and total concentration of bpa were estimated and matched well with the theoretical values measured with high performance liquid chromatography hplc through particle isolation suggesting the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed approach fig 3 3 2 monitoring the adsorption process with the continually measured total transmittance spectra and total reflectance spectra fig s6a and b the real time uptake process of bpa onto nylon 66 microparticles was monitored with the above approach fig 4 the estimated concentrations solid line fitted well with the theoretical concentrations in aqueous phase measured with hplc dash line fig 4b the estimated and theoretical concentrations were highly correlated r 2 0 994 with a slope close to 1 k 0 97 confirming the accuracy of the approach fig 4c moreover the pseudo second order model was found to explain the adsorption kinetics effectively r 2 0 999 fig 4d the determined pseudo second order rate constant was 0 14 min g mg 1 and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was 3 25 mg g 1 the great fitness for the pseudo second order model indicates that the rate limited step in the uptakes of bpa onto nylon 66 microplastics was a chemisorption process the adsorption rate depended on the adsorption capacity of the microparticles rather than the concentrations of the organic contaminants meanwhile the concentration of the adsorbed bpa was also estimated fig 4b compared with the theoretical values the amount of adsorbed bpa suffered a slight drop within 5 mg l 1 with the increasing adsorption time this might be resulted from the spatial distribution change of the microplastics as some microplastics were deposited at the cuvette corner or floated on the suspension surface in the long term stirring operation these microplastics coroneted with the adsorbed bpa went out of the light spot detection area thus reducing the estimated amount of bpa in the adsorbed phase as bpa in the aqueous phase was evenly distributed in the supernatant the estimated concentrations would not be interfered which are consistent with the experiment results in addition the adsorption kinetics at a relatively lower concentration bpa in 4 mg l 1 and nylon 66 microplastics in 1 g l 1 were also monitored to evaluate the method s applicability in the environmental concentration range fig s7 the concentrations estimated through the proposed method fitted well with the values measured through hplc r 2 0 860 the reason for the zigzag decline of the kinetic curve in a low concentration system was due to the nonnegligible fluctuating distribution of microplastics in the light spot detection area which negligible in high concentration microplastic system theoretically the concentration limit of the proposed method depends on the detection limit of uv visible spectrophotometer which can be as low as ppb level with organic compounds according to literature passos and saraiva 2019 perkampus et al 2013 besides based on lambert beer s law eq 1 the concentration is inversely proportional to the optical path length by increasing the optical path length which was set to 0 5 cm in the previous experiments the concentration limit would be further reduced further to investigate the potential effect of ph on the accuracy of the method we evaluated the method in a large ph range ph 3 11 on the bpa nylon 66 microplastics system figs s8 and s9 indeed the absorption spectra of the bpa system in an alkaline environment fig s9a were significantly different from those in neutral and acidic environments fig s8a however the uptake kinetics were also accurately estimated with our method in those ph values figs s8b and s9b by calibrating the corresponding standard absorption coefficient spectra figs s8c d and s9c d notably bpa exhibited a slowest adsorption rate onto nylon 66 microplastics in an alkaline environment k 0 007 min g mg 1 and a fastest rate at natural ph k 0 14 min g mg 1 while the equilibrium adsorption capacity decreased with the increasing ph value qe 3 36 mg g 1 at ph 3 0 qe 3 25 mg g 1 at ph 7 0 and qe 3 09 mg g 1 at ph 11 0 to evaluate the generalization ability of our approach in different types of organic and microplastics the real time uptake processes of p np on nylon 66 microparticles figs 5 and s6c d and bpa onto thermoplastic polyurethanes microplastics fig s10 were also monitored in the p np and nylon 66 microparticles system the estimated amount of p np in the aqueous phase fitted well with the theoretical values r 2 0 999 k 0 99 fig 5d the determined pseudo second order rate constant of p np was 0 48 min g mg 1 and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was 0 41 mg g 1 compared with bpa p np exhibited a much smaller adsorption capacity and slower reaction rate on the microplastics notably the absorption intensity decreased at 320 nm while increased at 400 nm after being adsorbed onto the microplastics the degree of protonation of p np could significantly change its absorption characteristics in details the characteristic peaks at 320 nm and 400 nm refer to p np in the protonation and deprotonation states respectively with the transfer of p np from aqueous solution into particle surface the p np molecules transformed from a deprotonation state dominated at neutral ph into a protonation state in the bpa and thermoplastic polyurethanes microplastics system the concentrations of bpa in aqueous phase were also accurately estimated fig s10b using the proposed method by measuring the corresponding absorption coefficient spectra fig s10a the results indicate that the proposed method was also valid for other microplastics with different sizes consequently the developed approach exhibited excellent generalization performance in monitoring the contaminant uptake process on the microplastics 3 3 application for natural water samples the interactions between the contaminants and microplastics include hydrogen bonding π π dipole dipole electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions which are weak in strength and high in environmental relevance liu et al 2019a town and van leeuwen 2020 yu et al 2021 therefore the interactions between organic contaminants and microplastics vary with their surrounding aquatic environment with the developed approach the uptake process of bpa on the microplastics in natural water samples was demonstrated and compared conveniently fig s11 the slope and r 2 between the estimated and theoretical concentrations of bpa in the aqueous phase ranged from 0 92 to 0 99 and 0 994 to 0 998 respectively indicating the robustness of this approach table 1 the equilibrium adsorption capacities of bpa on the microplastics in humic acid and natural water environments were lower than that in ultrapure water this might be caused by the natural water substances that compete for the adsorption sites on the microplastics with bpa the negative correlation between the equilibrium adsorption capacities and toc of natural water samples confirms that the decrease in equilibrium adsorption capacities was attributed to the organic matter in natural water fig 6 a to find out which organic matter had the most significant impact on the equilibrium adsorption capacities the correlations between the equilibrium adsorption capacities and the excitation emission matrix spectra were examined fig 6b and c the equilibrium adsorption capacities were highly correlated with the fluorescent peak at 305 370 nm r 2 0 8 which was attributed to the soluble microbial by product like substances chen et al 2003 indicating that the soluble microbial by product like substances and protein like substances might be the key factor that interfered the equilibrium adsorption capacities of bpa fig 6b the negative correlation between the equilibrium adsorption capacities and the fluorescence intensities of microbial by product like substances and protein like substances confirms that these substances might occupy the adsorption sites on microplastics fig 6c interestingly the correlation coefficients between the equilibrium adsorption capacities and the fluorescent peaks of humic fulvic like substances em 380 nm were close to zero fig 6c this result indicates that humic fulvic like substances in natural water might have little impact on the adsorption process of bpa onto microplastics compared with the rapid occupation of bpa onto the active surface sites on nylon 66 microplastics the binding of humic fulvic like substances occurred much more slowly tang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 thus in the short term adsorption process the early occupied bpa would further prevent humic fulvic like substances from adsorption onto nylon 66 microplastics these results suggest that our approach has a great potential for practical applications in monitoring the organic contaminants uptake by microplastics in this work the method was established based on a uv vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere thus it belonged to molecule electron transition spectroscopy uv vis spectroscopy has been widely used for the identification and quantification of organic contaminates huang et al 2018 li and hur 2017 indeed only chemicals containing unsaturated heteroatoms c c c o no2 conjugated systems or transition metal complexes such as unsaturated hydrocarbons conjugated olefins aromatic hydrocarbons humic substance and amino acids have characteristic uv vis spectral signal because of the existence of π π n π or d d transitions however by improving the light source and extending the detection range to the near infrared region the developed method could also be applied to more types of organic contaminants such as proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids cozzolino 2016 ding et al 2000 pasquini et al 2003 steponavicius et al 2011 weyer et al 1985 zhang et al 2009 moreover molecular vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared or raman spectroscopy is not suitable for investigating the interactions between organic contaminants and microplastics due to the strong spectral interference of aqueous solvents microplastic organic polymer substrate or fluorescent signals therefore the developed method is suitable for the most common organic contaminants in aquatic environments also it possesses great potential for in situ analyzing surface modification on natural or engineered nano micro particles under aqueous suspension conditions 4 conclusions an in situ optical approach was proposed to probe the real time organic contaminant uptake process on suspended microplastics in aquatic environments with a two step strategy the concentrations of organic contaminants in the aqueous and adsorbed phases were accurately and quickly determined simultaneously moreover the weak interaction between the organic contaminants and microplastics could also be revealed through the extracted uv vis absorption coefficient spectra this approach yields new insights into handling the spectra of turbid solutions that don t follow beer lambert s law since this approach is cost effective and easy to handle the uptake of bpa onto nylon 66 microplastics under various natural aquatic environments were effectively monitored and the microbial by product like and protein like substances were found to impact the bpa uptake process on nylon 66 microplastics mostly this approach could potentially find applications in more complex situations such as the release or competitive uptake of various organic contaminants on microplastics or nanoplastics moreover it might be feasible to apply this approach for characterizing the corona formation process on suspended particles both in natural and artificial environments in addition to microplastics such as eco corona formation and

16143,microplastics act as a source of organic contaminants in aquatic environments and thus affect their environmental fate and toxicity because of the weak and reversible interactions between microplastics and organic species the organic coronas vary with their surrounding environments thus in order to evaluate the possible environmental risks of microplastics methods for evaluating the dynamic uptake of organic contaminants onto suspended microplastics in aquatic environments are greatly desired in this work a uv vis spectroscopy based approach was developed for in situ monitoring organic contaminants uptake onto suspended microplastics after correcting the light scattering interference from microplastics suspensions and establishing the nonlinear relationship between concentration and light absorbance of organic species the inverse adding doubling method based on radiative transfer theory was adopted to correct the light scattering effect of suspensions then the resulting mixed absorption spectra were decomposed to calculate the concentrations of the aqueous and adsorbed organic species simultaneously with a nonlinear calibration method the uptake processes of bisphenol a and p nitrophenol onto nylon 66 microparticles were monitored with this approach and confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis the approach was validated by applying it to natural water samples and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was found to be interfered mainly by the protein like substances this approach has high accuracy good reproducibility remarkable universality and ease of handling and also provides a potential tool for characterizing the corona formation process on suspended particles both in natural and artificial environments such as eco corona formation and engineering surface modification on nano micro particles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics contaminants adsorption uv vis spectroscopy in situ nonlinear spectra calibration 1 introduction the weathering of plastics results in the release of billions of microplastics with large surface area to volume ratios and abundant functional surface modifications into the aquatic environment andrady 2011 hendrickson et al 2018 koelmans 2019 vethaak and legler 2021 wright and kelly 2017 making them a potential sink and source of organic contaminants bhagwat et al 2021 kapelewska et al 2021 liu et al 2019b 2019c ogata et al 2009 rochman et al 2013 seeley et al 2020 trevisan et al 2019 velzeboer et al 2014 the environmental fate of the organic pollutants would be significantly changed with the widespread microplastics such as mistaken ingestion by aquatic animals atugoda et al 2021 dong et al 2020a dong et al 2020b li et al 2021a 2021b mato et al 2001 mohamed nor and koelmans 2019 teuten et al 2007 such a trojan horse effect makes the organic corona a potentially hazardous property of microplastics liu et al 2020 menendez pedriza and jaumot 2020 schultz et al 2021 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 therefore investigations into the organic contaminants uptake onto microplastics are of great importance in evaluating their biological toxicity and ecological risks several techniques have been developed to quantify the corona on microplastics in aquatic environments they can be divided into three main categories 1 ex situ quantification through isolation e g centrifugal operation 2 direct measurement of the adsorbed species on microplastics e g quartz crystal microbalance and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy and 3 indirect analysis by size measurements e g dynamic light scattering harms et al 2012 heskett et al 2012 junaid and wang 2021 mudunkotuwa et al 2014 pino et al 2014 shang and nienhaus 2017 xiao et al 2020 however the inherent restrictions limit their practical applications alexy et al 2020 fornstedt 2010 mudunkotuwa et al 2014 for instance concentration and separation pretreatment operations like centrifuging and washing might destroy the weak attachment of the surface corona on microplastics lai et al 2021 moreover the time consuming procedures are incompetent for real time monitoring of contaminant uptake heskett et al 2012 atr ftir and quartz crystal microbalance are commonly and enable directly quantify the adsorption kinetics by measuring the light absorption or mass change on the liquid solid interface harms et al 2012 mudunkotuwa et al 2014 however a lab made polymer film is required to represent the microplastics in measurement thus the representativeness of the processes under suspension conditions is questionable scattering based techniques such as dynamic light scattering can quantify the contaminant uptake through size measurements junaid and wang 2021 however it is effective only for microplastics with colloidally stable corona and narrow size distribution it is also challenging to capture the size change when the difference of the reflective index between the microplastics and organic corona is not significant or the thicknesses of the coronas are small bhattacharjee 2016 moreover no chemical composition information could be obtained with scattering based methods consequently quantitative approaches of in situ probing the organic contaminant uptake kinetics on suspended microplastics under realistic aquatic environments are largely needed ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy is a conventional technique to quantify organic chemicals in solution by beer lambert s law however two issues should be solved to monitor the organic contaminant uptake onto suspended microplastics first beer lambert s law is ineffective in suspensions due to the light scattering effect numerous empirical and semi empirical light methods have been developed to obtain the pure light absorption portions such as extended multiplicative scatter correction harald martens 2003 geladi et al 1985 and optical path length estimation and correction chen et al 2006 jin et al 2012 the chemometrics methods are built on specific databases and therefore can t work when variations in scattering are significant among those physical based approaches using radiative transfer theory might have the potential to be applied to all types of heterogeneous systems huffman 1983 pickering et al 1993 prahl 1993 2011 secondly after light scattering correction the light absorption of the aqueous organic molecules in the supernatant and the adsorbed organic molecules on microplastics should be decomposed and quantified respectively in previous works the linear decomposition methods were reported for the simultaneous quantification of multiple components steponavicius and thennadil 2009 2011 however the molecules in adsorbed phase don t conform to linear lambert beer s law due to the molecule aggregation effect argudo et al 2021 barnett et al 2015 and interaction between molecules and particles thus calibration is needed in this work a two step uv vis spectroscopic approach was developed to in situ probe the uptake kinetics of organic contaminants onto suspended microplastics in the first step the inverse adding doubling iad method based on radiative transfer theory was adopted to correct the scattering effect of microplastics suspensions then a nonlinear spectra calibration method was established to estimate the concentrations of the aqueous organic molecules in the supernatant and adsorbed molecules on microplastics bisphenol a bpa and p nitrophenol p np were chosen as the target organic pollutants and their uptake by nylon 66 microparticles was monitored to validate the effectiveness of this approach finally the practical application of this approach was evaluated under four types of natural aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bpa and p np were purchased from aladdin co china polyamide microparticles 70 30 μm in diameter fig s1a and thermoplastic polyurethanes microplastics 150 20 μm in diameter fig s1b were purchased from sinopec maoming petrochemical co china silica nanosphere 200 nm in diameter was bought from tianjin baseline chromtech research centre china humic acid was purchased from sigma aldrich all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification 2 2 measurement setup total transmittance and reflectance spectra were acquired using a scanning spectrophotometer lambda 650 s perkinelmer inc usa equipped with a 60 mm integrating sphere the spectral data of bpa were collected at the wavelength range from 250 to 325 nm 250 to 500 nm for p np at a 1 nm interval with an integration time of 0 2 s the suspension samples were placed in a 5 mm path length cuvette made of quartz glass for spectra measurement a homemade stirring device was used to prevent the microparticles from settling down in the suspension during spectra collection fig s2 2 3 extraction of optical absorption properties with iad method radiative transfer theory describes the wave propagation through a medium characterized by a random distribution of absorbers and scatters huffman 1983 steponavicius and thennadil 2009 total transmittance spectra total reflectance spectra were obtained for decoupling of absorption coefficient spectra μ a and scattering coefficient spectra μ s through inverting the radiative transport equation which for a specific wavelength λ is giving by 1 d i r s λ d s μ t λ i r s λ μ s λ 4 π 4 π p s s λ i r s λ d ω 2 μ t λ μ a λ μ s λ where i r s λ is the light intensity at a distance r from the light source along with the directional vector s μ t λ cm 1 is the total extinction coefficient p s s λ is the phase function and ω is the solid angle particularly μ t λ is the sum of absorption coefficient μ a λ and the scattering coefficient μ s λ the iad method was applied for the inversion of the radiative transport equation prahl 2011 in brief the iad program worked by iterating an adding doubling solution which was generated and numerical of the radiative transport equation until the estimated values of the reflection and transmission matched the measured ones the refractive index of the sample was set to equal to the refractive index of water 1 33 and the value of g was fixed to 0 9 according to the literature hu et al 2020 other parameters needed for the iad program are listed in table s1 the obtained absorption coefficient spectra were then processed by baseline correction for further concentrations estimation 2 4 estimation of aqueous and adsorbed substances beer lambert s law which relates the light absorption to the concentrations of the materials is given by 3 μ a b l λ 2 3 ε λ c where μ a b l λ is the absorption coefficient corresponded with beer lambert s law ε λ is the molar absorbance coefficient however since the law fails to maintain the linear relationship at a high concentration of absorption species the high concentration of adsorbed molecules on the particle s surface cannot be quantified with their light absorbance using beer lambert s law therefore the relationship between absorbance and concentration is expressed as 4 μ a λ f λ c where f λ is a nonlinear function since the relationship between concentration and absorbance at each wavelength is different f λ should be determined at each wavelength fortunately we found that the actual absorbance and the absorbance estimated with beer lambert s law share the same relationship at each wavelength thus combining eqs 3 and 4 generates the following relationship 5 μ a f λ μ a b l λ ε λ f μ a b l where f is a monotone nonlinear function independent to the wavelength there are two absorption species in an organic microplastics adsorption sample molecules in the aqueous phase with a low concentration in the supernatant and adsorbed molecules on the surface of particles since their contributions to the light absorption are independent guo et al 2019 mudunkotuwa et al 2014 sit et al 2020 the absorbance of the sample is the sum of their absorbance i e μ a s a m p l e μ a p a r t i c l e μ a s u p e r n a t a n t μ a p a r t i c l e is given by 6 μ a p a r t i c l e f μ a a d s o r b e d μ a a q u e o u s where μ a a d s o r b e d ε a d s o r b e d c a d s o r b e d and μ a q u e o u s ε a q u e o u s c a q u e o u s ε a d s o r b e d was estimated with a low concentration of molecules the relationship between absorbance and concentration of molecules in the aqueous phase maintains a linear relationship since μ a a q u e o u s ε a q u e o u s 1 r c a q u e o u s the absorbance of the sample can be expressed as 7 μ a f ε a d s o r b e d r c a d s o r b e d ε a q u e o u s r c a q u e o u s ε a q u e o u s 1 r c a q u e o u s where r is estimated with the volume ratio of the particle and the sample when the particles are precipitated since eq 7 is applicable to all wavelengths we can solve the concentrations of molecules in the adsorbed and aqueous phases 2 5 experimental design a set of suspended samples consisting of sio2 nanospheres 12 5 and 25 mg l 1 a commonly used pure scattering material and bpa 30 mg l 1 were used to validate the scattering correction efficiency of the iad method the total transmittance spectra were collected to compare with the absorption coefficient spectra inversed from the total reflectance spectra and collimated transmitted spectra the calibration curves of the absorption coefficient spectra of bpa p np in the aqueous and adsorbed phases were constructed described in detail in supporting information three parallel samples consisting of bpa in the aqueous phase 13 mg l 1 bpa in adsorbed phase 27 mg l 1 and nylon 66 microplastics 10 45 g l 1 were measured to verify the approach the uptake kinetics of bpa 40 mg l 1 and p np 10 mg l 1 on nylon 66 microplastics 10 45 g l 1 in ultra pure water was used as models to verify the efficiency for kinetic monitoring at time intervals of 1 min and 2 min within 25 times respectively notably to obtain the kinetic data within an acceptable time a higher concentration of organic contaminants and microplastics were used as models because low concentrations of analyte environment relevant may take hours to days duan et al 2012 sheehan and whitman 2005 also the adsorption kinetics at a relatively lower concentration bpa in 4 mg l 1 and nylon 66 microplastics in 1 g l 1 were monitored to evaluate the method s applicability in the environmental concentration range according to literature dong et al 2020a qian et al 2021 wang et al 2016 xie et al 2020 yao et al 2020 yin and shang 2020 further the uptake kinetics of bpa 40 mg l 1 on nylon 66 microplastics 10 45 g l 1 in alkaline ph 11 0 adjusted with 0 1 mol l 1 potassium hydroxide and acidic ph 3 0 adjusted with 0 1 mol l 1 perchloric acid aquatic environments were monitored to verify the practicability of our method at various ph values moreover the uptake kinetics of bpa 40 mg l 1 onto thermoplastic polyurethanes microplastics 5 2 g l 1 with an average diameter around 150 μm fig s1b in ultra pure water were also evaluated to verify the robustness of our method for different types of microplastics for practical applications the uptake kinetics of bpa on nylon 66 microplastics was monitored in a humic acid simulated sample 5 mg toc l 1 and three natural water samples collected from yanjing lake chaohu lake and nanfei river hefei china 2 6 computational calculations the bpa and nylon 66 monomer mpa were selected to investigate the interaction mechanism between bpa and microplastics the structure of bpa was firstly optimized then two bpa and one mpa molecule were constructed to simulate the interactions and final optimized structures were obtained density functional theory dft calculations were performed in materials studio the geometric optimization mulliken charge distribution and molecular orbital energy of free bpa and bpa bpa mpa complex were conducted with dmol3 module delley 1990 2000 the generalized gradient approximation with perdew burke ernzerhof functional was used to describe the exchange correlation energy perdew et al 1996 the convergence of energy and force for structure relaxation were set to 1 0 10 5 hartree and 2 10 3 hartree å for all molecules the van der waals interactions were introduced with tkatchenko scheffler method tkatchenko and scheffler 2009 the solvation effects of water were also taken into account using conductor like screening model solvation method klamt and schüürmann 1993 york and karplus 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the method the iad method is a powerful tool to correct the scattering effect in a heterogeneous system for concentration estimation of absorption species in suspensions prahl 1993 2011 steponavicius and thennadil 2009 2011 thus it was used to extract the light absorption coefficient spectra of the suspensions and its effectiveness was validated with a suspension system consisting of bpa and sio2 nanospheres commonly used pure scattering materials the light extinction intensity increased with the rising concentration of sio2 nanospheres due to the scattering effect raised by sio2 nanospheres leading to the overestimation of bpa concentration fig 1 a after correcting the light scattering effect through the total transmittance and total reflectance spectra with the iad method the estimated absorption coefficient spectra of the suspension in different amounts of sio2 nanospheres kept the same fig 1b two light absorption species molecules in the aqueous phase and the adsorbed phase contributed to the extracted absorption coefficient spectra of the suspension the absorption spectrum of the aqueous molecules was significantly different from that of the adsorbed ones fig s3 the characteristic peak of bpa molecules in aqueous phase at 273 nm red shifted and widened when adsorbed on nylon 66 microplastics dft calculation shows that the phenolic groups of bpa interacted with mpa mainly through hydrogen bonding fig s4 as for the charge transfer process all the atomic mulliken charges table s2 together with the atomic corresponding coordinates text s1 were provided before interaction both bpa and mpa were almost neutral however after forming the bpa bpa mpa complex the total charge density was redistributed again and the atoms with the largest charge differences in mpa and bpa were c1 and c101 0 068 and 0 080 e in table s2 belonging to the atoms without directly bonding with other molecules furthermore through separating the charge density to different moieties we found that compared with the almost neutral molecules for both free bpa and mpa before interaction the bpa moieties held a negative charge 0 154 and 0 061 e while the mpa moiety held a positive charge 0 211 e table s3 suggesting the electron transfer from mpa to bpa such an interaction might lead to the band structure alteration therefore the homo and lumo energy of the molecules before and after complexation was determined fig s4 compared with free bpa the band gap between homo and lumo energy of the bpa mpa complex decreased from 3 89 to 3 73 ev the decrease of the band gap facilitates the electron transition between various energy levels and consequently results in a red shift of uv vis absorption spectra which is coincident with the experimental results however due to the strong basal signal raised by nylon 66 microplastics the interaction between bpa and nylon 66 microplastics was undetectable in raman or fourier transform infrared spectra fig s5 the second step aimed to decompose the extracted absorption coefficient spectra of the suspension based on the spectra difference between the molecules in aqueous and adsorbed phases followed by quantifying the concentration of the solutes in both phases the absorption coefficient of bpa in aqueous phase complied well with beer lambert s law fig s3a thus the concentration normalized spectrum of bpa in 50 mg l 1 could be used as the standard absorption spectrum of bpa in aqueous phase fig 2 a nevertheless the absorption coefficient of bpa in the adsorbed phase was nonlinear with concentration fig s3b due to the aggregation of bpa molecules on the surface of microplastics therefore a nonlinear calibration of the spectra for the adsorbed bpa is needed fortunately the relationship between the experimentally measured and estimated absorption spectra through beer lambert s law at different wavelengths follow the same nonlinear function fig 2c by using the locally weighted linear regression the theoretical absorption spectra of the absorbed bpa can be estimated without expression function f in eq 5 after calibration a linear decomposition was used to estimate the bpa concentrations in aqueous and adsorbed phases the spectrum of 4 7 mg l 1 adsorbed bpa was used as the standard absorption spectrum of the adsorbed bpa at such a low concentration the nonlinear effect might be negligible fig 2b with this approach the concentrations of bpa in the aqueous phase and total concentration of bpa were estimated and matched well with the theoretical values measured with high performance liquid chromatography hplc through particle isolation suggesting the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed approach fig 3 3 2 monitoring the adsorption process with the continually measured total transmittance spectra and total reflectance spectra fig s6a and b the real time uptake process of bpa onto nylon 66 microparticles was monitored with the above approach fig 4 the estimated concentrations solid line fitted well with the theoretical concentrations in aqueous phase measured with hplc dash line fig 4b the estimated and theoretical concentrations were highly correlated r 2 0 994 with a slope close to 1 k 0 97 confirming the accuracy of the approach fig 4c moreover the pseudo second order model was found to explain the adsorption kinetics effectively r 2 0 999 fig 4d the determined pseudo second order rate constant was 0 14 min g mg 1 and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was 3 25 mg g 1 the great fitness for the pseudo second order model indicates that the rate limited step in the uptakes of bpa onto nylon 66 microplastics was a chemisorption process the adsorption rate depended on the adsorption capacity of the microparticles rather than the concentrations of the organic contaminants meanwhile the concentration of the adsorbed bpa was also estimated fig 4b compared with the theoretical values the amount of adsorbed bpa suffered a slight drop within 5 mg l 1 with the increasing adsorption time this might be resulted from the spatial distribution change of the microplastics as some microplastics were deposited at the cuvette corner or floated on the suspension surface in the long term stirring operation these microplastics coroneted with the adsorbed bpa went out of the light spot detection area thus reducing the estimated amount of bpa in the adsorbed phase as bpa in the aqueous phase was evenly distributed in the supernatant the estimated concentrations would not be interfered which are consistent with the experiment results in addition the adsorption kinetics at a relatively lower concentration bpa in 4 mg l 1 and nylon 66 microplastics in 1 g l 1 were also monitored to evaluate the method s applicability in the environmental concentration range fig s7 the concentrations estimated through the proposed method fitted well with the values measured through hplc r 2 0 860 the reason for the zigzag decline of the kinetic curve in a low concentration system was due to the nonnegligible fluctuating distribution of microplastics in the light spot detection area which negligible in high concentration microplastic system theoretically the concentration limit of the proposed method depends on the detection limit of uv visible spectrophotometer which can be as low as ppb level with organic compounds according to literature passos and saraiva 2019 perkampus et al 2013 besides based on lambert beer s law eq 1 the concentration is inversely proportional to the optical path length by increasing the optical path length which was set to 0 5 cm in the previous experiments the concentration limit would be further reduced further to investigate the potential effect of ph on the accuracy of the method we evaluated the method in a large ph range ph 3 11 on the bpa nylon 66 microplastics system figs s8 and s9 indeed the absorption spectra of the bpa system in an alkaline environment fig s9a were significantly different from those in neutral and acidic environments fig s8a however the uptake kinetics were also accurately estimated with our method in those ph values figs s8b and s9b by calibrating the corresponding standard absorption coefficient spectra figs s8c d and s9c d notably bpa exhibited a slowest adsorption rate onto nylon 66 microplastics in an alkaline environment k 0 007 min g mg 1 and a fastest rate at natural ph k 0 14 min g mg 1 while the equilibrium adsorption capacity decreased with the increasing ph value qe 3 36 mg g 1 at ph 3 0 qe 3 25 mg g 1 at ph 7 0 and qe 3 09 mg g 1 at ph 11 0 to evaluate the generalization ability of our approach in different types of organic and microplastics the real time uptake processes of p np on nylon 66 microparticles figs 5 and s6c d and bpa onto thermoplastic polyurethanes microplastics fig s10 were also monitored in the p np and nylon 66 microparticles system the estimated amount of p np in the aqueous phase fitted well with the theoretical values r 2 0 999 k 0 99 fig 5d the determined pseudo second order rate constant of p np was 0 48 min g mg 1 and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was 0 41 mg g 1 compared with bpa p np exhibited a much smaller adsorption capacity and slower reaction rate on the microplastics notably the absorption intensity decreased at 320 nm while increased at 400 nm after being adsorbed onto the microplastics the degree of protonation of p np could significantly change its absorption characteristics in details the characteristic peaks at 320 nm and 400 nm refer to p np in the protonation and deprotonation states respectively with the transfer of p np from aqueous solution into particle surface the p np molecules transformed from a deprotonation state dominated at neutral ph into a protonation state in the bpa and thermoplastic polyurethanes microplastics system the concentrations of bpa in aqueous phase were also accurately estimated fig s10b using the proposed method by measuring the corresponding absorption coefficient spectra fig s10a the results indicate that the proposed method was also valid for other microplastics with different sizes consequently the developed approach exhibited excellent generalization performance in monitoring the contaminant uptake process on the microplastics 3 3 application for natural water samples the interactions between the contaminants and microplastics include hydrogen bonding π π dipole dipole electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions which are weak in strength and high in environmental relevance liu et al 2019a town and van leeuwen 2020 yu et al 2021 therefore the interactions between organic contaminants and microplastics vary with their surrounding aquatic environment with the developed approach the uptake process of bpa on the microplastics in natural water samples was demonstrated and compared conveniently fig s11 the slope and r 2 between the estimated and theoretical concentrations of bpa in the aqueous phase ranged from 0 92 to 0 99 and 0 994 to 0 998 respectively indicating the robustness of this approach table 1 the equilibrium adsorption capacities of bpa on the microplastics in humic acid and natural water environments were lower than that in ultrapure water this might be caused by the natural water substances that compete for the adsorption sites on the microplastics with bpa the negative correlation between the equilibrium adsorption capacities and toc of natural water samples confirms that the decrease in equilibrium adsorption capacities was attributed to the organic matter in natural water fig 6 a to find out which organic matter had the most significant impact on the equilibrium adsorption capacities the correlations between the equilibrium adsorption capacities and the excitation emission matrix spectra were examined fig 6b and c the equilibrium adsorption capacities were highly correlated with the fluorescent peak at 305 370 nm r 2 0 8 which was attributed to the soluble microbial by product like substances chen et al 2003 indicating that the soluble microbial by product like substances and protein like substances might be the key factor that interfered the equilibrium adsorption capacities of bpa fig 6b the negative correlation between the equilibrium adsorption capacities and the fluorescence intensities of microbial by product like substances and protein like substances confirms that these substances might occupy the adsorption sites on microplastics fig 6c interestingly the correlation coefficients between the equilibrium adsorption capacities and the fluorescent peaks of humic fulvic like substances em 380 nm were close to zero fig 6c this result indicates that humic fulvic like substances in natural water might have little impact on the adsorption process of bpa onto microplastics compared with the rapid occupation of bpa onto the active surface sites on nylon 66 microplastics the binding of humic fulvic like substances occurred much more slowly tang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 thus in the short term adsorption process the early occupied bpa would further prevent humic fulvic like substances from adsorption onto nylon 66 microplastics these results suggest that our approach has a great potential for practical applications in monitoring the organic contaminants uptake by microplastics in this work the method was established based on a uv vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere thus it belonged to molecule electron transition spectroscopy uv vis spectroscopy has been widely used for the identification and quantification of organic contaminates huang et al 2018 li and hur 2017 indeed only chemicals containing unsaturated heteroatoms c c c o no2 conjugated systems or transition metal complexes such as unsaturated hydrocarbons conjugated olefins aromatic hydrocarbons humic substance and amino acids have characteristic uv vis spectral signal because of the existence of π π n π or d d transitions however by improving the light source and extending the detection range to the near infrared region the developed method could also be applied to more types of organic contaminants such as proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids cozzolino 2016 ding et al 2000 pasquini et al 2003 steponavicius et al 2011 weyer et al 1985 zhang et al 2009 moreover molecular vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared or raman spectroscopy is not suitable for investigating the interactions between organic contaminants and microplastics due to the strong spectral interference of aqueous solvents microplastic organic polymer substrate or fluorescent signals therefore the developed method is suitable for the most common organic contaminants in aquatic environments also it possesses great potential for in situ analyzing surface modification on natural or engineered nano micro particles under aqueous suspension conditions 4 conclusions an in situ optical approach was proposed to probe the real time organic contaminant uptake process on suspended microplastics in aquatic environments with a two step strategy the concentrations of organic contaminants in the aqueous and adsorbed phases were accurately and quickly determined simultaneously moreover the weak interaction between the organic contaminants and microplastics could also be revealed through the extracted uv vis absorption coefficient spectra this approach yields new insights into handling the spectra of turbid solutions that don t follow beer lambert s law since this approach is cost effective and easy to handle the uptake of bpa onto nylon 66 microplastics under various natural aquatic environments were effectively monitored and the microbial by product like and protein like substances were found to impact the bpa uptake process on nylon 66 microplastics mostly this approach could potentially find applications in more complex situations such as the release or competitive uptake of various organic contaminants on microplastics or nanoplastics moreover it might be feasible to apply this approach for characterizing the corona formation process on suspended particles both in natural and artificial environments in addition to microplastics such as eco corona formation and engineering surface modification on nano micro particles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

sars cov 2 rna fragments in 24 h composite samples was determined by using the ultrafiltration method followed by nucleic acid extraction and cdc n2 rt qpcr assay sars cov 2 rna signals at each wwtp were compared over time to the numbers of confirmed covid 19 cases 14 day case incidence rate in the sewer network area over the 10 month surveillance period with an extensive total number of samples the detection rate of sars cov 2 rna in ww was 79 including 6 uncertain results i e amplified only in one out of four two original and two ten fold diluted replicates while only 24 of all samples exhibited gene copy numbers above the quantification limit the range of the sars cov 2 detection rate in ww varied from 33 including 10 uncertain results in pietarsaari to 100 in espoo only six out of 693 ww samples were positive with sars cov 2 rna when the reported covid 19 case number from the preceding 14 days was zero overall the 14 day covid 19 incidence was 7 0 18 and 36 cases per 100 000 persons within the sewer network area when the probability to detect sars cov 2 rna in wastewater samples was 50 75 and 95 respectively the quantification of sars cov 2 rna required significantly more covid 19 cases the quantification rate was 50 75 and 95 when the 14 day incidence was 110 152 and 223 covid 19 cases respectively per 100 000 persons multiple linear regression confirmed the relationship between the covid 19 incidence and the sars cov 2 rna quantified in ww at 15 out of 28 wwtps overall r2 0 36 p 0 001 at four of the 13 wwtps where a significant relationship was not found the sars cov 2 rna remained below the quantification limit during the whole study period in the five other wwtps the sewer coverage was less than 80 of the total population in the area and thus the covid 19 cases may have been inhabitants from the areas not covered based on the results obtained ww based surveillance of sars cov 2 could be used as an indicator for local and national covid 19

2017 lorenzo and picó 2019 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 recently wbe has been reported as a quick sensitive and cost effective approach for monitoring the prevalence trend and circulation of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemics at the population level medema et al 2020a hart and halden 2020 ahmed et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 hillary et al 2021

to complement the clinical individual testing surveillance approach ahmed et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 who 2020 sherchan et al 2020 hokajärvi et al 2021 sometimes wbe data can be more reliable than clinical data as the clinical diagnostic capacity is limited mostly to population having symptoms or with a recent travel history wu et al 2020a further clinical data can be biased depending on various factors such as differences in patient testing strategies and sometimes the unwillingness of people to be tested in that respect the wbe approach is more unbiased as it accounts for the viral

environmental standpoint the fate and decay of sars cov 2 in sewer networks and transit after sampling before analysis are not fully known hart and halden 2020 kitajima et al 2020 further runoff waters and industrial ww might dilute sars cov 2 quantities and therefore various normalization procedures of sars cov 2 copy numbers in ww are used most often in the form of flow rate and population size normalization but microbial indicators of human fecal loads have also been proposed medema et al 2020a medema et al 2020b green et al 2020 overall a better understanding of the relationship between community covid 19 incidence and sars cov 2 gc in ww is needed for further development of the wbe approach herein this study compared a 10 month august 2020 to may 2021 longitudinal monitoring

following the standard biosafety precautions for handling untreated ww as previously described hokajärvi et al 2021 samples were collected from 28 wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig s1 tables 1 and

finland usually have separate drainage for runoff waters but also combined sewers still exist especially in older city centrums the estimated share of runoff waters precipitation melting snow and groundwater leaking in the sewage network ranged from 5 to 45 a clear high peak of wastewater inflow was observed during the time of snow melting april 2021 and another peak in the mean flow rate was seen in november 2020 related to the increased runoffs in the sewerage network areas of the largest cities in finland fig s2 the measurement of the total suspended solids tss was available for a total

100 000 inhabitants was 29 000 m3 day during the 24 hour composite sampling events a fraction 1 liter of samples were transported in cool boxes as soon as possible to the water microbiology laboratory of the finnish institute for health and welfare thl kuopio finland for analysis as soon as the sample arrived at the laboratory the arrival time and temperature were recorded and the samples were stored at 4 c and mostly analyzed within 24 48 hours the mean ww temperature was higher than 15 c after transit to the laboratory in august 2020 and a part of the samples also exceeded this temperature limit in september and october 2020 fig s5 the arrival temperature was mostly below 15 c from november 2020 to may 2021 the time in transit varied between one and two days depending on the location table 1 the time in transit was longer than two days only for nine out of 693 samples 2 2 determination of sars cov 2 rna fragments in the wastewater samples wastewater samples were analyzed as previously described hokajärvi et al 2021 in brief the ultrafiltration method medema et al 2020b was used with the exception that 10 kda centricon plus 70 centrifugal filters were used for 70 ml

not calculated crassphage results were composed of arithmetic mean values of the two dilutions and reported as gene copy numbers per 100 ml of ww sample the presence of inhibition was reported as a factor decreasing the reliability of the result if the difference in ct values was more than two in the mengovirus assay between the nucleic acid templates from a sample and a negative process control in 63 of the samples tested 433 samples out of 684 the presence of inhibitors was noted as the inhibition was prevalent in ww nucleic acids based on the mengovirus control no samples were excluded from the data due to the inhibition however for n2 assay both un diluted and 10 fold diluted and for crassphage 10 and 100 fold diluted nucleic acids were used overcome the potential inhibitory

light microscope daily during the six days of culture after that as a second passage an aliquot of each cell culture supernatant was inoculated on fresh cells the same way as described earlier a volume of 100 μl of the supernatant samples was collected daily for rna extraction in addition one ww sample was collected on 12 april 2021 during the peak of the epidemic from helsinki wwtp and was used fresh to test the virus infectivity in the vero e6 cell culture a 500 ml ww sample was concentrated with dextran polyethylene glycol peg mixture following the standard procedure described in the

19 cases in the wwtps sewer network areas throughout the study period individual covid 19 tests have been available for all symptomatic people in finland clinical laboratories report all detected covid 19 cases to the national infectious disease register nidr detailing the total number of covid 19 tests performed each day per each hospital district in finland the trend of daily reported cases of covid 19 in the study sewer network areas fig s1 during the study period shows increasing and decreasing trends fig 1 for the purposes of comparing the clinical findings with the data produced by environmental monitoring of influent ww the reported new covid 19 cases in each municipality served by the 28 wwtps were extracted from nidr then the case numbers were corrected using a wwtp specific factor corresponding to the share of inhabitants served by the sewer connected to the study wwtps as compared to all inhabitants of the municipalities table s1 this correction of the nidr case numbers was necessary since each wwtp served one or more municipalities and one municipality could have one or more wwtps finally the 14 dms of the covid 19 cases was calculated for each sewer network area based on initial correlation tests using daily 7 day and 14 day moving sums results not shown and an earlier study reporting that infected individuals shed sars cov 2 for about two weeks after the infection in feces cevik et al 2021 to compare with the ww data the 14 day time window s end was set to the day of composite sampling these moving sum covid 19 case numbers were then normalized per 100 000 population and we refer to these numbers as 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate 2 5 data analysis and reporting of the sars cov 2 results throughout the ww based sars cov 2 rna monitoring efforts the outcomes of the wastewater analysis were shared with governmental and local health authorities in finland the ww based sars cov 2 results were manually compared to reported new covid 19 cases within the wwtp sewer network area municipalities in case of any discrepancies between the clinical individual testing and environmental wastewater testing surveillance direct contact by phone or email was made by thl s personnel to the communicable disease doctor in charge of the corresponding hospital district sars cov 2 copy numbers of n2 assay were normalized with the influent flow at the sampled wwtp over each 24 h composite sampling event further the numbers of inhabitants in the wwtp area were taken into consideration in presenting the sars cov 2 rna copy numbers published weekly on thl s website https www thl fi episeuranta jatevesi jatevesiseuranta viikkoraportti html normalization for n2 assay copy numbers was done by flow correction multiplying gene copies per m3 with 24 hours inflow of a wwtp m3 and then dividing the results by the population served at that wwtp for crassphage based normalization n2 assay copy numbers were calculated by dividing the n2 copy number per 100 ml by the crassphage copy number per 100 ml of wastewater from all wwtp s samples during the period from 1 november 2020 to 31 may 2021 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using ibm spss statistics 27 and r r core team 2019 figure illustrations were made using originpro version 2017 originlab corporation northampton ma usa statistical tests were considered statistically significant when the p value was 0 05 for comparing sars cov 2 rna in ww influent to the 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate the 693 samples in total were converted into categorical interval data as follows a at first all the data tables were re arranged based on ascending order of covid 19 incidence b then all samples with zero incidence cases were grouped into one category c then categorical groups with 20 incidence case from lower to higher were categorized per group and d out of 20 samples the detection percentage of sars cov 2 rna per each interval was calculated uncertain results were grouped into a detected category for calculating the 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate threshold values for detecting and quantifying sars cov 2 rna with n2 assay in ww influent binary logistic regression analysis was used employing hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit where classification cutoff was 0 5 and maximum iterations 20 by using the quantitative sars cov 2 results in ww linear regression analysis with multiple explaining variables for 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was conducted in the preliminary data analysis for determining the most significant factor covid 19 incidence in the sewer network area the number of customers per wwtp wastewater influent inflow volume sample collection month and the sample temperature after transport all had a strong positive correlation data not shown therefore by avoiding the multicollinearity effect we included only flow corrected sars cov 2 gc day 100 000 persons temperature of the sample at arrival in the laboratory and number of days delay during sample transportation as explaining variables in the multiple linear regression analysis in models for individual wwtps groups of large and small wwtps and all samples from 28 wwtps pooled together 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was used as the dependent variable to include uncertain and detected results below loq to models 25 of loq copy numbers for uncertain results and 50 for detected results were given and then normalized as described above flow corrected copy numbers were replaced to linear models described above with copy numbers normalized against the sample crassphage content to test crassphage gc as a normalization method the kruskal wallis test was used for determining the effect of population size of sewer network areas on sars cov 2 detection in ww and 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate and sample transportation delays on the sars cov 2 detection frequency in the influent wastewaters of wwtps the detection frequency between n2 and e sarbeco assays was compared with cross tabulation followed by a chi square test by pooling samples from all wwtps 3 results 3 1 national detection and quantification thresholds the relationship between the 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate and the ww based sars cov 2 detection and quantification rates was examined at the national level in finland from an extensive number of wastewater samples n 693 table 2 covid 19 incidence in the sewer network areas gradually increased the sars cov 2 detection rate until reaching 100 in ww influent samples table 2 figs 2 and s7 based on the logistic regression analysis table s5 the 14 day covid 19 incidence was 7 0 18 and 36 cases per 100 000 persons within the sewer network area when the probability to detect sars cov 2 rna in wastewater samples was 50 75 and 95 respectively fig 3 the quantification rate of sars cov 2 rna increased almost constantly as the covid 19 incidence increased in the sewer network area but did not reach 100 during the study period table 2 figs 2 and s7 in fact as compared to the sars cov 2 detection rate in ww the quantification of sars cov 2 required significantly more covid 19 cases the quantification rate was 50 75 and 95 when the 14 day incidence was 110 152 and 223 covid 19 cases respectively per 100 000 persons fig 3 and table s6 during the 10 months of the study period a national view with ww data originating from 28 wwtps is provided with ascending and descending phases of the covid 19 incidence in the country however the incidence trend variations between the first three months ascending phase the middle four months plateau phase and the last three months descending phase displayed only minor changes in the ww based detection and quantification rates fig 2 and table s6 during the study period the covid 19 incidence trend gradually increased from august 2020 when the mean se 14 dms per 100 000 persons was 4 5 0 7 until december when the 14 dms was 102 9 15 7 decreased slightly in january 2021 14 dms was 79 4 6 6 increased gradually and reached the highest mean 14 dms in march 172 0 19 4 and then decreased gradually by the end of the study period may 2021 when 14 dms was 63 2 8 0 per 100 000 population fig 1 and table s7 consistent with covid 19 trends the sars cov 2 detection rate varied being 38 in august and 91 in december reaching its peak at 95 in february and dropping to 90 in march and 71 in may table s7 similarly the ww influent flowrate normalized sars cov 2 rna copy number mean se changed according to covid 19 incidence

detection and quantification in wastewater at each wwtp sars cov 2 rna was detected in 79 including 6 uncertain out of a total of 693 samples analyzed with n2 assay table 3 among them only 24 of the total samples had a copy numbers above the loq with a clear difference in the quantification rates between the large 33 and small 12 wwtps the sars cov 2 rna detection rate varied in wwtps located in different cities following the covid 19 incidence table 3 the highest detection rates 95 or higher of sars cov 2 in ww were recorded in helsinki espoo and turku where the mean covid 19 incidence rates per 100 000 persons exceeded 100 but also in jyväskylä and hämeenlinna where the mean covid 19 incidence was around 60 in all these locations sars cov 2 was quantifiable in at least 35 of the ww samples analyzed however cities with a small population namely vihti and salo exhibited the highest mean sars cov 2 rna copy numbers in ww 7 72 0 23 and 7 89 0 40 log10 gc day person respectively at the other extreme the ww based sars cov 2 gc never exceeded the loq and the median values of covid 19 incidence were always less than 30 per 100 000 persons 14 dms in wwtps of pori joensuu rovaniemi seinäjoki and kemi where the sars cov 2 detection rates in ww were 57 76 71 57 and 33 respectively at 13 wwtps where the median of 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was 8 9 66 5 per 100 000 population the sars cov 2 rna detection rate in ww was quite high up to 95 while the quantification rate remained less than 20 linear regression was conducted to determine whether the number of customers or ww influent inflow volumes of wwtp sample temperature after transport to the laboratory sample collection month or delay in sample processing can affect the relationship between the sars cov 2 rna in ww and the covid 19 incidence of these three factors sars cov 2 rna copy numbers in ww sample temperature upon arrival at the laboratory and sample processing delay collectively accounted for a 36 variation in overall covid 19 incidence table 3 sars cov 2 copy numbers in ww was the only significant factor determining covid 19 incidence alone sample temperature upon arrival at the laboratory did not affect the model outcome at any of the wwtps the effect of transportation delay was significant only at oulu wwtp table 3 the regression model indicated a significant relationship between the ww based sars cov 2 copy numbers and the covid 19 incidence in total at 15 out of 28 wwtps table 3 at four out of the thirteen wwtps where a significant relationship was not found the sars cov 2 rna remained below the quantification limit during the whole study period in the other five wwtps the sewer coverage was less than 80 of the total population in the area and thus the covid 19 cases may have been inhabitants from the areas not covered in general larger cities had higher mean covid 19 incidence rates and sars cov 2 detection and quantification rates and mean copy numbers in wastewater p 0 001 and thus the linear regression were in better agreement in the group of large cities than small cities table 3 trends in reported new covid 19 cases varied in the sewer network areas of the 28 wwtps fig 4 a g the national capital region helsinki and espoo and the third largest city and maritime gateway from sweden turku were constantly the major hotspots for covid 19 these hotspots and other neighboring cities hämeenlinna lahti and vihti had two major waves of covid 19 during the surveillance period the first wave in november december 2020 and the main wave in march april 2021 fig 4a and b in other locations namely the cities of salo rauma maarianhamina kokkola savonlinna and lappeenranta there was a one time covid 19 peak in march april 2021 fig 4c f the north western coastal cities of vaasa pietarsaari rovaniemi and kemi had a one time peak in october november 2020 fig 4c e and g 3 3 sars cov 2 viability and methodological aspects in wastewater the cell culturing attempts for the selected ww samples indicated that the sars cov 2 target was non infectious in the samples analyzed further the ww based sars cov 2 rna assay target was found to significantly affect the surveillance outcomes out of the total of 386 samples analyzed using both n2 and e sarbeco assays the detection rate with n2 assay was significantly higher than with e sarbeco assay χ 2 1 183 4 p 0 0001 all except four samples that were positive for sars cov 2 with e sarbeco assay were also positive with n2 assay notably 14 of samples proven to contain sars cov 2 with n2 assay were assigned as false negative with e sarbeco assay table s8 even though spearman s correlation coefficient ρ between the detection of sars cov 2 rna with n2 assay and e sarbeco assays was 0 676 p 0 0001 sars cov 2 rna was consistently more frequently detected with n2 assay than with e sarbeco assay throughout all sampling months due to the lower sensitivity of the e sarbeco assay it was no longer used after january 2021 for the national ww based surveillance the multiple linear regression analysis conducted indicated that crassphage is an insufficient normalization method for wbe since significant relationship between 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate and crassphage corrected sars cov 2 gc numbers in ww was found only for two out 28 wwtps table s9 the corresponding relationship when using flow corrected sars cov 2 numbers was found in total at 15 out of 28 wwtps table 3 however crassphage assay seemed to provide useful results in the ultrafiltration method

study reports the surveillance results of sars cov 2 rna analyzed from 28 wwtps in finland between august 2020 to may 2021 by using cell culture based viability assays for selected samples the study also provides further evidence that sars cov 2 coronaviruses do not pose a waterborne transmission risk as they remain non infectious in community wastewater influents as stated by others rimoldi et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 ahmed et al 2021c tiwari et al 2021 presumably wastewater collection transport and preprocessing steps decrease the virus viability in comparison to fresh human excreta by analyzing a total of 693 ww samples we found that ww based detection of sars cov 2 from multiple locations is an effective measure for tracing national trends in covid 19 by using the ultrafiltration method and n2 rt qpcr assay the relative quantification of sars cov 2 numbers was possible at 50 probability when the covid 19 incidence rate in the sewer network area exceeded 152 cases per 100 000 persons the sars cov 2 detection reached 50 probability already when the preceding 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was about seven cases per 100 000 however this numerical relationship can be affected by factors such as clinical testing strategies i e lack of clinical testing capacity or no testing carried out for mild infections the proportion of asymptomatic carriers and changes in sars cov 2 excretion patterns due to the introduction of new virus variants or increase in vaccination coverage bivins and bibby 2021 notably the ww based sars cov 2 rna quantitation is an independent surveillance method and both wastewater rna results and confirmed covid 19 case numbers might fail to reflect the true number of infections in a population further the higher sensitivity of n2 assay than e sarbeco assay in our hands and some contradictory results reported earlier in relation to n2 assay performance ahmed et al 2021a gerrity et al 2021 highlights the need for special attention during the selection of rt qpcr assay for sars cov 2 determinations from ww the covid 19 trend was highly variable between the sewer network areas throughout the country with the large cities helsinki espoo and turku having the most influence on the national trends of covid 19 incidence these large cities were consistently the nation s pandemic hotspots which is not surprising as these cities are the major financial tourist and education hubs and gateways to the country from abroad overall the detection trend of sars cov 2 rna in ww had a strong relationship with reported new covid 19 cases in the sewer network area and showed good agreement with earlier studies wang et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 the monitoring of sars cov 2 rna in ww captured both trends and peaks of covid 19 incidences both at local and national levels the ww based sars cov 2 surveillance data often followed the same sequence sars cov 2 was first detected as an uncertain observation then detected but below loq quantities and finally quantified after a further increase in covid 19 incidence illustrating the simultaneous spread of covid 19 cases in individual testing among the inhabitants of the studied sewer network areas although traces of sars cov 2 in ww might remain below the limit of detection lod or at least below the limit of quantification loq of the method ahmed et al 2020 2021b the data presented herein demonstrates a clear connection between the change in covid 19 incidence noted in the individual testing and the presence and quantity of sars cov 2 rna in ww in communities where covid 19 infection rates are low rna is less likely to be quantified in ww and the reporting systems need to function with the available binary results sars cov 2 detected non detected in such cases the use of poisson distribution based binary logistic regression can be a useful tool for interpreting wbe results in our study the sole reliance on the quantified sars cov 2 gc ww results would have caused a loss of most of our results 76 in the wwtps of five cities pori joensuu rovaniemi seinäjoki and kemi where 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was always less than 27 sars cov 2 rna was not quantified in any of the studied ww samples indeed some earlier studies have also reported a poor correlation between covid 19 incidence with sars cov 2 rna copies mainly during periods of low covid 19 incidence hillary et al 2021 ahmed et al 2021a in our study only six out of 693 ww samples were positive with sars cov 2 rna when the reported 14 day covid 19 case incidence was zero while the detection of sars cov 2 rna in ww influent infers there being at least one person with covid 19 shedding sars cov 2 into the ww in the sewer network area the nidr collects the individual test positivity results based on the municipality of residence however due to the pandemic and the recommendation not to travel the movement of people between municipalities could have been during the study period lower than usual further although individual covid 19 tests were available for all symptomatic people in finland over the study duration not everyone is willing to be tested and the infected person can also be asymptomatic pre symptomatic or post symptomatic conversely the non detection of sars cov 2 rna in ww influents does not guarantee the absence of infected people in the sewer network area the possible reasons for non detection in ww can be due to a an absence of infected people b the virus load is below the ww method lod or c the periodic flow of the virus with limited numbers of infected people has not been captured during the period of sample collection further the mixing with other ww flows stormwater infiltration the diurnal variation in shedding and hydraulic residence time in the sewer collection system can also affect the probability of detection of sars cov 2 rna particularly in low prevalence conditions ahmed et al 2020 hillary et al 2021 indeed during peaking influent flow events containing runoff waters the influent composition may change in a way that the sars cov 2 quantities are diluted in the samples this is a challenge when only marginally low sars cov 2 numbers are present and runoff waters could cause false negative ww based sars cov 2 results due to the dilution effect the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 rna in different ww samples and various wwtps may be affected also by the variation in physical and chemical characteristics of the wastewater for example the differential amounts of pcr inhibiting substances between the sampling events may cause variation on the results in the present study the share of ww samples with the observation of pcr inhibition based on the internal mengovirus inhibition control was remarkably high being about 63 and this could have affected both sars cov 2 detection rate and gene copy numbers in the analyzed wastewater samples the increased inflow could alter the concentrations of nutrients total nitrogen total phosphorus and ammonium nitrate the content of tss and fecal material measured e g as crassphage gene copy numbers and biological and chemical oxygen demand in the wastewater samples in the data presented herein the tss content was slightly higher in samples with sars cov 2 detection than in samples where sars cov 2 was not detected an observation congruent to earlier studies that have reported the tendency of enveloped viruses like sars cov 2 to attach in the solid fraction of wastewater d aoust et al 2021 wolfe et al 2021 kitajima et al 2020 the work presented in this paper is a proof of concept that poisson distribution based binary logistic regression can be particularly useful for wbe in situation when most results are below the method quantification limit in fact one major finding of our study is that a relatively high number of confirmed covid 19 cases is needed prior sars cov 2 can be properly quantified from the wastewater matrix however the relationship between sars cov 2 detection rate in wastewater and covid 19 clinical cases might have considerable variation over time and between sewerage network areas 5 conclusions this study shows a clear relationship between 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate in sewer network areas and the detection and quantification rate of sars cov 2 rna in ww influent samples of respective wwtps the 14 day covid 19 case incidence of 7 0 per 100 000 persons yielded about 50 probability of detecting sars cov 2 from wastewater samples and a 95 wastewater detection rate was reached when the covid 19 incidence was about 40 cases per 100 000 persons a much higher 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was required to quantify than to detect sars cov 2 from the wastewater samples 50 and 95 probability to quantify sars cov 2 in wastewater was achieved when the 14 day covid 19 case incidence was 110 and 220 per 100 000 persons respectively this finding supports the use of binary detected not detected results of sars cov 2 rna monitoring as a basis of ww based surveillance results reporting during periods of low covid 19 incidence this study did not find infectious sars cov 2 particles in ww samples data availability this work is part of that carried out by the national covid 19 task force at the finnish institute for health and welfare thl the

16144,wastewater based surveillance is a cost effective concept for monitoring covid 19 pandemics at a population level here sars cov 2 rna was monitored from a total of 693 wastewater ww influent samples from 28 wastewater treatment plants wwtp n 21 42 samples per wwtp in finland from august 2020 to may 2021 covering ww of ca 3 3 million inhabitants 60 of the finnish population quantity of sars cov 2 rna fragments in 24 h composite samples was determined by using the ultrafiltration method followed by nucleic acid extraction and cdc n2 rt qpcr assay sars cov 2 rna signals at each wwtp were compared over time to the numbers of confirmed covid 19 cases 14 day case incidence rate in the sewer network area over the 10 month surveillance period with an extensive total number of samples the detection rate of sars cov 2 rna in ww was 79 including 6 uncertain results i e amplified only in one out of four two original and two ten fold diluted replicates while only 24 of all samples exhibited gene copy numbers above the quantification limit the range of the sars cov 2 detection rate in ww varied from 33 including 10 uncertain results in pietarsaari to 100 in espoo only six out of 693 ww samples were positive with sars cov 2 rna when the reported covid 19 case number from the preceding 14 days was zero overall the 14 day covid 19 incidence was 7 0 18 and 36 cases per 100 000 persons within the sewer network area when the probability to detect sars cov 2 rna in wastewater samples was 50 75 and 95 respectively the quantification of sars cov 2 rna required significantly more covid 19 cases the quantification rate was 50 75 and 95 when the 14 day incidence was 110 152 and 223 covid 19 cases respectively per 100 000 persons multiple linear regression confirmed the relationship between the covid 19 incidence and the sars cov 2 rna quantified in ww at 15 out of 28 wwtps overall r2 0 36 p 0 001 at four of the 13 wwtps where a significant relationship was not found the sars cov 2 rna remained below the quantification limit during the whole study period in the five other wwtps the sewer coverage was less than 80 of the total population in the area and thus the covid 19 cases may have been inhabitants from the areas not covered based on the results obtained ww based surveillance of sars cov 2 could be used as an indicator for local and national covid 19 incidence trends importantly the determination of sars cov 2 rna fragments from ww is a powerful and non invasive public health surveillance measure independent of possible changes in the clinical testing strategies or in the willingness of individuals to be tested for covid 19 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords community sewage coronavirus national surveillance rt qpcr assay wastewater based epidemiology 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been used in areas with centralized sewage network systems for evaluating the circulation of etiological agents of communicable diseases such as hepatitis c virus poliovirus and antibiotic resistant bacteria consumption patterns of illegal drugs nicotine alcohol and pharmaceuticals in communities gracia lor et al 2017 lorenzo and picó 2019 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 recently wbe has been reported as a quick sensitive and cost effective approach for monitoring the prevalence trend and circulation of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemics at the population level medema et al 2020a hart and halden 2020 ahmed et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 hillary et al 2021 rusiñol et al 2021 lundy et al 2021 and as an early warning tool medema et al 2020a wu et al 2020a ahmed et al 2021a during the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 2021 the wbe approach has been used worldwide to complement the clinical individual testing surveillance approach ahmed et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 who 2020 sherchan et al 2020 hokajärvi et al 2021 sometimes wbe data can be more reliable than clinical data as the clinical diagnostic capacity is limited mostly to population having symptoms or with a recent travel history wu et al 2020a further clinical data can be biased depending on various factors such as differences in patient testing strategies and sometimes the unwillingness of people to be tested in that respect the wbe approach is more unbiased as it accounts for the viral load of all infected i e symptomatic asymptomatic pre symptomatic and post symptomatic people within the sewer network area wu et al 2020b cevik et al 2021 wölfel et al 2020 the wbe approach to monitoring covid 19 is an area of rapid development and thus all the factors defining the minimum threshold number of new covid 19 cases within a sewer network area for detecting sars cov 2 in the wastewater ww influent are not clear one of the necessary considerations from the clinical standpoint is the variability in shedding quantities viral load and secretion routes feces urine cough sneeze and sputum of infected individuals from where virus particles end up in the sewage systems wölfel et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b cevik et al 2021 crank et al 2022 from the environmental standpoint the fate and decay of sars cov 2 in sewer networks and transit after sampling before analysis are not fully known hart and halden 2020 kitajima et al 2020 further runoff waters and industrial ww might dilute sars cov 2 quantities and therefore various normalization procedures of sars cov 2 copy numbers in ww are used most often in the form of flow rate and population size normalization but microbial indicators of human fecal loads have also been proposed medema et al 2020a medema et al 2020b green et al 2020 overall a better understanding of the relationship between community covid 19 incidence and sars cov 2 gc in ww is needed for further development of the wbe approach herein this study compared a 10 month august 2020 to may 2021 longitudinal monitoring of sars cov 2 rna in ww influent samples analyzed from 28 wwtps in finland with a 14 day incidence rate 14 day moving sum 14 dms of confirmed covid 19 cases in the respective communities the minimum number of covid 19 cases needed in the respective communities for detecting and quantifying sars cov 2 rna in ww influent samples in finland was determined and the potential of wbe to catch the local and national covid 19 incidence trends was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sample collection between 3 august 2020 and 31 may 2021 a total of 693 influent ww samples were collected following the standard biosafety precautions for handling untreated ww as previously described hokajärvi et al 2021 samples were collected from 28 wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig s1 tables 1 and s1 serving about 3 3 million inhabitants this is about 60 of the total population of finland the wastewater inflow rates varied between wwtps and seasonal variations were also seen fig s2 based on spearman correlation analysis influent flow m3 day during the sampling events had a significant relationship with biological oxygen demand bod r 0 42 p 0 001 chemical oxygen demand cod r 0 52 p 0 001 total suspended solids content tss r 0 42 p 0 001 and concentrations of total nitrogen ntotal r 0 64 p 0 001 and total phosphorus ptotal r 0 66 p 0 001 in the wastewater samples sewerage systems in finland usually have separate drainage for runoff waters but also combined sewers still exist especially in older city centrums the estimated share of runoff waters precipitation melting snow and groundwater leaking in the sewage network ranged from 5 to 45 a clear high peak of wastewater inflow was observed during the time of snow melting april 2021 and another peak in the mean flow rate was seen in november 2020 related to the increased runoffs in the sewerage network areas of the largest cities in finland fig s2 the measurement of the total suspended solids tss was available for a total of 353 samples table 1 wastewater samples from jyväskylä mikkeli kajaani and vihti exhibited the highest mean values of tss fig s4 population coverage between the participating wwtps varied from 860 000 inhabitants in helsinki to 18 000 in vihti causing variability between wwtps in the mean influent flow during the sampling events tables 1 s1 and fig s3 the mean ww influent inflow normalized per 100 000 inhabitants was 29 000 m3 day during the 24 hour composite sampling events a fraction 1 liter of samples were transported in cool boxes as soon as possible to the water microbiology laboratory of the finnish institute for health and welfare thl kuopio finland for analysis as soon as the sample arrived at the laboratory the arrival time and temperature were recorded and the samples were stored at 4 c and mostly analyzed within 24 48 hours the mean ww temperature was higher than 15 c after transit to the laboratory in august 2020 and a part of the samples also exceeded this temperature limit in september and october 2020 fig s5 the arrival temperature was mostly below 15 c from november 2020 to may 2021 the time in transit varied between one and two days depending on the location table 1 the time in transit was longer than two days only for nine out of 693 samples 2 2 determination of sars cov 2 rna fragments in the wastewater samples wastewater samples were analyzed as previously described hokajärvi et al 2021 in brief the ultrafiltration method medema et al 2020b was used with the exception that 10 kda centricon plus 70 centrifugal filters were used for 70 ml pre centrifugated supernatants with a concentration time of 25 minutes in 3 000 g producing 200 µl 1 600 µl of concentrate mengovirus and crassphage were used as an internal process controls pintó et al 2009 stachler et al 2017 sterile deionized water was used as negative process control for nucleic acid extraction from 300 μl of the concentrate and from 300 µl ww without ultrafiltration a chemagic viral300 dna rna extraction kit was used with the chemagic 360d instrument perkin elmer germany to verify the extraction performance each extraction set included a positive swab sample 300 µl of 1 500 diluted ct approximately 29 after dilution nasopharyngeal swab from a covid 19 positive patient dissolved into pbs and inactivated at 60 c for 90 min and a negative extraction control 300 µl sterile deionized water all rt qpcr and qpcr assays were performed using quantstudio 6 flex real time pcr system applied biosystems thermofisher scientific in addition to the negative ultrafiltration and nucleic acid extraction process controls all runs included at least one reaction with molecular grade water instead of nucleic acid no template control ntc rt qpcr assay targeting nucleocapsid n protein gene of sars cov 2 was used n2 assay lu et al 2020 and tables s2 s4 for samples taken between august 2020 and the end of january 2021 also a beta coronavirus assay to detect the envelope e protein gene was used e sarbeco assay corman et al 2020 and tables s2 s4 the reactions and the target quantification were carried out as described earlier hokajärvi et al 2021 by using taqman fast virus 1 step master mix applied biosystems thermofisher scientific non diluted and 10 fold diluted fractions of the extracted nucleic acid of each ww sample were analyzed in duplicates mengovirus internal process control results to estimate the recovery efficiency and rt qpcr inhibition were produced following the principles of international standard iso ts 15216 1 2013 pintó et al 2009 and tables s2 s4 to characterize the fecal content of ww samples and further evaluation of the recovery efficiency of ultrafiltration the cross assembly phage crassphage copy numbers were enumerated before and after ultrafiltration using a qpcr assay stachler et al 2017 fig s6 and tables s1 s4 the total reaction volume of 25 μl in crassphage assay contained 5 μl of nucleic acid template primers in a final concentration of 0 4 µm probe at concentration of 0 08 µm and 12 5 µl of environmental master mix 2 0 applied biosystems thermofisher scientific single 10 and 100 fold dilutions of nucleic acid templates were used for qpcr analysis the quantification of crassphage was performed using a synthetic gene fragment containing primer annealing sites integrated dna technologies belgium with eight standard points106 100 gc µl per reaction by using quantstudio real time pcr system software applied biosystems thermofisher scientific the reaction was considered successfully amplified when the ct value was below 40 with a threshold in n2 0 1 e sarbeco 0 2 mengovirus 0 04 and crassphage 0 05 the sars cov 2 results n2 assay were interpreted using four categories as follows non detected when all out of four reactions two undiluted and two 10 fold diluted nucleic acids as a template did not have any amplification i e ct 40 uncertain one out of four reactions two undiluted and two 10 fold diluted nucleic acids as a template had amplification with ct 40 but was not confirmed in repeated rt qpcr analysis one undiluted and one 10 fold diluted nucleic acids as a template detected when more than one rt qpcr reaction was positive in the n2 assay but copy numbers were below the limit of quantification loq 50 gc per reaction detected and quantified copy number of sars cov 2 target per 100 ml ww sample was calculated when the target was detected and the copy number exceeded the loq e sarbeco assay results were interpreted in the same categories as n2 assay except copy numbers were not calculated crassphage results were composed of arithmetic mean values of the two dilutions and reported as gene copy numbers per 100 ml of ww sample the presence of inhibition was reported as a factor decreasing the reliability of the result if the difference in ct values was more than two in the mengovirus assay between the nucleic acid templates from a sample and a negative process control in 63 of the samples tested 433 samples out of 684 the presence of inhibitors was noted as the inhibition was prevalent in ww nucleic acids based on the mengovirus control no samples were excluded from the data due to the inhibition however for n2 assay both un diluted and 10 fold diluted and for crassphage 10 and 100 fold diluted nucleic acids were used overcome the potential inhibitory effects in generating the results 2 3 cell cultures to determine the viability of sars cov 2 in the wastewater samples to determine the viability of sars cov 2 in the ww samples using vero e6 cell cultures one ww influent sample collected at 10 11 may 2020 from wwtp in helsinki and five ww influent samples collected at 18 19 october 2020 from wwtps in helsinki espoo vaasa jyväskylä and kouvola were used centricon concentrates were stored at 20 c with penicillin streptomycin gentamycin antibiotics final concentration100 iu ml 500 µg ml each prior to analysis a centricon concentrate 3 0 ml equivalent to 84 ml sample volume obtained from the may 2020 sample was used sars cov 2 rna copy number 11 000 gc 100 ml n2 assay vero e6 cell lines were cultivated in minimum essential medium mem with 2 fetal bovine serum fbs penicillin and streptomycin and were incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 for 7 days the concentrate was inoculated in five vero e6 cell culture flasks 0 5 ml concentrate 4 5 ml mem flask after the seventh day the supernatant was filtered and aliquots of 1 0 ml cell culture supernatant was inoculated on two fresh cell flasks for the second passage as described above to determine the viability of the virus each day the flasks were examined under the light microscope and 250 µl supernatant was collected for rna extraction the sars cov 2 rna copy numbers of the october 2020 concentrates n2 assay were ca 3 900 gc 100 ml helsinki 6 600 gc 100 ml espoo 20 000 gc 100 ml vaasa 35 000 gc 100 ml jyväskylä and 6 200 gc 100 ml kouvola concentrate volumes of 0 4 ml equivalent to 40 ml sample volume were used for cell cultures the samples were filtrated 0 22 µm pore size before inoculated on vero e6 cells growing in 25 cm2 cell culture flasks for 1h at 37 c and 5 ml of fresh culture medium eagle minimal essential medium eagle mem sigma aldrich supplemented with 2 fetal bovine serum sigma aldrich was added for incubation the cytopathic effect was monitored under a light microscope daily during the six days of culture after that as a second passage an aliquot of each cell culture supernatant was inoculated on fresh cells the same way as described earlier a volume of 100 μl of the supernatant samples was collected daily for rna extraction in addition one ww sample was collected on 12 april 2021 during the peak of the epidemic from helsinki wwtp and was used fresh to test the virus infectivity in the vero e6 cell culture a 500 ml ww sample was concentrated with dextran polyethylene glycol peg mixture following the standard procedure described in the polio laboratory manual hovi et al 2001 both the original and concentrated samples were further filtrated using 0 22 µm pore size membrane filters and incubated with penicillin streptomycin gentamycin antibiotics for 15 min at rt aliquots of the both samples 100 µl of the concentrate equivalent to 3 3 ml of the original ww sample were diluted in 1 1 with the culture medium supplemented with 2 fetal bovine serum sigma aldrich and inoculated in five replicates on the vero e6 cells growing in 2 cm2 cell culture wells 24 well plate for 1h at 37 c after which 500 µl of fresh media was added on the cells the cytopathic effect was monitored under a light microscope daily during the three days of culture after the third day as a second passage an aliquot of each cell culture supernatant was inoculated on fresh cells the same way as described earlier a finnish sars cov 2 isolate hcov 19 finland 3 2020 gisaid number epi isl 2365908 was used as a positive control a volume of 100 µl aliquot of the supernatant samples was collected for rna extraction on day 0 and day 3 from both passages the detection of sars cov 2 rna in the cell culture aliquots was done as described earlier jiang et al 2021 briefly the rna extraction was done with rneasy mini kit qiagen and detection of sars cov 2 was done by using rt qpcr assay targeting the e gene corman et al 2020 2 4 recording of the new covid 19 cases in the wwtps sewer network areas throughout the study period individual covid 19 tests have been available for all symptomatic people in finland clinical laboratories report all detected covid 19 cases to the national infectious disease register nidr detailing the total number of covid 19 tests performed each day per each hospital district in finland the trend of daily reported cases of covid 19 in the study sewer network areas fig s1 during the study period shows increasing and decreasing trends fig 1 for the purposes of comparing the clinical findings with the data produced by environmental monitoring of influent ww the reported new covid 19 cases in each municipality served by the 28 wwtps were extracted from nidr then the case numbers were corrected using a wwtp specific factor corresponding to the share of inhabitants served by the sewer connected to the study wwtps as compared to all inhabitants of the municipalities table s1 this correction of the nidr case numbers was necessary since each wwtp served one or more municipalities and one municipality could have one or more wwtps finally the 14 dms of the covid 19 cases was calculated for each sewer network area based on initial correlation tests using daily 7 day and 14 day moving sums results not shown and an earlier study reporting that infected individuals shed sars cov 2 for about two weeks after the infection in feces cevik et al 2021 to compare with the ww data the 14 day time window s end was set to the day of composite sampling these moving sum covid 19 case numbers were then normalized per 100 000 population and we refer to these numbers as 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate 2 5 data analysis and reporting of the sars cov 2 results throughout the ww based sars cov 2 rna monitoring efforts the outcomes of the wastewater analysis were shared with governmental and local health authorities in finland the ww based sars cov 2 results were manually compared to reported new covid 19 cases within the wwtp sewer network area municipalities in case of any discrepancies between the clinical individual testing and environmental wastewater testing surveillance direct contact by phone or email was made by thl s personnel to the communicable disease doctor in charge of the corresponding hospital district sars cov 2 copy numbers of n2 assay were normalized with the influent flow at the sampled wwtp over each 24 h composite sampling event further the numbers of inhabitants in the wwtp area were taken into consideration in presenting the sars cov 2 rna copy numbers published weekly on thl s website https www thl fi episeuranta jatevesi jatevesiseuranta viikkoraportti html normalization for n2 assay copy numbers was done by flow correction multiplying gene copies per m3 with 24 hours inflow of a wwtp m3 and then dividing the results by the population served at that wwtp for crassphage based normalization n2 assay copy numbers were calculated by dividing the n2 copy number per 100 ml by the crassphage copy number per 100 ml of wastewater from all wwtp s samples during the period from 1 november 2020 to 31 may 2021 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using ibm spss statistics 27 and r r core team 2019 figure illustrations were made using originpro version 2017 originlab corporation northampton ma usa statistical tests were considered statistically significant when the p value was 0 05 for comparing sars cov 2 rna in ww influent to the 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate the 693 samples in total were converted into categorical interval data as follows a at first all the data tables were re arranged based on ascending order of covid 19 incidence b then all samples with zero incidence cases were grouped into one category c then categorical groups with 20 incidence case from lower to higher were categorized per group and d out of 20 samples the detection percentage of sars cov 2 rna per each interval was calculated uncertain results were grouped into a detected category for calculating the 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate threshold values for detecting and quantifying sars cov 2 rna with n2 assay in ww influent binary logistic regression analysis was used employing hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit where classification cutoff was 0 5 and maximum iterations 20 by using the quantitative sars cov 2 results in ww linear regression analysis with multiple explaining variables for 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was conducted in the preliminary data analysis for determining the most significant factor covid 19 incidence in the sewer network area the number of customers per wwtp wastewater influent inflow volume sample collection month and the sample temperature after transport all had a strong positive correlation data not shown therefore by avoiding the multicollinearity effect we included only flow corrected sars cov 2 gc day 100 000 persons temperature of the sample at arrival in the laboratory and number of days delay during sample transportation as explaining variables in the multiple linear regression analysis in models for individual wwtps groups of large and small wwtps and all samples from 28 wwtps pooled together 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was used as the dependent variable to include uncertain and detected results below loq to models 25 of loq copy numbers for uncertain results and 50 for detected results were given and then normalized as described above flow corrected copy numbers were replaced to linear models described above with copy numbers normalized against the sample crassphage content to test crassphage gc as a normalization method the kruskal wallis test was used for determining the effect of population size of sewer network areas on sars cov 2 detection in ww and 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate and sample transportation delays on the sars cov 2 detection frequency in the influent wastewaters of wwtps the detection frequency between n2 and e sarbeco assays was compared with cross tabulation followed by a chi square test by pooling samples from all wwtps 3 results 3 1 national detection and quantification thresholds the relationship between the 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate and the ww based sars cov 2 detection and quantification rates was examined at the national level in finland from an extensive number of wastewater samples n 693 table 2 covid 19 incidence in the sewer network areas gradually increased the sars cov 2 detection rate until reaching 100 in ww influent samples table 2 figs 2 and s7 based on the logistic regression analysis table s5 the 14 day covid 19 incidence was 7 0 18 and 36 cases per 100 000 persons within the sewer network area when the probability to detect sars cov 2 rna in wastewater samples was 50 75 and 95 respectively fig 3 the quantification rate of sars cov 2 rna increased almost constantly as the covid 19 incidence increased in the sewer network area but did not reach 100 during the study period table 2 figs 2 and s7 in fact as compared to the sars cov 2 detection rate in ww the quantification of sars cov 2 required significantly more covid 19 cases the quantification rate was 50 75 and 95 when the 14 day incidence was 110 152 and 223 covid 19 cases respectively per 100 000 persons fig 3 and table s6 during the 10 months of the study period a national view with ww data originating from 28 wwtps is provided with ascending and descending phases of the covid 19 incidence in the country however the incidence trend variations between the first three months ascending phase the middle four months plateau phase and the last three months descending phase displayed only minor changes in the ww based detection and quantification rates fig 2 and table s6 during the study period the covid 19 incidence trend gradually increased from august 2020 when the mean se 14 dms per 100 000 persons was 4 5 0 7 until december when the 14 dms was 102 9 15 7 decreased slightly in january 2021 14 dms was 79 4 6 6 increased gradually and reached the highest mean 14 dms in march 172 0 19 4 and then decreased gradually by the end of the study period may 2021 when 14 dms was 63 2 8 0 per 100 000 population fig 1 and table s7 consistent with covid 19 trends the sars cov 2 detection rate varied being 38 in august and 91 in december reaching its peak at 95 in february and dropping to 90 in march and 71 in may table s7 similarly the ww influent flowrate normalized sars cov 2 rna copy number mean se changed according to covid 19 incidence trends 7 00 0 01 in august and 7 15 0 15 in september reaching its peak at 7 58 0 07 in march and decreasing to 7 36 0 10 gc person day in may table s7 3 2 covid 19 incidence determines the sars cov 2 detection and quantification in wastewater at each wwtp sars cov 2 rna was detected in 79 including 6 uncertain out of a total of 693 samples analyzed with n2 assay table 3 among them only 24 of the total samples had a copy numbers above the loq with a clear difference in the quantification rates between the large 33 and small 12 wwtps the sars cov 2 rna detection rate varied in wwtps located in different cities following the covid 19 incidence table 3 the highest detection rates 95 or higher of sars cov 2 in ww were recorded in helsinki espoo and turku where the mean covid 19 incidence rates per 100 000 persons exceeded 100 but also in jyväskylä and hämeenlinna where the mean covid 19 incidence was around 60 in all these locations sars cov 2 was quantifiable in at least 35 of the ww samples analyzed however cities with a small population namely vihti and salo exhibited the highest mean sars cov 2 rna copy numbers in ww 7 72 0 23 and 7 89 0 40 log10 gc day person respectively at the other extreme the ww based sars cov 2 gc never exceeded the loq and the median values of covid 19 incidence were always less than 30 per 100 000 persons 14 dms in wwtps of pori joensuu rovaniemi seinäjoki and kemi where the sars cov 2 detection rates in ww were 57 76 71 57 and 33 respectively at 13 wwtps where the median of 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was 8 9 66 5 per 100 000 population the sars cov 2 rna detection rate in ww was quite high up to 95 while the quantification rate remained less than 20 linear regression was conducted to determine whether the number of customers or ww influent inflow volumes of wwtp sample temperature after transport to the laboratory sample collection month or delay in sample processing can affect the relationship between the sars cov 2 rna in ww and the covid 19 incidence of these three factors sars cov 2 rna copy numbers in ww sample temperature upon arrival at the laboratory and sample processing delay collectively accounted for a 36 variation in overall covid 19 incidence table 3 sars cov 2 copy numbers in ww was the only significant factor determining covid 19 incidence alone sample temperature upon arrival at the laboratory did not affect the model outcome at any of the wwtps the effect of transportation delay was significant only at oulu wwtp table 3 the regression model indicated a significant relationship between the ww based sars cov 2 copy numbers and the covid 19 incidence in total at 15 out of 28 wwtps table 3 at four out of the thirteen wwtps where a significant relationship was not found the sars cov 2 rna remained below the quantification limit during the whole study period in the other five wwtps the sewer coverage was less than 80 of the total population in the area and thus the covid 19 cases may have been inhabitants from the areas not covered in general larger cities had higher mean covid 19 incidence rates and sars cov 2 detection and quantification rates and mean copy numbers in wastewater p 0 001 and thus the linear regression were in better agreement in the group of large cities than small cities table 3 trends in reported new covid 19 cases varied in the sewer network areas of the 28 wwtps fig 4 a g the national capital region helsinki and espoo and the third largest city and maritime gateway from sweden turku were constantly the major hotspots for covid 19 these hotspots and other neighboring cities hämeenlinna lahti and vihti had two major waves of covid 19 during the surveillance period the first wave in november december 2020 and the main wave in march april 2021 fig 4a and b in other locations namely the cities of salo rauma maarianhamina kokkola savonlinna and lappeenranta there was a one time covid 19 peak in march april 2021 fig 4c f the north western coastal cities of vaasa pietarsaari rovaniemi and kemi had a one time peak in october november 2020 fig 4c e and g 3 3 sars cov 2 viability and methodological aspects in wastewater the cell culturing attempts for the selected ww samples indicated that the sars cov 2 target was non infectious in the samples analyzed further the ww based sars cov 2 rna assay target was found to significantly affect the surveillance outcomes out of the total of 386 samples analyzed using both n2 and e sarbeco assays the detection rate with n2 assay was significantly higher than with e sarbeco assay χ 2 1 183 4 p 0 0001 all except four samples that were positive for sars cov 2 with e sarbeco assay were also positive with n2 assay notably 14 of samples proven to contain sars cov 2 with n2 assay were assigned as false negative with e sarbeco assay table s8 even though spearman s correlation coefficient ρ between the detection of sars cov 2 rna with n2 assay and e sarbeco assays was 0 676 p 0 0001 sars cov 2 rna was consistently more frequently detected with n2 assay than with e sarbeco assay throughout all sampling months due to the lower sensitivity of the e sarbeco assay it was no longer used after january 2021 for the national ww based surveillance the multiple linear regression analysis conducted indicated that crassphage is an insufficient normalization method for wbe since significant relationship between 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate and crassphage corrected sars cov 2 gc numbers in ww was found only for two out 28 wwtps table s9 the corresponding relationship when using flow corrected sars cov 2 numbers was found in total at 15 out of 28 wwtps table 3 however crassphage assay seemed to provide useful results in the ultrafiltration method

study reports the surveillance results of sars cov 2 rna analyzed from 28 wwtps in finland between august 2020 to may 2021 by using cell culture based viability assays for selected samples the study also provides further evidence that sars cov 2 coronaviruses do not pose a waterborne transmission risk as they remain non infectious in community wastewater influents as stated by others rimoldi et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 ahmed et al 2021c tiwari et al 2021 presumably wastewater collection transport and preprocessing steps decrease the virus viability in comparison to fresh human excreta by analyzing a total of 693 ww samples we found that ww based detection of sars cov 2 from multiple locations is an effective measure for tracing national trends in covid 19 by using the ultrafiltration method and n2 rt qpcr assay the relative quantification of sars cov 2 numbers was possible at 50 probability when the covid 19 incidence rate in the sewer network area exceeded 152 cases per 100 000 persons the sars cov 2 detection reached 50 probability already when the preceding 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was about seven cases per 100 000 however this numerical relationship can be affected by factors such as clinical testing strategies i e lack of clinical testing capacity or no testing carried out for mild infections the proportion of asymptomatic carriers and changes in sars cov 2 excretion patterns due to the introduction of new virus variants or increase in vaccination coverage bivins and bibby 2021 notably the ww based sars cov 2 rna quantitation is an independent surveillance method and both wastewater rna results and confirmed covid 19 case numbers might fail to reflect the true number of infections in a population further the higher sensitivity of n2 assay than e sarbeco assay in our hands and some contradictory results reported earlier in relation to n2 assay performance ahmed et al 2021a gerrity et al 2021 highlights the need for special attention during the selection of rt qpcr assay for sars cov 2 determinations from ww the covid 19 trend was highly variable between the sewer network areas throughout the country with the large cities helsinki espoo and turku having the most influence on the national trends of covid 19 incidence these large cities were consistently the nation s pandemic hotspots which is not surprising as these cities are the major financial tourist and education hubs and gateways to the country from abroad overall the detection trend of sars cov 2 rna in ww had a strong relationship with reported new covid 19 cases in the sewer network area and showed good agreement with earlier studies wang et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 westhaus et al 2021 the monitoring of sars cov 2 rna in ww captured both trends and peaks of covid 19 incidences both at local and national levels the ww based sars cov 2 surveillance data often followed the same sequence sars cov 2 was first detected as an uncertain observation then detected but below loq quantities and finally quantified after a further increase in covid 19 incidence illustrating the simultaneous spread of covid 19 cases in individual testing among the inhabitants of the studied sewer network areas although traces of sars cov 2 in ww might remain below the limit of detection lod or at least below the limit of quantification loq of the method ahmed et al 2020 2021b the data presented herein demonstrates a clear connection between the change in covid 19 incidence noted in the individual testing and the presence and quantity of sars cov 2 rna in ww in communities where covid 19 infection rates are low rna is less likely to be quantified in ww and the reporting systems need to function with the available binary results sars cov 2 detected non detected in such cases the use of poisson distribution based binary logistic regression can be a useful tool for interpreting wbe results in our study the sole reliance on the quantified sars cov 2 gc ww results would have caused a loss of most of our results 76 in the wwtps of five cities pori joensuu rovaniemi seinäjoki and kemi where 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was always less than 27 sars cov 2 rna was not quantified in any of the studied ww samples indeed some earlier studies have also reported a poor correlation between covid 19 incidence with sars cov 2 rna copies mainly during periods of low covid 19 incidence hillary et al 2021 ahmed et al 2021a in our study only six out of 693 ww samples were positive with sars cov 2 rna when the reported 14 day covid 19 case incidence was zero while the detection of sars cov 2 rna in ww influent infers there being at least one person with covid 19 shedding sars cov 2 into the ww in the sewer network area the nidr collects the individual test positivity results based on the municipality of residence however due to the pandemic and the recommendation not to travel the movement of people between municipalities could have been during the study period lower than usual further although individual covid 19 tests were available for all symptomatic people in finland over the study duration not everyone is willing to be tested and the infected person can also be asymptomatic pre symptomatic or post symptomatic conversely the non detection of sars cov 2 rna in ww influents does not guarantee the absence of infected people in the sewer network area the possible reasons for non detection in ww can be due to a an absence of infected people b the virus load is below the ww method lod or c the periodic flow of the virus with limited numbers of infected people has not been captured during the period of sample collection further the mixing with other ww flows stormwater infiltration the diurnal variation in shedding and hydraulic residence time in the sewer collection system can also affect the probability of detection of sars cov 2 rna particularly in low prevalence conditions ahmed et al 2020 hillary et al 2021 indeed during peaking influent flow events containing runoff waters the influent composition may change in a way that the sars cov 2 quantities are diluted in the samples this is a challenge when only marginally low sars cov 2 numbers are present and runoff waters could cause false negative ww based sars cov 2 results due to the dilution effect the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 rna in different ww samples and various wwtps may be affected also by the variation in physical and chemical characteristics of the wastewater for example the differential amounts of pcr inhibiting substances between the sampling events may cause variation on the results in the present study the share of ww samples with the observation of pcr inhibition based on the internal mengovirus inhibition control was remarkably high being about 63 and this could have affected both sars cov 2 detection rate and gene copy numbers in the analyzed wastewater samples the increased inflow could alter the concentrations of nutrients total nitrogen total phosphorus and ammonium nitrate the content of tss and fecal material measured e g as crassphage gene copy numbers and biological and chemical oxygen demand in the wastewater samples in the data presented herein the tss content was slightly higher in samples with sars cov 2 detection than in samples where sars cov 2 was not detected an observation congruent to earlier studies that have reported the tendency of enveloped viruses like sars cov 2 to attach in the solid fraction of wastewater d aoust et al 2021 wolfe et al 2021 kitajima et al 2020 the work presented in this paper is a proof of concept that poisson distribution based binary logistic regression can be particularly useful for wbe in situation when most results are below the method quantification limit in fact one major finding of our study is that a relatively high number of confirmed covid 19 cases is needed prior sars cov 2 can be properly quantified from the wastewater matrix however the relationship between sars cov 2 detection rate in wastewater and covid 19 clinical cases might have considerable variation over time and between sewerage network areas 5 conclusions this study shows a clear relationship between 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate in sewer network areas and the detection and quantification rate of sars cov 2 rna in ww influent samples of respective wwtps the 14 day covid 19 case incidence of 7 0 per 100 000 persons yielded about 50 probability of detecting sars cov 2 from wastewater samples and a 95 wastewater detection rate was reached when the covid 19 incidence was about 40 cases per 100 000 persons a much higher 14 day covid 19 case incidence rate was required to quantify than to detect sars cov 2 from the wastewater samples 50 and 95 probability to quantify sars cov 2 in wastewater was achieved when the 14 day covid 19 case incidence was 110 and 220 per 100 000 persons respectively this finding supports the use of binary detected not detected results of sars cov 2 rna monitoring as a basis of ww based surveillance results reporting during periods of low covid 19 incidence this study did not find infectious sars cov 2 particles in ww samples data availability this work is part of that carried out by the national covid 19 task force at the finnish institute for health and welfare thl the
