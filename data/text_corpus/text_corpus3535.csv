17675,diversion of food waste fw away from the solid waste stream into the wastewater stream is proved viable through the use of food waste disposers fwds however this may cause unwanted influences on the wastewater treatment system in this context this study has comprehensively evaluated integrated food waste and wastewater management on a city scale for the first time a plant wide cod based transformation model was first established to assess the impacts of the use of fwds on the networks of biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps in hong kong the biological wwtps can remove about 78 of solids and 58 of chemical oxygen demand cod in fw moreover the diversion of fw poses limited impacts on treatment capacity and effluent quality in wwtps with the fwds penetration rate up to 30 the increases in energy consumption and operational cost are highly dependent on the treatment processes and the fwds penetration rates while municipal solid waste treatment can benefit from the diversion of fw this study suggests that upgrading treatment processes e g with less aeration and optimizing the operation of wwtps e g reduce sludge retention time may be required with the use of fwds to achieve an energy efficient and cost effective goal more importantly this study not only provides a methodology for effectively evaluating the impacts of diverting fw into wastewater treatment in hong kong but also facilitates fw management in similar metropolises graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment food waste plant wide modelling food waste disposer solid waste 1 introduction anticipated growth in the human population and living standards have accentuated the importance of the interconnections among food water and energy which consequently impacts the total environment including water soil and air guven et al 2018 mortensen et al 2016 it is thus deemed indispensable to sustainably manage wastewater and municipal solid waste msw to bolster public health resource availability and ecological benefit among the crucial issues food waste fw has drawn increasing attention due to the enormous production and uneconomic treatment xue et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 this is particularly true in that approximately 3600 tonnes of fw are generated each day in hong kong solely relying on landfills as the final disposal means hkepd 2018a landfilling fw not only needs large areas of precious land resources but also eliminates the possibility of economically recycling the valuable resources energy from fw breunig et al 2017 hi√ß et al 2016 on the other hand diversion of fw away from the solid waste stream has proven viable by using food waste disposers fwds which can grind fw discharge the fw slurry into the existing sewer system and treat it in the downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps evans et al 2010 thomas 2011 given the complexity of the wastewater treatment networks in the metropolises such as hong kong whether the use of fwds can be a suitable solution for fw management is still uncertain due to a lack of knowledge on the issue to date many efforts have been devoted to investigating the potential impacts of the fw addition on wwtps from lab scale to large scale battistoni et al 2007 thomas 2011 zan et al 2020b 2019a the consequences of using fwds vary from location to location it was widely reported that the diversion of fw could enhance biogas production from the wwtps by 13 73 iacovidou et al 2012 zan et al 2018 in gagliole italy the use of fwds could reduce the energy consumption of the wwtp by up to 39 battistoni et al 2007 moreover adopting a fwds policy can reduce the overall cost by 28 for solid waste and wastewater management maalouf and el fadel 2017 however concerns have been associated with the use of fwds over the negative impacts on the operation of wwtps and the subsequent sludge treatment in particular the high solid content and chemical oxygen demand cod in fw could increase the burden of the treatment process and enhance sludge production bolzonella et al 2003 iacovidou et al 2012 a trial in new york city suggested that in the long term the use of fwds on a large scale could incur an extra operational cost for expanding capacity and upgrading the treatment process to tackle the additional loading in fw nyepd 1997 sewage sludge production could be enhanced with the use of fwds which not only brings extra burden but also raises the cost for sludge treatment iacovidou et al 2012 maalouf and el fadel 2017 our previous study has confirmed that the addition of fw into sewers of hong kong has more influence on solid and cod in wastewater rather than on nitrogen and phosphorus zan et al 2018 the addition of fw may have unwanted influences on the local wastewater treatment networks in the metropolis in this context a comprehensive evaluation is deemed necessary which has the strong potential to advance knowledge of integrated fw and wastewater management on a city scale in this study integrated fw and wastewater management were comprehensively evaluated through analyzing the local biological wwtps network and local first hand data of fw in hong kong a plant wide cod based transformation model was established to profile the transformation of fw in the biological wwtps the use of fwds at different penetration rates was applied to examine the impacts on wastewater and sludge treatment of the local wwtps energy balance and economic analysis of the use of fwds were assessed on the operation of wwtps sludge treatment and msw management lastly we elucidated the perspectives to provide insights into the feasibility of integrated fw and wastewater management 2 methods and materials 2 1 local data collection local fw data were obtained based on a previous study zan et al 2018 real fw samples were collected for 1 year at a frequency of eight times per month from three different residential communities in hong kong three different residential communities i e yuen long mei foo and tsuen wan were selected based on the income level to cover the potential fwds users the collected fw was ground for roughly 1 min by using fwd evolution 100 insinkerator usa with 1 l tap water flushing 100 g fw zan et al 2018 the fwds effluent was completely mixed for analysis of the chemical oxygen demand cod moreover 1 l of well mixed fwds effluent was settled for 30 min to distinguish the primary effluent i e the supernatants and primary sludge i e the sediments the volumes total solids ts volatile solids vs cod of the primary effluent and primary sludge were measured individually to mimic the settling ability of fw in the primary sedimentation process in biological wwtps based on the results the average data of fw characteristics were used in this study in hong kong there are six wwtps adopting secondary treatment namely sai kung sewage treatment works sk stw stanley sewage treatment works sta stw yuen long sewage treatment works yl stw tai po sewage treatment works tp stw shek wu hui sewage treatment works swh stw and sha tin sewage treatment works st stw hkdsd 2018 these wwtps consist of preliminary treatment screening and grit removal primary treatment primary sedimentation secondary treatment activated sludge process and final sedimentation and sludge treatment anaerobic digestion and sludge dewatering the dewatered sludge is then transported to a sludge treatment facility namely t park for incineration and electricity generation with a daily treatment capacity of 2000 tonne hkepd 2018b the networks of biological wwtps and the sludge treatment facility are shown in fig 1 the basic information of the sewage treatment works is listed in table 1 hkdsd 2018 the characteristics of the wastewater used in this study for the biological wwtps were obtained from a local study wu et al 2016 2 2 estimation of the transformation of food waste in the biological wwtps after the fwds treatment fw is mixed with wastewater in the sewers and transported to the downstream wwtps in this study the degradation of organic compounds from fw in sewers was not considered due to the limited changes in fw characteristics iacovidou et al 2012 zan et al 2020a the conceptual flow chart of integrated fw and wastewater management is illustrated in fig 2 basically the biological wwtps consist of primary treatment secondary treatment activated sludge process and sludge digestion a plant wide cod based transformation model was established based on the steady state of the wwtps ekama 2009 henze et al 2008 in primary treatment the diversion of ts and cod in wastewater and fw was determined with a 30 min settling the impact of ground fw on the settleability is considered negligible in this study in secondary treatment cod is categorized into four parts i e soluble biodegradable part soluble non biodegradable part particulate biodegradable part and particulate non biodegradable part for the conversion of wastewater and fw subsequent to the primary and secondary treatment the anaerobic digestion ad process was applied to recover energy in the form of methane from the produced sludge cano et al 2015 moreover methane was converted into electricity through the combined heat and power chp system in the biological wwtps the digested sludge from the ad system was transported to t park i e sludge incineration facility for waste to energy treatment in hong kong the local fw data obtained from the one year sampling and the characteristics of local wastewater were used as the inputs for the applied plant wide cod based transformation model and energy estimations moreover the plant wide steady state model consists of 15 stoichiometric and kinetic equations with 16 constants which are summarized in tables s1 s2 and s3 of the supplementary information si in this study the errors in the estimations are mainly attributed to the one year food waste sampling in this study the fwds penetration rates from 0 to 80 were used to estimate the impacts of the quantity of the fw diversion from the current solid waste treatment according to the reports in hong kong hkepd 2019 the fw production from households is around 0 32 kg capita day average value from 2015 to 2017 which was used to calculate the household fw discharged into the sewers and treated by the different biological wwtps with different fwds penetration rates 2 3 energy and economic analysis to evaluate the impacts of the use of fwds on the operation of the wwtps the energy and economic analysis was conducted to estimate the energy balance and operational cost with different fwds penetration rates the results acquired from the transformation of fw in the biological wwtps were used to estimate the potential energy consumption generation and economic feasibility of the fwds application this was performed by a desktop scale up study on the networks of the full scale biological wwtps with incineration for sludge treatment the fwds penetration rates increasing from 10 to 80 were selected for energy and economic assessments this involved the energy consumption for aeration pumping mixing supplying and total cost for energy consumption and sludge transportation disposal as details in the si in this study the construction cost of the wwtps was not considered as the main role of the wwtps is for wastewater treatment to assess the impacts on msw treatment an economic analysis was carried out to compare the various scenarios in hong kong there is a waste to energy wte combustion facility under construction and it will be fully commissioned by 2024 thus from the energy recovery and sustainability perspective wte combustion is selected for msw treatment as the important part for sustainable fw management proposed by hkepd hkepd 2017 the analysis of energy and cost on msw treatment was performed by using local msw composition the heating values of msw were first estimated based on the local composition with different fwds penetration rates moreover the msw treatment by the wte combustion was estimated including the collection transportation energy consumption generation table s5 of the si it should be noted that the cost for manpower was not included in the analysis since it is fixed regardless of the msw quantity 2 4 analytical methods measurements of ts and vs of fw in both primary effluent and primary sludge were carried out according to the standard methods apha 2005 total cod was analyzed without filtration whereas soluble cod was determined after filtration through a 0 45 Œºm filter millex hv millipore germany the determination of cod relied on low range cod vials with a detection range of 0 150 mg l and 2 ml of diluted samples with without filtration was added into the vials and then digested with a cod reactor model 4560000 hach usa at 150 c for 2 h the cod values of the digested samples were then measured by spectrophotometry dr 2800 hach usa at 430 nm particulate cod was calculated according to the measured values of total cod and soluble cod 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of food waste in the biological wwtps the transformation of ts and cod from fw was estimated by combining the experimental results and the empirical values figs 3 and s1 in the si due to the high settleability of fw after the fwds treatment around 86 of ts i e 0 19 kg ts kg fw and 55 of cod i e 0 12 kg cod kg fw in fw were removed by the primary sedimentation most of the solids in fw settled out as sludge in the primary treatment this is consistent with the reported results that 70 88 of solids in fwds effluent would be precipitated after 30 min to 2 h of settling thomas 2011 the remaining in the primary effluent was then treated by the biological treatment most of the cod can be converted to biomass 11 and co2 21 for metabolism in the secondary treatment the ts of fw in the primary effluent is removed by the sedimentation while the secondary effluent containing 0 03 kg cod kg fw 13 is generally the soluble non biodegradable cod in the sludge treatment line ad is a versatile technology to stabilize the sludge reduce sludge volume and harvest valuable resources based on the applied model around 0 03 nm3 of methane is generated from 1 kg fw discharged into the sewers fig s1 in the si around 0 28 kw h kg fw of energy is recovered in the form of electricity 0 1 kw h kg fw and heat 648 kj kg fw also the produced digested sludge from 1 kg fw contains 0 05 kg ts and 0 07 kg cod accounting for around 22 of ts and 29 of cod in fw therefore the wwtps can remove around 78 of ts and 58 of cod in fw the majority of ts and cod from fw end up as sludge suggesting that the use of fwds may result in a high burden on the sludge treatment in biological wwtps the cost of sludge treatment and disposal contributes 30 60 of the total annual operational expenditure in wwtps globally zan et al 2019b this indicates a potential increase in the operational cost of wwtps after the use of fwds considering the increased energy recovery potential it is necessary to assess the financial balance between the additional operational cost and the benefits of enhanced energy production 3 2 impacts of the food waste addition on the biological wwtps when the fwds effluent is flushed into the sewer system and mixed with sewage the ratio of the fwds effluent to sewage at different times in one day varies significantly iacovidou et al 2012 kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 to evaluate the mixing of fw with wastewater reliably the average concentration of fw in sewage is used for steady state analysis in hong kong the long term record of daily household fw and sewage production per capita suggests the concentration of fw in sewage is within the range of 0 7 2 g l zan et al 2018 the fwds penetration rate directly determines the amount of household fw discharged into the sewer system so the concentration of fw in sewage can be calculated accordingly for each biological wwtp 3 2 1 primary and secondary treatment changes in the ts and cod of fw wastewater and its respective ratio fw ww in the influent and secondary effluent in different biological wwtps were estimated with the fwds penetration rates at 10 30 50 and 80 fig 4 according to long term monitoring in hong kong wu et al 2016 wastewater as the influent contains around 302 mg ts l and 488 mg cod l with a fwds penetration rate of 10 the concentration in the influent can increase up to 328 mg ts l by 8 7 and 515 mg cod l by 5 5 in yl stw among the six biological wwtps in the secondary effluent cod can be around 63 mg l without the use of fwds whereas cod can increase up to 67 mg cod l by 5 4 at the penetration rate of 10 this suggests 10 of fwds applications in hong kong would not affect the characteristics of raw municipal wastewater however it is evident that the increase in the fwds penetration rate can divert a higher quantity of fw into wastewater cause proportional increases in ts and cod and render substantial influences on wastewater characteristics with a fwds penetration rate of 80 ts and cod in the influent can increase by 44 in st stw 69 in yl stw and 28 in st stw 44 in yl stw indicating a significant increase in pollutant loadings on the biological wwtps in the meantime cod in the secondary effluent can reach to 91 mg l by 44 at the penetration rate of 80 the discharge standard of treated wastewater in hong kong is 80 mg cod l for coastal waters hkdsd 2018 given the similar treatment techniques adopted and the plant wide cod based transformation model applied the differences in ts or cod of the six biological wwtps are mainly attributed to the amounts of fw and wastewater received a similar observation was identified in a pilot plant treating kitchen fw and urban wastewater which the influent contains up to 177 mg ts l and 425 mg cod l from fw and 316 mg ts l and 618 mg cod l from wastewater with the penetration rate of 80 mo√±ino et al 2017 the increased penetration rates from 0 to 80 could deteriorate the removal of solids and cod in the effluent moreover according to the experience of the use of fwds in other areas the highest penetration rate is around 50 in the u s iacovidou et al 2012 in hong kong the use of fwds may lie in the range of 0 30 suggesting an insignificant influence on the secondary effluent quality for a well operated biological wwtp 3 2 2 sludge production the transformation of fw in primary and secondary treatment results in the increasing sludge production due to the settled solid fw and the fw produced biomass the impacts of ts and cod in fw on primary secondary and digested sludge were estimated with different fwds penetration rates figs 5 and s2 in the si with a fwds penetration rate of 10 the increases could be up to 11 for primary sludge 1 9 for secondary sludge and 4 for digested sludge in yl stw the addition of fw in the biological wwtps of hong kong has a much higher influence on the primary sludge production than on secondary and digested sludge production this is because the majority of solid in fw is removed by primary treatment as primary sludge moreover increasing the fwds penetration rate leads to a higher fw to ww ratio on sludge production the increases in primary secondary and digested sludge could be up to 88 15 and 32 respectively with the penetration rate of 80 suggesting a high penetration rate 50 may incur a significant burden on primary sludge treatment in the biological wwtps in the biological wwtps digested sludge is considered as the final product and requires further treatment e g incineration and landfill metcalf and eddy 2003 it was estimated that sludge production from the biological wwtps of hong kong was around 252 tonne day without the addition of fw with dry solid about 30 fig 5 a the use of fwds could result in an increase in total sludge production from 2 6 to 21 at penetration rates from 10 to 80 fig 5a which inevitably produces more sludge for further treatment the use of fwds could result in an additional sludge production of around 6 52 tonne day a previous study reported the use of fwds at the penetration rate of 70 could increase secondary sludge production by 9 7 from 31 to 34 kg day battistoni et al 2007 currently about 1200 tonnes of sludge are produced each day in hong kong which is transported to the sludge incineration facility i e t park with a capacity of 2000 tonne day before final disposal to the landfill hkepd 2018b this indicates that the additional sludge production from the use of fwds may have a limited influence on local sludge treatment capacity however the impacts of the use of fwds were based on the model based evaluation which may change after real application to this end the transformation of fw in the biological wwtps of hong kong needs a long term experiment based evaluation to determine its effects in a clear and definite way 3 3 energy recovery 3 3 1 ad and chp system current methane and electricity generation from wastewater in the biological wwtps of hong kong were estimated at around 15000 nm3 day and 50000 kw h day figs 6 and s3 in the si with 10 30 penetration rates the net increase in methane production would be nearly 1200 to 3600 nm3 day respectively this would lead to the net increase in energy generation of 3900 12000 kw h day of electricity and 26000 78000 mj day of heat through the chp system heat energy could be stored in terms of steam and hot water cano et al 2015 the produced electricity can be used for the on site operation of wwtps or supplied to the public power grid while the generated heat can be recirculated for the ad system at a mesophilic range in winter in hong kong the daily energy demand per household is around 13 3 kw h hkcsd 2019 the daily electricity recovered from the fw could power 290 to 880 households every day when 10 30 of households install the fwds this indicates that the considerable potential of energy recovery from the use of fwds can be achieved through the existing processes in the biological wwtps 3 3 2 sludge incineration in hong kong sewage sludge after dewatering with dry solid about 30 is transported to the incineration facility i e t park for volume reduction and energy harvest the use of fwds with different penetration rates could increase the sludge production in the biological wwtps affecting the sludge incineration around 95 of generated electricity could self sustain the facility whereas the surplus of electricity about 5 can be exported to the public grid hkcsd 2018 woon and lo 2013 fig 6 shows the daily electricity generated from the sludge incineration with different fwds penetration rates generally the use of fwds can improve limited electricity generation the incineration of 252 tonnes of sludge can generate about 32000 kw h of electricity and this increases by 810 2400 kw h when 10 30 of households install fwds this demonstrates an increase from 3 to 8 of electricity can be achieved with the penetration rates from 10 to 30 in this study the digested sludge is considered to mainly contain the non biodegradable matter after secondary treatment and anaerobic digestion this causes the increased electricity strongly correlated with the increased sludge from the use of fwds therefore the use of fwds may not bring an additional burden on the treatment capacity of sludge incineration while energy recovery is minor from the additional sludge production from fw 3 4 energy balance and economic analysis of the use of fwds on the wwtps the impacts of the fwds application have been drawing attention in research application and policy making for decades especially considering the offset on energy consumption and operational cost of wwtps ceced 2003 iacovidou et al 2012 nyepd 1997 in this study it is estimated that the net energy input for the biological wwtps of hong kong is 130000 kw h day while the total operational cost is around 0 24 million hkd day 0 03 million usd day fig 7 with a fwds penetration rate of 10 impacts on energy consumption and operational cost in the wwtps are negligible 1 figs 7 and 8 a there will be increases in energy consumption and operational cost by 10 and 12 respectively in the biological wwtps of hong kong for handling 30 of household fw diverted into the wastewater stream by contrast the use of fwds with the penetration rate up to 80 may incur a demand for energy and operational expenditure by over 50 this indicates that the increasing fwds penetration rate could render a much higher energy consumption and operational cost in the biological wwtps of hong kong in addition sludge incineration in hong kong reuses 95 of generated electricity for the on site operation limiting net energy production and economic return with the use of fwds more energy is consumed though substantial electricity can be harvested the increased energy consumption for the additional loading is mainly ascribed to the power required for aeration in the secondary treatment the adopted biological processes in the wwtps can significantly affect energy consumption mccarty et al 2011 metcalf and eddy 2003 the use of fwds poses a different influence on energy consumption due to the shift of treatment processes such as extended aeration process fixed aerobic anoxic cycles and alternate cycles process in the wwtps battistoni et al 2007 kim et al 2019 this study evaluated the energy consumption from the use of fwds by using the activated sludge process adopted in hong kong hkdsd 2018 although surplus electricity can be generated from the wwtps and sludge incineration with the fw addition the amount is much lower than the energy consumption as a result the increased energy consumption can boost the operational cost of the biological wwtps another reason for the increased operational cost is sludge treatment mainly for sludge transportation and final disposal fig 8 shows the increased operational cost in different biological wwtps and the correlation with the treatment capacity of wwtps the difference between the operational cost and the treatment capacity is negligible with the penetration rate 30 whereas a larger treatment capacity requires a higher operational cost with the penetration rate 50 based on the data in fig 8b we propose to use the empirical equation below to describe the dependency of increased operational cost of the biological wwtps on the treatment capacity and the fwds penetration rate f q i p i c o s t a p i b q i c p i d where f q i p i c o s t is the increased operational cost hkd day q i is the flow rate of the biological wwtp m3 day p i is the fwds penetration rate a b c and d are constant parameters equal to 0 33 hkd m3 0 04 hkd m3 5693 hkd day and 852 hkd day in this study based on the fitting results thereinto constants a and c are related to the increased cost of the use of fwds or the fw addition in wastewater and sludge treatment stream respectively constants b and d are the compensation of the increased cost from the flow rate and fixed part respectively the above empirical equation although adequately describe the relationship between increased operational cost and the treatment capacity and the fwds penetration rate is based on extrapolation of the local data further verifications with different characteristics of wastewater and fw are strongly recommended for the calibration and validation of the empirical equation for analyzing the impacts 3 5 potential implications for municipal solid waste management the use of fwds can divert fw away from the solid waste stream into the wastewater stream thus relieving the burden on msw treatment potential implications were evaluated based on the economic analysis on msw treatment as shown in fig 9 generally the use of fwds could cause a reduction in the quantity of msw thus saving the cost for collection and transportation fig 9a moreover the discharge of household fw into the sewers could increase the heating values of the msw fig s4 the high moisture content of fw in msw could reduce the heating values which inevitably lowers the conversion efficiency of the incineration brunner et al 2002 iqbal et al 2019 furthermore incineration of fw can potentially produce dioxins due to the high moisture of fw lead to air pollution katami et al 2004 kiran et al 2014 the use of fwds reduces the msw quantity for incineration and decreases electricity generation fig 9a the savings in collection and transportation can increase the overall net profit by contrast diverting fw into wastewater stream by using fwds is more cost effective for fw management in hong kong 3 6 perspectives this study has comprehensively evaluated the use of fwds on the networks of the biological wwtps sludge treatment and msw management in hong kong from the aspect of fw conversion energy balance and economic analysis it has demonstrated that the addition of fw may pose a limited influence on the biological wwtps in terms of treatment capacity effluent quality and sludge production this can be attributed to the resilience and redundant capacity of systems treating wastewater and sludge in hong kong however the biological wwtps need to handle extra loadings from the fw addition while the energy recovery from the biological wwtps and sludge incineration is limited compared with the energy consumption this can be attributed to the high energy input of the aeration to remove the organics in the activated sludge process in which it is necessary to apply smart control of aeration to reduce the energy input or adopt anaerobic treatment in the mainstream moreover the sludge retention time srt used in the model is 15 days which reduces the energy recovery potential since the biodegradable organics are either consumed or converted into endogenous residues henze et al 2008 as a result the use of fwds may cause increases in both net energy consumption and net operational cost of the biological wwtps however at the warm wastewater temperature of hong kong 20 c the nitrification denitrification activated sludge srt can be reduced to 4 5 days without compromising effluent quality which significantly decreases energy demand for oxygen consumption and increases methane production from the ad system besides the high rate activated sludge hras process can be an attractive alternative to capture the organic matters in wastewater with a short retention time e g 30 60 min in particular the addition of fw could significantly enhance the formation of organically rich sludge for energy recovery guven et al 2019 on the other hand the use of fwds could be beneficial for msw management the diversion of fw could improve the combustion efficiency of msw for incineration the savings in msw treatment from the diversion of fw can be much higher than the extra operational cost of wwtps there is a potential benefit for the diversion of fw by the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from collection and transportation moreover the diversion of fw would improve the net energy recovery from msw with the improvement in the combustion efficiency of incineration iqbal et al 2019 the fwds penetration rate is key to determining the quantity of fw discharging into the sewer system since it relates to the proportion of households installing fwds currently the penetration rates are around 50 in the us 5 in the u k 10 in canada 12 in australia and 30 in new zealand iacovidou et al 2012 in hong kong the use of fwds is still in its infancy and evaluating its impacts is deemed necessary for policy making this work evaluated the impacts of fwds with the penetration rates of 0 80 by using current local information although it is estimated to have a limited influence on the biological wwtps a trial at a low penetration rate is necessary for preliminary evaluation and further improvement on the sewer system and the biological wwtps besides the fat oil and grease fog contained in fw could be problematic in the sewers and wwtps gross et al 2017 nieuwenhuis et al 2018 the fog deposits may cause blockages in sewers and affect the operation of the wwtps which should not be overlooked with the application of fwds the results of this work suggest that upgrading treatment processes e g anaerobic treatment hras process and optimizing the operation of biological wwtps e g reduce srt smart aeration control may be required to improve the overall energy balance and cost of the wwtps moreover the methodology used in this work is useful and effective to evaluate the diversion of fw into wastewater treatment on a city scale which can be beneficial for the policy making on fw management in different metropolises 4 conclusions this study has evaluated the integrated food waste and wastewater management based on the networks of biological wwtps and sludge treatment in hong kong the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 in the biological wwtps about 78 of ts and 58 of cod in fw can be removed by primary and secondary processes while about 22 of ts and 29 of cod may end up in the digested sludge 2 estimated secondary effluent in the biological wwtps with the fw addition could satisfy the discharge standard in hong kong with the additional sludge production having limited influence on the sludge treatment capacity 3 energy consumption and operational cost in the wwtps are highly dependent on the treatment processes and the penetration rates of fwds while msw management can benefit from the use of fwds and 4 this study provides a methodology for effectively evaluating the impacts of diverting fw into wastewater treatment on a city scale favoring the policy making on fw

fw could enhance biogas production from the wwtps by 13 73 iacovidou et al 2012 zan et al 2018 in gagliole italy the use of fwds could reduce the energy consumption of the wwtp by up to 39 battistoni et al 2007 moreover adopting a fwds policy can reduce the overall cost by 28 for solid waste and wastewater management maalouf and el fadel 2017 however concerns have been associated with the use of fwds over the negative impacts on the operation of wwtps and the subsequent sludge treatment in particular the high solid content and chemical oxygen demand cod in fw could increase the burden of the treatment process and enhance sludge production bolzonella et al 2003 iacovidou et al 2012 a trial in new york city suggested that in the long term the use of fwds on a large scale could incur an extra operational cost for expanding capacity and upgrading the treatment process to tackle the additional loading in fw nyepd 1997 sewage sludge production could be enhanced with the use of fwds which not only brings extra burden but also raises the cost for sludge treatment iacovidou et al 2012 maalouf and el fadel 2017 our previous study has confirmed that the addition of fw into sewers of hong kong has more influence on solid and cod in wastewater rather than on nitrogen and phosphorus zan et al 2018 the addition of fw may have unwanted influences on the local wastewater treatment networks in the metropolis in this context a comprehensive evaluation is deemed necessary which has the strong potential to advance knowledge of integrated fw and wastewater management on a city scale in this study integrated fw and wastewater management were comprehensively evaluated through analyzing the local biological wwtps network and local first hand data of fw in hong kong a plant wide cod based transformation model was established to profile the transformation of fw in the biological wwtps the use of fwds at different penetration rates was applied to examine the impacts on wastewater and sludge treatment of the local wwtps energy balance and economic analysis of the use of fwds were assessed on the operation of wwtps sludge treatment and msw management lastly we elucidated the perspectives to provide insights into the feasibility of integrated fw and wastewater management 2 methods and materials 2 1 local data collection local fw data were obtained based on a previous study zan et al 2018 real fw samples were collected for 1 year at a frequency of eight times per month from three different residential communities in hong kong three different residential communities i e yuen long mei foo and tsuen wan were selected based on the income level to cover the potential fwds users the collected fw was ground for roughly 1 min by using fwd evolution 100 insinkerator usa with 1 l tap water flushing 100 g fw zan et al 2018 the fwds effluent was completely mixed for analysis of the chemical oxygen demand cod moreover 1 l of well mixed fwds effluent was settled for 30 min to distinguish the primary effluent i e the supernatants and primary sludge i e the sediments the volumes total solids ts volatile solids vs cod of the primary effluent and primary sludge were measured individually to mimic the settling ability of fw in the primary sedimentation process in biological wwtps based on the results the average data of fw characteristics were used in this study in hong kong there are six wwtps adopting secondary treatment namely sai kung sewage treatment works sk stw stanley sewage treatment works sta stw yuen long sewage treatment works yl stw tai po sewage treatment works tp stw shek wu hui sewage treatment works swh stw and sha tin sewage treatment works st stw hkdsd 2018 these wwtps consist of preliminary treatment screening and grit removal primary treatment primary sedimentation secondary treatment activated sludge process and final sedimentation and sludge treatment anaerobic digestion and sludge dewatering the dewatered sludge is then transported to a sludge treatment facility namely t park for incineration and electricity generation with a daily treatment capacity of 2000 tonne hkepd 2018b the networks of biological wwtps and the sludge treatment facility are shown in fig 1 the basic information of the sewage treatment works is listed in table 1 hkdsd 2018 the characteristics of the wastewater used in this study for the biological wwtps were obtained from a local study wu et al 2016 2 2 estimation of the transformation of food waste in the biological wwtps after the fwds treatment fw is mixed with wastewater in the sewers and transported to the downstream wwtps in this study the degradation of organic compounds from fw in sewers was not considered due to the limited changes in fw characteristics iacovidou et al 2012 zan et al 2020a the conceptual flow chart of integrated fw and wastewater management is illustrated in fig 2 basically the biological wwtps consist of primary treatment secondary treatment activated sludge process and sludge digestion a plant wide cod based transformation model was established based on the steady state of the wwtps ekama 2009 henze et al 2008 in primary treatment the diversion of ts and cod in wastewater and fw was determined with a 30 min settling the impact of ground fw on the settleability is considered negligible in this study in secondary treatment cod is categorized into four parts i e soluble biodegradable part soluble non biodegradable part particulate biodegradable part and particulate non biodegradable part for the conversion of wastewater and fw subsequent to the primary and secondary treatment the anaerobic digestion ad process was applied to recover energy in the form of methane from the produced sludge cano et al 2015 moreover methane was converted into electricity through the combined heat and power chp system in the biological wwtps the digested sludge from the ad system was transported to t park i e sludge incineration facility for waste to energy treatment in hong kong the local fw data obtained from the one year sampling and the characteristics of local wastewater were used as the inputs for the applied plant wide cod based transformation model and energy estimations moreover the plant wide steady state model consists of 15 stoichiometric and kinetic equations with 16 constants which are summarized in tables s1 s2 and s3 of the supplementary information si in this study the errors in the estimations are mainly attributed to the one year food waste sampling in this study the fwds penetration rates from 0 to 80 were used to estimate the impacts of the quantity of the fw diversion from the current solid waste treatment according to the reports in hong kong hkepd 2019 the fw production from households is around 0 32 kg capita day average value from 2015 to 2017 which was used to calculate the household fw discharged into the sewers and treated by the different biological wwtps with different fwds penetration rates 2 3 energy and economic analysis to evaluate the impacts of the use of fwds on the operation of the wwtps the energy and economic analysis was conducted to estimate the energy balance and operational cost with different fwds penetration rates the results acquired from the transformation of fw in the biological wwtps were used to estimate the potential energy consumption generation and economic feasibility of the fwds application this was performed by a desktop scale up study on the networks of the full scale biological wwtps with incineration for sludge treatment the fwds penetration rates increasing from 10 to 80 were selected for energy and economic assessments this involved the energy consumption for aeration pumping mixing supplying and total cost for energy consumption and sludge transportation disposal as details in the si in this study the construction cost of the wwtps was not considered as the main role of the wwtps is for wastewater treatment to assess the impacts on msw treatment an economic analysis was carried out to compare the various scenarios in hong kong there is a waste to energy wte combustion facility under construction and it will be fully commissioned by 2024 thus from the energy recovery and sustainability perspective wte combustion is selected for msw treatment as the important part for sustainable fw management proposed by hkepd hkepd 2017 the analysis of energy and cost on msw treatment was performed by using local msw composition the heating values of msw were first estimated based on the local composition with different fwds penetration rates moreover the msw treatment by the wte combustion was estimated including the collection transportation energy consumption generation table s5 of the si it should be noted that the cost for manpower was not included in the analysis since it is fixed regardless of the msw quantity 2 4 analytical methods measurements of ts and vs of fw in both primary effluent and primary sludge were carried out according to the standard methods apha 2005 total cod was analyzed without filtration whereas soluble cod was determined after filtration through a 0 45 Œºm filter millex hv millipore germany the determination of cod relied on low range cod vials with a detection range of 0 150 mg l and 2 ml of diluted samples with without filtration was added into the vials and then digested with a cod reactor model 4560000 hach usa at 150 c for 2 h the cod values of the digested samples were then measured by spectrophotometry dr 2800 hach usa at 430 nm particulate cod was calculated according to the measured values of total cod and soluble cod 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of food waste in the biological wwtps the transformation of ts and cod from fw was estimated by combining the experimental results and the empirical values figs 3 and s1 in the si due to the high settleability of fw after the fwds treatment around 86 of ts i e 0 19 kg ts kg fw and 55 of cod i e 0 12 kg cod kg fw in fw were removed by the primary sedimentation most of the solids in fw settled out as sludge in the primary treatment this is consistent with the reported results that 70 88 of solids in fwds effluent would be precipitated after 30 min to 2 h of settling thomas 2011 the remaining in the primary effluent was then treated by the biological treatment most of the cod can be converted to biomass 11 and co2 21 for metabolism in the secondary treatment the ts of fw in the primary effluent is removed by the sedimentation while the secondary effluent containing 0 03 kg cod kg fw 13 is generally the soluble non biodegradable cod in the sludge treatment line ad is a versatile technology to stabilize the sludge reduce sludge volume and harvest valuable resources based on the applied model around 0 03 nm3 of methane is generated from 1 kg fw discharged into the sewers fig s1 in the si around 0 28 kw h kg fw of energy is recovered in the form of electricity 0 1 kw h kg fw and heat 648 kj kg fw also the produced digested sludge from 1 kg fw contains 0 05 kg ts and 0 07 kg cod accounting for around 22 of ts and 29 of cod in fw therefore the wwtps can remove around 78 of ts and 58 of cod in fw the majority of ts and cod from fw end up as sludge suggesting that the use of fwds may result in a high burden on the sludge treatment in biological wwtps the cost of sludge treatment and disposal contributes 30 60 of the total annual operational expenditure in wwtps globally zan et al 2019b this indicates a potential increase in the operational cost of wwtps after the use of fwds considering the increased energy recovery potential it is necessary to assess the financial balance between the additional operational cost and the benefits of enhanced energy production 3 2 impacts of the food waste addition on the biological wwtps when the fwds effluent is flushed into the sewer system and mixed with sewage the ratio of the fwds effluent to sewage at different times in one day varies significantly iacovidou et al 2012 kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 to evaluate the mixing of fw with wastewater reliably the average concentration of fw in sewage is used for steady state analysis in hong kong the long term record of daily household fw and sewage production per capita suggests the concentration of fw in sewage is within the range of 0 7 2 g l zan et al 2018 the fwds penetration rate directly determines the amount of household fw discharged into the sewer system so the concentration of fw in sewage can be calculated accordingly for each biological wwtp 3 2 1 primary and secondary treatment changes in the ts and cod of fw wastewater and its respective ratio fw ww in the influent and secondary effluent in different biological wwtps were estimated with the fwds penetration rates at 10 30 50 and 80 fig 4 according to long term monitoring in hong kong wu et al 2016 wastewater as the influent contains around 302 mg ts l and 488 mg cod l with a fwds penetration rate of 10 the concentration in the influent can increase up to 328 mg ts l by 8 7 and 515 mg cod l by 5 5 in yl stw among the six biological wwtps in the secondary effluent cod can be around 63 mg l without the use of fwds whereas cod can increase up to 67 mg cod l by 5 4 at the penetration rate of 10 this suggests 10 of fwds applications in hong kong would not affect the characteristics of raw municipal wastewater however it is evident that the increase in the fwds penetration rate can divert a higher quantity of fw into wastewater cause proportional increases in ts and cod and render substantial influences on wastewater characteristics with a fwds penetration rate of 80 ts and cod in the influent can increase by 44 in st stw 69 in yl stw and 28 in st stw 44 in yl stw indicating a significant increase in pollutant loadings on the biological wwtps in the meantime cod in the secondary effluent can reach to 91 mg l by 44 at the penetration rate of 80 the discharge standard of treated wastewater in hong kong is 80 mg cod l for coastal waters hkdsd 2018 given the similar treatment techniques adopted and the plant wide cod based transformation model applied the differences in ts or cod of the six biological wwtps are mainly attributed to the amounts of fw and wastewater received a similar observation was identified in a pilot plant treating kitchen fw and urban wastewater which the influent contains up to 177 mg ts l and 425 mg cod l from fw and 316 mg ts l and 618 mg cod l from wastewater with the penetration rate of 80 mo√±ino et al 2017 the increased penetration rates from 0 to 80 could deteriorate the removal of solids and cod in the effluent moreover according to the experience of the use of fwds in other areas the highest penetration rate is around 50 in the u s iacovidou et al 2012 in hong kong the use of fwds may lie in the range of 0 30 suggesting an insignificant influence on the secondary effluent quality for a well operated biological wwtp 3 2 2 sludge production the transformation of fw in primary and secondary treatment results in the increasing sludge production due to the settled solid fw and the fw produced biomass the impacts of ts and cod in fw on primary secondary and digested sludge were estimated with different fwds penetration rates figs 5 and s2 in the si with a fwds penetration rate of 10 the increases could be up to 11 for primary sludge 1 9 for secondary sludge and 4 for digested sludge in yl stw the addition of fw in the biological wwtps of hong kong has a much higher influence on the primary sludge production than on secondary and digested sludge production this is because the majority of solid in fw is removed by primary treatment as primary sludge moreover increasing the fwds penetration rate leads to a higher fw to ww ratio on sludge production the increases in primary secondary and digested sludge could be up to 88 15 and 32 respectively with the penetration rate of 80 suggesting a high penetration rate 50 may incur a significant burden on primary sludge treatment in the biological wwtps in the biological wwtps digested sludge is considered as the final product and requires further treatment e g incineration and landfill metcalf and eddy 2003 it was estimated that sludge production from the biological wwtps of hong kong was around 252 tonne day without the addition of fw with dry solid about 30 fig 5 a the use of fwds could result in an increase in total sludge production from 2 6 to 21 at penetration rates from 10 to 80 fig 5a which inevitably produces more sludge for further treatment the use of fwds could result in an additional sludge production of around 6 52 tonne day a previous study reported the use of fwds at the penetration rate of 70 could increase secondary sludge production by 9 7 from 31 to 34 kg day battistoni et al 2007 currently about 1200 tonnes of sludge are produced each day in hong kong which is transported to the sludge incineration facility i e t park with a capacity of 2000 tonne day before final disposal to the landfill hkepd 2018b this indicates that the additional sludge production from the use of fwds may have a limited influence on local sludge treatment capacity however the impacts of the use of fwds were based on the model based evaluation which may change after real application to this end the transformation of fw in the biological wwtps of hong kong needs a long term experiment based evaluation to determine its effects in a clear and definite way 3 3 energy recovery 3 3 1 ad and chp system current methane and electricity generation from wastewater in the biological wwtps of hong kong were estimated at around 15000 nm3 day and 50000 kw h day figs 6 and s3 in the si with 10 30 penetration rates the net increase in methane production would be nearly 1200 to 3600 nm3 day respectively this would lead to the net increase in energy generation of 3900 12000 kw h day of electricity and 26000 78000 mj day of heat through the chp system heat energy could be stored in terms of steam and hot water cano et al 2015 the produced electricity can be used for the on site operation of wwtps or supplied to the public power grid while the generated heat can be recirculated for the ad system at a mesophilic range in winter in hong kong the daily energy demand per household is around 13 3 kw h hkcsd 2019 the daily electricity recovered from the fw could power 290 to 880 households every day when 10 30 of households install the fwds this indicates that the considerable potential of energy recovery from the use of fwds can be achieved through the existing processes in the biological wwtps 3 3 2 sludge incineration in hong kong sewage sludge after dewatering with dry solid about 30 is transported to the incineration facility i e t park for volume reduction and energy harvest the use of fwds with different penetration rates could increase the sludge production in the biological wwtps affecting the sludge incineration around 95 of generated electricity could self sustain the facility whereas the surplus of electricity about 5 can be exported to the public grid hkcsd 2018 woon and lo 2013 fig 6 shows the daily electricity generated from the sludge incineration with different fwds penetration rates generally the use of fwds can improve limited electricity generation the incineration of 252 tonnes of sludge can generate about 32000 kw h of electricity and this increases by 810 2400 kw h when 10 30 of households install fwds this demonstrates an increase from 3 to 8 of electricity can be achieved with the penetration rates from 10 to 30 in this study the digested sludge is considered to mainly contain the non biodegradable matter after secondary treatment and anaerobic digestion this causes the increased electricity strongly correlated with the increased sludge from the use of fwds therefore the use of fwds may not bring an additional burden on the treatment capacity of sludge incineration while energy recovery is minor from the additional sludge production from fw 3 4 energy balance and economic analysis of the use of fwds on the wwtps the impacts of the fwds application have been drawing attention in research application and policy making for decades especially considering the offset on energy consumption and operational cost of wwtps ceced 2003 iacovidou et al 2012 nyepd 1997 in this study it is estimated that the net energy input for the biological wwtps of hong kong is 130000 kw h day while the total operational cost is around 0 24 million hkd day 0 03 million usd day fig 7 with a fwds penetration rate of 10 impacts on energy consumption and operational cost in the wwtps are negligible 1 figs 7 and 8 a there will be increases in energy consumption and operational cost by 10 and 12 respectively in the biological wwtps of hong kong for handling 30 of household fw diverted into the wastewater stream by contrast the use of fwds with the penetration rate up to 80 may incur a demand for energy and operational expenditure by over 50 this indicates that the increasing fwds penetration rate could render a much higher energy consumption and operational cost in the biological wwtps of hong kong in addition sludge incineration in hong kong reuses 95 of generated electricity for the on site operation limiting net energy production and economic return with the use of fwds more energy is consumed though substantial electricity can be harvested the increased energy consumption for the additional loading is mainly ascribed to the power required for aeration in the secondary treatment the adopted biological processes in the wwtps can significantly affect energy consumption mccarty et al 2011 metcalf and eddy 2003 the use of fwds poses a different influence on energy consumption due to the shift of treatment processes such as extended aeration process fixed aerobic anoxic cycles and alternate cycles process in the wwtps battistoni et al 2007 kim et al 2019 this study evaluated the energy consumption from the use of fwds by using the activated sludge process adopted in hong kong hkdsd 2018 although surplus electricity can be generated from the wwtps and sludge incineration with the fw addition the amount is much lower than the energy consumption as a result the increased energy consumption can boost the operational cost of the biological wwtps another reason for the increased operational cost is sludge treatment mainly for sludge transportation and final disposal fig 8 shows the increased operational cost in different biological wwtps and the correlation with the treatment capacity of wwtps the difference between the operational cost and the treatment capacity is negligible with the penetration rate 30 whereas a larger treatment capacity requires a higher operational cost with the penetration rate 50 based on the data in fig 8b we propose to use the empirical equation below to describe the dependency of increased operational cost of the biological wwtps on the treatment capacity and the fwds penetration rate f q i p i c o s t a p i b q i c p i d where f q i p i c o s t is the increased operational cost hkd day q i is the flow rate of the biological wwtp m3 day p i is the fwds penetration rate a b c and d are constant parameters equal to 0 33 hkd m3 0 04 hkd m3 5693 hkd day and 852 hkd day in this study based on the fitting results thereinto constants a and c are related to the increased cost of the use of fwds or the fw addition in wastewater and sludge treatment stream respectively constants b and d are the compensation of the increased cost from the flow rate and fixed part respectively the above empirical equation although adequately describe the relationship between increased operational cost and the treatment capacity and the fwds penetration rate is based on extrapolation of the local data further verifications with different characteristics of wastewater and fw are strongly recommended for the calibration and validation of the empirical equation for analyzing the impacts 3 5 potential implications for municipal solid waste management the use of fwds can divert fw away from the solid waste stream into the wastewater stream thus relieving the burden on msw treatment potential implications were evaluated based on the economic analysis on msw treatment as shown in fig 9 generally the use of fwds could cause a reduction in the quantity of msw thus saving the cost for collection and transportation fig 9a moreover the discharge of household fw into the sewers could increase the heating values of the msw fig s4 the high moisture content of fw in msw could reduce the heating values which inevitably lowers the conversion efficiency of the incineration brunner et al 2002 iqbal et al 2019 furthermore incineration of fw can potentially produce dioxins due to the high moisture of fw lead to air pollution katami et al 2004 kiran et al 2014 the use of fwds reduces the msw quantity for incineration and decreases electricity generation fig 9a the savings in collection and transportation can increase the overall net profit by contrast diverting fw into wastewater stream by using fwds is more cost effective for fw management in hong kong 3 6 perspectives this study has comprehensively evaluated the use of fwds on the networks of the biological wwtps sludge treatment and msw management in hong kong from the aspect of fw conversion energy balance and economic analysis it has demonstrated that the addition of fw may pose a limited influence on the biological wwtps in terms of treatment capacity effluent quality and sludge production this can be attributed to the resilience and redundant capacity of systems treating wastewater and sludge in hong kong however the biological wwtps need to handle extra loadings from the fw addition while the energy recovery from the biological wwtps and sludge incineration is limited compared with the energy consumption this can be attributed to the high energy input of the aeration to remove the organics in the activated sludge process in which it is necessary to apply smart control of aeration to reduce the energy input or adopt anaerobic treatment in the mainstream moreover the sludge retention time srt used in the model is 15 days which reduces the energy recovery potential since the biodegradable organics are either consumed or converted into endogenous residues henze et al 2008 as a result the use of fwds may cause increases in both net energy consumption and net operational cost of the biological wwtps however at the warm wastewater temperature of hong kong 20 c the nitrification denitrification activated sludge srt can be reduced to 4 5 days without compromising effluent quality which significantly decreases energy demand for oxygen consumption and increases methane production from the ad system besides the high rate activated sludge hras process can be an attractive alternative to capture the organic matters in wastewater with a short retention time e g 30 60 min in particular the addition of fw could significantly enhance the formation of organically rich sludge for energy recovery guven et al 2019 on the other hand the use of fwds could be beneficial for msw management the diversion of fw could improve the combustion efficiency of msw for incineration the savings in msw treatment from the diversion of fw can be much higher than the extra operational cost of wwtps there is a potential benefit for the diversion of fw by the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from collection and transportation moreover the diversion of fw would improve the net energy recovery from msw with the improvement in the combustion efficiency of incineration iqbal et al 2019 the fwds penetration rate is key to determining the quantity of fw discharging into the sewer system since it relates to the proportion of households installing fwds currently the penetration rates are around 50 in the us 5 in the u k 10 in canada 12 in australia and 30 in new zealand iacovidou et al 2012 in hong kong the use of fwds is still in its infancy and evaluating its impacts is deemed necessary for policy making this work evaluated the impacts of fwds with the penetration rates of 0 80 by using current local information although it is estimated to have a limited influence on the biological wwtps a trial at a low penetration rate is necessary for preliminary evaluation and further improvement on the sewer system and the biological wwtps besides the fat oil and grease fog contained in fw could be problematic in the sewers and wwtps gross et al 2017 nieuwenhuis et al 2018 the fog deposits may cause blockages in sewers and affect the operation of the wwtps which should not be overlooked with the application of fwds the results of this work suggest that upgrading treatment processes e g anaerobic treatment hras process and optimizing the operation of biological wwtps e g reduce srt smart aeration control may be required to improve the overall energy balance and cost of the wwtps moreover the methodology used in this work is useful and effective to evaluate the diversion of fw into wastewater treatment on a city scale which can be beneficial for the policy making on fw management in different metropolises 4 conclusions this study has evaluated the integrated food waste and wastewater management based on the networks of biological wwtps and sludge treatment in hong kong the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 in the biological wwtps about 78 of ts and 58 of cod in fw can be removed by primary and secondary processes while about 22 of ts and 29 of cod may end up in the digested sludge 2 estimated secondary effluent in the biological wwtps with the fw addition could satisfy the discharge standard in hong kong with the additional sludge production having limited influence on the sludge treatment capacity 3 energy consumption and operational cost in the wwtps are highly dependent on the treatment processes and the penetration rates of fwds while msw management can benefit from the use of fwds and 4 this study provides a methodology for effectively evaluating the impacts of diverting fw into wastewater treatment on a city scale favoring the policy making on fw

17676,assessing the hydrologic processes over scales ranging from single wetland to regional is critical to understand the hydrologically driven ecosystem services especially nutrient buffering of wetlands here we present a novel approach to quantify the multiscale hydrologic regulation of multipond systems mpss a common type of small scattered wetland in humid agricultural regions because previous studies have stopped in commending the catchment scale flood and drought resilience of these waters and contemporary models do not adequately represent the corresponding intra catchment fill spill relationships a new version of soil and water assessment tool swat was developed to incorporate improved representation of 1 perennial or intermittent spillage connections of pond to pond and pond to stream and 2 bidirectional exchange between pond surface water and shallow groundwater we present swat mps which adopts rule based artificial intelligence to model the possibilities of different spillage directions and ga based parameter optimization over the two simulation years june 2017 to may 2019 with successfully replicated streamflow and pond water level variations in a 4 8 km2 test catchment southern china water balance analysis and scenario simulations were then executed to assess the hydrologic regulation at single pond single mps and entire catchment scales results revealed 1 the presence of 9 series or series parallel connected mpss in which pond overflow accounted for as much as 59 of the catchment water yield 2 seasonally and mps independent baseflow support

quickflow variations in the farmland and 3 mps aggregated catchment flood peak reduction 20 and baseflow increment 26 in the following dry days meteorological data analysis and simulated average daily values indicated these hydrologic patterns are credible even if extending to a 5 year period as a first modelling attempt to explore the intra catchment details of mpss our study underscores the water storage and connectivity in their hydrologic regulation and suggests inventories long term field monitoring and several research directions of the new model for integrated pond management in

services from floodwater storage to pollutant removal habitat provision and microclimate regulation these services are governed to a large extent by the hydrologic processes that occur within wetlands

2006 liu et al 2009 an mps typically consists of several ponds scattered aside farmland and cottages fig 1 a these ponds are natural surface depressions that permanently or temporarily hold water and

reduce annual irrigation water shortages from 306 26 to 89 48 mm in the liuchahe catchment anhui province yin et al 2006 during a heavy rainfall event 141 mm d 1 these ponds reduced the flood peak

detailed assessments on these waters evenson et al 2015 2018b yasarer et al 2018 yeo et al 2019 however model limitations still exist for consideration of mpss notable processes represented include bidirectional exchanges between ponded water and shallow groundwater rains et al 2016 and cascading fill spill relationships between intermittently connected ponds yu et al 2015 the latter has been observed as an important hydrologic component but is not well resolved in previous studies owing to the difficulties in depicting the hydrologic path of ditches even from high resolution digital elevation models dems and remote sensing imagery wu 2018 chen et al 2019 furthermore the availability of measured data has limited further exploration on these intra catchment hydrologic details requiring both streamflow and pond dynamics for parameter estimation yen et al 2016 over the past decades small scattered wetlands such as mpss have faced a severe decline in numbers and malfunctions in terms of ecosystem services owing to expanding urbanization agricultural intensification and centralized irrigation hill et al 2018 chen et al 2019 while little environmental legislation has focused on pond conservation several policies and regulations have gradually acknowledged their importance such as the headwater environment remediation in china s river chief mechanism that clarifies the responsibilities of different government sectors dai 2019 and pond planning and dredging in beautiful rural development that pursues both ecological and economic well being long 2014 pond prioritization and management for environmentalists and rural planners also requires detailed assessments on the structures and processes of these waters to achieve the potential benefits of mpss given the above scientific challenges and management deficiencies this study presents a novel modelling approach to explore the multiscale hydrologic regulation of mpss in humid agricultural catchments the headwaters of two basins of environmental concern the taihu lake basin and qinhuai river basin fig 1b were selected as a test bed a new version of swat v 2012 rev 670 was developed to represent mps hereafter referred to as swat mps so that intermittent spillage connections between ponds and their bidirectional exchanges with shallow groundwater can be better represented swat mps was set up with both streamflow and pond water level variations and calibrated using rule based artificial intelligence the simulations were conducted under two contrasting land use scenarios to assess changes in the hydrologic components of ponds mpss and the entire catchment followed by discussions on their multiscale hydrologic regulation implications for management and modelling recommendations as a first modelling exploration on the intra catchment hydrologic details of mpss the proposed methods and analytical results can better quantify the water transport and distribution in catchments with small scattered wetlands they can also help inform the management and conservation efforts in the context of global wetland degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study catchment 31 42 n 118 18 e is characterized by traditional agricultural practices densely distributed ponds and a humid subtropical monsoon climate fig 2 a a 5 m resolution dem from the jiangsu provincial bureau of surveying and mapping shows that the 4 8 km2 catchment is surrounded by low mountains and hills rising from 62 to 295 m fig 2b according to chen et al 2018a the soil types include eutric planosols haplic luvisols and dystric regosols fig 2c which are composed of silty loam and loam textures at the top soil layer and sandy loam and clay loam textures below with saturated hydraulic conductivity values of 9 2 210 5 and 2 1 38 8 mm h 1 respectively calculated by saxton and rawls 2005 in addition to agricultural land paddy fields dry farmland and tea gardens totaling 29 the catchment consists of woods deciduous and evergreen forests at 63 waters ponds and streams at 5 and rural residential areas 3 as extracted from a 0 5 m panchromatic satellite image taken in 2017 fig 2d two year june 2017 to may 2019 complete data including daily meteorological conditions and variations of streamflow pond water level and shallow groundwater table was prepared while the former 2 categories were collected for more than these years national ground climatological data http data cma cn station no 58345 n31 26 e119 29 7 7 m in elevation indicated average daily high and low temperatures at 21 1 and 13 3 c respectively while average annual precipitation of 1136 352 mm with 60 concentrated from june to september for the past half decade another preliminary analysis showed small variations 8 to 3 fig a1 in relative percentage changes on the average daily values of precipitation maximum minimum temperature and sunshine duration of the 2 years to past half decade with fixed ground conditions including dem soil type and land use variations on these key meteorological variables of a watershed model indicated that the credibility of subsequent hydrologic patterns of test mpss is beyond the 2 year period with complete data daily streamflow at the catchment outlet was estimated using a pre established hspf model for the past 4 years chen et al 2018a which was calibrated with measurements of a portable propeller type current meter and later a fixed parshall flume in the midstream and validated with daily average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and r 2 0 8 among the 30 ponds in total area 100 m2 9 were selected and gaged with the hobo u20l https www onsetcomp com for water level observation according to the jenks natural breaks of pond elevation storage capacity and submerged area manual irrigation pumping of these ponds was also investigated pond bathymetry was surveyed and integrated with the surrounding dem topography to derive the relationship between water level storage and submerged area for each pond see chen et al 2018b for detailed procedures furthermore underlain by a confining unit 30 m below the peripheral regions have a shallow groundwater table 6 m below the surface geological bureau of jiangsu province 1980 water level variations in 6 drinking water wells which locate in and adjacent to the catchment and are deep to the same aquifer were therefore monitored for the estimation of shallow groundwater table after establishing the thiessen polygons of the wells and catchment boundary using arctoolbox http desktop arcgis com 2 2 the swat mps model 2 2 1 default wetland modelling in swat swat is an open source semi distributed and semi physically based watershed model that has been widely applied to examine the impacts of agricultural land management on water resources and water quality constituents arnold et al 2012 hydrologic simulation in swat is first performed at the hydrologic response unit hru a combination of soil landuse and slope that determines rainfall runoff characteristics level and then aggregated at the subwatershed and routed to the watershed outlet following the stream network in this process wetlands can be modelled at the subwatershed scale in which all wetlands are depicted via aggregated or lumped parameters wang et al 2008 or at the hru scale which enables a customized inflow proportion from a single hru or subset of all hrus for each wetland feng et al 2013 golden et al 2014 the two modes share a common water balance equation which is expressed as 1 Œ¥ v p et q in q out q seep where Œ¥ v is the change in wetland water volume during a given time step m3 p is the water volume entering as precipitation m3 q in and q out are the water volume flowing in and out m3 and et and q seep are the water volume lost via evapotranspiration and seepage m3 further details on these parameters are described in arnold et al 2012 kang and sridhar 2017 and sridhar et al 2019 the swat default wetland model has substantial limitations when assessing the intra catchment hydrologic processes of mpss first pond inflows are determined by empirical or constant parameters in both of the two modes rather than their actual distribution and drainage characteristics while pond outflows i e spillage are directly routed to streams ignoring possible fill spill relationships with downgradient ponds ameli and creed 2017 jones et al 2019 second pond subsurface outflows i e seepage are identified at a constant rate dictated by soil saturated hydraulic conductivity values and soil water content this simplification precludes representation of changes in head gradients between these waters and surrounding uplands which drive the direction and magnitude of local groundwater exchange foglia et al 2007 golden et al 2014 the above limitations of original swat stem from the structural representation of hru for ponds and their drainage areas as well as process representation of the water balance equation that ignores the cascading fill spill processes and bidirectional exchange with shallow groundwater 2 2 2 improved representation of mpss significant efforts have been made to enhance process representation of wetlands in swat and to set up more spatially explicit wetland parameters relevant improvements include 1 delineating upland to wetland drainage relationships and constraining wetland surface and subsurface inflows according to actual spatial positioning evenson et al 2015 yasarer et al 2018 yeo et al 2019 and 2 supporting bidirectional exchange between wetland surface and subsurface water as a function of time varying head gradients with the water content in soil profiles cohen et al 2016 evenson et al 2018b on this basis swat mps was developed to better present mpss by 1 enabling pond to pond and pond to stream fill spill relationships especially for those between different subcatchments as the intermittent water connections are determined by pond water storage and surrounding microtopography but usually unidentifiable even from high resolution geospatial datasets and 2 estimating pond surface and subsurface water exchange according to head gradients between ponds and drinking water wells as the latter are common easily accessible and can reflect areal shallow groundwater table when deep to the same aquifer in low mountains and hills following evenson et al 2015 2018b the swat hrus were first redefined as the combination of soil landuse slope and the fourth attribute of pond drainage area so that the upland drainage relationship of each pond is spatially explicit fig 3 a in this process the drainage area was depicted via the multiple flow direction approach tarboton 2005 and new model input files were added to enhance the structural attributes of pond hrus implemented by the matrix data structure in the python scientific library i e numpy https www numpy org each pond can then receive spillage from upgradient ponds and overflow to its subcatchment reach and downgradient ponds in and out of the same subcatchment to restore an intermittent fill spill relationship that may not presented by subcatchment delineation fig 3a furthermore the relationship between water storage and submerged area was discretized at 0 1 m water level intervals while the total outflow magnitude was estimated via the flow calculation formula of broad crested weirs see herschy 2008 for detailed procedures and surveyed practice of irrigation pumping for each pond the hydrologic processes of pond hrus are extended and reimplemented to better represent the fill spill relationship within an mps and bidirectional exchange between pond surface water and shallow groundwater hence pond hrus are resolved into two parts the pond portion fig 3b marked in blue and soil and aquifer portion fig 3b marked in green the water balance of the pond portion is described as 2 Œ¥ v pond p et q surf q spill out q spill in q local where Œ¥ v pond is the change in pond water volume during a given time step m3 p and et are water volume entering as precipitation and lost via evapotranspiration m3 from the time varying submerged area q surf is the surface runoff m3 entering from pond drainage hrus q spill out and q spill in are surface water m3 leaving and entering via the fill spill processes which are depicted through the following equations 3 q spill out i m p pond i q spill out p stream q spill out 4 q spill in i n p pond i q spill out where m and n are the total number of ponds that receive and provide spillage respectively p pond i is the proportion of total spillage that routes to the i th pond while p stream is the proportion that routes to the subcatchment reach note that the summation of i m p pond i and p stream equals 1 q local is the net subsurface flow m3 entering and leaving via local exchange with underlying soil and shallow aquifers which is estimated by head gradients between ponds and drinking water wells according to darcy s law sophocleous 2002 hence q local is simulated as 5 q local k sat s bottom i m h pond h well i l i w i where k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m day 1 of the pond s substrate s bottom is the time varying submerged area m2 on the integrated bathymetric and terrain surface h pond and h well i are water levels m in the pond and i th well respectively l i is the distance m from the well to pond s centroid while w i is the inverse distance weight to that well according to the distance to all measured wells the subsurface flow was depicted as entering from the underlying soil layer and shallow aquifers if surrounding water table height exceeded pond water level h well h pond and in turn leaving the pond if the water level exceeded surrounding water table height h pond h well beneath the pond portion the soil layer and aquifer portion of pond hru is simulated as 6 Œ¥ v beneath q lat in q lat out q local q gw where Œ¥ v beneath is the change in water volume m3 of soil layer and aquifers in the pond hru during a given time step q lat in and q lat out are lateral subsurface flow m3 entering the soil profile from drainage hrus and leaving the pond hru to either a downgradient hru or the subcatchment reach respectively q gw is groundwater outflow m3 leaving shallow and deep aquifers and entering the reach 2 3 model calibration and validation daily streamflow in original swat was first prepared over 4 seasonal years june 2015 to may 2019 after a 3 year warm up period june 2012 to may 2015 to get basic parameter ranges and catchment conditions swat mps was then calibrated and validated against daily streamflow and pond water level variations over the latest 2 years june 2017 to may 2019 here seasons were defined as spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to february according to the subtropical climate the calibration and validation practice include parameter sensitivity analysis rule based knowledge integration genetic algorithm ga based parameter optimization cross validation and goodness of fit assessment fig 4 the initial sensitivity analysis was executed using both one at a time and global sensitivity analysis in the swat cup software package abbaspour 2013 with full physically meaningful value ranges suggested by arnold et al 2012 and abbaspour 2013 the sensitive parameters of original swat in conjunction with the above new ones for pond hydrologic processes i e p pond p stream and k sat are employed for the following procedures 2 3 1 rule based fill spill relationship calibrated by streamflow measurements hydrologic models usually lack accurate intra catchment simulations despite satisfactory results at the catchment outlet efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 two major difficulties emerged with respect to swat mps calibration and validation 1 overall rationality parameter estimation on a single pond cannot guarantee appropriate value sets as the fill spill processes may be associated with several upgradient and downgradient ponds meanwhile the catchment rainfall runoff and aggregated regulation of all mpss jointly influence the outlet streamflow 2 uncertainties in the direction and magnitude of pond overflow the cascading fill spill processes of an mps are affected by the ponds low lying terrain the pervasive and interlaced ditch networks microtopography in farmland and various rainfall intensity yu et al 2015 chen et al 2019 these factors are difficult to monitor and model and are usually changed by agricultural practices resulting in uncertainties in the direction and magnitude of pond overflow to cope with the above difficulties and narrow the value range of pond representation parameters production rules which originated from artificial intelligence engelmore and feigenbaum 1993 were introduced to integrate field experience and model the fill spill possibility between pond to pond and pond to stream according to the strahler s stream order scheidegger et al 1965 a binary tree was first established to present the hierarchical and topological relationship of all subcatchments fig 4a using a basic structure of if condition then consequence 4 production rules were designed and set priority tokens for possible overflow between ponds in single or multiple subcatchments table 1 ordered by rule id the fill spill processes are more likely to happen between ponds in subcatchments with a closer topological relationship after replacing the downgradient pond i e pondj in table 1 with main stream in these rules another 4 rules were created for the spillage between pond to stream and in aggregate implemented for the following parameter optimization 2 3 2 ga based parameter optimization genetic algorithms ga originally proposed by goldberg 1989 are increasingly used in parameter estimation of hydrologic modelling due to the advantages in global optimization shafii and smedt 2009 chlumeck√Ω et al 2017 following sensitivity analysis and rule based knowledge integration the original swat and new pond representation parameters were subsequently optimized using a python based evolutionary computation framework i e deap https pypi org project deap against daily streamflow at the catchment outlet and water level variations in the selected ponds the ga optimization was performed in the following 4 steps and then repeated 100 times to evaluate the stability of ga and acquire 20 optimal parameter value sets fig 4b after comparing with the parameter value ranges reported by arnold et al 2012 abbaspour 2013 and lin et al 2013 the most reasonable set was manually selected considering both model performance and actual fill spill relationships that have been partly surveyed in the field 1 population initialization two hundred initial parameter sets population were generated for the first ga run parameters were encoded in the form of a substring and linked together to form one individual while their values were randomly generated within the pre defined ranges 2 fitness evaluation during the training period the fitness f of each individual was evaluated by a fitness function based on the root mean square error rmse of streamflow and pond water level which is described as 7 f 1 i 1 n j 1 m p ij obs p ij sim 2 m k j 1 m s j obs s j sim 2 m where p ij obs and p ij sim are observed and simulated water level for the i th pond on j th day respectively s j obs and s j sim are observed and simulated streamflow on j th day as a weight coefficient k took the same value as n to balance the two types of measurement ranging from 0 to a higher f value implied a lower rmse value and higher fitness 3 reproduction aimed to create the next generations by selecting individuals with a higher fitness value f and endowing them with a higher chance to reproduce hence the overall model fit of the individuals is gradually improved over 300 generations 4 crossover and mutation were expected to increase population diversity and generate dissimilar individuals parameter values with the high model fit for each generation 65 of the individuals were randomly selected for the crossover process which generated new individuals by slightly changing parameter values to derive the different magnitude of pond overflow meanwhile mutation introduced random change to the parameter values of 25 of individuals in which the above 8 production rules were implemented by probabilistic events to generate different spillage directions further details on the ga implementation can be found in shafii and smedt 2009 and fortin et al 2012 2 3 3 cross validation and goodness of fit assessment a k fold cross validation was employed for model validation owing to the relatively short period of measured data fig 4c the streamflow and water level variations of the 2 years were first divided into 4 subsets according to the seasons in each of the 4 cross validation processes 3 subsets were held for the above parameter optimization while the remaining one was used for model validation hence each subset of the measured data was used once for validation and 4 models were generated accordingly finally the parameter values of the 4 models were averaged and performed on the complete data for the goodness of fit assessment further theoretical basis and calculation processes for the cross validation are described in foglia et al 2007 and ly et al 2013 the goodness of fit assessment of swat mps covered both streamflow and pond water level simulations two statistical criteria including the kling gupta efficiency kge and percent bias pbias were employed to evaluate the agreements between simulations and measurements fig 4d as a derivative of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse statistic nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kge reduces the inherent tendency of runoff underestimation in nse while allowing for a multi objective perspective by focusing on correlation error variability error and bias error gupta et al 2009 a kge 0 5 recommended by moriasi et al 2007 was set as the threshold value for satisfactory simulations when running the auto calibration program the pbias statistics gupta et al 1999 which compute the average tendency of simulated variables to be larger or smaller than observed variables were used to provide further perspective on the model performance with an optimum value of 0 the pbias values were considered satisfactory between 0 25 for streamflow and intermediate processes as applied in other hydrologic simulations hoang et al 2017 evenson et al 2018b yeo et al 2019 2 4 model output and hydrologic analysis the output of swat mps is organized in three spatial scales including the single pond single mps and entire catchment average daily water balances for the pond portion in each of the pond hru were first summarized across the simulation period average daily streamflow baseflow and quickflow were then collected for each mps and summarized seasonally according to the result direction and magnitude of pond overflow an mps was identified as a collection of ponds with cascading fill spill relationships regardless of whether such connections were serial or parallel in structure and perennial or intermittent in continuity meanwhile quickflow was defined as the quantity of flow occurring immediately after the onset of a rainfall event while baseflow was the quantity of flow after the conclusion of a rainfall event hornberger et al 2014 these two flow components were calculated via swat bflow arnold et al 2012 which implements the baseflow separation methods in arnold and allen 1999 and takes daily streamflow as input last average daily water balance was summarized seasonally at the catchment scale while extreme weather events including floods and droughts were screened to assess the aggregated hydrologic regulation of all mpss two contrasting land use scenarios including the baseline and all ponds lost were simulated to evaluate the relative change in streamflow of identified mpss and catchment water balance the baseline scenario employed the present distribution and connections of mpss while in the all ponds lost scenario mpss were replaced with surrounding agricultural land owing to the pervasive and ever increasing degradation threats hill et al 2018 chen et al 2019 the dem preprocessing tool in arcswat https swat tamu edu software arcswat was employed to fill the surface depressions so that roughly the same subcatchments and hrus were depicted as the baseline scenario redundancy analysis rda was performed using canoco http canoco5 com to examine the influences of pond characteristics including water storage connectivity and bidirectional exchange with shallow groundwater on the streamflow variations as a constrained linear ordination technique rda can condense the information between two sets of variables and reveal the strength and direction of the correlation between them note that before rda data normalization detrended correspondence analysis and a monte carlo permutation test 499 permutations were successively performed while the resulting biplots demonstrate the correlation of two variables via their collinearity i e the two arrows with a smaller angle have a higher correlation and vice versa see lep≈° and ≈°milauer 2003 for further details 3 results 3 1 calibrated parameters and model performance fourteen parameters from the original swat including runoff groundwater soil plant and reach processes as suggested by van griensvan et al 2006 were initially identified by the global sensitivity analysis table 2 to avoid over parameterization yen et al 2016 jones et al 2019 7 statistically significant p 0 05 parameters among the 14 ones in conjunction with the main stream manning s n value ch n2 hydraulic conductivity ch k2 and 3 pond representation parameters were then calibrated in the ga based optimization despite that the ch n2 and ch k2 parameters were not statistically significant they were included to compensate for uncertainties associated with the main stream channelization in the study catchment chen et al 2018a in general the following cross validation resulted in a daily kge value of 0 61 and pbias value of 0 11 for streamflow simulations at the outlet and an average daily kge value of 0 55 and pbias value of 0 13 for water level simulations for the 9 selected ponds the calibrated swat mps was consequently considered satisfactory to represent intra catchment processes of mpss although water level simulations were slightly poorer than those for streamflow the calibrated parameters were evaluated by focusing on the result values to which they represent catchment hydrology and mps dynamics groundwater parameters including sol k rchr dp and gwqmn and pond representation parameters i e p pond p stream and k sat were underlined table 1 the sol k value 3 6 mm h 1 dictated a relative increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the swat hru soil profiles as the local data describes the soil profile as extending to a maximum of 2100 mm below the surface geological bureau of jiangsu province 1980 the rchr dp value 0 24 dictated that 76 of water moving below the soil profile and acting as groundwater recharge within an hru entered the shallow aquifer while the gwqmn value 375 mm dictated a relatively low threshold depth for groundwater leaving from the shallow aquifer to the subcatchment reach the optimized value range of p pond and p stream 0 86 and 0 42 respectively dictated a relatively large proportion of pond water storage that overflowed to downgradient ponds and streams while the k sat values 0 4 1 6 mm h 1 dictated a far lower seepage rate of ponds substrate than the surrounding soil profiles these parameters in concert portrayed a system in which both lateral and vertical water movement exist while the magnitude of pond spillage was prominent both statistical criteria and visual comparison were inspected to verify the model performance the daily streamflow variations were generally replicated at the catchment outlet and most of the lower values particularly 0 1 m3 s 1 were successfully captured fig 5 a however streamflow simulations tended to be overestimated during heavy rainfall events e g july 10 2017 june 5 2018 and august 17 2018 presumably due to the neglect of water storage in tributary ditches and streams with slightly larger but acceptable deviations the 9 selected ponds were divided into 3 groups according to their elevations the average pbias value for the pond group between 90 and 105 m fig 5b c d 75 90 m fig 5e f g and 60 75 m fig 5h i j were 0 07 0 18 and 0 27 respectively indicating that water level simulation errors and associated uncertainties of fill spill processes gradually increased from upstream to downstream moreover ponds in all the 3 groups were generally wetter i e higher water levels and larger submerged areas in the simulation during rainfall periods and drier during rainless periods which was temporally like streamflow simulations 3 2 pond water balance and mps identification the average daily water balance was evaluated to assess the hydrologic component of each pond table 3 across the two year simulation period all 30 ponds had water storage indicated by average daily water depths within the baseline scenario although a few ones i e no 4 no 16 and no 21 dried up for short periods water could enter the ponds via direct precipitation surface inflow from drainage hrus spillage from upgradient ponds and groundwater discharge results demonstrated that direct precipitation was the dominant means of water input for 60 of ponds while surface inflow and spillage served as main water source for another 30 and 10 of ponds respectively water exited the ponds via et spillage and groundwater recharge results demonstrate that et is the dominant means of water exiting for 73 of ponds followed by spillage which agreed with water balance assessments of ponds and reservoirs in humid subtropical climates chen et al 2017 tan et al 2018 the average daily total amount of these two means for all ponds were similar 109 and 93 mm d 1 respectively indicating that most of the spillage was provided by a few ponds moreover the local bidirectional exchange served as groundwater recharge for 67 of ponds and discharge for the rest while their average daily total amount was approximately proportional 23 and 8 mm d 1 respectively last standard deviations of pond average daily water balance components were generally less than that of precipitation table 3 indicating the ground response was smaller than precipitation variation in viewing the meteorological data analysis in section 2 1 simulated hydrologic patterns on the average daily values here and below are credible even if extending to 5 years slight and proportional amplification or reduction is presumably expected according to the average daily magnitude and direction of pond spillage 9 mpss were identified in the catchment fig 6 a the majority of these mpss consisted of several ponds where the cascading fill spill relationship existed between pond to pond and pond to stream a small number of mpss no 2 and 4 in fig 6a consisted of only a single pond but were also numbered for consistency in each mps ponds were series connected e g no 5 7 and 8 or series parallel hybrid connected e g no 1 3 6 and 9 with spillage to the main stream at the end or in the middle of the structure meanwhile mps drainage areas were delineated by merging the drainage area of each pond in the structure fig 6b the total drainage area of all mpss took 76 of the catchment area which partially demonstrated that pond overflow accounted for a large proportion of streamflow at the outlet furthermore the drainage area of mps no 7 8 and 9 was spatially separated despite their internal spillage connections this extraordinary finding proved the existence of fill spill relationships in non adjacent subcatchments which did not follow the subcatchment and stream delineation from the 5 m resolution dem data but can be revealed by our rule based knowledge integration i e higher possibility of spillage connection for ponds in subcatchments with a closer topological relationship and vice versa and associated ga based parameter optimization 3 3 mps s regulation effect on streamflow baseflow and quickflow variations in average daily streamflow baseflow and quickflow of the all ponds lost scenario relative to the baseline scenario were evaluated to assess the hydrologic regulation of each mps the overall findings across the two year simulation period indicated that filling mpss decreased baseflow 5 to 38 increased quickflow 9 19 and produced variations in the sign and magnitude of streamflow for different mps subcatchments see the overall columns in table 4 hence the mpss were organized into 3 control groups according to their streamflow variations these groups were named by the typical landuse types of the mps subcatchment and differed significantly in the average slope mps no 1 6 7 and 8 as forest group woods at 79 agricultural land at 17 and average slope at 16 mps no 3 5 and 9 as farm group agricultural land at 40 woods at 51 and average slope at 11 and mps no 2 and 4 as village group rural residential areas at 39 agricultural land at 37 and average slope at 3 in the subcatchments of forest group average daily streamflow attenuated slightly by 4 relative to the baseline simulations meanwhile streamflow in the subcatchments of farm group witnessed a marginal increase of 2 the subcatchments of village group however presented notably contrasting daily streamflow of an averaged attenuation 10 within the all ponds lost scenario seasonal variations in streamflow baseflow and quickflow of the all ponds lost scenario were then evaluated and it was found that mpss had seasonally independent regulation effect on average daily streamflow and baseflow while quickflow regulation was comparatively consistent across seasons see the season columns in table 3 relative to the baseline simulations for example the subcatchments of forest group produced attenuated average daily streamflow during summer and autumn 2 to 10 but increased average daily streamflow during spring and winter 1 4 the filling of mps in these subcatchments markedly lowered average daily baseflow within summer and autumn 10 to 28 but presented moderate attenuation in spring and winter 6 average daily quickflow in the 4 subcatchments increased across seasons by 8 17 relative to the baseline scenario in the all ponds lost scenario the subcatchments of farm group had an opposite trend in average daily streamflow relative to the above subcatchments but similar seasonally independent regulation effects on streamflow and baseflow in the subcatchments of mps no 3 and 5 average daily streamflow increased in summer and autumn 4 while decreasing in spring and winter 2 in the subcatchment of mps no 9 similar variations occurred in spring summer and autumn 2 1 and 1 respectively but a reverse trend was found in winter 2 further average daily baseflow simulations within the three subcatchments suggested marked attenuations in autumn and winter 7 to 25 yet comparatively smaller attenuations in spring and summer 3 despite a marginal increase 0 23 in spring for the subcatchment of mps no 5 again average daily quickflow in the three subcatchments increased across seasons by 6 15 the subcatchment of village group also had contrasting simulations relative to the baseline simulations the subcatchment of mps no 2 witnessed a moderate attenuation in average daily streamflow 12 to 17 despite that a smaller decline was found in the subcatchment of mps no 4 5 to 8 attenuation in average daily baseflow was similar and drastic 19 to 46 in the two subcatchments but increase in average daily quickflow was observed to be greater across seasons in mps no 4 17 20 than that in mps no 2 9 15 3 4 catchment water balance and extreme hydrographs to assess the aggregated regulation effects of all mpss simulated catchment water balance of the all ponds lost scenario was compared with that of the baseline scenario table 5 results indicated that potential evapotranspiration pet values decreased slightly after filling the mpss area proportion at 5 and replacing with agricultural land especially in spring and summer 0 6 such attenuation was more notable in et which was 4 across the years and had two low values in summer 5 5 and autumn 5 similarly the soil water content of the catchment declined across seasons at 7 to 4 without the pond water storage and intra catchment fill spill processes surface flow at the outlet significantly increased by 13 overall and peaked in summer by 15 groundwater flow however declined across seasons 20 to 11 and reached the minimum value in winter total water yield at the catchment outlet decreased by 3 overall which almost levelled off during spring and summer 0 4 yet decreased markedly during autumn and winter 6 simulated hydrographs of the baseline and all ponds lost scenario were further inspected to assess the mps aggregated regulation effect on hydrologic extremes the screened events included short term and heavy rainfall fig 7 a smaller but intermittent rainfall fig 7b and two severe droughts for the peripheral regions each lasting more than a month fig 7c and d results suggested that flood resilience of mpss was more pronounced during heavier rainfall as the simulated streamflow in the baseline scenario exhibited 0 4 m3 s 1 28 less than that of the all ponds lost scenario during the largest rainy day in fig 7a while such difference averaged at 0 05 m3 s 1 20 during the three rainfall peaks in fig 7b the hydrographs of the two scenarios intersected as time went on after the rainfall events when the streamflow returned to baseflow in fig 7c and during the dry days in fig 7d the average daily values in the baseline scenario increased by 26 0 01 m3 s 1 relative to that in the all ponds lost scenario indicating that the presence of mpss resulted in consistently higher simulated baseflow compared to that in their absence 4 discussion 4 1 multiscale hydrologic regulation of mpss small scattered wetlands such as vernal pools prairie potholes and cypress domes provide numerous ecosystem services by altering the distribution and form of water resources locally and regionally verhoeven et al 2006 hill et al 2018 golden et al 2019 among these wetlands mpss which date back over 2000 years are often dominant on small farms in southern china but are poorly quantified regarding their intra catchment hydrologic processes yu 2015 chen et al 2019 liu et al 2009 in this context the hydrologic regulation of mps were explored over numerous scales via an enhanced semi distributed and semi physically based swat model which includes the following advancements 1 parameterizing the cascading fill spill relationships of pond to pond and pond to stream in a spatially explicit pond representation framework 2 estimating bidirectional surface and subsurface water exchange for each pond according to the water level gradients with surrounding drinking water wells and 3 employing rule based artificial intelligence for model calibration and validation to elucidate mps structures i e ponds with perennial or intermittent spillage connections previous studies have concluded that wetlands attenuate peak flows at the catchment scale feng et al 2013 golden et al 2014 lee et al 2018 yeo et al 2019 this axiom was supported by our hydrograph comparisons between the baseline and all ponds lost simulations as peak flows reduced more than 20 during the heavy rainfall events in fig 7a and b in addition to the intermediate pond water storage flood resilience was mainly due to the cascading fill spill processes of identified mpss which reinforced the lag effect summarized by rains et al 2016 when rainfall occurred within swat mps water first entered the ponds via direct precipitation and drainage i e surface runoff while overflow to the main stream only occurred when all upgradient ponds in the mps structure were filled moreover the lag effect can also increase flood residence times rahman et al 2016 evenson et al 2018a ameli and creed 2019 but this was not apparent in our small catchment fig 7a and b instead the hydrographs of the two scenarios intersected when streamflow returned to baseflow several days after rainfall peaks in fig 7c and d indicating that mpss increased soil water content and groundwater flow via the relatively slow infiltration process and thus raised baseflow at the catchment outlet these inferences were consistent with the simulated catchment water balance in table 4 as decreased percentage of soil water content and groundwater flow were revealed after filling the mpss meanwhile pond spillage was equally important according to the average daily baseflow and quickflow in table 4 and surface and groundwater flow in table 5 hence comparing with low relief and geologically young landscapes in the us southeastern coastal plain evenson et al 2018b lee et al 2018 yeo et al 2019 and polder areas in netherlands yu et al 2018 and taihu lake basin yan et al 2016 where groundwater plays a dominant role in the hydrologic circle situations of mpss in low mountains and hills are different at the mps scale the effect of baseflow support and quickflow attenuation was consistent but varied in degree across different mpss and seasons table 3 such differences can be attributed to pond intrinsic characteristics e g water storage connectivity and bidirectional exchange with shallow groundwater and extrinsic factors of subcatchment e g slope landuse types and soil attributes and precipitation e g intensity duration and concentration golden et al 2014 yasarer et al 2018 jones et al 2019 under the same rainfall conditions but disparate subcatchment factors rda was performed to discuss the influences of pond characteristics on baseflow and quickflow variations in the 3 mps groups forest farm and village narrated in section 3 3 fig 8 results indicated apparent influence of pond water storage for baseflow support and the correlation ranked forest farm village group in our study catchment we attributed the strongest linkage to the low human disturbance and large drainage area that associated with pond water storage in the natural woodlands and the weakest linkage to the impervious land surface and low positions of the village where baseflow may primarily come from upgradient subcatchments moreover the influence of pond water storage was stronger than spillage in the forest group but slightly weaker than that in the farm group such difference was consistent with the complexity of surface water connections in the two groups where the pervasive and interlaced ditch network in the farmland can contribute to a more spatially enough baseflow support liu et al 2009 tan et al 2018 for quickflow attenuation the influence of pond spillage was stronger in the forest group than that in the village group while the correlation was found negative in the farm group we attributed the relative stronger correlation to the concurrent flow path of pond to pond and pond to stream in the woodlands while the negative correlation in the farmland to 1 intentional blockage of the ditch network during rainfall to increase pond water storage and reduce farmland soil erosion chen et al 2019 and 2 perennial saturated high water level condition of some downgradient aquaculture ponds e g no 8 and no 18 that may adversely contribute to a higher flood peak mitsuo et al 2014 wu et al 2020 due to the indirect regulation effect that determined by pond water level the influence of bidirectional water exchange was rather limited comparing to water storage and spillage fig 8 even so the correlation of groundwater recharge and quickflow attenuation was demonstrated across all mps groups owing to the increased travel time and hydrologic path golden et al 2014 our findings including 1 the ranked level of pond water storage for baseflow support across different landuse groups and 2 the inversed correlation of pond spillage to baseflow and quickflow variation in the farmland presented site specific answers to the long standing question about how intrinsic characteristics and extrinsic landuse types jointly affect the hydrologic regulation of wetlands rains et al 2016 golden et al 2019 jones et al 2019 the total explained variance of the two axes in rda 40 however revealed other potential but stronger correlation factors such as precipitation intensity and duration which develop further research interests applicable to larger watershed and river basins but was beyond the scope of the current study according to the simulated water balance at the pond scale 27 out of the 30 ponds had water storage throughout the simulation period as small scattered wetlands are reported to dry out in other landscapes williams and fryirs 2016 poschlod and braun reichert 2017 evenson et al 2018b we attributed the submerged conditions to the humid climate that produces direct precipitation and drainage to single ponds and more importantly the cascading fill spill processes that keep balanced water storage across all ponds in the mps structure moreover 8 ponds 27 in total of the 7 structures simultaneously provided spillage to the main stream and received spillage from upgradient ponds fig 6 the average daily overflow provided and received by these ponds totaled 1 37 and 0 72 mm converted to runoff depth and excluded evapotranspiration losses which took 59 and 31 of the catchment water yield in table 4 and again portrayed a nonnegligible role of pond fill spill processes to the catchment hydrology different from analytical scenarios that partition the wetlands according to their distance to streams evenson et al 2018a golden et al 2019 or their spatial distribution in the catchment e g upstream midstream and downstream hansen et al 2018 lee et al 2018 our study elucidated the actual connecting structures and quantified the hydrologic components of each pond mps and entire catchment which support and refine the emerging findings that wetland connectivity and hydrologic fluxes are crucial to their catchment functions in addition to the number area and distribution cohen et al 2016 lane et al 2018 ameli and creed 2019 4 2 implications for management with an estimated global loss of about 35 since the 1970s wetlands are one of the most threatened ecosystems and are central to meeting many of the united nations 17 sustainable development goals gardner and finlayson 2018 although a no net loss target for wetlands has been set in many nations most conservation policies ignore small scattered waters resulting in hidden loss of wetland functions behind the reported paper offsets un water 2018 xu et al 2019 following our findings that both pond water storage and spillage connections are important to their hydrologic regulation conservation efforts do not necessarily require expensive engineering measures to create new wetlands but need to maintain and optimize the perennial or intermittent surface water connections between the existing ones a relevant practice is pond and ditch dredging to reduce siltation during agricultural slack seasons in china and japan which is traditional cost efficient but increasingly ignored owing to the limited short term economic benefit yin et al 2006 mitsuo et al 2014 yu et al 2015 hence we propose encouragement and revitalization of similar traditional measures to ensure connections and flowing waters for wetland functions not limited to mpss in the chinese context but similar small scattered wetlands elsewhere tested in low mountains and hills under a humid subtropical climate our work confirmed that incorporating intra catchment observations benefits wetland and catchment modelling yen et al 2016 golden et al 2017 lane et al 2018 to acquire generalized knowledge on mpss hydrologic regulation and guide pond management in larger watersheds and river basins we call on several measures to improve the monitoring system and possible data scarcities first to place an emphasis on pond mapping as these small scattered waters are usually disregarded in wetland inventories tiner et al 2015 wu 2018 concerted efforts from government sectors including water resources agriculture and rural development are preferred since our interviews with the local farmers indicated that mps structures are easily damaged by agricultural activities and even filled during land consolidation long 2014 second to encourage long term monitoring on pond dynamics such as water level variations despite the reported deficiencies since the 2000s whigham and jordan 2003 hill et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 facilitated by various smart devices and wireless networks this work can be voluntarily or encouraged through incentives by locals after holding workshops to reinforce their responsibility as pond managers as has been tested in farmer participatory rural reform in our study catchment chen et al 2018 furthermore remote sensing techniques including light detection and ranging lidar synthetic aperture radar sar and multispectral scanning mss have inherent abilities to characterize these waters chen et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and can cross validate and reduce uncertainties of the simulated fill spill processes reported roles of small scattered wetlands go beyond hydrologic regulation and include nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus buffers to safeguard downstream rivers and lakes against eutrophication verhoeven et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 xia et al 2018 as well as freshwater habitats and refuges for endangered plants invertebrates and amphibians mitsuo et al 2014 williams and fryirs 2016 poschlod and braun reichert 2017 partly driven by the submerged conditions and perennial or intermittent water connections the environmental and ecological concerns have become a well studied topic in large aquatic systems such as dam regulated rivers grantham et al 2014 but are seldom assessed in conjunction with the hydrologic regulation of mps during rural planning and pond management based on identified direction and magnitude of pond overflow hydrodynamic models such as water quality analysis simulation program wasp and environmental fluid dynamics code efdc have potential to reveal the flow paths within ponds and ditches and their associated influences on the surrounding water quality and flora and fauna hence the integration of these models was recommended to make wider application of our detailed hydrologic assessment and identify the overlapped or interlaced hotspots of mpss that require particular conservation efforts 4 3 improved model limitations and recommendations we present a novel contribution toward quantifying the intra catchment processes of small scattered wetlands compared to previous studies however all modelling methods necessarily have limitations for example the direction and magnitude of pond spillage i e p pond and p stream was inversely identified by streamflow and water level variations in conjunction with the pre defined production rules and ga based parameter optimization screening from several qualified ga populations the rule based artificial intelligence was validated by the statistical criteria but brought uncertainties during subcatchment delineation and rule formulation owing to the multiple ponds within a single subcatchment fig 3a and various fill spill possibilities between different subcatchments table 1 in view of the increased errors of simulated water level from upstream to downstream narrated in section 3 1 the uncertainties may be minimized by reducing the subcatchment size so that each one contains a single pond representation but may also increase the rule complexity and screening procedures to obtain qualified parameter values to balance their respective complexity and model performance the relationship between pond number in each subcatchment and rule based fill spill possibility requires further digestion although the present method is effective in depicting intra catchment processes and its swat independent implementations are referential to similar catchment modelling our swat enhancements did not necessarily signify improved model performance as measured by standard statistical criteria to verify this point an original swat with default pond representation was applied in the study catchment during the 2 year simulation period using the calibrated parameters of swat mps in the baseline scenario the original model had daily kge and pbias values of 0 73 and 0 09 for streamflow simulations respectively comparing with the performance in section 3 1 the two models resulted in relatively similar kge values while the original model tended to underestimate streamflow pbias value of 0 09 and the new model tended to overestimate streamflow pbias value of 0 11 relative to the employed parameters that govern the rate of water transport in the simulated main stream i e ch n2 and ch k2 several swat extensions can potentially improve the performance of streamflow simulation in the new model such as explicit representations of riparian wetlands and tributary ditches and streams rahman et al 2016 as well as water pumping from streams to ponds that usually happens before irrigation seasons to increase pond water storage tan et al 2018 however streamflow oriented model improvements are not enough for swat mps partly because of the equifinality phenomenon in auto calibration i e several different combinations of model parameters can result in similar predictions efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 yen et al 2016 and partly the ignorance of intra catchment processes in performance evaluation including pond spillage connections variations in submerged area and bidirectional exchanges with shallow groundwater future work must evaluate swat mps against more diverse monitoring data over longer simulation periods for example the bidirectional exchange is recognized as an important hydrologic component of pond water balance in humid agricultural regions golden et al 2014 ameli and creed 2017 yeo et al 2019 however swat mps employed an aggregate rate of vertical and lateral seepage owing to the parameterization of only one hydraulic conductivity value to simulate seepage from hrus calibrated by water level gradients between ponds and drinking water wells the vertical exchange was separated and valued between 2 89 and 1 23 mm d 1 for the study catchment table 2 on the condition that wells are deep to the same aquifer this areal result was approximate to swat simulations in peripheral catchments lin et al 2013 but requires downscaling before comparing with soil seepage observations at the slope scale vanderlinden et al 2012 li et al 2015 moreover other field observations such as streamflow between some large perennially connected ponds chemical and isotopic tracings thorslund et al 2018 and microbial communities and indicators mushet et al 2019 can be used to validate the spillage connections that characterize mpss a combined use of these datasets over longer periods can enhance mpss multiscale hydrologic assessment under various precipitation conditions and advance our understanding of how small scattered wetlands affect catchment functions via their structures and processes 5 conclusions assessing wetland hydrologic processes over numerous scales is crucial in understanding their ecosystem services especially nutrient buffering in this study we demonstrate a novel approach to quantify the multiscale hydrologic regulation of multipond systems mpss a common type of small scattered wetland in humid agricultural regions our new model dubbed swat mps incorporated improved representations of 1 cascading fill spill relationships of pond to pond and pond to stream and 2 bidirectional exchange between pond surface water and shallow groundwater using rule based knowledge integration and ga based parameter optimization swat mps successfully replicated streamflow and pond water level variations in the 4 8 km2 test catchment southern china water balance analysis revealed the presence of 9 series or series parallel connected mpss in which pond overflow accounted for as much as 59 of the catchment water yield scenario simulations revealed seasonally and mps independent baseflow support and quickflow attenuation at the mps scale while at the catchment scale mpss in aggregate reduced flood peaks by 20 and increased baseflow by 26 in the following dry days redundancy analysis further discovered 1 ranked level of pond water storage for baseflow support across different landuse types forest farm village and 2 inversed correlation of pond spillage to baseflow and quickflow variations in the farmland preliminary meteorological data analysis and resulting average daily values confirmed the credibility of our mps hydrologic patterns even if extending the 2 year simulation to longer periods this study underscores mps s water storage and connectivity in its flood and drought resilience and encourages inventories long term field monitoring and integration of hydrodynamic models for integrated pond management in watersheds and river basins despite potential research directions such as balancing the complexity of subcatchment and production rules to reduce pond fill spill uncertainties and incorporating diverse long term monitoring data to fully reflect pond dynamics in performance evaluation our model enhancements and analytical results serve as a first exploration on the intra catchment hydrologic details of mpss in the chinese context they

17676,assessing the hydrologic processes over scales ranging from single wetland to regional is critical to understand the hydrologically driven ecosystem services especially nutrient buffering of wetlands here we present a novel approach to quantify the multiscale hydrologic regulation of multipond systems mpss a common type of small scattered wetland in humid agricultural regions because previous studies have stopped in commending the catchment scale flood and drought resilience of these waters and contemporary models do not adequately represent the corresponding intra catchment fill spill relationships a new version of soil and water assessment tool swat was developed to incorporate improved representation of 1 perennial or intermittent spillage connections of pond to pond and pond to stream and 2 bidirectional exchange between pond surface water and shallow groundwater we present swat mps which adopts rule based artificial intelligence to model the possibilities of different spillage directions and ga based parameter optimization over the two simulation years june 2017 to may 2019 with successfully replicated streamflow and pond water level variations in a 4 8 km2 test catchment southern china water balance analysis and scenario simulations were then executed to assess the hydrologic regulation at single pond single mps and entire catchment scales results revealed 1 the presence of 9 series or series parallel connected mpss in which pond overflow accounted for as much as 59 of the catchment water yield 2 seasonally and mps independent baseflow support and quickflow attenuation with ranked level of pond water storage for baseflow support across different landuse types forest farm village and inversed correlation of pond spillage to baseflow and quickflow variations in the farmland and 3 mps aggregated catchment flood peak reduction 20 and baseflow increment 26 in the following dry days meteorological data analysis and simulated average daily values indicated these hydrologic patterns are credible even if extending to a 5 year period as a first modelling attempt to explore the intra catchment details of mpss our study underscores the water storage and connectivity in their hydrologic regulation and suggests inventories long term field monitoring and several research directions of the new model for integrated pond management in watersheds and river basins these findings can inform refined assessment of similar small scattered wetlands elsewhere where restoration efforts are required keywords hydrologic regulation small scattered wetlands multipond systems cascading fill spill relationships soil and water assessment tool rule based artificial intelligence 1 introduction wetlands provide a portfolio of ecosystem services from floodwater storage to pollutant removal habitat provision and microclimate regulation these services are governed to a large extent by the hydrologic processes that occur within wetlands and interactions with the catchment in which the wetlands are located cohen et al 2016 lane et al 2018 chen et al 2019 understanding the hydrologic processes and assessing their regulation effects over scales ranging from single wetland to regional is a historical challenge of earth system sciences rains et al 2016 ameli and creed 2017 these knowledges also serve as a prerequisite for developing best management practices bmps low impact development lid and natural based solutions nbss when addressing a range of environmental and socioeconomic challenges toward sustainable development un water 2018 unep 2019 multipond systems mpss traditional and semi artificial water conservancy projects are a common type of wetland in southern china yin and shan 2001 verhoeven et al 2006 liu et al 2009 an mps typically consists of several ponds scattered aside farmland and cottages fig 1 a these ponds are natural surface depressions that permanently or temporarily hold water and then gradually become dammed and partly connected by ditches to stabilize water storage such ponds are regular features of the landscape owing to the low cost of construction and maintenance high efficiency in irrigation and drainage and value for multiple uses including drinking cleaning and fishing first constructed in the 200s before common era mpss are now widespread with an estimated total amount exceeding 6 million yu et al 2015 distributions shown in fig 1b although we discuss the chinese context similar small scattered wetlands with perennial or intermittent surface water connections are also reported in other humid agricultural regions such as the north american coastal plain evenson et al 2018b golden et al 2019 the mediterranean basin poschlod and braun reichert 2017 and the southern highlands of australia williams and fryirs 2016 in catchments with mpss rainfall initially fills shallow ponds and then runs off along the ditches to downgradient ponds and other waters this process helps to reduce flood peaks contribute to groundwater recharge and provides baseflow for irrigation golden et al 2014 rains et al 2016 for example the 193 ponds were found to reduce annual irrigation water shortages from 306 26 to 89 48 mm in the liuchahe catchment anhui province yin et al 2006 during a heavy rainfall event 141 mm d 1 these ponds reduced the flood peak from 2 5 to 0 3 m3 s 1 liu et al 2009 although hydrologic regulation of these small scattered wetlands has been widely and quantitatively recognized at catchment scales wang et al 2008 longbucco 2010 feng et al 2013 three scientific questions remain regarding their intra catchment processes 1 how to specify the pond fill spill relationship among the pervasive and interlaced ditch network 2 to elucidate the structure of mpss in which ponds are perennially or intermittently connected and 3 to assess their hydrologic regulation over scales ranging from single pond to single mps and entire catchment recent advances in geospatial data and analytics have enabled process based watershed models such as soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological simulation program fortran hspf and annualized agricultural non point source pollution model annagnps to incorporate small scattered wetlands golden et al 2017 chen et al 2018a yasarer et al 2018 relative to lumped wetland parameter representation wang et al 2008 feng et al 2013 the spatially explicit representation with physical and functional attributes e g submerged area and storage capacity provides feasible means for detailed assessments on these waters evenson et al 2015 2018b yasarer et al 2018 yeo et al 2019 however model limitations still exist for consideration of mpss notable processes represented include bidirectional exchanges between ponded water and shallow groundwater rains et al 2016 and cascading fill spill relationships between intermittently connected ponds yu et al 2015 the latter has been observed as an important hydrologic component but is not well resolved in previous studies owing to the difficulties in depicting the hydrologic path of ditches even from high resolution digital elevation models dems and remote sensing imagery wu 2018 chen et al 2019 furthermore the availability of measured data has limited further exploration on these intra catchment hydrologic details requiring both streamflow and pond dynamics for parameter estimation yen et al 2016 over the past decades small scattered wetlands such as mpss have faced a severe decline in numbers and malfunctions in terms of ecosystem services owing to expanding urbanization agricultural intensification and centralized irrigation hill et al 2018 chen et al 2019 while little environmental legislation has focused on pond conservation several policies and regulations have gradually acknowledged their importance such as the headwater environment remediation in china s river chief mechanism that clarifies the responsibilities of different government sectors dai 2019 and pond planning and dredging in beautiful rural development that pursues both ecological and economic well being long 2014 pond prioritization and management for environmentalists and rural planners also requires detailed assessments on the structures and processes of these waters to achieve the potential benefits of mpss given the above scientific challenges and management deficiencies this study presents a novel modelling approach to explore the multiscale hydrologic regulation of mpss in humid agricultural catchments the headwaters of two basins of environmental concern the taihu lake basin and qinhuai river basin fig 1b were selected as a test bed a new version of swat v 2012 rev 670 was developed to represent mps hereafter referred to as swat mps so that intermittent spillage connections between ponds and their bidirectional exchanges with shallow groundwater can be better represented swat mps was set up with both streamflow and pond water level variations and calibrated using rule based artificial intelligence the simulations were conducted under two contrasting land use scenarios to assess changes in the hydrologic components of ponds mpss and the entire catchment followed by discussions on their multiscale hydrologic regulation implications for management and modelling recommendations as a first modelling exploration on the intra catchment hydrologic details of mpss the proposed methods and analytical results can better quantify the water transport and distribution in catchments with small scattered wetlands they can also help inform the management and conservation efforts in the context of global wetland degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study catchment 31 42 n 118 18 e is characterized by traditional agricultural practices densely distributed ponds and a humid subtropical monsoon climate fig 2 a a 5 m resolution dem from the jiangsu provincial bureau of surveying and mapping shows that the 4 8 km2 catchment is surrounded by low mountains and hills rising from 62 to 295 m fig 2b according to chen et al 2018a the soil types include eutric planosols haplic luvisols and dystric regosols fig 2c which are composed of silty loam and loam textures at the top soil layer and sandy loam and clay loam textures below with saturated hydraulic conductivity values of 9 2 210 5 and 2 1 38 8 mm h 1 respectively calculated by saxton and rawls 2005 in addition to agricultural land paddy fields dry farmland and tea gardens totaling 29 the catchment consists of woods deciduous and evergreen forests at 63 waters ponds and streams at 5 and rural residential areas 3 as extracted from a 0 5 m panchromatic satellite image taken in 2017 fig 2d two year june 2017 to may 2019 complete data including daily meteorological conditions and variations of streamflow pond water level and shallow groundwater table was prepared while the former

small variations 8 to 3 fig a1 in relative percentage changes on the average daily values of precipitation maximum minimum temperature and sunshine duration of the 2 years to past half decade with fixed ground conditions including dem soil type and land use variations on these key meteorological variables of a watershed model indicated that the credibility of subsequent hydrologic patterns of test mpss is beyond the 2 year period with complete data daily streamflow at the catchment outlet was estimated using a pre established hspf model for the past 4 years chen et al 2018a which was calibrated with measurements of a portable propeller type current meter and later a fixed parshall flume in the midstream and validated with daily average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and r 2 0 8 among the 30 ponds in total area 100 m2 9 were selected and gaged with the hobo u20l https www onsetcomp com for water level observation according to the jenks natural breaks of pond elevation storage capacity and submerged area manual irrigation pumping of these ponds was also investigated pond bathymetry was surveyed and integrated with the surrounding dem topography to derive the relationship between water level storage and submerged area for each pond see chen et al 2018b for detailed procedures furthermore underlain by a confining unit 30 m below the peripheral regions have a shallow groundwater table 6 m below the surface geological bureau of jiangsu province 1980 water level variations in 6 drinking water wells which locate in and adjacent to the catchment and are deep to the same aquifer were therefore monitored for the estimation of shallow groundwater table after establishing the thiessen polygons of the wells and catchment boundary using arctoolbox http desktop arcgis com 2 2 the swat mps model 2 2 1 default wetland modelling in swat swat is an open source semi distributed and semi physically based watershed model that has been widely applied to examine the impacts of agricultural land management on water resources and water quality constituents arnold et al 2012 hydrologic simulation in swat is first performed at the hydrologic response unit hru a combination of soil landuse and slope that determines rainfall runoff characteristics level and then aggregated at the subwatershed and routed to the watershed outlet following the stream network in this process wetlands can be modelled at the subwatershed scale in which all wetlands are depicted via aggregated or lumped parameters wang et al 2008 or at the hru scale which enables a customized inflow proportion from a single hru or subset of all hrus for each wetland feng et al 2013 golden et al 2014 the two modes share a common water balance equation which is expressed as 1 Œ¥ v p et q in q out q seep where Œ¥ v is the change in wetland water volume during a given time step m3 p is the water volume entering as precipitation m3 q in and q out are the water volume flowing in and out m3 and et and q seep are the water volume lost via evapotranspiration and seepage m3 further details on these parameters are described in arnold et al 2012 kang and sridhar 2017 and sridhar et al 2019 the swat default wetland model has substantial limitations when assessing the intra catchment hydrologic processes of mpss first pond inflows are determined by empirical or constant parameters in both of the two modes rather than their actual distribution and drainage characteristics while pond outflows i e spillage are directly routed to streams ignoring possible fill spill relationships with downgradient ponds ameli and creed 2017 jones et al 2019 second pond subsurface outflows i e seepage are identified at a constant rate dictated by soil saturated hydraulic conductivity values and soil water content this simplification precludes representation of changes in head gradients between these waters and surrounding uplands which drive the direction and magnitude of local groundwater exchange foglia et al 2007 golden et al 2014 the above limitations of original swat stem from the structural representation of hru for ponds and their drainage areas as well as process representation of the water balance equation that ignores the cascading fill spill processes and bidirectional exchange with shallow groundwater 2 2 2 improved representation of mpss significant efforts have been made to enhance process representation of wetlands in swat and to set up more spatially explicit wetland parameters relevant improvements include 1 delineating upland to wetland drainage relationships and constraining wetland surface and subsurface inflows according to actual spatial positioning evenson et al 2015 yasarer et al 2018 yeo et al 2019 and 2 supporting bidirectional exchange between wetland surface and subsurface water as a function of time varying head gradients with the water content in soil profiles cohen et al 2016 evenson et al 2018b on this basis swat mps was developed to better present mpss by 1 enabling pond to pond and pond to stream fill spill relationships especially for those between different subcatchments as the intermittent water connections are determined by pond water storage and surrounding microtopography but usually unidentifiable even from high resolution geospatial datasets and 2 estimating pond surface and subsurface water exchange according to head gradients between ponds and drinking water wells as the latter are common easily accessible and can reflect areal shallow groundwater table when deep to the same aquifer in low mountains and hills following evenson et al 2015 2018b the swat hrus were first redefined as the combination of soil landuse slope and the fourth attribute of pond drainage area so that the upland drainage relationship of each pond is spatially explicit fig 3 a in this process the drainage area was depicted via the multiple flow direction approach tarboton 2005 and new model input files were added to enhance the structural attributes of pond hrus implemented by the matrix data structure in the python scientific library i e numpy https www numpy org each pond can then receive spillage from upgradient ponds and overflow to its subcatchment reach and downgradient ponds in and out of the same subcatchment to restore an intermittent fill spill relationship that may not presented by subcatchment delineation fig 3a furthermore the relationship between water storage and submerged area was discretized at 0 1 m water level intervals while the total outflow magnitude was estimated via the flow calculation formula of broad crested weirs see herschy 2008 for detailed procedures and surveyed practice of irrigation pumping for each pond the hydrologic processes of pond hrus are extended and reimplemented to better represent the fill spill relationship within an mps and bidirectional exchange between pond surface water and shallow groundwater hence pond hrus are resolved into two parts the pond portion fig 3b marked in blue and soil and aquifer portion fig 3b marked in green the water balance of the pond portion is described as 2 Œ¥ v pond p et q surf q spill out q spill in q local where Œ¥ v pond is the change in pond water volume during a given time step m3 p and et are water volume entering as precipitation and lost via evapotranspiration m3 from the time varying submerged area q surf is the surface runoff m3 entering from pond drainage hrus q spill out and q spill in are surface water m3 leaving and entering via the fill spill processes which are depicted through the following equations 3 q spill out i m p pond i q spill out p stream q spill out 4 q spill in i n p pond i q spill out where m and n are the total number of ponds that receive and provide spillage respectively p pond i is the proportion of total spillage that routes to the i th pond while p stream is the proportion that routes to the subcatchment reach note that the summation of i m p pond i and p stream equals 1 q local is the net subsurface flow m3 entering and leaving via local exchange with underlying soil and shallow aquifers which is estimated by head gradients between ponds and drinking water wells according to darcy s law sophocleous 2002 hence q local is simulated as 5 q local k sat s bottom i m h pond h well i l i w i where k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m day 1 of the pond s substrate s bottom is the time varying submerged area m2 on the integrated bathymetric and terrain surface h pond and h well i are water levels m in the pond and i

was depicted as entering from the underlying soil layer and shallow aquifers if surrounding water table height exceeded pond water level h well h pond and in turn leaving the pond if the water level exceeded surrounding water table height h pond h well beneath the pond portion the soil layer and aquifer portion of pond hru is simulated as 6 Œ¥ v beneath q lat in q lat out q local q gw where Œ¥ v

model calibration and validation daily streamflow in original swat was first prepared over 4 seasonal years june 2015 to may 2019 after a 3 year warm up period june 2012 to may 2015 to get basic parameter ranges and catchment conditions swat mps was then calibrated and validated against daily streamflow and pond water level variations over the latest 2 years june 2017 to may 2019 here seasons were defined as spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to february according to the subtropical climate the calibration and validation practice include parameter sensitivity analysis rule based knowledge integration genetic algorithm ga based parameter optimization cross validation and goodness of fit assessment fig 4 the initial sensitivity analysis was executed using both one at a time and global sensitivity analysis in the swat cup software package abbaspour 2013 with full physically meaningful value ranges suggested by arnold et al 2012 and abbaspour 2013 the sensitive parameters of original swat in conjunction with the above new ones for pond hydrologic processes i e p pond p stream and k sat are employed for the following procedures 2 3 1 rule based fill spill relationship calibrated by streamflow measurements hydrologic models usually lack accurate intra catchment simulations despite satisfactory results at the catchment outlet efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 two major difficulties emerged with respect to swat mps calibration and validation 1 overall rationality parameter estimation on a single pond cannot guarantee appropriate value sets as the fill spill processes may be associated with several upgradient and downgradient ponds meanwhile the catchment rainfall runoff and aggregated regulation of all mpss jointly influence the outlet streamflow 2 uncertainties in the direction and magnitude of pond overflow the cascading fill spill processes of an mps are affected by the ponds low lying terrain the pervasive and interlaced ditch networks microtopography in farmland and various rainfall intensity yu et al 2015 chen et al 2019 these factors are difficult to monitor and model and are usually changed by agricultural practices resulting in uncertainties in the direction and magnitude of pond overflow to cope with the above difficulties and narrow the value range of pond representation parameters production rules which originated from artificial intelligence engelmore and feigenbaum 1993 were introduced to integrate field experience and model the fill spill possibility between pond to pond and pond to stream according to the strahler s stream order scheidegger et al 1965 a binary tree was first established to present the hierarchical and topological relationship of all subcatchments fig 4a using a basic structure of if condition then consequence 4 production rules were designed and set priority tokens for possible overflow between ponds in single or multiple subcatchments table 1 ordered by rule id the fill spill processes are more likely to happen between ponds in subcatchments with a closer topological relationship after replacing the downgradient pond i e pondj in table 1 with main stream in these rules another 4 rules were created for the spillage between pond to stream and in aggregate implemented for the following parameter optimization 2 3 2 ga based parameter optimization genetic algorithms ga originally proposed by goldberg 1989 are increasingly used in parameter estimation of hydrologic modelling due to the advantages in global optimization shafii and smedt 2009 chlumeck√Ω et al 2017 following sensitivity analysis and rule based knowledge integration the original swat and new pond representation parameters were subsequently optimized using a python based evolutionary computation framework i e deap https pypi org project deap against daily streamflow at the catchment outlet and water level variations in the selected ponds the ga optimization was performed in the following 4 steps and then repeated 100 times to evaluate the stability of ga and acquire 20 optimal parameter value sets fig 4b after comparing with the parameter value ranges reported by arnold et al 2012 abbaspour 2013 and lin et al 2013 the most reasonable set was manually selected considering both model performance and actual fill spill relationships that have been partly surveyed in the field 1 population initialization two hundred initial parameter sets population were generated for the first ga run parameters were encoded in the form of a substring and linked together to form one individual while their values were randomly generated within the pre defined ranges 2 fitness evaluation during the training period the fitness f of each individual was evaluated by a fitness function based on the root mean square error rmse of streamflow and pond water level which is described as 7 f 1 i 1 n j 1 m p ij obs p ij sim 2 m k j 1 m s j obs s j sim 2 m where p ij obs and p ij sim are observed and simulated water level for the i th pond on j th day respectively s j obs and s j sim are observed and simulated streamflow on j th day as a weight coefficient k took the same value as n to balance the two types of measurement ranging from 0 to a higher f value implied a lower rmse value and higher fitness 3 reproduction aimed to create the next generations by selecting individuals with a higher fitness value f and endowing them with a higher chance to reproduce hence the overall model fit of the individuals is gradually improved over 300 generations 4 crossover and mutation were expected to increase population diversity and generate dissimilar individuals parameter values with the high model fit for each generation 65 of the individuals were randomly selected for the crossover process which generated new individuals by slightly changing parameter values to derive the different magnitude of pond overflow meanwhile mutation introduced random change to the parameter values of 25 of individuals in which the above 8 production rules were implemented by probabilistic events to generate different spillage directions further details on the ga implementation can be found in shafii and smedt 2009 and fortin et al 2012 2 3 3 cross validation and goodness of fit assessment a k fold cross validation was employed for model validation owing to the relatively short period of measured data fig 4c the streamflow and water level variations of the 2 years were first divided into 4 subsets according to the seasons in each of the 4 cross validation processes 3 subsets were held for the above parameter optimization while the remaining one was used for model validation hence each subset of the measured data was used once for validation and 4 models were generated accordingly finally the parameter values of the 4 models were averaged and performed on the complete data for the goodness of fit assessment further theoretical basis and calculation processes for the cross validation are described in foglia et al 2007 and ly et al 2013 the goodness of fit assessment of swat mps covered both streamflow and pond water level simulations two statistical criteria including the kling gupta efficiency kge and percent bias pbias were employed to evaluate the agreements between simulations and measurements fig 4d as a derivative of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse statistic nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kge reduces the inherent tendency of runoff underestimation in nse while allowing for a multi objective perspective by focusing on correlation error variability error and bias error gupta et al 2009 a kge 0 5 recommended by moriasi et al 2007 was set as the threshold value for satisfactory simulations when running the auto calibration program the pbias statistics gupta et al 1999 which compute the average tendency of simulated variables to be larger or smaller than observed variables were used to provide further perspective on the model performance with an optimum value of 0 the pbias values were considered satisfactory between 0 25 for streamflow and intermediate processes as applied in other hydrologic simulations hoang et al 2017 evenson et al 2018b yeo et al 2019 2 4 model output and hydrologic analysis the output of swat mps is organized in three spatial scales including the single pond single mps and entire catchment average daily water balances for the pond portion in each of the pond hru were first summarized across the simulation period average daily streamflow baseflow and quickflow were then collected for each mps and summarized seasonally according to the result direction and magnitude of pond overflow an mps was identified as a collection of ponds with cascading fill spill relationships regardless of whether such connections were serial or parallel in structure and perennial or intermittent in continuity meanwhile quickflow was defined as the quantity of flow occurring immediately after the onset of a rainfall event while baseflow was the quantity of flow after the conclusion of a rainfall event hornberger et al 2014 these two flow components were calculated via swat bflow arnold et al 2012 which implements the baseflow separation methods in arnold and allen 1999 and takes daily streamflow as input last average daily water balance was summarized seasonally at the catchment scale while extreme weather events including floods and droughts were screened to assess the aggregated hydrologic regulation of all mpss two contrasting land use scenarios including the baseline and all ponds lost were simulated to evaluate the relative change in streamflow of identified mpss and catchment water balance the baseline scenario employed the present distribution and connections of mpss while in the all ponds lost scenario mpss were replaced with surrounding agricultural land owing to the pervasive and ever increasing degradation threats hill et al 2018 chen et al 2019 the dem preprocessing tool in arcswat https swat tamu edu software arcswat was employed to fill the surface depressions so that roughly the same subcatchments and hrus were depicted as the baseline scenario redundancy analysis rda was performed using canoco http canoco5 com to examine the influences of pond characteristics including water storage connectivity and bidirectional exchange with shallow groundwater on the streamflow variations as a constrained linear ordination technique rda can condense the information between two sets of variables and reveal the strength and direction of the correlation between them note that before rda data normalization detrended correspondence analysis and a monte carlo permutation test 499 permutations were successively performed while the resulting biplots demonstrate the correlation of two variables via their collinearity i e the two arrows with a smaller angle have a higher correlation and vice versa see lep≈° and ≈°milauer 2003 for further details 3 results 3 1 calibrated parameters and model performance fourteen parameters from the original swat including runoff groundwater soil plant and reach processes as suggested by van griensvan et al 2006 were initially identified by the global sensitivity analysis table 2 to avoid over parameterization yen et al 2016 jones et al 2019 7 statistically significant p 0 05 parameters among the 14 ones in conjunction with the main stream manning s n value ch n2 hydraulic conductivity ch k2 and 3 pond representation parameters were then calibrated in the ga based optimization despite that the ch n2 and ch k2 parameters were not statistically significant they were included to compensate for uncertainties associated with the main stream channelization in the study catchment chen et al 2018a in general the following cross validation resulted in a daily kge value of 0 61 and pbias value of 0 11 for streamflow simulations at the outlet and an average daily kge value of 0 55 and pbias value of 0 13 for water level simulations for the 9 selected ponds the calibrated swat mps was consequently considered satisfactory to represent intra catchment processes of mpss although water level simulations were slightly poorer than those for streamflow the calibrated parameters were evaluated by focusing on the result values to which they represent catchment hydrology and mps dynamics groundwater parameters including sol k rchr dp and gwqmn and pond representation parameters i e p pond p stream and k sat were underlined table 1 the sol k value 3 6 mm h 1 dictated a relative increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the swat hru soil profiles as the local data describes the soil profile as extending to a maximum of 2100 mm below the surface geological bureau of jiangsu province 1980 the rchr dp value 0 24 dictated that 76 of water moving below the soil profile and acting as groundwater recharge within an hru entered the shallow aquifer while the gwqmn value 375 mm dictated a relatively low threshold depth for groundwater leaving from the shallow aquifer to the subcatchment reach the optimized value range of p pond and p stream 0 86 and 0 42 respectively dictated a relatively large proportion of pond water storage that overflowed to downgradient ponds and streams while the k sat values 0 4 1 6 mm h 1 dictated a far lower seepage rate of ponds substrate than the surrounding soil profiles these parameters in concert portrayed a system in which both lateral and vertical water movement exist while the magnitude of pond spillage was prominent both statistical criteria and visual comparison were inspected to verify the model performance the daily streamflow variations were generally replicated at the catchment outlet and most of the lower values particularly 0 1 m3 s 1 were successfully captured fig 5 a however streamflow simulations tended to be overestimated during heavy rainfall events e g july 10 2017 june 5 2018 and august 17 2018 presumably due to the neglect of water storage in tributary ditches and streams with slightly larger but acceptable deviations the 9 selected ponds were divided into 3 groups according to their elevations the average pbias value for the pond group between 90 and 105 m fig 5b c d 75 90 m fig 5e f g and 60 75 m fig 5h i j were 0 07 0 18 and 0 27 respectively indicating that water level simulation errors and associated uncertainties of fill spill processes gradually increased from upstream to downstream moreover ponds in all the 3 groups were generally wetter i e higher water levels and larger submerged areas in the simulation during rainfall periods and drier during rainless periods which was temporally like streamflow simulations 3 2 pond water balance and mps identification the average daily water balance was evaluated to assess the hydrologic component of each pond table 3 across the two year simulation period all 30 ponds had water storage indicated by average daily water depths within the baseline scenario although a few ones i e no 4 no 16 and no 21 dried up for short periods water could enter the ponds via direct precipitation surface inflow from drainage hrus spillage from upgradient ponds and groundwater discharge results demonstrated that direct precipitation was the dominant means of water input for 60 of ponds while surface inflow and spillage served as main water source for another 30 and 10 of ponds respectively water exited the ponds via et spillage and groundwater recharge results demonstrate that et is the dominant means of water exiting for 73 of ponds followed by spillage which agreed with water balance assessments of ponds and reservoirs in humid subtropical climates chen et al 2017 tan et al 2018 the average daily total amount of these two means for all ponds were similar 109 and 93 mm d 1 respectively indicating that most of the spillage was provided by a few ponds moreover the local bidirectional exchange served as groundwater recharge for 67 of ponds and discharge for the rest while their average daily total amount was approximately proportional 23 and 8 mm d 1 respectively last standard deviations of pond average daily water balance components were generally less than that of precipitation table 3 indicating the ground response was smaller than precipitation variation in viewing the meteorological data analysis in section 2 1 simulated hydrologic patterns on the average daily values here and below are credible even if extending to 5 years slight and proportional amplification or reduction is presumably expected according to the average daily magnitude and direction of pond spillage 9 mpss were identified in the catchment fig 6 a the majority of these mpss consisted of several ponds where the cascading fill spill relationship existed between pond to pond and pond to stream a small number of mpss no 2 and 4 in fig 6a consisted of only a single pond but were also numbered for consistency in each mps ponds were series connected e g no 5 7 and 8 or series parallel hybrid connected e g no 1 3 6 and 9 with spillage to the main stream at the end or in the middle of the structure meanwhile mps drainage areas were delineated by merging the drainage area of each pond in the structure fig 6b the total drainage area of all mpss took 76 of the catchment area which partially demonstrated that pond overflow accounted for a large proportion of streamflow at the outlet furthermore the drainage area of mps no 7 8 and 9 was spatially separated despite their internal spillage connections this extraordinary finding proved the existence of fill spill relationships in non adjacent subcatchments which did not follow the subcatchment and stream delineation from the 5 m resolution dem data but can be revealed by our rule based knowledge integration i e higher possibility of spillage connection for ponds in subcatchments with a closer topological relationship and vice versa and associated ga based parameter optimization 3 3 mps s regulation effect on streamflow baseflow and quickflow variations in average daily streamflow baseflow and quickflow of the all ponds lost scenario relative to the baseline scenario were evaluated to assess the hydrologic regulation of each mps the overall findings across the two year simulation period indicated that filling mpss decreased baseflow 5 to 38 increased quickflow 9 19 and produced variations in the sign and magnitude of streamflow for different mps subcatchments see the overall columns in table 4 hence the mpss were organized into 3 control groups according to their streamflow variations these groups were named by the typical landuse types of the mps subcatchment and differed significantly in the average slope mps no 1 6 7 and 8 as forest group woods at 79 agricultural land at 17 and average slope at 16 mps no 3 5 and 9 as farm group agricultural land at 40 woods at 51 and average slope at 11 and mps no 2 and 4 as village group rural residential areas at 39 agricultural land at 37 and average slope at 3 in the subcatchments of forest group average daily streamflow attenuated slightly by 4 relative to the baseline simulations meanwhile streamflow in the subcatchments of farm group witnessed a marginal increase of 2 the subcatchments of village group however presented notably contrasting daily streamflow of an averaged attenuation 10 within the all ponds lost scenario seasonal variations in streamflow baseflow and quickflow of the all ponds lost scenario were then evaluated and it was found that mpss had seasonally independent regulation effect on average daily streamflow and baseflow while quickflow regulation was comparatively consistent across seasons see the season columns in table 3 relative to the baseline simulations for example the subcatchments of forest group produced attenuated average daily streamflow during summer and autumn 2 to 10 but increased average daily streamflow during spring and winter 1 4 the filling of mps in these subcatchments markedly lowered average daily baseflow within summer and autumn 10 to 28 but presented moderate attenuation in spring and winter 6 average daily quickflow in the 4 subcatchments increased across seasons by 8 17 relative to the baseline scenario in the all ponds lost scenario the subcatchments of farm group had an opposite trend in average daily streamflow relative to the above subcatchments but similar seasonally independent regulation effects on streamflow and baseflow in the subcatchments of mps no 3 and 5 average daily streamflow increased in summer and autumn 4 while decreasing in spring and winter 2 in the subcatchment of mps no 9 similar variations occurred in spring summer and autumn 2 1 and 1 respectively but a reverse trend was found in winter 2 further average daily baseflow simulations within the three subcatchments suggested marked attenuations in autumn and winter 7 to 25 yet comparatively smaller attenuations in spring and summer 3 despite a marginal increase 0 23 in spring for the subcatchment of mps no 5 again average daily quickflow in the three subcatchments increased across seasons by 6 15 the subcatchment of village group also had contrasting simulations relative to the baseline simulations the subcatchment of mps no 2 witnessed a moderate attenuation in average daily streamflow 12 to 17 despite that a smaller decline was found in the subcatchment of mps no 4 5 to 8 attenuation in average daily baseflow was similar and drastic 19 to 46 in the two subcatchments but increase in average daily quickflow was observed to be greater across seasons in mps no 4 17 20 than that in mps no 2 9 15 3 4 catchment water balance and extreme hydrographs to assess the aggregated regulation effects of all mpss simulated catchment water balance of the all ponds lost scenario was compared with that of the baseline scenario table 5 results indicated that potential evapotranspiration pet values decreased slightly after filling the mpss area proportion at 5 and replacing with agricultural land especially in spring and summer 0 6 such attenuation was more notable in et which was 4 across the years and had two low values in summer 5 5 and autumn 5 similarly the soil water content of the catchment declined across seasons at 7 to 4 without the pond water storage and intra catchment fill spill processes surface flow at the outlet significantly increased by 13 overall and peaked in summer by 15 groundwater flow however declined across seasons 20 to 11 and reached the minimum value in winter total water yield at the catchment outlet decreased by 3 overall which almost levelled off during spring and summer 0 4 yet decreased markedly during autumn and winter 6 simulated hydrographs of the baseline and all ponds lost scenario were further inspected to assess the mps aggregated regulation effect on hydrologic extremes the screened events included short term and heavy rainfall fig 7 a smaller but intermittent rainfall fig 7b and two severe droughts for the peripheral regions each lasting more than a month fig 7c and d results suggested that flood resilience of mpss was more pronounced during heavier rainfall as the simulated streamflow in the baseline scenario exhibited 0 4 m3 s 1 28 less than that of the all ponds lost scenario during the largest rainy day in fig 7a while such difference averaged at 0 05 m3 s 1 20 during the three rainfall peaks in fig 7b the hydrographs of the two scenarios intersected as time went on after the rainfall events when the streamflow returned to baseflow in fig 7c and during the dry days in fig 7d the average daily values in the baseline scenario increased by 26 0 01 m3 s 1 relative to that in the all ponds lost scenario indicating that the presence of mpss resulted in consistently higher simulated baseflow compared to that in their absence 4 discussion 4 1 multiscale hydrologic regulation of mpss small scattered wetlands such as vernal pools prairie potholes and cypress domes provide numerous ecosystem services by altering the distribution and form of water resources locally and regionally verhoeven et al 2006 hill et al 2018 golden et al 2019 among these wetlands mpss which date back over 2000 years are often dominant on small farms in southern china but are poorly quantified regarding their intra catchment hydrologic processes yu 2015 chen et al 2019 liu et al 2009 in this context the hydrologic regulation of mps were explored over numerous scales via an enhanced semi distributed and semi physically based swat model which includes the following advancements 1 parameterizing the cascading fill spill relationships of pond to pond and pond to stream in a spatially explicit pond representation framework 2 estimating bidirectional surface and subsurface water exchange for each pond according to the water level gradients with surrounding drinking water wells and 3 employing rule based artificial intelligence for model calibration and validation to elucidate mps structures i e ponds with perennial or intermittent spillage connections previous studies have concluded that wetlands attenuate peak flows at the catchment scale feng et al 2013 golden et al 2014 lee et al 2018 yeo et al 2019 this axiom was supported by our hydrograph comparisons between the baseline and all ponds lost simulations as peak flows reduced more than 20 during the heavy rainfall events in fig 7a and b in addition to the intermediate pond water storage flood resilience was mainly due to the cascading fill spill processes of identified mpss which reinforced the lag effect summarized by rains et al 2016 when rainfall occurred within swat mps water first entered the ponds via direct precipitation and drainage i e surface runoff while overflow to the main stream only occurred when all upgradient ponds in the mps structure were filled moreover the lag effect can also increase flood residence times rahman et al 2016 evenson et al 2018a ameli and creed 2019 but this was not apparent in our small catchment fig 7a and b instead the hydrographs of the two scenarios intersected when streamflow returned to baseflow several days after rainfall peaks in fig 7c and d indicating that mpss increased soil water content and groundwater flow via the relatively slow infiltration process and thus raised baseflow at the catchment outlet these inferences were consistent with the simulated catchment water balance in table 4 as decreased percentage of soil water content and groundwater flow were revealed after filling the mpss meanwhile pond spillage was equally important according to the average daily baseflow and quickflow in table 4 and surface and groundwater flow in table 5 hence comparing with low relief and geologically young landscapes in the us southeastern coastal plain evenson et al 2018b lee et al 2018 yeo et al 2019 and polder areas in netherlands yu et al 2018 and taihu lake basin yan et al 2016 where groundwater plays a dominant role in the hydrologic circle situations of mpss in low mountains and hills are different at the mps scale the effect of baseflow support and quickflow attenuation was consistent but varied in degree across different mpss and seasons table 3 such differences can be attributed to pond intrinsic characteristics e g water storage connectivity and bidirectional exchange with shallow groundwater and extrinsic factors of subcatchment e g slope landuse types and soil attributes and precipitation e g intensity duration and concentration golden et al 2014 yasarer et al 2018 jones et al 2019 under the same rainfall conditions but disparate subcatchment factors rda was performed to discuss the influences of pond characteristics on baseflow and quickflow variations in the 3 mps groups forest farm and village narrated in section 3 3 fig 8 results indicated apparent influence of pond water storage for baseflow support and the correlation ranked forest farm village group in our study catchment we attributed the strongest linkage to the low human disturbance and large drainage area that associated with pond water storage in the natural woodlands and the weakest linkage to the impervious land surface and low positions of the village where baseflow may primarily come from upgradient subcatchments moreover the influence of pond water storage was stronger than spillage in the forest group but slightly weaker than that in the farm group such difference was consistent with the complexity of surface water connections in the two groups where the pervasive and interlaced ditch network in the farmland can contribute to a more spatially enough baseflow support liu et al 2009 tan et al 2018 for quickflow attenuation the influence of pond spillage was stronger in the forest group than that in the village group while the correlation was found negative in the farm group we attributed the relative stronger correlation to the concurrent flow path of pond to pond and pond to stream in the woodlands while the negative correlation in the farmland to 1 intentional blockage of the ditch network during rainfall to increase pond water storage and reduce farmland soil erosion chen et al 2019 and 2 perennial saturated high water level condition of some downgradient aquaculture ponds e g no 8 and no 18 that may adversely contribute to a higher flood peak mitsuo et al 2014 wu et al 2020 due to the indirect regulation effect that determined by pond water level the influence of bidirectional water exchange was rather limited comparing to water storage and spillage fig 8 even so the correlation of groundwater recharge and quickflow attenuation was demonstrated across all mps groups owing to the increased travel time and hydrologic path golden et al 2014 our findings including 1 the ranked level of pond water storage for baseflow support across different landuse groups and 2 the inversed correlation of pond spillage to baseflow and quickflow variation in the farmland presented site specific answers to the long standing question about how intrinsic characteristics and extrinsic landuse types jointly affect the hydrologic regulation of wetlands rains et al 2016 golden et al 2019 jones et al 2019 the total explained variance of the two axes in rda 40 however revealed other potential but stronger correlation factors such as precipitation intensity and duration which develop further research interests applicable to larger watershed and river basins but was beyond the scope of the current study according to the simulated water balance at the pond scale 27 out of the 30 ponds had water storage throughout the simulation period as small scattered wetlands are reported to dry out in other landscapes williams and fryirs 2016 poschlod and braun reichert 2017 evenson et al 2018b we attributed the submerged conditions to the humid climate that produces direct precipitation and drainage to single ponds and more importantly the cascading fill spill processes that keep balanced water storage across all ponds in the mps structure moreover 8 ponds 27 in total of the 7 structures simultaneously provided spillage to the main stream and received spillage from upgradient ponds fig 6 the average daily overflow provided and received by these ponds totaled 1 37 and 0 72 mm converted to runoff depth and excluded evapotranspiration losses which took 59 and 31 of the catchment water yield in table 4 and again portrayed a nonnegligible role of pond fill spill processes to the catchment hydrology different from analytical scenarios that partition the wetlands according to their distance to streams evenson et al 2018a golden et al 2019 or their spatial distribution in the catchment e g upstream midstream and downstream hansen et al 2018 lee et al 2018 our study elucidated the actual connecting structures and quantified the hydrologic components of each pond mps and entire catchment which support and refine the emerging findings that wetland connectivity and hydrologic fluxes are crucial to their catchment functions in addition to the number area and distribution cohen et al 2016 lane et al 2018 ameli and creed 2019 4 2 implications for management with an estimated global loss of about 35 since the 1970s wetlands are one of the most threatened ecosystems and are central to meeting many of the united nations 17 sustainable development goals gardner and finlayson 2018 although a no net loss target for wetlands has been set in many nations most conservation policies ignore small scattered waters resulting in hidden loss of wetland functions behind the reported paper offsets un water 2018 xu et al 2019 following our findings that both pond water storage and spillage connections are important to their hydrologic regulation conservation efforts do not necessarily require expensive engineering measures to create new wetlands but need to maintain and optimize the perennial or intermittent surface water connections between the existing ones a relevant practice is pond and ditch dredging to reduce siltation during agricultural slack seasons in china and japan which is traditional cost efficient but increasingly ignored owing to the limited short term economic benefit yin et al 2006 mitsuo et al 2014 yu et al 2015 hence we propose encouragement and revitalization of similar traditional measures to ensure connections and flowing waters for wetland functions not limited to mpss in the chinese context but similar small scattered wetlands elsewhere tested in low mountains and hills under a humid subtropical climate our work confirmed that incorporating intra catchment observations benefits wetland and catchment modelling yen et al 2016 golden et al 2017 lane et al 2018 to acquire generalized knowledge on mpss hydrologic regulation and guide pond management in larger watersheds and river basins we call on several measures to improve the monitoring system and possible data scarcities first to place an emphasis on pond mapping as these small scattered waters are usually disregarded in wetland inventories tiner et al 2015 wu 2018 concerted efforts from government sectors including water resources agriculture and rural development are preferred since our interviews with the local farmers indicated that mps structures are easily damaged by agricultural activities and even filled during land consolidation long 2014 second to encourage long term monitoring on pond dynamics such as water level variations despite the reported deficiencies since the 2000s whigham and jordan 2003 hill et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 facilitated by various smart devices and wireless networks this work can be voluntarily or encouraged through incentives by locals after holding workshops to reinforce their responsibility as pond managers as has been tested in farmer participatory rural reform in our study catchment chen et al 2018 furthermore remote sensing techniques including light detection and ranging lidar synthetic aperture radar sar and multispectral scanning mss have inherent abilities to characterize these waters chen et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and can cross validate and reduce uncertainties of the simulated fill spill processes reported roles of small scattered wetlands go beyond hydrologic regulation and include nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus buffers to safeguard downstream rivers and lakes against eutrophication verhoeven et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 xia et al 2018 as well as freshwater habitats and refuges for endangered plants invertebrates and amphibians mitsuo et al 2014 williams and fryirs 2016 poschlod and braun reichert 2017 partly driven by the submerged conditions and perennial or intermittent water connections the environmental and ecological concerns have become a well studied topic in large aquatic systems such as dam regulated rivers grantham et al 2014 but are seldom assessed in conjunction with the hydrologic regulation of mps during rural planning and pond management based on identified direction and magnitude of pond overflow hydrodynamic models such as water quality analysis simulation program wasp and environmental fluid dynamics code efdc have potential to reveal the flow paths within ponds and ditches and their associated influences on the surrounding water quality and flora and fauna hence the integration of these models was recommended to make wider application of our detailed hydrologic assessment and identify the overlapped or interlaced hotspots of mpss that require particular conservation efforts 4 3 improved model limitations and recommendations we present a novel contribution toward quantifying the intra catchment processes of small scattered wetlands compared to previous studies however all modelling methods necessarily have limitations for example the direction and magnitude of pond spillage i e p pond and p stream was inversely identified by streamflow and water level variations in conjunction with the pre defined production rules and ga based parameter optimization screening from several qualified ga populations the rule based artificial intelligence was validated by the statistical criteria but brought uncertainties during subcatchment delineation and rule formulation owing to the multiple ponds within a single subcatchment fig 3a and various fill spill possibilities between different subcatchments table 1 in view of the increased errors of simulated water level from upstream to downstream narrated in section 3 1 the uncertainties may be minimized by reducing the subcatchment size so that each one contains a single pond representation but may also increase the rule complexity and screening procedures to obtain qualified parameter values to balance their respective complexity and model performance the relationship between pond number in each subcatchment and rule based fill spill possibility requires further digestion although the present method is effective in depicting intra catchment processes and its swat independent implementations are referential to similar catchment modelling our swat enhancements did not necessarily signify improved model performance as measured by standard statistical criteria to verify this point an original swat with default pond representation was applied in the study catchment during the 2 year simulation period using the calibrated parameters of swat mps in the baseline scenario the original model had daily kge and pbias values of 0 73 and 0 09 for streamflow simulations respectively comparing with the performance in section 3 1 the two models resulted in relatively similar kge values while the original model tended to underestimate streamflow pbias value of 0 09 and the new model tended to overestimate streamflow pbias value of 0 11 relative to the employed parameters that govern the rate of water transport in the simulated main stream i e ch n2 and ch k2 several swat extensions can potentially improve the performance of streamflow simulation in the new model such as explicit representations of riparian wetlands and tributary ditches and streams rahman et al 2016 as well as water pumping from streams to ponds that usually happens before irrigation seasons to increase pond water storage tan et al 2018 however streamflow oriented model improvements are not enough for swat mps partly because of the equifinality phenomenon in auto calibration i e several different combinations of model parameters can result in similar predictions efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 yen et al 2016 and partly the ignorance of intra catchment processes in performance evaluation including pond spillage connections variations in submerged area and bidirectional exchanges with shallow groundwater future work must evaluate swat mps against more diverse monitoring data over longer simulation periods for example the bidirectional exchange is recognized as an important hydrologic component of pond water balance in humid agricultural regions golden et al 2014 ameli and creed 2017 yeo et al 2019 however swat mps employed an aggregate rate of vertical and lateral seepage owing to the parameterization of only one hydraulic conductivity value to simulate seepage from hrus calibrated by water level gradients between ponds and drinking water wells the vertical exchange was separated and valued between 2 89 and 1 23 mm d 1 for the study catchment table 2 on the condition that wells are deep to the same aquifer this areal result was approximate to swat simulations in peripheral catchments lin et al 2013 but requires downscaling before comparing with soil seepage observations at the slope scale vanderlinden et al 2012 li et al 2015 moreover other field observations such as streamflow between some large perennially connected ponds chemical and isotopic tracings thorslund et al 2018 and microbial communities and indicators mushet et al 2019 can be used to validate the spillage connections that characterize mpss a combined use of these datasets over longer periods can enhance mpss multiscale hydrologic assessment under various precipitation conditions and advance our understanding of how small scattered wetlands affect catchment functions via their structures and processes 5 conclusions assessing wetland hydrologic processes over numerous scales is crucial in understanding their ecosystem services especially nutrient buffering in this study we demonstrate a novel approach to quantify the multiscale hydrologic regulation of multipond systems mpss a common type of small scattered wetland in humid agricultural regions our new model dubbed swat mps incorporated improved representations of 1 cascading fill spill relationships of pond to pond and pond to stream and 2 bidirectional exchange between pond surface water and shallow groundwater using rule based knowledge integration and ga based parameter optimization swat mps successfully replicated streamflow and pond water level variations in the 4 8 km2 test catchment southern china water balance analysis revealed the presence of 9 series or series parallel connected mpss in which pond overflow accounted for as much as 59 of the catchment water yield scenario simulations revealed seasonally and mps independent baseflow support and quickflow attenuation at the mps scale while at the catchment scale mpss in aggregate reduced flood peaks by 20 and increased baseflow by 26 in the following dry days redundancy analysis further discovered 1 ranked level of pond water storage for baseflow support across different landuse types forest farm village and 2 inversed correlation of pond spillage to baseflow and quickflow variations in the farmland preliminary meteorological data analysis and resulting average daily values confirmed the credibility of our mps hydrologic patterns even if extending the 2 year simulation to longer periods this study underscores mps s water storage and connectivity in its flood and drought resilience and encourages inventories long term field monitoring and integration of hydrodynamic models for integrated pond management in watersheds and river basins despite potential research directions such as balancing the complexity of subcatchment and production rules to reduce pond fill spill uncertainties and incorporating diverse long term monitoring data to fully reflect pond dynamics in performance evaluation our model enhancements and analytical results serve as a first exploration on the intra catchment hydrologic details of mpss in the chinese context they

17677,the occurrence of harmful algal blooms dominated by toxic cyanobacteria has induced continuous loadings of algal organic matter aom and toxins in drinking water treatment plants however the impact of aom on the active biofilms and microbial community structures of biologically active filtration baf which directly affects the contaminant removal is not well understood in this study we systematically examined the effects of aom on baf performance and bacterial biofilm formation over 240 days tracing the removal of specific aom components a cyanotoxin microcystin lr mc lr and microbial community responses the component analysis excitation and emission matrix analysis results for aom revealed that terrestrial humic like substances showed the highest removal among all the identified components and were strongly correlated to mc lr removal in addition reduced empty bed contact time and deactivation of biofilms significantly decreased baf performances for both aom and mc lr the active biofilm bacterial community structure and mlra gene involved in microcystin degradation abundance demonstrated that bacterial biofilm composition responded to aom and mc lr in which rhodocyclaceae saprospiraceae and comamonadaceae were dominant in addition mc lr biodegradation appeared to be more active at the top than at the bottom layer in baf overall this study provides deeper insights into the role of biofilms and filter operation on the fate of aom and mc lr in baf graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal organic matter aom microcystin biologically active filtration biofilm excitation emission matrix eem microbial community structure 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs dominated by toxic cyanobacteria have been increasingly detected in water bodies worldwide during such blooms cyanobacterial cells may produce and release undesirable algal metabolites such as cyanotoxins and taste and odor causing compounds which can severely impair water quality chen et al 2017 fang et al 2010a li et al 2012b among the cyanotoxins produced by different cyanobacteria the most prevalent in freshwater systems are microcystins mcs microcystin lr mc lr one of the most toxic and frequently detected among microcystin congeners is a hepatotoxin that can be lethal guti√©rrez praena et al 2012 in addition cyanobacterial cells release algal organic matter aom containing a wide spectrum of components such as amino acids peptides proteins and polysaccharides guo et al 2017 these are known to serve as precursors for disinfection byproducts dbps hong et al 2009 hence to produce safe drinking water it is critical that drinking water treatment plants dwtps are prepared to control aom and mcs most dwtps rely on conventional treatment methods consisting of coagulation flocculation c f sedimentation granular media filtration gmf and disinfection during the c f process aom inhibits the c f effectiveness by increasing the negative particle charge aom proteins are likely to form complexes with coagulants resulting in the reduction of available coagulants for particle destabilization pivokonsky et al 2006 sano et al 2011 the c f process has also shown to be ineffective in removing extracellular mcs sun et al 2013 consequently these conditions may lead to continuous loads of aom with mc lr in gmf systems recently biologically active filtration baf with granular activated carbon gac has been widely employed in place of conventional gmf to reduce biodegradable organic matter dbp precursors and taste and odor causing compounds the biological degradation of mc lr was also demonstrated by the indigenous microbial biofilm in baf ho et al 2006 for instance morganella morganii isolated from a filtration system showed the biodegradation of mc lr with and without other carbon sources eleuterio and batista 2010 however few studies have reported the performance of gac based gmf in the biodegradation of mc lr for example lab scale filtration with the combination of adsorption and biodegradation showed complete removal of pure mc lr 5 Œºg l for 6 months of operation using filter effluent from a dwtp wang et al 2007 on the other hand for full scale gmf systems with gac even less than 5 Œºg l of mc lr in raw water was not completely eliminated lahti et al 2001 lambert et al 1996 it should be noted that previous lab scale tests mostly evaluated the performance of gac based gmf at longer filtration times 15 min whereas many full scale gmf systems are operated under rapid filtration conditions 10 min brown et al 2016 furthermore in all previous studies the impacts of aom on biofilm formation and mc lr removal have not been evaluated even though aom and mc lr co exist in source water results from these previous studies indicate that there are great research needs to better understand and optimize baf to treat aom and mc lr the biodegradation performance of baf heavily relies on microbial community composition and activity within biofilms kim et al 2014 richter et al 2008 additionally operational variability e g filtration rate and type of filter media and filter influent water quality e g organic matter can significantly affect microbial biofilm stability i e their structure and function prest et al 2016 the large portion of labile organic compounds in aom and its continuous load may significantly alter biofilm community structure impacting baf performance bittar et al 2015 hammes et al 2007 several studies have reported the changes of bacterial community structure associated with habs and the decomposition of aom in freshwater systems louati et al 2015 shi et al 2017 woodhouse et al 2016 however no studies have focused on understanding the impact of aom components on microbial community dynamics in baf even though biofilm community structure not only plays an important role in various organic matter removal at dwtps but also shapes the microbial community composition in drinking water distribution systems dwdss el chakhtoura et al 2015 to address the aforementioned knowledge gaps gac sand columns simulating baf in dwtps were operated to 1 understand the role of biofilms and different operational conditions slow and rapid filtration for the removal of aom and mc lr 2 elucidate the treatability of spectrally characterized aom components and their correlations with mc lr removal and 3 investigate the impact of aom on the activity and community structure of bacterial biofilms in baf 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents mc lr standards were purchased from cayman inc purity 95 cyanobacteria laden water samples mostly microcystis species were obtained from the western basin of lake erie during the summer of 2017 aom from microcystis sp contains a mixture of compounds such as amino acids peptides polysaccharides and proteins guo et al 2017 cyanobacterial cells were separated from the collected water samples by membrane filtration using a 0 45 Œºm pore size filter the separated cells were mixed with di water and underwent three freeze thaw cycles at 80 c then aom was obtained by filtering the water sample using a 0 45 Œºm membrane filter zhu et al 2015 and was stored for column operation 2 2 column set up and operations figure s1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set up five identical glass columns length 25 cm internal diameter 2 5 cm were prepared in parallel filter media of the columns consisted of gac 10 cm and sand 4 cm layers simulating baf with gac in a full scale dwtp toledo ohio usa filter influent for the column operation was obtained from the dwtp after alum coagulation and sedimentation but prior to gmf table 1 selected fresh gac with an effective particle size of 1 0 1 2 mm was obtained from the calgon carbon corporation gac was rinsed with deionized water autoclaved at 121 c and oven dried prior to use filter sand media with an effective size of 0 8 1 0 mm was obtained from the dwtp and prepared following the same procedures for gac operation conditions of the columns are summarized in table 2 collected biomass during backwashing of filters at the dwtp was inoculated into columns 1 and 2 before operating the columns to emulate filtration systems with indigenous biofilm formation bai et al 2016 columns 3 4 and 5 were operated without biomass inoculation to obtain naturally developed biofilms on filter media by feed solution in order to determine the abiotic removal of aom and mc lr in baf sodium azide a biocide was tested but significantly oxidized mc lr thus autoclaving was conducted for column 5 once a week 10 min at 121 c to monitor filter performance with reduced biofilm formation wang et al 2007 for 160 days all five columns were operated at 20 min ebct representing slow filtration condition by feeding the collected filter influent without aom and mc lr column 4 without initial biomass inoculation was sacrificed to analyze active biomass in biofilm and microbial community composition before aom was introduced from day 161 on columns 2 3 and 5 were operated with filter influent fortified with aom while column 1 was continuously operated only with filter influent aom was diluted 10 000 times by filter influent and aom contribution to total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn was 0 5 mg l 1 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively aom concentration was determined based on previous studies which monitored aom releases by a pre oxidation step qi et al 2016 xie et al 2013 and our own preliminary laboratory tests to estimate the impact of water treatment on aom releases at the dwtp seasonally impacted by habs mc lr was not detected in aom fortified filter influent after day 179 pure mc lr 5 Œºg l with aom was injected into columns 2 3 and 5 at 20 min ebct the observed average mc lr concentration in the influent of the columns was 5 07 0 11 Œºg l from day 209 on the columns were operated at 10 min ebct simulating a rapid filtration condition to examine the influence of ebct on the removal of mc lr and aom all columns were operated under room temperature 23 2 c a single column was prepared for each condition due to high operational costs associated with utilizing pure mc lr for the study surface cleaning for columns was conducted every two weeks during the first phase and once a week after the addition of aom and mc lr to minimize the re stratification of filter media influent and effluent samples 0 25 l for each in a sterilized glass flask were collected from the columns twice per week for water quality analyses at the end of the column operation filter media samples in each column were also collected in sterilized tubes from the top middle and bottom of 10 cm gac layers and a 4 cm sand layer for active biomass in biofilm and microbial community structure analyses in addition collected filter influent 2 l from the dwtp was filtered using 0 2 Œºm membrane filter millipore usa the filter media samples and membranes were stored at 80 c until further processing for microbial community analyses 2 3 water quality analysis and quantification of biomass toc and tn of collected filter influents and effluents were determined using a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan the ph and turbidity were also analyzed adenosine triphosphate atp analysis was used to regularly monitor active biomass of collected column influent and effluent samples atp of collected filter media samples was also analyzed to determine active biomass in columns using an atp kit luminultra canada developed for biofilms a standard heterotrophic plate count hpc was performed for filter influent samples according to the previously described method fujioka et al 2019 bacterial counts using the hpc method were expressed with the colony forming unit cfu 2 4 excitation emission matrix eem measurements and parafac modeling to trace removal of dissolved organic matters dom including aom components in baf the eems of collected influents and effluents were measured using a spectrofluorometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan details describing the measurements and corrections can be found in text s1 a total of ninety six eem samples 349 eem spectra obtained from the study were utilized to identify individual components using parallel factor analysis parafac modeling murphy et al 2013 the f max value represents the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component f max in influents and effluents was used to calculate the removal efficiency of organic matter in baf 2 5 microcystin lr analysis collected samples in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask were treated using the solid phase extraction spe method available in text s2 kaloudis et al 2013 high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with a photo diode array pda detector lc 20ad shimadzu japan and a c18 column phenomenex kinetex usa with a guard column was used to quantify mc lr the analysis was performed by isocratic elution flow rate 0 5 ml min using a solution composed of 4 6 volume acetonitrile sigma aldrich usa to hplc water with 0 05 trifluoracetic acid sigma aldrich usa the pda detector was set at the wavelength range of 195 300 nm and 238 nm was selected to determine mc lr the detection limit was 0 05 Œºg l 2 6 dna extraction quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput amplicon sequencing analysis dna was extracted from collected filter media samples 0 5 g and membrane filters for filter influent using a commercial dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa the concentration and quality of dna in the extracts were examined using qubit 3 0 life technologies usa dna extracts were used as templates to detect the mlra gene which encodes a microcystinase enzyme involved in mc lr biodegradation hoefel et al 2009a and to generate 16s rrna gene sequencing libraries barcoded 16s rrna gene targeting primers i e 515f and 806r caporaso et al 2011 were used and the targeted products i e 291 bp were sequenced in both directions using an illumina miseq with a pe250 sequencing kit as previously described inkinen et al 2016 the obtained 16s rrna gene sequence data were processed and analyzed using qiime 1 9 1 software caporaso et al 2010 detailed procedures for qpcr and the sequencing data analysis are in text s3 2 7 statistical analysis the r software version 3 4 4 was used for statistical analyses of the data principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on unweighted unifrac distance was performed to visualize the distribution of community structures in filter media using rarefied sequencing data at the library size of 12 900 permutational multivariate anova permanova based on bray curtis dissimilarities and similarity percentage simper analysis were conducted to monitor the differences among the columns and at different filter depths further statistical analysis information about the effect of aom on filter performances is provided in text s4 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal of mc lr by baf under the presence of aom at 20 min ebct mc lr was detected in the effluents of all three columns for the first few days fig 1 but columns 2 and 3 showed the complete removal of mc lr after 7 days of acclimation period for column 5 the autoclaved column mc lr breakthrough occurred repeatedly right after each sterilization the mc lr removal results for 20 min ebct indicate that gac with active biofilms can efficiently eliminate 5 Œºg l of mc lr even under the presence of aom however when 10 min ebct was applied mc lr was found in all effluent samples averages of mc lr detected in the effluents of columns 2 3 and 5 were 0 17 0 07 Œºg l 0 22 0 09 Œºg l and 0 65 0 56 Œºg l respectively for column 5 at 10 min ebct the breakthrough patterns became increasingly distinct 1 Œºg l of mc lr if adsorption was the only removal mechanism for mc lr in column 5 right after sterilization the results suggest that 3 39 0 17 Œºg l of mc lr was abiotically removed after this its removal was rapidly recovered as much as those of columns 2 and 3 it is worth noting that the sterilization significantly lowered the removal efficiency of mc lr in column 5 p 0 05 generally the matrix structures of active biofilms are known to influence the transport of waterborne substances from the bulk fluid to substratum stewart 2003 previous studies evidenced that biofilms on gac inhibit the liquid bulk flow but introduce a laminar liquid film around gac which effectively allows waterborne substances to diffuse into the adsorption sites in gac stoodley and lewandowski 1994 it is also noteworthy that the top layer of column 5 had a higher atp value than in columns 1 and 4 columns without aom and mc lr even though column 5 was sterilized two days before collecting filter media samples fig s2 this shows that activity of bacterial biofilms was partially recovered in column 5 between the regular sterilizations therefore we surmise that the recovery of mc lr removal in column 5 was closely associated with the formation of active biofilms on gac however further studies are required to enhance our understanding on the removal mechanisms gac adsorption biosorption and biodegradation of mc lr and how biofilm characteristics e g thickness surface coverage and porosity affect mass transfer of mc lr onto gac surfaces in baf ebct is a crucial operational parameter for baf and shorter ebct is known to decrease baf performance for organic carbon removal terry and summers 2018 in this study after reducing the ebct from 20 min to 10 min a significant drop of toc removal in all columns was observed p 0 05 fig s3 at 10 min ebct the average toc removals were 15 7 7 20 7 8 23 8 2 and 12 11 9 for columns 1 2 3 and 5 respectively likewise we found that the mc lr removal also significantly decreased with the reduced ebct p 0 05 baf or gmf systems in most dwtps with large treatment capacities are operated at an ebct less than or equal to 10 min brown et al 2016 thus our results suggest that the performance of gmf for mc lr removal under the rapid filtration 10 min needs to be carefully monitored especially when a high concentration of mc lr is present in filter influent previous field studies with sand and anthracite media showed that more than 1 Œºg l of mc lr remained in finished water when raw water contained around 5 Œºg l of mc lr and even 2 1 Œºg l of mc lr in filter influent was not completely removed 0 3 Œºg l in filter effluent miller et al 2017 zamyadi et al 2012 even considering the differences in the water quality operating conditions and filter media type our results indicate that baf with gac also has limitations in completely removing mc lr at the short ebct under the presence of aom this suggests that dwtps need to consider additional treatment barriers e g powdered activated carbon addition to c f for adsorbing dissolved mc lr or increased disinfectant dose to oxidize the adda group of mc lr for baf effluent resulting in a less toxic form along with increasing ebct if feasible for mc lr during habs more detailed information of the impacts of ebct and injected aom on the performance of baf is available in text s5 3 2 tracking organic matter removal in baf using eem parafac the parafac model analysis results table s1 identified four independent components associated with different dissolved organic matrices in all samples fig s4 component 2 c2 contained two maxima at ex em 270 370 466 nm components 1 3 and 4 c1 c3 and c4 had a single maximum at ex em 320 394 280 322 and 250 308 nm respectively c1 is associated with marine humic like substances c2 relates to terrestrial humic like substances and c3 and c4 represent protein like substances table s2 the peak related to c3 contains tryptophan like substances and autochthonous protein like substances which are susceptible to microbial degradation villacorte et al 2015 for c4 the peak is similar to tyrosine like substances in an aromatic protein like region chen et al 2003 after the characterization component composition and the removal efficiency of each component through filtration were obtained using f max fig 2 statistical analyses were also performed to monitor the effects of the ebct and biofilm sterilization on organic matter removal we found that the addition of aom in the filter influent increased components c2 terrestrial humic like and c3 protein like fig s5 which was in line with previous findings hong et al 2008 most of all all columns showed higher removal efficiency for c2 than other components at 20 min ebct 78 2 3 6 96 9 1 3 97 2 0 9 and 96 5 1 6 for columns 1 2 3 and 5 respectively confirming that humic like substances with longer emission wavelengths 394 nm for c1 and 466 nm for c2 are more likely to have a strong affinity to gac sgroi et al 2018 there was also significant removal of c3 in the columns 71 9 8 7 81 9 8 0 82 9 9 7 and 82 1 7 3 for columns 1 2 3 5 respectively this can be explained by the fact that protein like materials such as peptides and amino acids with low molecular weight mw were effectively removed by gac through adsorption and those adsorbed molecules containing high organic nitrogen content could be easily biodegraded in baf chen et al 2011 when the ebct was reduced to 10 min all component removal decreased significantly except c4 p 0 05 consistent with a previous study chen et al 2016 for example in column 1 c1 and c2 removals dropped by 17 and 24 respectively columns 2 and 3 showed a similar decreasing trend for c2 6 7 and 7 0 and c3 13 1 and 10 1 column 5 exhibited 25 9 and 24 reduction for c1 c2 and c3 respectively interestingly lower removal of c1 marine humic like substances was observed in column 5 compared to columns 2 and 3 p 0 05 fig 2a generally baf with gac provides substantial removal of humic like substances through adsorption and biodegradation pramanik et al 2014 notably the removal of high mw substances was more attributed to the adsorption of those molecules on biofilms rather than gac because of size exclusion effect on gac huang et al 2011 which suggests that biofilm plays a more important role in removing marine humic like substances in the system for c4 tyrosine like substances low average removal even negative removal was observed in all columns 12 7 15 1 at both ebcts which might be due to bacterial exudates produced by biofilms in columns shen et al 2016 3 3 correlations between aom components and mc lr removal the eem parafac method has been successfully employed to investigate correlations between fluorescence intensities of various components and general water quality parameters yang et al 2015 a recent study also reported a relationship between specific cyanobacteria derived aom components and carbonaceous dbp c dbp and nitrogenous dbp n dbp formation confirming that aom associated with protein like substances corresponding to c3 are strongly correlated with trihalomethanes and more toxic n dbp yields ma et al 2018 however no previous studies have explored the applicability of the eem parafac method for monitoring mc lr removal in baf it is worth mentioning that the ex em loadings of mc lr and c4 were similar to each other as the eem spectra of pure mc lr overlapped with the position where c4 was identified fig s6 consequently this infers that direct tracking of mc lr removal using the eem parafac method is not feasible under the presence of protein like substances to further elucidate any potential correlations between mc lr removal and the identified aom components the spearman s rank correlation analysis was conducted and the results revealed a strong positive correlation between c2 and mc lr removals in all columns table 3 when the component ratios were also evaluated c1 c2 presented a significant correlation for mc lr removal in columns 2 0 55 and 3 0 75 indicating that the removal of mc lr was more related to the removal of humic like substances c2 than protein like substances c3 in baf little is known about the role of c2 in baf except that it is related to aromatic carbon compounds with both high 100 kda and low mw portions 1 kda qu et al 2012 there is no available information regarding its impacts on baf in the following section the role of aom components and their influences on bacterial community structure will be discussed 3 4 aom impacts on the communities of bacterial biofilms in baf previous studies reported the dynamic changes of fresh water bacterial community structures in response to a wide range of cyanobacteria species and their potential impacts on water quality followed by aom release li et al 2012a wilhelm et al 2014 however there is no study that monitors the impacts of aom on the bacterial community structures in baf to our knowledge this is the first study that provides insights into the roles of aom on the highly variable bacterial community composition in baf a total of 439 429 sequences were retrieved from the filter media samples using 16s rrna sequencing analysis and 1646 otus were obtained samples from column 5 contained the lowest otus the top of the gac layers in columns 2 and 3 showed lower richness chao1 and diversity simpson compared to column 1 which may indicate that the top layer was significantly affected by aom table s3 to visualize the dissimilarity of community structures among samples the pcoa was performed on unweighted unifrac distance and 37 8 variance of the otu dataset was included in the first two principal coordinate axes fig 3 samples from columns 1 4 and 5 formed three distinct groups far separated from the inoculum samples from columns 2 and 3 were also clustered together but the top layers were distant from the cluster the permanova test on otu tables confirmed that column 1 was significantly different from columns 2 3 and 5 p 0 05 this indicates that aom affected the community structures in column 2 although columns 1 and 2 were seeded with the same biomass from the dwtp and appeared very similar with each other at the phylum levels moreover simper results table s4 revealed high dissimilarities at top layers among the columns which also supports that injected aom influenced the top layers more than bottom layers of filters of all identified otus the major phyla for each sample are shown in fig 4 the recovered taxa from this study are composed of fifteen bacterial phyla commonly found in baf including acidobacteria actinobacteria nitorspirae proteobacteria and chlorobi oh et al 2018 with proteobacteria being the most dominant across the samples proteobacteria in columns 1 2 and 3 constituted 77 3 2 at top 69 1 5 at middle 65 2 4 at bottom gac layers and 49 2 0 3 at sand layers in column 1 alphaproteobacteria accounted for 33 50 of the overall abundance betaproteobacteria overwhelmingly dominated columns 2 63 83 3 45 87 and 5 60 68 this implies that aom as substrate strongly influenced the bacterial communities in the columns resulting in the dominance of the betaproteobacteria group in which members are known to be highly competitive in nutrient rich environments niemi et al 2009 further characterization at family and genus levels revealed that in columns 2 and 3 genus methyloversatilis rhodocyclaceae family and unclassified comamonadaceae accounted for 22 9 8 and 19 4 10 respectively fig 5 in column 5 the two groups constituted the average of 12 7 3 and 22 4 4 members of the genus methyloversatilis are facultative methylotrophs which are able to utilize organic acids aromatic compounds and methylated amines smalley et al 2015 as we observed increased tn removals in columns 2 3 and 5 under the presence of aom fig s3 their predominance may be significantly related to nitrogen contents of aom such as unidentified organic nitrogen and aliphatic amines fang et al 2010b for the comamonadaceae some of the group members are known to degrade aromatic carbon compounds and produce large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps feng et al 2012 te et al 2017 a previous study reported that carbon hydrogen aromatic compounds were originated from humic like substances of aom villacorte et al 2015 which were shown to be successfully removed by filtration in our eem parafac results fig 2 in our previous study the family comamonadaceae was dominant in biofilm impacted by aom showing a strong correlation with total eps contents li et al 2019 thus it is inferred that the adsorbed aromatic carbon compounds in c2 helped in the enrichment of comamonadaceae in addition bacteria closely related to members of the family saprospiraceae were enriched in the top layer of columns 2 3 and 5 saprospiraceae as protein hydrolyzers mcilroy and nielsen 2014 xia et al 2007 generally coexist with flavobacteriales which rely on intermediates hydrolyzed from protein by saprospiraceae kim et al 2016 in the study the proliferation of the family flavobacteriales was also observed in columns 2 and 3 indicating that saprospiraceae dominated by utilizing protein like substances of aom overall the bacterial community analysis showed that the addition of aom significantly decreased the diversity of the top layer while the bacterial community was shifting in the favor of betaproteobacteria in baf notably the abundance of rhodocyclaceae saprospiraceae and comamonadaceae at the family level was distinct in the presence of aom 3 5 abundances of mlra gene and potential mc degrading bacteria until now over 40 mc degrading bacterial strains have been identified from diverse ecosystems the characterized degraders mainly belong to proteobacteria and the most frequently reported genera are novosphingobium sphingomonas and sphingopyxis belonging to alphaproteobacteria li et al 2017 these genera were detected in the sequencing libraries fig 6 for example sphingopyxis was well distributed through all columns compared to novosphingobium and sphingomonas this genus was relatively abundant at the top layers in columns 2 and 3 while it was dominant at bottom layers in columns 1 4 and 5 hoefel et al 2009a demonstrated that the abundance of mc degraders is positively connected with the abundance of the mlra gene which encodes enzymes hydrolytically cleaving the cyclic structure of mc lr the authors also reported a strong correlation between the abundance of mlra gene and mc lr biodegradation in sand filters hoefel et al 2009b our qpcr results revealed that mlra genes were also present in all columns except column 1 fig 6 and the genes were more abundant at top layers which implies potential biodegradation of mc lr linked to some of these bacterial groups however further studies are needed to unravel the distribution and activity of mc lr degraders in baf under different operational conditions and seasonal changes with and without hab providing absolute resolution at genus species level and gene expressions associated with mc lr biodegradation 3 6 engineering implications this study highlights the impact of aom on mc lr removal and active biomass and community structures of biofilms in baf under the presence of aom complete mc lr removal by both gac adsorption and biodegradation could be achieved after a seven day acclimation period at high ebct but not at low ebct although mc lr concentration in baf effluent was lower than 1 Œºg l who s guideline for mc lr there were also limitations in eliminating all aom components at both ebcts protein like substances were less removed than terrestrial humic like substances which may increase concerns over finished water quality specifically since the baf receiving aom showed the incomplete removal of protein like substances the substances can facilitate toxic dbp formation upon disinfection and biofilm formation in dwds furthermore detached biofilm clusters and eps released from aom impacted biofilm in baf can lead to additional dbp and biofilm formation in both dwtps and dwdss li et al 2019 2020 thus water utilities may need to consider additional physical and chemical treatments that can supplement baf for aom removal during habs in addition more careful monitoring and operation of baf and associated processes are required to ensure finished water quality most baf processes are still operated as black boxes without any practical guidelines for operation and performance monitoring especially for aom thus understanding the fate of aom is critical to gain deeper insight into upstream treatment process control and baf optimization our eem parafac analysis results showed that eem parafac can be a useful tool to monitor removal performance for aom associated components while predicting mc lr removal in baf consequently this can help dwtp operators make informed decisions to optimize dwtp processes offering a comprehensive understanding of aom and mc lr removal during habs lastly our community analysis results clearly demonstrated that aom and mc lr could impact the community structure of biofilm increasing the relative abundance of bacteria that potentially utilize aom components and mc lr our finding displays the future potential to harness biofilm activity and functions in baf for enhanced removal of cyanobacteria derived contaminants using feasible strategies such as biostimulation and or bioaugmentation horemans et al 2017 mikkelson et al 2015 4 conclusions under the presence of aom baf with gac completely removed 5 Œºg l of mc lr at 20 min ebct but not at 10 min ebct deactivation of biofilm with autoclaving showed that c1 marine humic like substances removal was more related to active biofilm formation and up to 68 3 4 Œºg l of injected mc lr could be abiotically removed in baf baf showed higher removal efficiency for terrestrial humic like substances than protein like substances at both ebcts and there was a strong correlation between the removal of terrestrial humic like substances and the removal of mc lr the study demonstrated that ebct and the formation of biofilms play an important role in the removal of aom and mc lr however further studies are needed to better understand how biofilm formation characteristics are associated with the aom removal mechanisms in baf substantial shifts in bacterial community structures in response to aom led to the predominance of rhodocyclaceae saprospiraceae and comamonadaceae moreover the distribution of mlra gene abundance and mc degrading bacteria showed potential mc lr biodegradation in baf declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17677,the occurrence of harmful algal blooms dominated by toxic cyanobacteria has induced continuous loadings of algal organic matter aom and toxins in drinking water treatment plants however the impact of aom on the active biofilms and microbial community structures of biologically active filtration baf which directly affects the contaminant removal is not well understood in this study we systematically examined the effects of aom on baf performance and bacterial biofilm formation over 240 days tracing the removal of specific aom components a cyanotoxin microcystin lr mc lr and microbial community responses the component analysis excitation and emission matrix analysis results for aom revealed that terrestrial humic like substances showed the highest removal among all the identified components and were strongly correlated to mc lr removal in addition reduced empty bed contact time and deactivation of biofilms significantly decreased baf performances for both aom and mc lr the active biofilm bacterial community structure and mlra gene involved in microcystin degradation abundance demonstrated that bacterial biofilm composition responded to aom and mc lr in which rhodocyclaceae saprospiraceae and comamonadaceae were dominant in addition mc lr biodegradation appeared to be more active at the top than at the bottom layer in baf overall this study provides deeper insights into the role of biofilms and filter operation on the fate of aom and mc lr in baf graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal organic matter aom microcystin biologically active filtration biofilm excitation emission matrix eem microbial community structure 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs dominated by toxic cyanobacteria have been increasingly detected in water bodies worldwide during such blooms cyanobacterial cells may produce and release undesirable algal metabolites such as cyanotoxins and taste and odor causing compounds which can severely impair water quality chen et al 2017 fang et al 2010a li et al 2012b among the cyanotoxins produced by different cyanobacteria the most prevalent in freshwater systems are microcystins mcs microcystin lr mc lr one of the most toxic and frequently detected among microcystin congeners is a hepatotoxin that can be lethal guti√©rrez praena et al 2012 in addition cyanobacterial cells release algal organic matter aom containing a wide spectrum of components such as amino acids peptides proteins and polysaccharides guo et al 2017 these are known to serve as precursors for disinfection byproducts dbps hong et al 2009 hence to produce safe drinking water it is critical that drinking water treatment plants dwtps are prepared to control aom and mcs most dwtps rely on conventional treatment methods consisting of coagulation flocculation c f sedimentation granular media filtration gmf and disinfection during the c f process aom inhibits the c f effectiveness by increasing the negative particle charge aom proteins are likely to form complexes with coagulants resulting in the reduction of available coagulants for particle destabilization pivokonsky et al 2006 sano et al 2011 the c f process has also shown to be ineffective in removing extracellular mcs sun et al 2013 consequently these conditions may lead to continuous loads of aom with mc lr in gmf systems recently biologically active filtration baf with granular activated carbon gac has been widely employed in place of conventional gmf to reduce biodegradable organic matter dbp precursors and taste and odor causing compounds the biological degradation of mc lr was also demonstrated by the indigenous microbial biofilm in baf ho et al 2006 for instance morganella morganii isolated from a filtration system showed the biodegradation of mc lr with and without other carbon sources eleuterio and batista 2010 however few studies have reported the performance of gac based gmf in the biodegradation of mc lr for example lab scale filtration with the combination of adsorption and biodegradation showed complete removal of pure mc lr 5 Œºg l for 6 months of operation using filter effluent from a dwtp wang et al 2007 on the other hand for full scale gmf systems with gac even less than 5 Œºg l of mc lr in raw water was not completely eliminated lahti et al 2001 lambert et al 1996 it should be noted that previous lab scale tests mostly evaluated the performance of gac based gmf at longer filtration times 15 min whereas many full scale gmf systems are operated under rapid filtration conditions 10 min brown et al 2016 furthermore in all previous studies the impacts of aom on biofilm formation and mc lr removal have not been evaluated even though aom and mc lr co exist in source water results from these previous studies indicate that there are great research needs to better understand and optimize baf to treat aom and mc lr the biodegradation performance of baf heavily relies on microbial community composition and activity within biofilms kim et al 2014 richter et al 2008 additionally operational variability e g filtration rate and type of filter media and filter influent water quality e g organic matter can significantly affect microbial biofilm stability i e their structure and function prest et al 2016 the large portion of labile organic compounds in aom and its continuous load may significantly alter biofilm community structure impacting baf performance bittar et al 2015 hammes et al 2007 several studies have reported the changes of bacterial community structure associated with habs and the decomposition of aom in freshwater systems louati et al 2015 shi et al 2017 woodhouse et al 2016 however no studies have focused on understanding the impact of aom components on microbial community dynamics in baf even though biofilm community structure not only plays an important role in various organic matter removal at dwtps but also shapes the microbial community composition in drinking water distribution systems dwdss el chakhtoura et al 2015 to address the aforementioned knowledge gaps gac sand columns simulating baf in dwtps were operated to 1 understand the role of biofilms and different operational conditions slow and rapid filtration for the removal of aom and mc lr 2 elucidate the treatability of spectrally characterized aom components and their correlations with mc lr removal and 3 investigate the impact of aom on the activity and community structure of bacterial biofilms in baf 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents mc lr standards were purchased from cayman inc purity 95 cyanobacteria laden water samples mostly microcystis species were obtained from the western basin of lake erie during the summer of 2017 aom from microcystis sp contains a mixture of compounds such as amino acids peptides polysaccharides and proteins guo et al 2017 cyanobacterial cells were separated from the collected water samples by membrane filtration using a 0 45 Œºm pore size filter the separated cells were mixed with di water and underwent three freeze thaw cycles at 80 c then aom was obtained by filtering the water sample using a 0 45 Œºm membrane filter zhu et al 2015 and was stored for column operation 2 2 column set up and operations figure s1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental set up five identical glass columns length 25 cm internal diameter 2 5 cm were prepared in parallel filter media of the columns consisted of gac 10 cm and sand 4 cm layers simulating baf with gac in a full scale dwtp toledo ohio usa filter influent for the column operation was obtained from the dwtp after alum coagulation and sedimentation but prior to gmf table 1 selected fresh gac with an effective particle size of 1 0 1 2 mm was obtained from the calgon carbon corporation gac was rinsed with deionized water autoclaved at 121 c and oven dried prior to use filter sand media with an effective size of 0 8 1 0 mm was obtained from the dwtp and prepared following the same procedures for gac operation conditions of the columns are summarized in table 2 collected biomass during backwashing of filters at the dwtp was inoculated into columns 1 and 2 before operating the columns to emulate filtration systems with indigenous biofilm formation bai et al 2016 columns 3 4 and 5 were operated without biomass inoculation to obtain naturally developed biofilms on filter media by feed solution in order to determine the abiotic removal of aom and mc lr in baf sodium azide a biocide was tested but significantly oxidized mc lr thus autoclaving was conducted for column 5 once a week 10 min at 121 c to monitor filter performance with reduced biofilm formation wang et al 2007 for 160 days all five columns were operated at 20 min ebct representing slow filtration condition by feeding the collected filter influent without aom and mc lr column 4 without initial biomass inoculation was sacrificed to analyze active biomass in biofilm and microbial community composition before aom was introduced from day 161 on columns 2 3 and 5 were operated with filter influent fortified with aom while column 1 was continuously operated only with filter influent aom was diluted 10 000 times by filter influent and aom contribution to total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn was 0 5 mg l 1 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively aom concentration was determined based on previous studies which monitored aom releases by a pre oxidation step qi et al 2016 xie et al 2013 and our own preliminary laboratory tests to estimate the impact of water treatment on aom releases at the dwtp seasonally impacted by habs mc lr was not detected in aom fortified filter influent after day 179 pure mc lr 5 Œºg l with aom was injected into columns 2 3 and 5 at 20 min ebct the observed average mc lr concentration in the influent of the columns was 5 07 0 11 Œºg l from day 209 on the columns were operated at 10 min ebct simulating a rapid filtration condition to examine the influence of ebct on the removal of mc lr and aom all columns were operated under room temperature 23 2 c a single column was prepared for each condition due to high operational costs associated with utilizing pure mc lr for the study surface cleaning for columns was conducted every two weeks during the first phase and once a week after the addition of aom and mc lr to minimize the re stratification of filter media influent and effluent samples 0 25 l for each in a sterilized glass flask were collected from the columns twice per week for water quality analyses at the end of the column operation filter media samples in each column were also collected in sterilized tubes from the top middle and bottom of 10 cm gac layers and a 4 cm sand layer for active biomass in biofilm and microbial community structure analyses in addition collected filter influent 2 l from the dwtp was filtered using 0 2 Œºm membrane filter millipore usa the filter media samples and membranes were stored at 80 c until further processing for microbial community analyses 2 3 water quality analysis and quantification of biomass toc and tn of collected filter influents and effluents were determined using a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan the ph and turbidity were also analyzed adenosine triphosphate atp analysis was used to regularly monitor active biomass of collected column influent and effluent samples atp of collected filter media samples was also analyzed to determine active biomass in columns using an atp kit luminultra canada developed for biofilms a standard heterotrophic plate count hpc was performed for filter influent samples according to the previously described method fujioka et al 2019 bacterial counts using the hpc method were expressed with the colony forming unit cfu 2 4 excitation emission matrix eem measurements and parafac modeling to trace removal of dissolved organic matters dom including aom components in baf the eems of collected influents and effluents were measured using a spectrofluorometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan details describing the measurements and corrections can be found in text s1 a total of ninety six eem samples 349 eem spectra obtained from the study were utilized to identify individual components using parallel factor analysis parafac modeling murphy et al 2013 the f max value represents the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component f max in influents and effluents was used to calculate the removal efficiency of organic matter in baf 2 5 microcystin lr analysis collected samples in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask were treated using the solid phase extraction spe method available in text s2 kaloudis et al 2013 high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled with a photo diode array pda detector lc 20ad shimadzu japan and a c18 column phenomenex kinetex usa with a guard column was used to quantify mc lr the analysis was performed by isocratic elution flow rate 0 5 ml min using a solution composed of 4 6 volume acetonitrile sigma aldrich usa to hplc water with 0 05 trifluoracetic acid sigma aldrich usa the pda detector was set at the wavelength range of 195 300 nm and 238 nm was selected to determine mc lr the detection limit was 0 05 Œºg l 2 6 dna extraction quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput amplicon sequencing analysis dna was extracted from collected filter media samples 0 5 g and membrane filters for filter influent using a commercial dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa the concentration and quality of dna in the extracts were examined using qubit 3 0 life technologies usa dna extracts were used as templates to detect the mlra gene which encodes a microcystinase enzyme involved in mc lr biodegradation hoefel et al 2009a and to generate 16s rrna gene sequencing libraries barcoded 16s rrna gene targeting primers i e 515f and 806r caporaso et al 2011 were used and the targeted products i e 291 bp were sequenced in both directions using an illumina miseq with a pe250 sequencing kit as previously described inkinen et al 2016 the obtained 16s rrna gene sequence data were processed and analyzed using qiime 1 9 1 software caporaso et al 2010 detailed procedures for qpcr and the sequencing data analysis are in text s3 2 7 statistical analysis the r software version 3 4 4 was used for statistical analyses of the data principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on unweighted unifrac distance was performed to visualize the distribution of community structures in filter media using rarefied sequencing data at the library size of 12 900 permutational multivariate anova permanova based on bray curtis dissimilarities and similarity percentage simper analysis were conducted to monitor the differences among the columns and at different filter depths further statistical analysis information about the effect of aom on filter performances is provided in text s4 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal of mc lr by baf under the presence of aom at 20 min ebct mc lr was detected in the effluents of all three columns for the first few days fig 1 but columns 2 and 3 showed the complete removal of mc lr after 7 days of acclimation period for column 5 the autoclaved column mc lr breakthrough occurred repeatedly right after each sterilization the mc lr removal results for 20 min ebct indicate that gac with active biofilms can efficiently eliminate 5 Œºg l of mc lr even under the presence of aom however when 10 min ebct was applied mc lr was found in all effluent samples averages of mc lr detected in the effluents of columns 2 3 and 5 were 0 17 0 07 Œºg l 0 22 0 09 Œºg l and 0 65 0 56 Œºg l respectively for column 5 at 10 min ebct the breakthrough patterns became increasingly distinct 1 Œºg l of mc lr if adsorption was the only removal mechanism for mc lr in column 5 right after sterilization the results suggest that 3 39 0 17 Œºg l of mc lr was abiotically removed after this its removal was rapidly recovered as much as those of columns 2 and 3 it is worth noting that the sterilization significantly lowered the removal efficiency of mc lr in column 5 p 0 05 generally the matrix structures of active biofilms are known to influence the transport of waterborne substances from the bulk fluid to substratum stewart 2003 previous studies evidenced that biofilms on gac inhibit the liquid bulk flow but introduce a laminar liquid film around gac which effectively allows waterborne substances to diffuse into the adsorption sites in gac stoodley and lewandowski 1994 it is also noteworthy that the top layer of column 5 had a higher atp value than in columns 1 and 4 columns without aom and mc lr even though column 5 was sterilized two days before collecting filter media samples fig s2 this shows that activity of bacterial biofilms was partially recovered in column 5 between the regular sterilizations therefore we surmise that the recovery of mc lr removal in column 5 was closely associated with the formation of active biofilms on gac however further studies are required to enhance our understanding on the removal mechanisms gac adsorption biosorption and biodegradation of mc lr and how biofilm characteristics e g thickness surface coverage and porosity affect mass transfer of mc lr onto gac surfaces in baf ebct is a crucial operational parameter for baf and shorter ebct is known to decrease baf performance for organic carbon removal terry and summers 2018 in this study after reducing the ebct from 20 min to 10 min a significant drop of toc removal in all columns was observed p 0 05 fig s3 at 10 min ebct the average toc removals were 15 7 7 20 7 8 23 8 2 and 12 11 9 for columns 1 2 3 and 5 respectively likewise we found that the mc lr removal also significantly decreased with the reduced ebct p 0 05 baf or gmf systems in most dwtps with large treatment capacities are operated at an ebct less than or equal to 10 min brown et al 2016 thus our results suggest that the performance of gmf for mc lr removal under the rapid filtration 10 min needs to be carefully monitored especially when a high concentration of mc lr is present in filter influent previous field studies with sand and anthracite media showed that more than 1 Œºg l of mc lr remained in finished water when raw water contained around 5 Œºg l of mc lr and even 2 1 Œºg l of mc lr in filter influent was not completely removed 0 3 Œºg l in filter effluent miller et al 2017 zamyadi et al 2012 even considering the differences in the water quality operating conditions and filter media type our results indicate that baf with gac also has limitations in completely removing mc lr at the short ebct under the presence of aom this suggests that dwtps need to consider additional treatment barriers e g powdered activated carbon addition to c f for adsorbing dissolved mc lr or increased disinfectant dose to oxidize the adda group of mc lr for baf effluent resulting in a less toxic form along with increasing ebct if feasible for mc lr during habs more detailed information of the impacts of ebct and injected aom on the performance of baf is available in text s5 3 2 tracking organic matter removal in baf using eem parafac the parafac model analysis results table s1 identified four independent components associated with different dissolved organic matrices in all samples fig s4 component 2 c2 contained two maxima at ex em 270 370 466 nm components 1 3 and 4 c1 c3 and c4 had a single maximum at ex em 320 394 280 322 and 250 308 nm respectively c1 is associated with marine humic like substances c2 relates to terrestrial humic like substances and c3 and c4 represent protein like substances table s2 the peak related to c3 contains tryptophan like substances and autochthonous protein like substances which are susceptible to microbial degradation villacorte et al 2015 for c4 the peak is similar to tyrosine like substances in an aromatic protein like region chen et al 2003 after the characterization component composition and the removal efficiency of each component through filtration were obtained using f max fig 2 statistical analyses were also performed to monitor the effects of the ebct and biofilm sterilization on organic matter removal we found that the addition of aom in the filter influent increased components c2 terrestrial humic like and c3 protein like fig s5 which was in line with previous findings hong et al 2008 most of all all columns showed higher removal efficiency for c2 than other components at 20 min ebct 78 2 3 6 96 9 1 3 97 2 0 9 and 96 5 1 6 for columns 1 2 3 and 5 respectively confirming that humic like substances with longer emission wavelengths 394 nm for c1 and 466 nm for c2 are more likely to have a strong affinity to gac sgroi et al 2018 there was also significant removal of c3 in the columns 71 9 8 7 81 9 8 0 82 9 9 7 and 82 1 7 3 for columns 1 2 3 5 respectively this can be explained by the fact that protein like materials such as peptides and amino acids with low molecular weight mw were effectively removed by gac through adsorption and those adsorbed molecules containing high organic nitrogen content could be easily biodegraded in baf chen et al 2011 when the ebct was reduced to 10 min all component removal decreased significantly except c4 p 0 05 consistent with a previous study chen et al 2016 for example in column 1 c1 and c2 removals dropped by 17 and 24 respectively columns 2 and 3 showed a similar decreasing trend for c2 6 7 and 7 0 and c3 13 1 and 10 1 column 5 exhibited 25 9 and 24 reduction for c1 c2 and c3 respectively interestingly lower removal of c1 marine humic like substances was observed in column 5 compared to columns 2 and 3 p 0 05 fig 2a generally baf with gac provides substantial removal of humic like substances through adsorption and biodegradation pramanik et al 2014 notably the removal of high mw substances was more attributed to the adsorption of those molecules on biofilms rather than gac because of size exclusion effect on gac huang et al 2011 which suggests that biofilm plays a more important role in removing marine humic like substances in the system for c4 tyrosine like substances low average removal even negative removal was observed in all columns 12 7 15 1 at both ebcts which might be due to bacterial exudates produced by biofilms in columns shen et al 2016 3 3 correlations between aom components and mc lr removal the eem parafac method has been successfully employed to investigate correlations between fluorescence intensities of various components and general water quality parameters yang et al 2015 a recent study also reported a relationship between specific cyanobacteria derived aom components and carbonaceous dbp c dbp and nitrogenous dbp n dbp formation confirming that aom associated with protein like substances corresponding to c3 are strongly correlated with trihalomethanes and more toxic n dbp yields ma et al 2018 however no previous studies have explored the applicability of the eem parafac method for monitoring mc lr removal in baf it is worth mentioning that the ex em loadings of mc lr and c4 were similar to each other as the eem spectra of pure mc lr overlapped with the position where c4 was identified fig s6 consequently this infers that direct tracking of mc lr removal using the eem parafac method is not feasible under the presence of protein like substances to further elucidate any potential correlations between mc lr removal and the identified aom components the spearman s rank correlation analysis was conducted and the results revealed a strong positive correlation between c2 and mc lr removals in all columns table 3 when the component ratios were also evaluated c1 c2 presented a significant correlation for mc lr removal in columns 2 0 55 and 3 0 75 indicating that the removal of mc lr was more related to the removal of humic like substances c2 than protein like substances c3 in baf little is known about the role of c2 in baf except that it is related to aromatic carbon compounds with both high 100 kda and low mw portions 1 kda qu et al 2012 there is no available information regarding its impacts on baf in the following section the role of aom components and their influences on bacterial community structure will be discussed 3 4 aom impacts on the communities of bacterial biofilms in baf previous studies reported the dynamic changes of fresh water bacterial community structures in response to a wide range of cyanobacteria species and their potential impacts on water quality followed by aom release li et al 2012a wilhelm et al 2014 however there is no study that monitors the impacts of aom on the bacterial community structures in baf to our knowledge this is the first study that provides insights into the roles of aom on the highly variable bacterial community composition in baf a total of 439 429 sequences were retrieved from the filter media samples using 16s rrna sequencing analysis and 1646 otus were obtained samples from column 5 contained the lowest otus the top of the gac layers in columns 2 and 3 showed lower richness chao1 and diversity simpson compared to column 1 which may indicate that the top layer was significantly affected by aom table s3 to visualize the dissimilarity of community structures among samples the pcoa was performed on unweighted unifrac distance and 37 8 variance of the otu dataset was included in the first two principal coordinate axes fig 3 samples from columns 1 4 and 5 formed three distinct groups far separated from the inoculum samples from columns 2 and 3 were also clustered together but the top layers were distant from the cluster the permanova test on otu tables confirmed that column 1 was significantly different from columns 2 3 and 5 p 0 05 this indicates that aom affected the community structures in column 2 although columns 1 and 2 were seeded with the same biomass from the dwtp and appeared very similar with each other at the phylum levels moreover simper results table s4 revealed high dissimilarities at top layers among the columns which also supports that injected aom influenced the top layers more than bottom layers of filters of all identified otus the major phyla for each sample are shown in fig 4 the recovered taxa from this study are composed of fifteen bacterial phyla commonly found in baf including acidobacteria actinobacteria nitorspirae proteobacteria and chlorobi oh et al 2018 with proteobacteria being the most dominant across the samples proteobacteria in columns 1 2 and 3 constituted 77 3 2 at top 69 1 5 at middle 65 2 4 at bottom gac layers and 49 2 0 3 at sand layers in column 1 alphaproteobacteria accounted for 33 50 of the overall abundance betaproteobacteria overwhelmingly dominated columns 2 63 83 3 45 87 and 5 60 68 this implies that aom as substrate strongly influenced the bacterial communities in the columns resulting in the dominance of the betaproteobacteria group in which members are known to be highly competitive in nutrient rich environments niemi et al 2009 further characterization at family and genus levels revealed that in columns 2 and 3 genus methyloversatilis rhodocyclaceae family and unclassified comamonadaceae accounted for 22 9 8 and 19 4 10 respectively fig 5 in column 5 the two groups constituted the average of 12 7 3 and 22 4 4 members of the genus methyloversatilis are facultative methylotrophs which are able to utilize organic acids aromatic compounds and methylated amines smalley et al 2015 as we observed increased tn removals in columns 2 3 and 5 under the presence of aom fig s3 their predominance may be significantly related to nitrogen contents of aom such as unidentified organic nitrogen and aliphatic amines fang et al 2010b for the comamonadaceae some of the group members are known to degrade aromatic carbon compounds and produce large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps feng et al 2012 te et al 2017 a previous study reported that carbon hydrogen aromatic compounds were originated from humic like substances of aom villacorte et al 2015 which were shown to be successfully removed by filtration in our eem parafac results fig 2 in our previous study the family comamonadaceae was dominant in biofilm impacted by aom showing a strong correlation with total eps contents li et al 2019 thus it is inferred that the adsorbed aromatic carbon compounds in c2 helped in the enrichment of comamonadaceae in addition bacteria closely related to members of the family saprospiraceae were enriched in the top layer of columns 2 3 and 5 saprospiraceae as protein hydrolyzers mcilroy and nielsen 2014 xia et al 2007 generally coexist with flavobacteriales which rely on intermediates hydrolyzed from protein by saprospiraceae kim et al 2016 in the study the proliferation of the family flavobacteriales was also observed in columns 2 and 3 indicating that saprospiraceae dominated by utilizing protein like substances of aom overall the bacterial community analysis showed that the addition of aom significantly decreased the diversity of the top layer while the bacterial community was shifting in the favor of betaproteobacteria in baf notably the abundance of rhodocyclaceae saprospiraceae and comamonadaceae at the family level was distinct in the presence of aom 3 5 abundances of mlra gene and potential mc degrading bacteria until now over 40 mc degrading bacterial strains have been identified from diverse ecosystems the characterized degraders mainly belong to proteobacteria and the most frequently reported genera are novosphingobium sphingomonas and sphingopyxis belonging to alphaproteobacteria li et al 2017 these genera were detected in the sequencing libraries fig 6 for example sphingopyxis was well distributed through all columns compared to novosphingobium and sphingomonas this genus was relatively abundant at the top layers in columns 2 and 3 while it was dominant at bottom layers in columns 1 4 and 5 hoefel et al 2009a demonstrated that the abundance of mc degraders is positively connected with the abundance of the mlra gene which encodes enzymes hydrolytically cleaving the cyclic structure of mc lr the authors also reported a strong correlation between the abundance of mlra gene and mc lr biodegradation in sand filters hoefel et al 2009b our qpcr results revealed that mlra genes were also present in all columns except column 1 fig 6 and the genes were more abundant at top layers which implies potential biodegradation of mc lr linked to some of these bacterial groups however further studies are needed to unravel the distribution and activity of mc lr degraders in baf under different operational conditions and seasonal changes with and without hab providing absolute resolution at genus species level and gene expressions associated with mc lr biodegradation 3 6 engineering implications this study highlights the impact of aom on mc lr removal and active biomass and community structures of biofilms in baf under the presence of aom complete mc lr removal by both gac adsorption and biodegradation could be achieved after a seven day acclimation period at high ebct but not at low ebct although mc lr concentration in baf effluent was lower than 1 Œºg l who s guideline for mc lr there were also limitations in eliminating all aom components at both ebcts protein like substances were less removed than terrestrial humic like substances which may increase concerns over finished water quality specifically since the baf receiving aom showed the incomplete removal of protein like substances the substances can facilitate toxic dbp formation upon disinfection and biofilm formation in dwds furthermore detached biofilm clusters and eps released from aom impacted biofilm in baf can lead to additional dbp and biofilm formation in both dwtps and dwdss li et al 2019 2020 thus water utilities may need to consider additional physical and chemical treatments that can supplement baf for aom removal during habs in addition more careful monitoring and operation of baf and associated processes are required to ensure finished water quality most baf processes are still operated as black boxes without any practical guidelines for operation and performance monitoring especially for aom thus understanding the fate of aom is critical to gain deeper insight into upstream treatment process control and baf optimization our eem parafac analysis results showed that eem parafac can be a useful tool to monitor removal performance for aom associated components while predicting mc lr removal in baf consequently this can help dwtp operators make informed decisions to optimize dwtp processes offering a comprehensive understanding of aom and mc lr removal during habs lastly our community analysis results clearly demonstrated that aom and mc lr could impact the community structure of biofilm increasing the relative abundance of bacteria that potentially utilize aom components and mc lr our finding displays the future potential to harness biofilm activity and functions in baf for enhanced removal of cyanobacteria derived contaminants using feasible strategies such as biostimulation and or bioaugmentation horemans et al 2017 mikkelson et al 2015 4 conclusions under the presence of aom baf with gac completely removed 5 Œºg l of mc lr at 20 min ebct but not at 10 min ebct deactivation of biofilm with autoclaving showed that c1 marine humic like substances removal was more related to active biofilm formation and up to 68 3 4 Œºg l of injected mc lr could be abiotically removed in baf baf showed higher removal efficiency for terrestrial humic like substances than protein like substances at both ebcts and there was a strong correlation between the removal of terrestrial humic like substances and the removal of mc lr the study demonstrated that ebct and the formation of biofilms play an important role in the removal of aom and mc lr however further studies are needed to better understand how biofilm formation characteristics are associated with the aom removal mechanisms in baf substantial shifts in bacterial community structures in response to aom led to the predominance of rhodocyclaceae saprospiraceae and comamonadaceae moreover the distribution of mlra gene abundance and mc degrading bacteria showed potential mc lr biodegradation in baf declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17678,the adverse effects of diclofenac dcf on ecosystems and human health have induced increasing interest in its elimination in environment dcf can be removed to some extent by nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes during wastewater treatment process however the actual roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf remain unclear in this study batch experiments were conducted to explore the biological transformation of dcf in enriched nitrifying sludge ns heterotrophic sludge hs and activated sludge as systems dcf was removed three times faster in enriched ns than in hs three transformation pathways of dcf in enriched ns hs and as were proposed and compared hydroxylation was the crucial transformation step in the three transformation pathways a faster hydroxylation reaction contributed to the faster removal of dcf in enriched ns more transformation products tps and reaction types i e reductive dechlorination sulphidation and methylation reactions were observed in hs furthermore some tps that were resistant to degrade in enriched ns such as dcf benzoic acid could be further transformed in hs accordingly enriched ns could remove dcf more rapidly while hs could further transform some tps resistant to degrade in enriched ns nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes may cooperatively and rapidly eliminate not only dcf but also its tps graphical abstract image 1 keywords diclofenac transformation pathways enriched nitrifying sludge heterotrophic sludge activated sludge 1 introduction diclofenac dcf which is a compound listed in the regulation of the global water research coalition and australian guidelines for water recycling bui et al 2016 has raised increasing concern owing to its adverse effects on human health and ecosystems oaks et al 2004 yokota et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the major sources and sinks of dcf discharged into downstream water bodies petrie et al 2015 the fate of dcf in wwtps is poorly understood which hampers the efficient removal of dcf zhou et al 2019 thus a mechanistic understanding of the transformation process and fate of dcf in wwtps should be realised presently activated sludge as biodegradation is the most commonly used treatment technology in wwtps nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes make up the major body of as that play a role in removing cod and nutrients ni et al 2008 dcf has been found to be removed in nitrifying sludge ns fal√•s et al 2018 and heterotrophic sludge hs tran et al 2017 previous studies concerning the transformation of dcf in ns and hs mainly focused on the removal of parent compounds for example the removal of dcf were reported as 75 in ns tran et al 2009 and 35 in hs moreira et al 2018 however the elimination of dcf does not mean complete mineralisation of dcf bletsou et al 2015 generally the degradation of dcf through biological processes constitutes a series of transformation steps wu et al 2019 some transformation products tps may be more toxic than the parent compound during degradation chen et al 2019 for example fu et al 2020 found that the lc50 of dcf methyl ester was 430 times lower than that of dcf after biotransformation therefore attention to the parent compound alone is clearly insufficient further exploration of transformation processes of dcf especially for the tps and the reactions involved is needed some tps of dcf have been identified in previous studies for example jewell et al 2016 investigated the transformation of dcf in hybrid biofilm as processes and compared the tps formed in contact with biofilm and suspended sludge bouju et al 2016 explored the transformation of dcf in as and found that 4 oh dcf is a crucial tp during the transformation process these studies provided some insights into the transformation processes of dcf in biological treatment systems however because the ns and hs play a role in as and biofilm systems the difference in dcf transformation in ns and hs is hardly distinguished men et al 2017 understanding the unique tps and related transformation reactions completed in ns and hs is of crucial importance it can provide the potential cause of the kinetic differences in the removal of dcf in ns and hs it can also provide insights into the actual roles of ns and hs in the transformation of dcf which is beneficial to the design of a more robust biological treatment system for dcf removal in the future khunjar et al 2011 a large range of micropollutants have been found to degrade during nitrification through co metabolic biodegradation kumwimba and meng 2019 xu et al 2016 the responsible ammonia monooxygenase amo transforms organic micropollutants mainly through hydroxylation men et al 2016 furthermore the biodiversity of hs is higher than that of ns which contributes to the versatile metabolic functions toward the transformation of dcf catalysed by various enzymes han et al 2019 krah et al 2016 these results demonstrate that the transformation processes of dcf in ns and hs are different however knowledge gaps have not yet been filled in this study 15 batch experiments were conducted to identify the transformation pathways and tps of dcf in enriched ns hs and as the goals of the present study were 1 to identify the tps and propose the transformation pathways of dcf in enriched ns and hs 2 to compare the dcf degradation processes in enriched ns and hs and 3 to reveal the respective roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf this research will deepen our understanding of the degradation of dcf by nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes and contribute to the development of enhanced removal of dcf during wastewater treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and consumables dcf cas 15307 86 5 was supplied by sigma aldrich the four major tps of 4 oh dcf 4 hydroxy dcf cas 64118 84 9 5 oh dcf 5 hydroxy dcf cas 69002 84 2 dcf lactam n 2 6 dichlorophenyl 2 indolinone cas 15362 40 0 and dcf ba dcf benzoic acid cas 13625 57 5 were provided by trc toronto canada details on dcf and the four tps are shown in table s1 methanol hplc grade was purchased from merck darmstadt germany milli q water was prepared from a millipore purification system milli q millipore other chemicals analytical grade were provided by the nanjing chemical reagent factory china solid phase extraction spe cartridges hlb 200 mg 6 ml were obtained from anpel shanghai china stock solutions of target compounds were prepared in methanol meoh and kept at 20 c aerobic as was collected from an oxidizing ditch in a municipal wwtp to be as similar as possible to the environmental conditions so that the experimental results can be extrapolated to a practical engineered system men et al 2017 enriched mixed microbial cultures rather than pure bacteria were used for the dcf transformation enriched ns refers to enriched nitrifying microbes from as in a laboratory scale membrane bio reactor described by wu et al 2018 because organic carbon was not added during the enrichment process of ns only the nitrification occurred in enriched ns hs refers to enriched heterotrophic microbes incubated from as for one month by addition of allylthiourea atu to inhibit the activity of nitrifying microbes the method for the enrichment of hs was obtained from khunjar et al 2011 with a slight modification briefly nitrifying activity was inhibited by 30 mg l of atu added in the influent detailed information for enrichment ns and hs is provided in text s1 the characteristics of the nitrifying and heterotrophic metabolic activities of enriched ns hs and as are shown in fig s1 a detailed discussion based on fig s1 is provided in text s2 2 2 batch experiment design the batch experiments can be categorised into four groups namely 1 degradation of dcf and its four major tps in experiments with enriched ns 2 degradation of dcf and its four major tps in experiments with hs 3 degradation of dcf in experiments with as and 4 further degradation of enriched ns effluent by hs the detailed experimental parameters are listed in table 1 batch experiments were conducted in 2 l beakers wrapped in aluminium foil with a reaction volume of 1 l different mixed microbial cultures were obtained according to the description in section 2 1 the biomass was washed three times with a phosphate buffer solution to ensure that nh4 n no2 n no3 n and cod were removed completely the biomass of each batch reactor was controlled by dilution with milli q water to a concentration of approximately 2000 mg l for mlss the do concentration was maintained at 2 5 mg l by controlling the air flow rates the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 05 by automatically adding nahco3 stock solution 500 mg l in the hs transformation experiments 30 mg l of atu was added again to inhibit the nitrifying activity all the experiments except for the control were spiked with stock solutions of target compounds to an initial concentration of 500 Œºg l the cod and nh4 n stock solutions were added according to the concentrations shown in table 1 during the experimental process samples were collected by filtering through a 0 45 Œºm pore size filter xinya shanghai china with 20 ml at time points of 0 0 0 5 2 0 8 0 12 0 24 0 and 48 0 h 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 quantitative and qualitative detection of diclofenac and its transformation products the water samples obtained from the batch experiments were prepared by solid phase extraction spe and the spe method was adopted from jiang et al 2017 the final extracted samples were diluted to 1 ml and stored at 20 c until analysis the quantitative analysis of dcf was completed by a sciex api 4000 lc ms ms triple quad mass spectrometer shanghai sciex analytical instrument trading co in the negative ion multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode with electrospray ionisation esi all the samples were detected in triplicate to obtain quantitative results the qualification method of dcf by mrm acquisition can be found in table s2 the qualitative detection of tps was completed by a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer in esi and esi modes triple tof 5600 ab sciex usa the detailed information of the operating parameters for qualitative detection is provided in text s3 chromatographic separation was performed with an infinitylab poroshell hph c18 column 2 1 100 0 mm 2 7 Œºm agilent at 30 c in gradient elution mode and the mobile phase was 0 1 of ammonium hydroxide solution in water a and methanol b the gradient elution started at 95 a for 1 min then changed to 10 a in 2 min and maintained for 20 min and was finally changed to 95 a in 6 min and maintained for 1 min 2 3 2 workflow for the identification of transformation products for the analysis of high resolution mass spectrum data peakview software was used for the identification and structural characterisation of tps the approach to identify the tps was to screen the total ion chromatogram acquired in full scan mode owing to the complexity of the biological samples the background subtraction of mass chromatograms was first conducted the screening methods were adopted from barzen hanson et al 2017 to investigate the tps of dcf the suspected list of tps formed by dcf biotransformation was collected from previous literature and tps prediction system eawag pps and pathpred the peaks of suspects were chosen by the exact mass within 0 01 da positive hits were selected by a a signal to noise ratio 3 b intensity 1000 c accurate mass error with 5 ppm error and d isotope ratio difference 10 for the suspected peak detected by the full scan ms ms fragmentation information was further acquired by tuning the collision energy ce for every suspected tp p√©rez and barcel√≥ 2007 the fragment formed under the optimised ce with the highest signal response was identified as the primary daughter ion for the corresponding peak p√©rez and barcel√≥ 2007 in combination with the mol file manually formatted by chem bio office software cambridgesoft usa the compound structure was determined and explained in peakview software 2 4 statistical analysis the results were analysed by spss 19 0 software the quantitative results were expressed as mean values standard deviation the significant difference of each batch experiment was tested according to the one way analysis of variance and the p value 0 05 was the accepted measure of statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of diclofenac by enriched ns hs and as fig 1 presents the time dependent removal of dcf by enriched ns hs and as the removal of dcf was fast in the first 0 5 h after 48 h of incubation the total removal of dcf in enriched ns 83 89 1 90 was significantly higher than that in hs 49 58 2 10 p 0 05 the degradation process followed the first order kinetic equation consistently the first order kinetic constant of dcf removal in enriched ns 0 7056 0 0696 d 1 was three times higher than that in hs 0 2232 0 0096 d 1 this implied that dcf was removed more efficiently in enriched ns than in hs park et al 2017 the removal of dcf in enriched ns was 34 57 higher than that in as this was because the amount of nitrifying microbes was higher in enriched ns about 75 than in the as 5 because the biomass in these two experiments was the same the proportion of nitrifying microbes was larger for enriched ns this further verifies the superior removal of dcf in enriched ns compared with that in hs comparing the removal of dcf observed in the hs and as transformation experiments the removal of dcf by as was 15 01 higher than that in the hs transformation experiment which confirmed that nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes can degrade dcf simultaneously in as therefore the likely roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf are worth exploring 3 2 products and pathway of diclofenac transformation in enriched ns 3 2 1 products of diclofenac transformation in enriched ns nine major tps were identified in the transformation experiments of dcf in enriched ns table s3 summarises the tps with their corresponding theoretical calculated mass and the observed mass of the precursor ions and molecular formula retention time and suggested structure for the four tps of 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba and dcf lactam the structure was confirmed via the reference standards for the other five tps the plausible molecular formula was confirmed by the formula finder in peakview within 5 ppm error meanwhile the isotopic pattern caused by two chlorine atoms 9 3 1 was also used to verify the plausible molecular formula finally the structure of these tps was speculated by the ms ms profile fig s3 and from previous studies bouju et al 2016 facey et al 2018 jewell et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba and dcf lactam could be degraded in enriched ns table 1 a2 a5 with regard to the transformation of 4 oh dcf in enriched ns only the tp of dcf ba was detected fig s4 which could be attributed to decarboxylation oxidation and subsequent dehydroxylation jewell et al 2016 also identified the tp of dcf ba in a biofilm system and a similar transformation reaction was found four tps dcf ba tp298 tp268 and tp310b formed via 5 oh dcf are shown in fig s4 dcf ba was detected again and might have been formed through the same transformation reaction discussed above for tp298 the reaction involved decarboxylation oxidation was similar to that in the transformation of dcf ba in terms of tp268 decarboxylation was attributed to its formation from 5 oh dcf similar reactions were observed for diatrizoate biotransformation decarboxylation participated in the last transformation step of diatrizoate biotransformation in as redeker et al 2014 for tp310b oxidation contributed to its formation the oxidation within the benzene ring may result in the ring breaking which would be beneficial to the complete metabolism of dcf in biological wastewater treatment systems brezina et al 2015 for dcf ba no tp was detected after 24 h of incubation which implied that dcf ba cannot further transform by nitrifying microbes in addition two tps namely dcf ba and tp268 were identified in the dcf lactam transformation experiment fig s4 for dcf ba and tp268 the involved reaction has been discussed above 3 2 2 transformation pathway of diclofenac in enriched ns according to the tps of the parent compound and four intermediates identified in enriched ns a tentative transformation pathway was profiled as shown in fig 2 the details on the deduction of the transformation pathway of dcf are provided in text s4 based on the holistic transformation pathway the postulated reactions concerning the formation of dcf were hydroxylation decarboxylation amidation oxidation and nitration except for tp325 and tp341 the formation of all tps was correlated with 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf this implied that hydroxylation of dcf may be the crucial step for the transformation of dcf bouju et al 2016 in addition the formation of tp325 and tp341 was uncorrelated with any of the other four major tps therefore tp325 and tp341 were speculated to form directly from dcf in our previous study tp325 and tp341 were found to be formed through reacting with no2 n formed during nitrification in enriched ns wu et al 2019 and they were first identified by perez and barcelo 2008 similarly the nitration nitrosation transformation products of dcf has also been found in wastewater osorio et al 2014 2016 and soil chiron and duwig 2016 in addition dcf lactam seems to be an unstable tp as it can be converted back to dcf this conversion reactions seems to be common for compounds containing amino and carboxyl groups in biological wastewater treatment processes which has also been reported by henning et al 2018 for gabapentin biotransformation 3 3 products and pathways of diclofenac transformation in hs 3 3 1 products of diclofenac transformation in hs twelve tps of dcf were detected in hs table s4 to determine the transformation pathway of dcf in hs four intermediates accessible to reference standards were incubated separately for 24 h there were four tps dcf ba tp392a tp275 and tp268 detected in the transformation of 4 oh dcf fig s5 the reaction involved in the formation of dcf ba has been discussed above for tp268 a similar decarboxylation reaction was discussed in the hs the formation of tp275 was attributed to the oxidation within the benzene ring and subsequent reductive dechlorination reductive dechlorination is a common reaction for micropollutants with halogen in biological wastewater treatment jewell et al 2016 tp392a was formed through the replacement of a hydrogen atom with a sulphonic acid group which was likely catalysed by a sulphotransferase enzyme generally sulphidation will increase the polarity of a compound which is beneficial to its excretion from the inside of organisms chapman et al 2004 this can be regarded as a method of detoxification for many bacteria fungi and mammals bartmanska et al 2013 two tps dcf ba and tp392b were formed from 5 oh dcf in hs fig s5 in addition three tps dcf ba tp310a and tp310b were formed via dcf lactam in terms of the transformation of dcf ba six tps ware detected fig s5 the reaction mechanism for tp392a tp392b tp268 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf has been discussed above for tp328 two hydroxyl were added to dcf this reaction has also been revealed during the transformation of dcf in biofilm as processes jewell et al 2016 3 3 2 transformation pathway of diclofenac in hs according to the transformation pathway of the four primary intermediates and the tps detected in the dcf biotransformation experiments a detailed transformation pathway of dcf was postulated fig 3 the details on the deduction of the transformation pathway of dcf are provided in text s4 the observed reactions attributed to the formation of tps were hydroxylation decarbonylation amidation oxidation sulphidation and deduction dechlorinate hydroxylation observed in the initial reactions was attributed to the formation of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf the other eight tps were formed through the further transformation of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf this implied the crucial role of hydroxylation during the transformation of dcf furthermore sulphidation and oxidation within the benzene ring are also important reactions for dcf transformation moreira et al 2018 tp326 was directly transformed from dcf rather than the four mediated products 4 of dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba and dcf lactam this tp might have been formed by the hydroxylation reaction and subsequent methylation reaction moreira et al 2018 3 4 products and pathway of diclofenac transformation in as fourteen tps of dcf were identified in the as transformation experiments they included all the tps detected in enriched ns and as discussed in figs 2 and 3 except for tp298 the transformation pathway of dcf in as is shown in fig 4 the reactions concerning the transformation of dcf in as were hydroxylation decarbonylation amidation oxidation sulphidation nitration and deduction dechlorinate in addition the formation of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf was crucial for the further transformation of dcf as shown in fig 4 tp392a tp275 tp268 tp328 and dcf ba can form through 4 oh dcf tp268 tp392b and dcf ba can form through 5 oh dcf in addition tp325 and tp341 can be observed during the transformation of dcf 3 5 differences among the transformation pathways of diclofenac in enriched ns hs and as the unique tps reaction types and transformation pathway in enriched ns hs and as can be seen in table 2 tp325 and tp341 only be detected in enriched ns and as which suggested that tp325 and tp341 were formed during nitrification process the detection profiles of tp325 and tp341 in hs and as can also verified that nitrification process caused the formation of tp325 and tp341 5 tps tp310a tp326 tp392a tp392b and tp275 only be detected in hs compared with in enriched ns transformation experiments which means that the reactions dechloridation sulphidation and mythylation attributed to the formation of these 5 tps only be initiated by heterotrophic microbes for the transformation pathway dcf ba cannot be transformed in enriched ns while can be transformed in hs a continuously upward trend was found in enriched ns for dcf ba fig 5 while the amount of dcf ba in the hs transformation experiment decreased first and then increased this was coincidental with the transformation pathway shown in figs 2 and 3 where no tps were detected in the dcf ba transformation experiment with enriched ns but five tps were found for hs the transformation of dcf ba to tp268 could be observed in the hs fig s5 and fig 3 and as fig 4 transformation experiments while the formation of tp268 only be observed in transformation experiment of dcf lactam with enriched ns fig s4 furthermore dcf ba could mutually transform with 5 oh dcf and 4 oh dcf in the as and hs transformation experiments while this pathway was not found in the enriched ns transformation experiments obviously more tps and reaction types can be found in hs compared with in enriched ns in addition the tps reaction types and transformation pathway found in enriched ns and hs all found in as except for tp298 the results imply two major messages the first is that the transformation of dcf by heterotrophic microbes is more versatile than by nitrifying microbes which could avoid the unfavourable outcome that some tps such as dcf ba accumulate during the transformation process the second is that nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes manually participate in the transformation process of dcf in as for hs the biodiversity may contribute to the versatile reaction types and further transformation of some tps resistant to degradation in enriched ns biodiversity plays a crucial role in the transformation of micropollutants has been verified johnson et al 2015 stravs et al 2019 in the microorganism culture more abundant bacteria means that there are more functional genes and catalysing enzymes that play a role in the transformation of micropollutants and their tps johnson et al 2015 these versatile genes and enzymes can participate in the different transformation reactions of dcf fig 5 shows the quantitative dcf ba 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf and semi quantitative results dcf lactam of tps during the transformation processes in enriched ns hs and as for the hydroxylated products 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf a rapidly upward and then downward trend can be seen in enriched ns 1 187 Œºg l at 0 5 h however the amounts of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf increased slowly 0 134307 Œºg l at 0 5 h in hs comparing the amounts of the two tps in enriched ns and hs the formation of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf was substantially faster in enriched ns this demonstrated that the hydroxylation reaction of dcf by nitrifying microbes was faster than by heterotrophic microbes which may be caused by the nonspecific amo possessed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria extensive studies have demonstrated that amo can transform micropollutants through hydroxylation reactions han et al 2019 men et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 in view of the crucial role of hydroxylation during the transformation processes of dcf discussed above there were five eight and seven tps formed by 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf in the enriched ns hs and as transformation experiments respectively the faster hydroxylation of dcf in enriched ns may explain why dcf was removed faster in the enriched ns transformation experiments 3 6 further transformation of effluent from enriched ns in hs according to the differences and insights obtained from the transformation pathway of dcf by enriched ns hs and as the greater number of reaction types observed in hs seem to provide the foundation for the further transformation of some tps resistant to degradation during nitrification such as dcf ba therefore to verify this hypothesis the effluent obtained from enriched ns 0 45 Œºm filter to eliminate microorganisms was further incubated in hs for 12 h there were nine tps including dcf detected in the enriched ns effluent namely 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf tp310b dcf ba tp341 tp268 tp325 dcf lactam and tp298 after 12 h of degradation in hs 10 tps were detected namely tp326 tp310a tp310b 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba tp341 tp268 tp325 and tp328 some tps such as dcf lactam and tp298 were completely metabolised in hs in addition some new tps formed in hs namely tp310a tp328 and tp326 these three tps only occurred in hs fig 3 which demonstrated that the reaction that contributed to form these tps only occurred in hs furthermore the greater number of tps found in hs also implied that the function of dcf transformation by heterotrophic microbes was more versatile for the tps detected through both of these types of bacterial transformation the peak area during the transformation process is shown in fig 6 for most of the tps such as 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba and tp268 a downward trend can be seen this suggested that these tps can be further removed in hs however four tps tp310a tp310b tp325 and tp341 showed an upward trend during the transformation process for tp325 and tp341 the no2 n formed during nitrification process may attribute to the formation of them in the present experiment because the influent was from the effluent in a1 through ns transformation no2 n could not be removed completely 0 5 mg l of no2 n could be detected therefore they could further react with dcf in the subsequent time which caused the continuous upward trend in tp325 and tp341 during the present experiment for tp310a and tp310b the upward trend could be explained by the faster oxidation reaction by adding an oxygen atom to the benzene ring in hs this reaction type was mainly completed in hs moreira et al 2018 taken together the dcf associated metabolites generated under nitrifying conditions could be further transformed in hs especially for dcf ba which was accumulated in enriched ns in view of the extra bonus on the removal of aromatic compounds during nitrification hyman et al 1988 keener and arp 1994 studies concerning the removal of micropollutants in enriched ns have increased in the past few years tran et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 recently the respective roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of micropollutants in active sludge have begun to be assessed objectively khunjar et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 the present study provides detailed evidence for the actual role of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf in the presence of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes such as in the as system it was speculated that the parent compound of dcf can be removed faster in enriched ns and stable tps formed in enriched ns can be further transformed in hs this can be seen as a corporative process beneficial to the rapid and further transformation of dcf by nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes overall this is the first study focusing on the corporative role of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf which highlights the importance of heterotrophic microbes in the further transformation of some intermediates of dcf in practical wastewater processes the influent inevitably contains not only cod but also nutrients which cause the co existence of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in wastewater treatment systems this is beneficial to the cooperative transformation of dcf by nitrification and heterotrophic microbes however the proportion of nitrifying microbes in the whole system is generally low which limits the rapid hydroxylation of dcf therefore enhancing the nitrification is a feasible strategy for rapid and further transformation of dcf in addition the large number of tps of dcf formed during biological wastewater treatment processes also implies the potential risk of by products of dcf which should be further studied 4 conclusions dcf can be transformed in enriched hs hs and as the removal rate constant of dcf in enriched ns was three times higher than that in hs nine twelve and fourteen tps were identified in the transformation of dcf in enriched ns hs and as respectively hydroxylation was observed to be the crucial step for the transformation of dcf heterotrophic microbes have a greater variety of metabolic reactions to transform dcf and some tps that cannot be further transformed during nitrification accordingly nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes can function cooperatively to transform dcf and they should be taken account simultaneously to enhance the reliability of wastewater treatment systems to eliminate dcf in practical wwtps the respective contribution of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes to the removal of dcf should be further

17678,the adverse effects of diclofenac dcf on ecosystems and human health have induced increasing interest in its elimination in environment dcf can be removed to some extent by nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes during wastewater treatment process however the actual roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf remain unclear in this study batch experiments were conducted to explore the biological transformation of dcf in enriched nitrifying sludge ns heterotrophic sludge hs and activated sludge as systems dcf was removed three times faster in enriched ns than in hs three transformation pathways of dcf in enriched ns hs and as were proposed and compared hydroxylation was the crucial transformation step in the three transformation pathways a faster hydroxylation reaction contributed to the faster removal of dcf in enriched ns more transformation products tps and reaction types i e reductive dechlorination sulphidation and methylation reactions were observed in hs furthermore some tps that were resistant to degrade in enriched ns such as dcf benzoic acid could be further transformed in hs accordingly enriched ns could remove dcf more rapidly while hs could further transform some tps resistant to degrade in enriched ns nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes may cooperatively and rapidly eliminate not only dcf but also its tps graphical abstract image 1 keywords diclofenac transformation pathways enriched nitrifying sludge heterotrophic sludge activated sludge 1 introduction diclofenac dcf which is a compound listed in the regulation of the global water research coalition and australian guidelines for water recycling bui et al 2016 has raised increasing concern owing to its adverse effects on human health and ecosystems oaks et al 2004 yokota et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the major sources and sinks of dcf discharged into downstream water bodies petrie et al 2015 the fate of dcf in wwtps is poorly understood which hampers the efficient removal of dcf zhou et al 2019 thus a mechanistic understanding of the transformation process and fate of dcf in wwtps should be realised presently activated sludge as biodegradation is the most commonly used treatment technology in wwtps nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes make up the major body of as that play a role in removing cod and nutrients ni et al 2008 dcf has been found to be removed in nitrifying sludge ns fal√•s et al 2018 and heterotrophic sludge hs tran et al 2017 previous studies concerning the transformation of dcf in ns and hs mainly focused on the removal of parent compounds for example the removal of dcf were reported as 75 in ns tran et al 2009 and 35 in hs moreira et al 2018 however the elimination of dcf does not mean complete mineralisation of dcf bletsou et al 2015 generally the degradation of dcf through biological processes constitutes a series of transformation steps wu et al 2019 some transformation products tps may be more toxic than the parent compound during degradation chen et al 2019 for example fu et al 2020 found that the lc50 of dcf methyl ester was 430 times lower than that of dcf after biotransformation therefore attention to the parent compound alone is clearly insufficient further exploration of transformation processes of dcf especially for the tps and the reactions involved is needed some tps of dcf have been identified in previous studies for example jewell et al 2016 investigated the transformation of dcf in hybrid biofilm as processes and compared the tps formed in contact with biofilm and suspended sludge bouju et al 2016 explored the transformation of dcf in as and found that 4 oh dcf is a crucial tp during the transformation process these studies provided some insights into the transformation processes of dcf in biological treatment systems however because the ns and hs play a role in as and biofilm systems the difference in dcf transformation in ns and hs is hardly distinguished men et al 2017 understanding the unique tps and related transformation reactions completed in ns and hs is of crucial importance it can provide the potential cause of the kinetic differences in the removal of dcf in ns and hs it can also provide insights into the actual roles of ns and hs in the transformation of dcf which is beneficial to the design of a more robust biological treatment system for dcf removal in the future khunjar et al 2011 a large range of micropollutants have been found to degrade during nitrification through co metabolic biodegradation kumwimba and meng 2019 xu et al 2016 the responsible ammonia monooxygenase amo transforms organic micropollutants mainly through hydroxylation men et al 2016 furthermore the biodiversity of hs is higher than that of ns which contributes to the versatile metabolic functions toward the transformation of dcf catalysed by various enzymes han et al 2019 krah et al 2016 these results demonstrate that the transformation processes of dcf in ns and hs are different however knowledge gaps have not yet been filled in this study 15 batch experiments were conducted to identify the transformation pathways and tps of dcf in enriched ns hs and as the goals of the present study were 1 to identify the tps and propose the transformation pathways of dcf in enriched ns and hs 2 to compare the dcf degradation processes in enriched ns and hs and 3 to reveal the respective roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf this research will deepen our understanding of the degradation of dcf by nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes and contribute to the development of enhanced removal of dcf during wastewater treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

solid phase extraction spe cartridges hlb 200 mg 6 ml were obtained from anpel shanghai china stock solutions of target compounds were prepared in methanol meoh and kept at 20 c aerobic as was collected from an oxidizing ditch in a municipal wwtp to be as similar as possible to the environmental conditions so that the experimental results can be extrapolated to a practical engineered system men et al 2017 enriched mixed microbial cultures rather than pure bacteria were used for the dcf transformation enriched ns refers to enriched nitrifying microbes from as in a laboratory scale membrane bio reactor described by wu et al 2018 because organic carbon was not added during the enrichment process of ns only the nitrification occurred in enriched ns hs refers to enriched heterotrophic microbes incubated from as for one month by addition of allylthiourea atu to inhibit the activity of nitrifying microbes the method for the enrichment of hs was obtained from khunjar et al 2011 with a slight modification briefly nitrifying activity was inhibited by 30 mg l of atu added in the influent detailed information for enrichment ns and hs is provided in text s1 the characteristics of the nitrifying and heterotrophic metabolic activities of enriched ns hs and as are shown in fig s1 a detailed discussion based on fig s1 is provided in text s2 2 2 batch experiment design the batch experiments can be categorised into four groups namely 1 degradation of dcf and its four major tps in experiments with enriched ns 2 degradation of dcf and its four major tps in experiments with hs 3 degradation of dcf in experiments with as and 4 further degradation of enriched ns effluent by hs the detailed experimental parameters are listed in table 1 batch experiments were conducted in 2 l beakers wrapped in aluminium foil with a reaction volume of 1 l different mixed microbial cultures were obtained according to the description in section 2 1 the biomass was washed three times with a phosphate buffer solution to ensure that nh4 n no2 n no3 n and cod were removed completely the biomass of each batch reactor was controlled by dilution with milli q water to a concentration of approximately 2000 mg l for mlss the do concentration was maintained at 2 5 mg l by controlling the air flow rates the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 05 by automatically adding nahco3 stock solution 500 mg l in the hs transformation experiments 30 mg l of atu was added again to inhibit the nitrifying activity all the experiments except for the control were spiked with stock solutions of target compounds to an initial concentration of 500 Œºg l the cod and nh4 n stock solutions were added according to the concentrations shown in table 1 during the experimental process samples were collected by filtering through a 0 45 Œºm pore size filter xinya shanghai china with 20 ml at time points of 0 0 0 5 2 0 8 0 12 0 24 0 and 48 0 h 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 quantitative and qualitative detection of diclofenac and its transformation products the water samples obtained from the batch experiments were prepared by solid phase extraction spe and the spe method was adopted from jiang et al 2017 the final extracted samples were diluted to 1 ml and stored at 20 c until analysis the quantitative analysis of dcf was completed by a sciex api 4000 lc ms ms triple quad mass spectrometer shanghai sciex analytical instrument trading co in the negative ion multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode with electrospray ionisation esi all the samples were detected in triplicate to obtain quantitative results the qualification method of dcf by mrm acquisition can be found in table s2 the qualitative detection of tps was completed by a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer in esi and esi modes triple tof 5600 ab sciex usa the detailed information of the operating parameters for qualitative detection is provided in text s3 chromatographic separation was performed with an infinitylab poroshell hph c18 column 2 1 100 0 mm 2 7 Œºm agilent at 30 c in gradient elution mode and the mobile phase was 0 1 of ammonium hydroxide solution in water a and methanol b the gradient elution started at 95 a for 1 min then changed to 10 a in 2 min and maintained for 20 min and was finally changed to 95 a in 6 min and maintained for 1 min 2 3 2 workflow for the identification of transformation products for the analysis of high resolution mass spectrum data peakview software was used for the identification and structural characterisation of tps the approach to identify the tps was to screen the total ion chromatogram acquired in full scan mode owing to the complexity of the biological samples the background subtraction of mass chromatograms was first conducted the screening methods were adopted from barzen hanson et al 2017 to investigate the tps of dcf the suspected list of tps formed by dcf biotransformation was collected from previous literature and tps prediction system eawag pps and pathpred the peaks of suspects were chosen by the exact mass within 0 01 da positive hits were selected by a a signal to noise ratio 3 b intensity 1000 c accurate mass error with 5 ppm error and d isotope ratio difference 10 for the suspected peak detected by the full scan ms ms fragmentation information was further acquired by tuning the collision energy ce for every suspected tp p√©rez and barcel√≥ 2007 the fragment formed under the optimised ce with the highest signal response was identified as the primary daughter ion for the corresponding peak p√©rez and barcel√≥ 2007 in combination with the mol file manually formatted by chem bio office software cambridgesoft usa the compound structure was determined and explained in peakview software 2 4 statistical analysis the results were analysed by spss 19 0 software the quantitative results were expressed as mean values standard deviation the significant difference of each batch experiment was tested according to the one way analysis of variance and the p value 0 05 was the accepted measure of statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of diclofenac by enriched ns hs and as fig 1 presents the time dependent removal of dcf by enriched ns hs and as the removal of dcf was fast in the first 0 5 h after 48 h of incubation the total removal of dcf in enriched ns 83 89 1 90 was significantly higher than that in hs 49 58 2 10 p 0 05 the degradation process followed the first order kinetic equation consistently the first order kinetic constant of dcf removal in enriched ns 0 7056 0 0696 d 1 was three times higher than that in hs 0 2232 0 0096 d 1 this implied that dcf was removed more efficiently in enriched ns than in hs park et al 2017 the removal of dcf in enriched ns was 34 57 higher than that in as this was because the amount of nitrifying microbes was higher in enriched ns about 75 than in the as 5 because the biomass in these two experiments was the same the proportion of nitrifying microbes was larger for enriched ns this further verifies the superior removal of dcf in enriched ns compared with that in hs comparing the removal of dcf observed in the hs and as transformation experiments the removal of dcf by as was 15 01 higher than that in the hs transformation experiment which confirmed that nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes can degrade dcf simultaneously in as therefore the likely roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf are worth exploring 3 2 products and pathway of diclofenac transformation in enriched ns 3 2 1 products of diclofenac transformation in enriched ns nine major tps were identified in the transformation experiments of dcf in enriched ns table s3 summarises the tps with their corresponding theoretical calculated mass and the observed mass of the precursor ions and molecular formula retention time and suggested structure for the four tps of 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba and dcf lactam the structure was confirmed via the reference standards for the other five tps the plausible molecular formula was confirmed by the formula finder in peakview within 5 ppm error meanwhile the isotopic pattern caused by two chlorine atoms 9 3 1 was also used to verify the plausible molecular formula finally the structure of these tps was speculated by the ms ms profile fig s3 and from previous studies bouju et al 2016 facey et al 2018 jewell et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba and dcf lactam could be degraded in enriched ns table 1 a2 a5 with regard to the transformation of 4 oh dcf in enriched ns only the tp of dcf ba was detected fig s4 which could be attributed to decarboxylation oxidation and subsequent dehydroxylation jewell et al 2016 also identified the tp of dcf ba in a biofilm system and a similar transformation reaction was found four tps dcf ba tp298 tp268 and tp310b formed via 5 oh dcf are shown in fig s4 dcf ba was detected again and might have been formed through the same transformation reaction discussed above for tp298 the reaction involved decarboxylation oxidation was similar to that in the transformation of dcf ba in terms of tp268 decarboxylation was attributed to its formation from 5 oh dcf similar reactions were observed for diatrizoate biotransformation decarboxylation participated in the last transformation step of diatrizoate biotransformation in as redeker et al 2014 for tp310b oxidation contributed to its formation the oxidation within the benzene ring may result in the ring breaking which would be beneficial to the complete metabolism of dcf in biological wastewater treatment systems brezina et al 2015 for dcf ba no tp was detected after 24 h of incubation which implied that dcf ba cannot further transform by nitrifying microbes in addition two tps namely dcf ba and tp268 were identified in the dcf lactam transformation experiment fig s4 for dcf ba and tp268 the involved reaction has been discussed above 3 2 2 transformation pathway of diclofenac in enriched ns according to the tps of the parent compound and four intermediates identified in enriched ns a tentative transformation pathway was profiled as shown in fig 2 the details on the deduction of the transformation pathway of dcf are provided in text s4 based on the holistic transformation pathway the postulated reactions concerning the formation of dcf were hydroxylation decarboxylation amidation oxidation and nitration except for tp325 and tp341 the formation of all tps was correlated with 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf this implied that hydroxylation of dcf may be the crucial step for the transformation of dcf bouju et al 2016 in addition the formation of tp325 and tp341 was uncorrelated with any of the other four major tps therefore tp325 and tp341 were speculated to form directly from dcf in our previous study tp325 and tp341 were found to be formed through reacting with no2 n formed during nitrification in enriched ns wu et al 2019 and they were first identified by perez and barcelo 2008 similarly the nitration nitrosation transformation products of dcf has also been found in wastewater osorio et al 2014 2016 and soil chiron and duwig 2016 in addition dcf lactam seems to be an unstable tp as it can be converted back to dcf this conversion reactions seems to be common for compounds containing amino and carboxyl groups in biological wastewater treatment processes which has also been reported by henning et al 2018 for gabapentin biotransformation 3 3 products and pathways of diclofenac transformation in hs 3 3 1 products of diclofenac transformation in hs twelve tps of dcf were detected in hs table s4 to determine the transformation pathway of dcf in hs four intermediates accessible to reference standards were incubated separately for 24 h there were four tps dcf ba tp392a tp275 and tp268 detected in the transformation of 4 oh dcf fig s5 the reaction involved in the formation of dcf ba has been discussed above for tp268 a similar decarboxylation reaction was discussed in the hs the formation of tp275 was attributed to the oxidation within the benzene ring and subsequent reductive dechlorination reductive dechlorination is a common reaction for micropollutants with halogen in biological wastewater treatment jewell et al 2016 tp392a was formed through the replacement of a hydrogen atom with a sulphonic acid group which was likely catalysed by a sulphotransferase enzyme generally sulphidation will increase the polarity of a compound which is beneficial to its excretion from the inside of organisms chapman et al 2004 this can be regarded as a method of detoxification for many bacteria fungi and mammals bartmanska et al 2013 two tps dcf ba and tp392b were formed from 5 oh dcf in hs fig s5 in addition three tps dcf ba tp310a and tp310b were formed via dcf lactam in terms of the transformation of dcf ba six tps ware detected fig s5 the reaction mechanism for tp392a tp392b tp268 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf has been discussed above for tp328 two hydroxyl were added to dcf this reaction has also been revealed during the transformation of dcf in biofilm as processes jewell et al 2016 3 3 2 transformation pathway of diclofenac in hs according to the transformation pathway of the four primary intermediates and the tps detected in the dcf biotransformation experiments a detailed transformation pathway of dcf was postulated fig 3 the details on the deduction of the transformation pathway of dcf are provided in text s4 the observed reactions attributed to the formation of tps were hydroxylation decarbonylation amidation oxidation sulphidation and deduction dechlorinate hydroxylation observed in the initial reactions was attributed to the formation of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf the other eight tps were formed through the further transformation of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf this implied the crucial role of hydroxylation during the transformation of dcf furthermore sulphidation and oxidation within the benzene ring are also important reactions for dcf transformation moreira et al 2018 tp326 was directly transformed from dcf rather than the four mediated products 4 of dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba and dcf lactam this tp might have been formed by the hydroxylation reaction and subsequent methylation reaction moreira et al 2018 3 4 products and pathway of diclofenac transformation in as fourteen tps of dcf were identified in the as transformation experiments they included all the tps detected in enriched ns and as discussed in figs 2 and 3 except for tp298 the transformation pathway of dcf in as is shown in fig 4 the reactions concerning the transformation of dcf in as were hydroxylation decarbonylation amidation oxidation sulphidation nitration and deduction dechlorinate in addition the formation of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf was crucial for the further transformation of dcf as shown in fig 4 tp392a tp275 tp268 tp328 and dcf ba can form through 4 oh dcf tp268 tp392b and dcf ba can form through 5 oh dcf in addition tp325 and tp341 can be observed during the transformation of dcf 3 5 differences among the transformation pathways of diclofenac in enriched ns hs and as the unique tps reaction types and transformation pathway in enriched ns hs and as can be seen in table 2 tp325 and tp341 only be detected in enriched ns and as which suggested that tp325 and tp341 were formed during nitrification process the detection profiles of tp325 and tp341 in hs and as can also verified that nitrification process caused the formation of tp325 and tp341 5 tps tp310a tp326 tp392a tp392b and tp275 only be detected in hs compared with in enriched ns transformation experiments which means that the reactions dechloridation sulphidation and mythylation attributed to the formation of these 5 tps only be initiated by heterotrophic microbes for the transformation pathway dcf ba cannot be transformed in enriched ns while can be transformed in hs a continuously upward trend was found in enriched ns for dcf ba fig 5 while the amount of dcf ba in the hs transformation experiment decreased first and then increased this was coincidental with the transformation pathway shown in figs 2 and 3 where no tps were detected in the dcf ba transformation experiment with enriched ns but five tps were found for hs the transformation of dcf ba to tp268 could be observed in the hs fig s5 and fig 3 and as fig 4 transformation experiments while the formation of tp268 only be observed in transformation experiment of dcf lactam with enriched ns fig s4 furthermore dcf ba could mutually transform with 5 oh dcf and 4 oh dcf in the as and hs transformation experiments while this pathway was not found in the enriched ns transformation experiments obviously more tps and reaction types can be found in hs compared with in enriched ns in addition the tps reaction types and transformation pathway found in enriched ns and hs all found in as except for tp298 the results imply two major messages the first is that the transformation of dcf by heterotrophic microbes is more versatile than by nitrifying microbes which could avoid the unfavourable outcome that some tps such as dcf ba accumulate during the transformation process the second is that nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes manually participate in the transformation process of dcf in as for hs the biodiversity may contribute to the versatile reaction types and further transformation of some tps resistant to degradation in enriched ns biodiversity plays a crucial role in the transformation of micropollutants has been verified johnson et al 2015 stravs et al 2019 in the microorganism culture more abundant bacteria means that there are more functional genes and catalysing enzymes that play a role in the transformation of micropollutants and their tps johnson et al 2015 these versatile genes and enzymes can participate in the different transformation reactions of dcf fig 5 shows the quantitative dcf ba 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf and semi quantitative results dcf lactam of tps during the transformation processes in enriched ns hs and as for the hydroxylated products 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf a rapidly upward and then downward trend can be seen in enriched ns 1 187 Œºg l at 0 5 h however the amounts of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf increased slowly 0 134307 Œºg l at 0 5 h in hs comparing the amounts of the two tps in enriched ns and hs the formation of 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf was substantially faster in enriched ns this demonstrated that the hydroxylation reaction of dcf by nitrifying microbes was faster than by heterotrophic microbes which may be caused by the nonspecific amo possessed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria extensive studies have demonstrated that amo can transform micropollutants through hydroxylation reactions han et al 2019 men et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 in view of the crucial role of hydroxylation during the transformation processes of dcf discussed above there were five eight and seven tps formed by 4 oh dcf and 5 oh dcf in the enriched ns hs and as transformation experiments respectively the faster hydroxylation of dcf in enriched ns may explain why dcf was removed faster in the enriched ns transformation experiments 3 6 further transformation of effluent from enriched ns in hs according to the differences and insights obtained from the transformation pathway of dcf by enriched ns hs and as the greater number of reaction types observed in hs seem to provide the foundation for the further transformation of some tps resistant to degradation during nitrification such as dcf ba therefore to verify this hypothesis the effluent obtained from enriched ns 0 45 Œºm filter to eliminate microorganisms was further incubated in hs for 12 h there were nine tps including dcf detected in the enriched ns effluent namely 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf tp310b dcf ba tp341 tp268 tp325 dcf lactam and tp298 after 12 h of degradation in hs 10 tps were detected namely tp326 tp310a tp310b 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba tp341 tp268 tp325 and tp328 some tps such as dcf lactam and tp298 were completely metabolised in hs in addition some new tps formed in hs namely tp310a tp328 and tp326 these three tps only occurred in hs fig 3 which demonstrated that the reaction that contributed to form these tps only occurred in hs furthermore the greater number of tps found in hs also implied that the function of dcf transformation by heterotrophic microbes was more versatile for the tps detected through both of these types of bacterial transformation the peak area during the transformation process is shown in fig 6 for most of the tps such as 4 oh dcf 5 oh dcf dcf ba and tp268 a downward trend can be seen this suggested that these tps can be further removed in hs however four tps tp310a tp310b tp325 and tp341 showed an upward trend during the transformation process for tp325 and tp341 the no2 n formed during nitrification process may attribute to the formation of them in the present experiment because the influent was from the effluent in a1 through ns transformation no2 n could not be removed completely 0 5 mg l of no2 n could be detected therefore they could further react with dcf in the subsequent time which caused the continuous upward trend in tp325 and tp341 during the present experiment for tp310a and tp310b the upward trend could be explained by the faster oxidation reaction by adding an oxygen atom to the benzene ring in hs this reaction type was mainly completed in hs moreira et al 2018 taken together the dcf associated metabolites generated under nitrifying conditions could be further transformed in hs especially for dcf ba which was accumulated in enriched ns in view of the extra bonus on the removal of aromatic compounds during nitrification hyman et al 1988 keener and arp 1994 studies concerning the removal of micropollutants in enriched ns have increased in the past few years tran et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 recently the respective roles of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of micropollutants in active sludge have begun to be assessed objectively khunjar et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 the present study provides detailed evidence for the actual role of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf in the presence of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes such as in the as system it was speculated that the parent compound of dcf can be removed faster in enriched ns and stable tps formed in enriched ns can be further transformed in hs this can be seen as a corporative process beneficial to the rapid and further transformation of dcf by nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes overall this is the first study focusing on the corporative role of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in the transformation of dcf which highlights the importance of heterotrophic microbes in the further transformation of some intermediates of dcf in practical wastewater processes the influent inevitably contains not only cod but also nutrients which cause the co existence of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes in wastewater treatment systems this is beneficial to the cooperative transformation of dcf by nitrification and heterotrophic microbes however the proportion of nitrifying microbes in the whole system is generally low which limits the rapid hydroxylation of dcf therefore enhancing the nitrification is a feasible strategy for rapid and further transformation of dcf in addition the large number of tps of dcf formed during biological wastewater treatment processes also implies the potential risk of by products of dcf which should be further studied 4 conclusions dcf can be transformed in enriched hs hs and as the removal rate constant of dcf in enriched ns was three times higher than that in hs nine twelve and fourteen tps were identified in the transformation of dcf in enriched ns hs and as respectively hydroxylation was observed to be the crucial step for the transformation of dcf heterotrophic microbes have a greater variety of metabolic reactions to transform dcf and some tps that cannot be further transformed during nitrification accordingly nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes can function cooperatively to transform dcf and they should be taken account simultaneously to enhance the reliability of wastewater treatment systems to eliminate dcf in practical wwtps the respective contribution of nitrifying and heterotrophic microbes to the removal of dcf should be further

17679,removal and recovery of phosphate from wastewater can minimize deleterious environmental impacts and supplement fertilizer supply hybrid anion exchangers haix with doped ferric oxide nanoparticles feonp can remove phosphate from complex wastewaters and recover concentrated phosphate solutions in this study we integrate haix with a weak acid cation exchanger wac to enrich phosphate

sensitivities of both materials electrochemically produced mild electrolytes ph 3 and ph 11 which are 100 1000 times less concentrated than typical regenerants preserved 80 wac and 50 haix capacities over five batch adsorption regeneration cycles feonp in haix facilitated regeneration due to ph sensitivity and their likely distribution on the resin particle surface which reduced intraparticle

is in high demand as a fertilizer constituent but is becoming increasingly scarce due to mining of non renewable phosphate rock rittmann et al 2011 excessive phosphate discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants cause eutrophication which has led to increasingly stringent discharge permits jorgensen 2001 mayer et al 2013 wu et al 2017 minimizing harmful environmental impacts and closing the phosphate loop require both removal i e capturing phosphate from wastewater and recovery i e separating phosphate as high purity products however conventional technologies typically focus on removal and struggle to achieve increasingly stringent discharge limits e g 0 1 mg p l for example biological nutrient removal bnr processes have difficulty reaching 95 nutrient removal rates and are sensitive to low temperature shock loads and carbon availability martin et al 2009 chemical precipitation could achieve 0 5 1 mg p l in effluent but treatment to a lower level 0 5 mg p l requires significantly higher metal salts dosing and sludge generation wu et al 2019 transferring aqueous phosphorus into sludge during chemical precipitation also makes phosphorus recovery challenging adsorption and regeneration with selective adsorbents can achieve phosphate removal and recovery phosphate selectivity enables adsorbents to capture phosphate amidst competing ions in complex wastewaters regenerability enables phosphate desorption for recovery as high purity products among various adsorbents hybrid materials created by doping metal oxide nanoparticles into different host

anion exchange resins sba commercial haix resins exhibit durability phosphate selectivity and regenerability moreover the positively charged resin phase in sba enhances anionic phosphate adsorption onto feonp known as the donnan membrane effect blaney et al 2007 cumbal and sengupta 2005 sarkar et al 2010 high capacity hybrid ion exchangers have been increasingly studied such as la iii oxide embedded anion exchangers la 201 providing 2 4 times higher capacity than haix chen et al 2015 haghseresht et al 2009 padungthon et al 2015 pan et al 2009 shepsko et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 however the high capacity caused by high affinity exhibits tradeoffs with regenerability la 201 requires 3 times the concentration of strong base regenerant 5 times higher regenerant volume and elevated temperature 60 c compared to haix wu et al 2019 regeneration using strong alkali regenerants remains a major obstacle for widespread implementation of anion exchange because of regenerant

the parent resin and ion exchange sites but still required strong base to regenerate phosphate from metal oxide ligand exchange sites reusing regenerant was proposed but still requires energy intensive chemical inputs after limited cycles huang et al 2020 electrochemical processes have been increasingly reported for water softening and phosphate recovery to reduce chemical inputs clauwaert et al 2020 lei et al 2017 electro assisted ph elevation can facilitate phosphate recovery from a calcium rich environment via precipitation lei et al 2020 2019 onsite electro assisted strong acid and base production was reported to save 40 cost compared to purchasing bulk chemicals for ion exchange regeneration davis et al 2015 however electrochemically producing strong acid ph 2 and base ph 13

producing mild acid and base e g 2 ph 13 could minimize chemical inputs and energy demand however the effects of lower electrolyte concentrations and energy inputs on electrochemical mild acid and base production have not been explored similarly regeneration of ion exchange materials with electrochemically produced mild regenerants remains understudied and could facilitate process intensification for adsorptive resource recovery in this study we present an electro assisted regeneration process for ion exchangers to facilitate sustainable phosphate removal and recovery two selective ion exchange materials a phosphate selective hybrid anion exchanger haix and a weak acid cation exchanger wac were integrated into a two column system to harvest both phosphate and calcium from wastewater fig 1 the novelty of this study is that both cation and anion exchangers are regenerated via electrochemically produced mild base ph 11 catholyte and acid ph 3 anolyte respectively by leveraging adsorbent ph sensitivity using batch column and spectroscopic experiments we probed the extents and mechanisms of electro assisted regeneration of haix and wac resins our specific goals were i to examine the ph sensitivity of haix and wac ii to investigate electro assisted mild acid and base production with minimal chemical and energy inputs iii to characterize the regenerability of haix and wac using electrochemically produced mild acid and base in batch reactors and iv to demonstrate proof of concept of electro assisted regeneration to remove and recover phosphate 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents four major adsorbents were tested in this study i a hybrid anion exchanger haix ferrixa33e purolite bala cynwyd pa ii a strong base anion exchange resin sba amberlite ira900

adsorption sites quaternary ammonium groups r4n on the host strong base anion exchange resin and ferric oxide nanoparticles feonp confined inside the polymeric phase the sba has a macroporous polystyrene backbone crosslinked with divinylbenzene representing the host material of haix with r4n moieties without feonp we also eluted feonp from haix using strong acid to further confirm the effect of feonp on phosphate sorption and desorption wac has a porous crosslinked polyacrylic backbone and carboxylic acid functional groups sac has a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer backbone with sulfonic acid moieties all commercial resins were used as received and characteristics are summarized in table s2 we chose haix and wac because of their phosphate and calcium selectivity respectively sba was the host material for haix which facilitated isolation of the effect of feonp comparing wac and sac informed cation exchanger choice in electro assisted calcium removal and recovery additionally we tested another commercial hybrid ion exchanger laynert solmetex northborough ma to compare with haix ferrixa33e purolite in terms of ph sensitivity section 3 1 including these haix alternatives helped generalize the mechanistic effects of feonp on phosphate sorption across multiple resins 2 2 batch adsorption and regeneration experiments batch adsorption and desorption tests were conducted to examine the ph sensitivity of haix and wac and to compare regenerability of haix with sba and wac with sac using electrochemically produced mild base catholyte and mild acid anolyte respectively four solutions were prepared for batch adsorption studies a synthetic wastewater ph 7 2 conductivity 1060 ¬µs cm containing 3 mg l p 96 mg l so4 2 and 50 mg l ca2 detailed composition in

2009 ph and conductivity were measured with a combined ph conductivity meter mp220 mettler toledo columbus oh to evaluate the interference of organic compounds on haix and wac adsorption capacity real secondary effluent was collected from palo alto regional water quality control plant n 37 27 10 325 w 122 6 40 521 for batch tests the wastewater was stored at 4 c and equilibrated to room temperature before use the real wastewater contained 22 3 mg l cod and had similar phosphorus and calcium concentration 3 6 mg l as p and 53 mg l ca2 as synthetic wastewater 3 mg l as p and 50 mg l ca2 synthetic and real wastewater composition are more comprehensively compared in table s1 batch adsorption tests were performed by mixing 0 01 g haix with 10 ml realwastewater and 0 005 g wac with 12 5 ml real wastewater for 24 h adsorption capacity during two adsorption cycles was determined for haix and wac 2 3 electrochemical mild acid and base production electrochemical water splitting was used to produce mildly acidic anolyte and mildly basic catholyte a two chamber parallel plate reactor was bolted together to create the anode and cathode chambers each 8 ml which were separated by a cation exchange membrane cem cmi 7000 the cathode was stainless steel and the anode was ti mesh coated with ir mixed metal oxide magneto special anodes netherlands both had 6 cm2 active surface area we used documented stable electrolytes 0 1 m na2so4 anolyte 0 1 m nacl catholyte due to the unfavorability of sulfate oxidation and chloride reduction at water splitting potentials tarpeh et al 2018 urtiaga et al 2015 to minimize chemical inputs we varied electrolyte concentration and current density in both chambers and monitored transient ph changes anolyte na2so4 concentration was decreased from 0 1 m to 0 05 m and 0 01 m catholyte nacl concentration was decreased from 0 1 m to 0 01 m and eventually replaced by the first 100 bed volumes bv of treated effluent from the haix wac column train chronopotentiometric experiments gamry 3000 potentiostat gamry instruments warminster pa were performed at three different current densities 10 5 and 1 ma cm2 to compare mild acid and base production under varying energy inputs anolyte and catholyte 100 ml each were recirculated separately into the corresponding chamber at 40 ml min for 60 min during each test unless otherwise specified the same setup was used to evaluate mild acid base production using real wastewater real wastewater was used as catholyte after batch treatment by mixing with haix and wac for 24 h 1 g of each resin in 500 ml solution the treated real wastewater was paired with 0 01 m na2so4 anolyte for electrochemical water splitting at 1 ma cm2 for 60 min ph changes in both catholyte and anolyte were monitored 2 4 column adsorption and regeneration experiments continuous fixed bed adsorption experiments were performed in a two column system fig 1 haix and wac 15 ml wet each were packed into each column synthetic wastewater composition in table s1 was pumped downwards through the column train contact time 3 min per column and effluent samples were collected periodically after resin exhaustion during the service cycle regeneration experiments were performed for each column separately columns were drained and backwashed using 2 bv deionized water then catholyte was continuously pumped through the haix column and anolyte was continuously pumped through the wac column contact time 30 min per column in downflow mode for 90 bv regeneration efficiency Œ≥ of phosphorus or calcium was calculated by eq 2 dividing eluted ion mass meluted mg by the adsorbed ion mass madsorbed mg 2 Œ≥ m e l u t e d m a d s o r b e d 100 2 5 spectroscopic analysis spectroscopic analysis was performed to elucidate regeneration mechanisms of haix fourier transform infrared spectra ftir were collected within the wavenumber range 400 4000 cm 1 by a nicolet is50 spectrometer thermofisher waltham ma with attenuated total reflectance atr x ray fluorescence xrf spectra were collected at beamline 14 3 at the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl to examine the distribution of phosphate and sulfate inside the haix beads the beam size was 5 Œºm which is suitable to map the sliced spherical beads 500 Œºm diameter the fluorescence signal was detected using a single element solid state vortex si drift detector data processing was conducted using the microanalysis toolkit software program bone et al 2017 2 6 statistical analysis batch adsorption and desorption capacities were compared using a one way anova and paired t tests ph values during electrochemical water splitting for varying electrolyte concentrations were compared using a one way anova test we considered results significantly different at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph sensitivity of haix and wac the ph sensitivity i e ph dependent capacity of haix and wac was examined to evaluate the potential of regenerating both materials with mild instead of strong acid and base solutions the effect of ph on p capacity differed drastically for haix compared to the parent sba p 0 05 fig 2 a increasing ph from 7 to 11 resulted in dramatic p capacity decline 88 capacity loss with haix p 0 0001 for qph7 vs qph11 but there was negligible capacity loss with sba p 0 5 for qph7 vs qph11 instead when decreasing ph from 7 to 3 sba exhibited dramatic p capacity decline 98 capacity loss p 0 005 for qph7 vs qph3 while there was negligible capacity loss with haix p 0 5 for qph7 vs qph3 a similar ph response as haix was observed using another commercial hybrid anion exchanger laynert figure s1 haix exhibited nearly 6 times higher p capacity than sba at neutral ph due to impregnation with feonp haix was more suitable for phosphate removal and recovery than sba due to its higher capacity and a more acute sensitivity to alkaline ph considering the embedded feonp is the major difference between haix and sba blaney et al 2007 the different ph responses of haix from sba were likely due to the feonp as a conventional anion exchanger sba contains only r4n groups which mainly adsorb phosphate through non specific electrostatic interactions zhang et al 2016 such interactions are subject to competition by other anions such as sulfate which is more negatively charged than phosphate at ph values below 7 2 the pka2 of phosphate thus the p capacity of sba was lower at acidic ph than neutral ph due to sulfate competition in contrast the p capacity of haix was less affected by reduced ph because feonp adsorbs phosphate strongly and selectively through specific lewis acid base interactions inner sphere complexes blaney et al 2007 german et al 2019 pan et al 2009 however the p capacity is highly affected by the surface charge of the feonp sites which is sensitive to ph the surface charge of feonp shifts from primarily neutral at ph 7 to negative at ph 11 figure s2 thus strongly expelling anionic phosphate and causing the observed reduction in p capacity previous studies focused on identifying the optimal working ph range of haix blaney et al 2007 pan et al 2009 but have not leveraged its ph sensitivity for regeneration with mild base e g ph 11 the ph sensitivity of wac has been previously established because of weakly acidic carboxylic acid functional groups pka 5 that adsorb calcium through electrostatic interactions adsorption capacity depends on the carboxylic acid groups being deprotonated at ph 5 negatively charged and being inactivated when protonated at ph 5 neutral tarpeh et al 2017 thus the calcium capacity of wac at acidic ph values ph 3 and 5 was 90 lower than at ph 8 p 0 0001 for qph5 vs qph8 this ph sensitivity narrows applicable conditions of wac but facilitates its mild acid regeneration 3 2 electro assisted mild acid and base production while it is well known that mild acid and base can be produced via electrochemical water splitting the ph values under varying background electrolyte concentrations are not completely established we observed nearly identical ph changes p 0 5 with varying catholyte background composition from 0 1 m nacl to 0 01 m nacl and treated effluent conductivity 900 ¬µs cm corresponding to 0 01 m as nacl fig 3 a c anolyte and catholyte reached ph 3 and ph 11 within 40 min under the lowest tested current density 1 ma cm2 corresponding to 144 c l facilitating simultaneous regeneration of both cation and anion exchangers when varying anolyte background concentration from 0 1 m na2so4 to 0 05 m and as low as 0 01 m fig 3d f ph 3 and ph 11 were also simultaneously reached within 40 min under conditions with decreasing chemical inputs in both catholyte orange arrow in fig 3 and anolyte blue arrow in fig 3 similar ph changes were achieved under a current density of 1 ma cm2 the minimal chemical inputs we achieved result from 0 01 m na2so4 conductivity 2200 ¬µs cm as anolyte and a complete replacement of chemical inputs in catholyte by reusing the effluent from the column train we anticipate that further chemical minimization can be achieved using more saline wastewater or industrial waste brine davis et al 2015 major obstacles to electrochemical regenerant production include the high conductivity needed to overcome internal solution resistance and the considerable time required to reach extreme ph values davis et al 2015 electrochemical production of mild acids and bases requires lower electrical conductivity lower current density and shorter electrolysis times all of which reduce energy requirements compared to producing strong acids and bases effects of current density and operation time on acid and base production were also studied compared with a current density of 1 ma cm2 higher current density 5 and 10 ma cm2 enabled stronger acid and base production ph 2 and ph 12 within the same time figure s3 however the maximum current density is constrained by electrolyte conductivity due to ohmic resistance in solution thus producing stronger acid and base would require more energy or chemical inputs with current density at 1 ma cm2 longer operation 20 h showed minimal ph changes after reaching ph 3 and 11 at 40 min figure s4 which implies stronger acid and base production via long operation is inefficient to determine whether electrochemically produced mild acid and base can regenerate cation wac and anion haix exchangers batch and column studies were conducted using the solutions produced with tested minimal chemical and energy inputs 0 01 m na2so4 as anolyte treated column effluent as catholyte current density at 1 ma cm2 unless otherwise specified 3 3 regeneration comparison of haix vs sba and wac vs sac batch adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted to compare regenerability of haix with sba and wac with sac via electrochemically produced mild base ph 11 and mild acid ph 3 in the presence of competing sulfate nah2po4 caso4 solution haix showed 2 5 times higher p capacity than sba figure s5a typically higher adsorbate adsorbent affinity requires more concentrated regenerants wu et al 2019 however 37 of haix was regenerated using mild regenerant figure s5b although the haix contains feonp that has high affinity on phosphate a larger ph drop was observed during desorption of haix compared to sba p 0 01 figure s5c implying that hydroxide ions oh exchange with phosphate ions on feonp you et al 2016 based on the previous discussion on feonp surface charge the consumed oh accumulated on feonp and negatively charged the feonp surface in contrast sba exhibited 40 desorption and minimal ph change indicating the background ions in the catholyte treated wastewater with around 1 mm so4 2 and 6 mm cl are likely regenerating r4n sites thus haix was demonstrated regenerable by weakly basic catholyte in which the ph and background ions were regenerating the two types of adsorption sites feonp and r4n in haix respectively wac exhibited a 50 higher calcium capacity than sac at ph 8 figure s5d consistent with manufacturer reports and previous research tarpeh et al 2017 the underlying reason is that carboxylate functional groups r coo in wac provide the same equivalence as sulfonic functional groups r so3 in sac but with a 45 lower molecular weight 44 g mol vs 80 g mol therefore wac theoretically carries more equivalence of counterions than sac with the same mass amount sengupta 2017 extending service time before regeneration during regeneration ph 3 anolyte nearly completely desorbed calcium from wac but led to little calcium desorption from sac figure s5e a two times higher regenerant ph p 0 02 after wac desorption and negligible ph changes p 0 1 during sac desorption figure s4f confirmed the uptake of hydrogen ions by wac which led to protonation and inactivation of carboxylic acid groups in batch regeneration haix and wac exhibited higher feasibilities than sba and sac for our proposed process in terms of selectivity capacity and regenerability by mild regenerants 3 4 cyclic batch adsorption cyclic batch adsorption regeneration experiments were conducted for haix and wac to examine their potential for multiple cycle reuse fig 4 considering the mild ph of the applied catholyte ph 11 for haix and the strong affinity of haix towards phosphate we anticipated and observed capacity loss during cyclic haix adsorption tests however the ph 11 catholyte maintained 50 haix capacity for multiple cycles cycles 2 5 after the 5th cycle adsorption a desorption test with 0 1 m naoh solution restored the haix capacity to nearly the capacity of fresh resins i e before the 1st cycle the restoration demonstrated that capacity loss was more likely due to incomplete regeneration than loss of feonp sites note that the 0 1 m naoh ph 13 is still weaker than typically applied 2 4 strong base e g 0 5 1 m naoh or koh blaney et al 2007 shepsko et al 2019 but exhibited 95 regeneration efficiency after the 6th adsorption cycle ph 11 catholyte desorption was again applied and 50 capacity was measured during the following 7th adsorption this robust repeatability demonstrated that weakly basic catholyte can regenerate haix for its reuse over multiple cycles for wac nearly 80 calcium was regenerated for 5 cycles with ph 3 anolyte fig 4b regeneration efficiency was higher for wac than haix regeneration mechanisms and limitations for haix were further studied using different regenerants 3 5 effects of different regenerants on haix regeneration compared to wac haix exhibited lower regeneration efficiency a more essential role in phosphate sorption and a more complex structure two site types instead of one thus we conducted detailed mechanistic studies to advance the understanding of haix regeneration using mild regenerant six different regenerants were evaluated for haix regeneration including three background solutions before water splitting ph 6 7 i treated effluent eff ii 0 01 m nacl and iii 0 1 m nacl and another three catholyte solutions after water splitting of the background solutions ph 11 because of the stable haix performance observed from the second to the fifth cycle fig 4a only the second cycle haix adsorption capacities were compared after batch regeneration using each regenerant fig 5 a these second cycle adsorption capacities were nearly identical using regenerants of similar ph values but higher using regenerants of ph 11 final catholytes than ph 6 7 initial background solutions p 0 01 varying the catholyte background under the same ph values did not affect the adsorption capacity confirming that ph is a major factor affecting haix regeneration to identify how ph affected different site types inside the haix r4n groups and feonp sites a similar test was conducted with sba r4n groups only fig 5b similar sba capacities p 0 5 after regeneration using catholyte ph 11 and background solutions ph 6 7 indicated that elevated ph did not affect r4n groups thus the enhanced capacity of haix using ph 11 catholyte was primarily attributed to the feonp sites to further confirm this conclusion haix beads without feonp sites were prepared by leaching feonp out using strong acids figure s6 and measuring phosphate adsorption as expected elevated ph was unable to enhance the haix capacity after feonp leaching which was similar to sba therefore feonp sites were the key factor that enhanced mild base regeneration of haix and were regenerated primarily due to the elevated ph to understand the performance limiting factor during ph 11 catholyte regeneration compared with 0 1 m naoh ph 13 solution ph changes during desorption were monitored figure s7 negligible ph changes were observed with 0 1 m naoh p 0 5 comparing initial and final ph values but ph significantly dropped in catholyte regenerants to below 10 p 0 05 comparing initial and final ph values the results imply that the 1 mm oh in ph 11 catholyte was insufficient to maintain a constant high ph causing the 50 regeneration efficiency batch studies revealed that feonp not only enhanced the haix capacity but also facilitated mild base regeneration of haix oh concentration is likely the performance limiting factor during mild base regeneration however 50 haix capacity was achieved over five cycles with ph 11 catholyte 3 6 spectroscopic analysis spectroscopic analysis was conducted to further elucidate molecular phenomena during haix regeneration atr ftir spectra of haix were collected at different time intervals during catholyte regeneration figure s8 the intensity of the peak representing the bending vibration of oh on feonp 895 cm 1 mei et al 2015 increased with regeneration time indicating the exchange of hydroxide ions adsorption and phosphate desorption on feonp sites during regeneration uptake of oh explains the ph drops during catholyte regeneration the slightly intensified bands representing the vibration of benzene ring on the polystyrene skeleton c c 1487 cm 1 and 1479 cm 1 and the stretching vibration of cn on the r4n groups 1241 cm 1 zhang et al 2019 indicated concomitant ion exchange due to phosphate desorption from the r4n groups and adsorption of the background ions in the catholyte xrf mapping of p phosphate and s sulfate on the sliced haix beads revealed a circular p distribution on the periphery of both exhausted and catholyte regenerated haix beads but not on the naoh regenerated beads figure s9 the observed circular p distribution pattern has been reported previously because it mirrors the peripheral distribution of metal oxides lin et al 2017 during hybrid ion exchanger fabrication cationic metal ions hardly penetrate the positively charged resin beads because of the donnan exclusion effect thus metal oxides sites are more distributed on the periphery of the beads kocio≈Çek balawejder et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 circular p distribution demonstrated that phosphate ion selectively bound to metal oxide sites dong et al 2018 lin et al 2017 the p distribution pattern in catholyte regenerated beads confirmed the incomplete regeneration at ph 11 and the diminished p pattern in the naoh regenerated bead confirmed the nearly complete regeneration at ph 13 3 7 continuous fixed bed column tests continuous fixed bed column tests were conducted to inform practical application of electro assisted regeneration during column adsorption with fresh haix phosphate was almost completely removed for roughly400 bvs and saturation occurred near 800 bvs figure s10a upon exhaustion ph 11 catholyte was pumped into the haix column contact time 30 min for 90 bvs exhibiting a regeneration efficiency Œ≥haix of nearly 50 by the end of the regeneration cycle fig 6 elution curve in figure s11a consistent with batch experiments the 2nd removal cycle figure s10a exhibited nearly complete phosphate removal for the initial 200 bvs despite early saturation occurring at 400 bvs 50 capacity of the initial cycle due to the strong affinity of haix onto phosphate in circumneutral influent both cycles demonstrated 97 phosphate removal the initial calcium removal cycle with fresh wac showed almost no calcium breakthrough until 1000 bvs figure s10b but the wac regeneration efficiency Œ≥wac only reached 10 at the end of the regeneration cycle using identical conditions as haix except ph 3 anolyte fig 6 elution curve in figure s11b consequently the 2nd calcium removal cycle exhibited much earlier breakthrough and higher initial calcium concentration than the first although Œ≥wac was around 80 during previous batch anolyte regeneration and higher than Œ≥haix 50 it exhibited marked decline during column regeneration considering the mild ph of the applied regenerants and the shortened contact time in column experiments 30 min vs 24 h in batch intraparticle diffusion path length is likely the primary factor explaining the different Œ≥wac but consistent Œ≥haix from batch to column experiments compared with strong regenerants mild regenerants exhibit slow intraparticle ion diffusion kinetics under small concentration gradients the limited contact time in column operation only allows counterions h or oh to diffuse a short distance into the resin bead and regenerate the adsorption sites typical resins e g wac have functional groups evenly distributed inside the beads thus a long intraparticle diffusion path length for regenerating the bead cores results in low overall regeneration efficiency greenleaf and sengupta 2006 the effect of intraparticle diffusion path length was diminished in batch experiments due to the long contact time but becomes significant in column experiments with mild regenerants greenleaf et al 2006 greenleaf and sengupta 2009 tarpeh et al 2018 which explained the high Œ≥wac in batch but low Œ≥wac in column tests in contrast the surface distributed p in the haix bead shortened the intraparticle diffusion path length which facilitated mild base regeneration and resulted in consistent Œ≥haix between batch and column experiments to further improve the wac regeneration efficiency via mild regenerants in column tests resins with shorter intraparticle diffusion path length should be further studied dong et al 2018 3 8 phosphate recovery after demonstrating that ph sensitive ion exchangers can be regenerated using electrochemically produced mild regenerants we aimed to demonstrate the potential of electro assisted phosphate recovery from the spent regenerant phosphate recovery via precipitation has been reported with calcium as hydroxyapatite and with magnesium as struvite both require high phosphorus concentration and ph to facilitate crystallization etter et al 2011 lei et al 2020 with the electro assisted regeneration approach we found phosphate concentration was five times higher in spent catholyte than in the influent by mixing the spent catholyte and anolyte regenerant more than 95 of phosphate was recovered as hydroxyapatite ftir spectra in figure s12 at elevated ph 11 by dosing naoh to facilitate chemical free phosphate recovery naoh could be replaced with additional catholyte in our system or according to previous methods for electrochemical ph elevation to precipitate phosphate hug and udert 2013 lei et al 2017 3 9 environmental implications electrochemical regeneration of ion exchange resins can accelerate implementation of resource efficiency by facilitating practical operation reduced chemical and energy inputs and process intensification practically column effluents must be monitored to optimize the transition between adsorption and regeneration service cycles for the haix wac column train phosphate and calcium may breakthrough asynchronously based on more stringent requirements for phosphate discharges we propose monitoring phosphate over calcium during adsorption during the removal cycle calcium can co precipitate with phosphate in haix however the ca p precipitate was demonstrated in resin pores not on feonp surfaces zhang et al 2019 thus precipitation does not notably affect phosphate adsorption by feonp and facilitates phosphate removal by haix washing with mild acid which could be produced onsite using our electro assisted approach could be used to remove undesired precipitates during long term operation kumar et al 2019 during regeneration spent haix regenerant dropped from ph 11 to 7 initially and eventually reached 11 after complete phosphate desorption figure s13 thus ph may be an effective real time indicator of haix regeneration progress because a major motivation for this work is minimizing the embedded energy of regenerants we also considered operational energy input for electrochemical water splitting with the electro assisted regeneration approach the required electrochemical energy input per mass of p removed was calculated as 20 kwh kg p details in si with 95 p removal from 3 mg p l wastewater at short contact time 3 min a comparable energy consumption 29 61 kwh kg p was recently reported in an electrochemical phosphate precipitation process but exhibited 61 p removal from a 18 6 mg p l solution at a contact time of 2 1 h lei et al 2019 a major drawback of conventional mild acid and base solutions is the required regenerant volume which in some cases can be larger than the volume of water treated we demonstrated that required regenerant volume was less than 30 of adsorption effluent 200 bvs treatment 60 bvs regeneration to further reduce water and energy demand it is also possible to reuse the regenerant for multiple cycles by electrochemically elevating the regenerant ph to replenish the spent regenerant after phosphate precipitation huang et al 2020 kumar et al 2019 by optimizing the use of water energy and nutrients we expect electrochemical regeneration of ion exchange resins to facilitate onsite phosphate removal and recovery to determine the environmental implications of electro assisted regeneration of ion exchange resins in real wastewaters we characterized performance in secondary effluent during adsorption organic compounds in real wastewater could compete with phosphate for haix sites we conducted haix adsorption tests using real wastewater 3 6 mg p l and 22 3 mg l cod and observed 24 cod was removed by haix although p removal remained high at 87 cod co removal by haix was expected due to previously reported hydrophobic interactions of organic compounds with the parent polystyrene anion exchange resin of haix huang et al 2020 li and sengupta 2001 although the co removed cod could foul haix during long term operation we anticipate organic fouling can be mitigated through material improvement pre filtration and resin cleaning li and sengupta 2001 o neal and boyer 2013 zhang et al 2017 recent reports of a full scale ion exchange plant demonstrated over 50 cod pre removal using a polystyrene anion exchange resin to scavenge cod which protected the downstream resins from organic fouling in addition the cod scavenger resin was completely regenerated for multiple cycle reuse chen et al 2020 the real wastewater was also used as catholyte for mild base production and paired with 0 01 m na2so4 anolyte in electrochemical water splitting tests similar ph changes were observed using real wastewater compared with synthetic wastewater ph 11 catholyte and ph 3 anolyte were obtained within 40 min figure s14 cod level did not change under the reducing conditions in the cathode chamber which indicates minimal cod interference on mild acid base production the saturated haix and wac were regenerated using the produced regenerants followed by a second cycle adsorption test using the real wastewater during the second cycle haix exhibited 40 capacity and wac exhibited 84 capacity of the first adsorption cycle figure s15 the 10 lower haix capacity p 0 02 using real wastewater 40 haix capacity during the 2nd cycle compared with using synthetic wastewater 50 haix capacity during the 2nd cycle indicates organic compounds can potentially compete with p removal by haix and cod pre removal should be considered during implementation wac did not remove cod during the first cycle adsorption and more than 80 capacity was reserved during the second cycle adsorption which demonstrated minimal cod interference on polyacrylic cation exchange resin like wac 4 conclusions we have provided a proof of concept for phosphate removal and recovery with minimized chemical inputs by combining ion exchange and electrochemical water splitting we anticipate that transforming ion exchange from a chemical driven to an electricity driven process will facilitate technology implementation especially for remote decentralized installations in future work we anticipate testing real secondary municipal wastewater through long term validation to advance toward implementation and more saline water sources to achieve fully chemical free mild acid and base production by advancing understanding and demonstration of a hybrid ion exchange electrochemical process this work catalyzes design of

17679,removal and recovery of phosphate from wastewater can minimize deleterious environmental impacts and supplement fertilizer supply hybrid anion exchangers haix with doped ferric oxide nanoparticles feonp can remove phosphate from complex wastewaters and recover concentrated phosphate solutions in this study we integrate haix with a weak acid cation exchanger wac to enrich phosphate and calcium in mild regenerants and precipitate both elements for recovery we demonstrated an electro assisted regeneration approach to avoid strong acid and base input based on demonstrated ph sensitivities of both materials electrochemically produced mild electrolytes ph 3 and ph 11 which are 100 1000 times less concentrated than typical regenerants preserved 80 wac and 50 haix capacities over five batch adsorption regeneration cycles feonp in haix facilitated regeneration due to ph sensitivity and their likely distribution on the resin particle surface which reduced intraparticle

is in high demand as a fertilizer constituent but is becoming increasingly scarce due to mining of non renewable phosphate rock rittmann et al 2011 excessive phosphate discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants cause eutrophication which has led to increasingly stringent discharge permits jorgensen 2001 mayer et al 2013 wu et al 2017 minimizing harmful environmental impacts and closing the phosphate loop require both removal i e capturing phosphate from wastewater and recovery i e separating phosphate as high purity products however conventional technologies typically focus on removal and struggle to achieve increasingly stringent discharge limits e g 0 1 mg p l for example biological nutrient removal bnr processes have difficulty reaching 95 nutrient removal rates and are sensitive to low temperature shock loads and carbon availability martin et al 2009 chemical precipitation could achieve 0 5 1 mg p l in effluent but treatment to a lower level 0 5 mg p l requires significantly higher metal salts dosing and sludge generation wu et al 2019 transferring aqueous phosphorus into sludge during chemical precipitation also makes phosphorus recovery challenging adsorption and regeneration with selective adsorbents can achieve phosphate removal and recovery phosphate selectivity enables adsorbents to capture phosphate amidst competing ions in complex wastewaters regenerability enables phosphate desorption for recovery as high purity products among various adsorbents hybrid materials created by doping metal oxide nanoparticles into different host materials have demonstrated high phosphate selectivity via ligand exchange inner sphere complexation between phosphate and the metal oxide nanoparticles biswas et al 2008 dong et al 2020b 2020c

the high capacity caused by high affinity exhibits tradeoffs with regenerability la 201 requires 3 times the concentration of strong base regenerant 5 times higher regenerant volume and elevated temperature 60 c compared to haix wu et al 2019 regeneration using strong alkali regenerants remains a major obstacle for widespread implementation of anion exchange because of regenerant

producing mild acid and base e g 2 ph 13 could minimize chemical inputs and energy demand however the effects of lower electrolyte concentrations and energy inputs on electrochemical mild acid and base production have not been explored similarly regeneration of ion exchange materials with electrochemically produced mild regenerants remains understudied and could facilitate process intensification for adsorptive resource recovery in this study we present an electro assisted regeneration process for ion exchangers to facilitate sustainable phosphate removal and recovery two selective ion exchange materials a phosphate selective hybrid anion exchanger haix and a weak acid cation exchanger wac were integrated into a two column system to harvest both phosphate and calcium from wastewater fig 1 the novelty of this study is that both cation and anion exchangers are regenerated via electrochemically produced mild base ph 11 catholyte and acid ph 3 anolyte respectively by leveraging adsorbent ph sensitivity using batch column and spectroscopic experiments we probed the extents and mechanisms of electro assisted regeneration of haix and wac resins our specific goals were i to examine the ph sensitivity of haix and wac ii to investigate electro assisted mild acid and base production with minimal chemical and energy inputs iii to characterize the regenerability of haix and wac using electrochemically produced mild acid and base in batch reactors and iv to demonstrate proof of concept of electro assisted regeneration to remove and recover phosphate 2 materials

adsorption sites quaternary ammonium groups r4n on the host strong base anion exchange resin and ferric oxide nanoparticles feonp confined inside the polymeric phase the sba has a macroporous polystyrene backbone crosslinked with divinylbenzene representing the host material of haix with r4n moieties without feonp we also eluted feonp from haix using strong acid to further confirm the effect of feonp on phosphate sorption and desorption wac has a porous crosslinked polyacrylic backbone and carboxylic acid functional groups sac has a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer backbone with sulfonic acid moieties all commercial resins were used as received and characteristics are summarized in table s2 we chose haix and wac because of their phosphate and calcium selectivity respectively sba was the host material for haix which facilitated isolation of the effect of feonp comparing wac and sac informed cation exchanger choice in electro assisted calcium removal and recovery additionally we tested another commercial hybrid ion exchanger laynert solmetex northborough ma to compare with haix ferrixa33e purolite in terms of ph sensitivity section 3 1 including these haix alternatives helped generalize the mechanistic effects of feonp on phosphate sorption across multiple resins 2 2 batch adsorption and regeneration experiments batch adsorption and desorption tests were conducted to examine the ph sensitivity of haix and wac and to compare regenerability of haix with sba and wac with sac using electrochemically produced mild base catholyte and mild acid anolyte

2009 ph and conductivity were measured with a combined ph conductivity meter mp220 mettler toledo columbus oh to evaluate the interference of organic compounds on haix and wac adsorption capacity real secondary effluent was collected from palo alto regional water quality control plant n 37 27 10 325 w 122 6 40 521 for batch tests the wastewater was stored at 4 c and equilibrated to room temperature before use the real wastewater contained 22 3 mg l cod and had similar phosphorus and calcium concentration 3 6 mg l as p and 53 mg l ca2 as synthetic wastewater 3 mg l as p and 50 mg l ca2 synthetic and real wastewater composition are more comprehensively compared in table s1 batch adsorption tests were performed by mixing 0 01 g haix with 10 ml realwastewater and 0 005 g wac with 12 5 ml real wastewater for 24 h adsorption capacity during two adsorption cycles was determined for haix and wac 2 3 electrochemical mild acid and base production electrochemical water splitting was used to produce mildly acidic anolyte and mildly basic catholyte a two chamber parallel plate reactor was bolted together to create the anode and cathode chambers each 8 ml which were separated by a cation exchange membrane cem cmi 7000 the cathode was stainless steel and the anode was ti mesh coated with ir mixed metal oxide magneto special anodes netherlands both had 6 cm2 active surface area we used documented stable electrolytes 0 1 m na2so4 anolyte 0 1 m nacl catholyte due to the unfavorability of sulfate oxidation and chloride reduction at water splitting potentials tarpeh et al 2018 urtiaga et al 2015 to minimize chemical inputs we varied electrolyte concentration and current density in both chambers and monitored transient ph changes anolyte na2so4 concentration was decreased from 0 1 m to 0 05 m and 0 01 m catholyte nacl concentration was decreased from 0 1 m to 0 01 m and eventually replaced by the first 100 bed volumes bv of treated effluent from the haix wac column train chronopotentiometric experiments gamry 3000 potentiostat gamry instruments warminster pa were performed at three different current densities 10 5 and 1 ma cm2 to compare mild acid and base production under varying energy inputs anolyte and catholyte 100 ml each were recirculated separately into the corresponding chamber at 40 ml min for 60 min during each test unless otherwise specified the same setup was used to evaluate mild acid base production using real wastewater real wastewater was used as catholyte after batch treatment by mixing with haix and wac for 24 h 1 g of each resin in 500 ml solution the treated real wastewater was paired with 0 01 m na2so4 anolyte for electrochemical water splitting at 1 ma cm2 for 60 min ph changes in both catholyte and anolyte were monitored 2 4 column adsorption and regeneration experiments continuous fixed bed adsorption experiments were performed in a two column system fig 1 haix and wac 15 ml wet each were packed into each column synthetic wastewater composition in table s1 was pumped downwards through the column train contact time 3 min per column and effluent samples were collected periodically after resin exhaustion during the service cycle regeneration experiments were performed for each column separately columns were drained and backwashed using 2 bv deionized water then catholyte was continuously pumped through the haix

regeneration mechanisms of haix fourier transform infrared spectra ftir were collected within the wavenumber range 400 4000 cm 1 by a nicolet is50 spectrometer thermofisher waltham ma with attenuated total reflectance atr x ray fluorescence xrf spectra were collected at beamline 14 3 at the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl to examine the distribution of phosphate and sulfate inside the haix beads the beam size was 5 Œºm which is suitable to map the sliced spherical beads 500 Œºm diameter the fluorescence signal was detected using a single element solid state vortex si drift detector data processing was conducted using the microanalysis toolkit software program bone et al 2017 2 6 statistical analysis batch adsorption and desorption capacities were compared using a one way anova and paired t tests ph values during electrochemical water splitting for varying electrolyte concentrations were compared using a one way anova test we considered results significantly different at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph sensitivity of haix and wac the ph sensitivity i e ph dependent capacity of haix and wac was examined to evaluate the potential of regenerating both materials with mild instead of strong acid and base solutions the effect of ph on p capacity differed drastically for haix compared to the parent sba p 0 05 fig 2 a increasing ph from 7 to 11 resulted in dramatic p capacity decline 88 capacity loss with haix p 0 0001 for qph7 vs qph11 but there was negligible capacity loss with sba p 0 5 for qph7 vs qph11 instead when decreasing ph from 7 to 3 sba exhibited dramatic p capacity decline 98 capacity loss p 0 005 for qph7 vs qph3 while there was negligible capacity loss with haix p 0 5 for qph7 vs qph3 a similar ph response as haix was observed using another commercial hybrid anion exchanger laynert figure s1 haix exhibited nearly 6 times higher p capacity than sba at neutral ph due to impregnation with feonp haix was more suitable for phosphate removal and recovery than sba due to its higher capacity and a more acute sensitivity to alkaline ph considering the embedded feonp is the major difference between haix and sba blaney et al 2007 the different ph responses of haix from sba were likely due to the feonp as a conventional anion exchanger sba contains only r4n groups which mainly adsorb phosphate through non specific electrostatic interactions zhang et al 2016 such interactions are subject to competition by other anions such as sulfate which is more negatively charged than phosphate at ph values below 7 2 the pka2 of phosphate thus the p capacity of sba was lower at acidic ph than neutral ph due to sulfate competition in contrast the p capacity of haix was less affected by reduced ph because feonp adsorbs phosphate strongly and selectively through specific lewis acid base interactions inner sphere complexes blaney et al 2007 german et al 2019 pan et al 2009 however the p capacity is highly affected by the surface charge of the feonp sites which is sensitive to ph the surface charge of feonp shifts from primarily neutral at ph 7 to negative at ph 11 figure s2 thus strongly expelling anionic phosphate and causing the observed reduction in p capacity previous studies focused on identifying the optimal working ph range of haix blaney et al 2007 pan et al 2009 but have not leveraged its ph sensitivity for regeneration with mild base e g ph 11 the ph sensitivity of wac has been previously established because of weakly acidic carboxylic acid functional groups pka 5 that adsorb calcium through electrostatic interactions adsorption capacity depends on the carboxylic acid groups being deprotonated at ph 5 negatively charged and being inactivated when protonated at ph 5 neutral tarpeh et al 2017 thus the calcium capacity of wac at acidic ph values ph 3 and 5 was 90 lower than at ph 8 p 0 0001 for qph5 vs qph8 this ph sensitivity narrows applicable conditions of wac but facilitates its mild acid regeneration 3 2 electro assisted mild acid and base production while it is well known that mild acid and base can be produced via electrochemical water splitting the ph values under varying background electrolyte concentrations are not completely established we observed nearly identical ph changes p 0 5 with varying catholyte background composition from 0 1 m nacl to 0 01 m nacl and treated effluent conductivity 900 ¬µs cm corresponding to 0 01 m as nacl fig 3 a c anolyte and catholyte reached ph 3 and ph 11 within 40 min under the lowest tested current density 1 ma cm2 corresponding to 144 c l facilitating simultaneous regeneration of both cation and anion exchangers when varying anolyte background concentration from 0 1 m na2so4 to 0 05 m and as low as 0 01 m fig 3d f ph 3 and ph 11 were also simultaneously reached within 40 min under conditions with decreasing chemical inputs in both catholyte orange arrow in fig 3 and anolyte blue arrow in fig 3 similar ph changes were achieved under a current density of 1 ma cm2 the minimal chemical inputs we achieved result from 0 01 m na2so4 conductivity 2200 ¬µs cm as anolyte and a complete replacement of chemical inputs in catholyte by reusing the effluent from the column train we anticipate that further chemical minimization can be achieved using more saline wastewater or industrial waste brine davis et al 2015 major obstacles to electrochemical regenerant production include the high conductivity needed to overcome internal solution resistance and the considerable time required to reach extreme ph values davis et al 2015 electrochemical production of mild acids and bases requires lower electrical conductivity lower current density and shorter electrolysis times all of which reduce energy requirements compared to producing strong acids and bases effects of current density and operation time on acid and base production were also studied compared with a current density of 1 ma cm2 higher current density 5 and 10 ma cm2 enabled stronger acid and base production ph 2 and ph 12 within the same time figure s3 however the maximum current density is constrained by electrolyte conductivity due to ohmic resistance in solution thus producing stronger acid and base would require more energy or chemical inputs with current density at 1 ma cm2 longer operation 20 h showed minimal ph changes after reaching ph 3 and 11 at 40 min figure s4 which implies stronger acid and base production via long operation is inefficient to determine whether electrochemically produced mild acid and base can regenerate cation wac and anion haix exchangers batch and column studies were conducted using the solutions produced with tested minimal chemical and energy inputs 0 01 m na2so4 as anolyte treated column effluent as catholyte current density at 1 ma cm2 unless otherwise specified 3 3 regeneration comparison of haix vs sba and wac vs sac batch adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted to compare regenerability of haix with sba and wac with sac via electrochemically produced mild base ph 11 and mild acid ph 3 in the presence of competing sulfate nah2po4 caso4 solution haix showed 2 5 times higher p capacity than sba figure s5a typically higher adsorbate adsorbent affinity requires more concentrated regenerants wu et al 2019 however 37 of haix was regenerated using mild regenerant figure s5b although the haix contains feonp that has high affinity on phosphate a larger ph drop was observed during desorption of haix compared to sba p 0 01 figure s5c implying that hydroxide ions oh exchange with phosphate ions on feonp you et al 2016 based on the previous discussion on feonp surface charge the consumed oh accumulated on feonp and negatively charged the feonp surface in contrast sba exhibited 40 desorption and minimal ph change indicating the background ions in the catholyte treated wastewater with around 1 mm so4 2 and 6 mm cl are likely regenerating r4n sites thus haix was demonstrated regenerable by weakly basic catholyte in which the ph and background ions were regenerating the two types of adsorption sites feonp and r4n in haix respectively wac exhibited a 50 higher calcium capacity than sac at ph 8 figure s5d consistent with manufacturer reports and previous research tarpeh et al 2017 the underlying reason is that carboxylate functional groups r coo in wac provide the same equivalence as sulfonic functional groups r so3 in sac but with a 45 lower molecular weight 44 g mol vs 80 g mol therefore wac theoretically carries more equivalence of counterions than sac with the same mass amount sengupta 2017 extending service time before regeneration during regeneration ph 3 anolyte nearly completely desorbed calcium from wac but led to little calcium desorption from sac figure s5e a two times higher regenerant ph p 0 02 after wac desorption and negligible ph changes p 0 1 during sac desorption figure s4f confirmed the uptake of hydrogen ions by wac which led to protonation and inactivation of carboxylic acid groups in batch regeneration haix and wac exhibited higher feasibilities than sba and sac for our proposed process in terms of selectivity capacity and regenerability by mild regenerants 3 4 cyclic batch adsorption cyclic batch adsorption regeneration experiments were conducted for haix and wac to examine their potential for multiple cycle reuse fig 4 considering the mild ph of the applied catholyte ph 11 for haix and the strong affinity of haix towards phosphate we anticipated and observed capacity loss during cyclic haix adsorption tests however the ph 11 catholyte maintained 50 haix capacity for multiple cycles cycles 2 5 after the 5th cycle adsorption a desorption test with 0 1 m naoh solution restored the haix capacity to nearly the capacity of fresh resins i e before the 1st cycle the restoration demonstrated that capacity loss was more likely due to incomplete regeneration than loss of feonp sites note that the 0 1 m naoh ph 13 is still weaker than typically applied 2 4 strong base e g 0 5 1 m naoh or koh blaney et al 2007 shepsko et al 2019 but exhibited 95 regeneration efficiency after the 6th adsorption cycle ph 11 catholyte desorption was again applied and 50 capacity was measured during the following 7th adsorption this robust repeatability demonstrated that weakly basic catholyte can regenerate haix for its reuse over multiple cycles for wac nearly 80 calcium was regenerated for 5 cycles with ph 3 anolyte fig 4b regeneration efficiency was higher for wac than haix regeneration mechanisms and limitations for haix were further studied using different regenerants 3 5 effects of different regenerants on haix regeneration compared to wac haix exhibited lower regeneration efficiency a more essential role in phosphate sorption and a more complex structure two site types instead of one thus we conducted detailed mechanistic studies to advance the understanding of haix regeneration using mild regenerant six different regenerants were evaluated for haix regeneration including three background solutions before water splitting ph 6 7 i treated effluent eff ii 0 01 m nacl and iii 0 1 m nacl and another three catholyte solutions after water splitting of the background solutions ph 11 because of the stable haix performance observed from the second to the fifth cycle fig 4a only the second cycle haix adsorption capacities were compared after batch regeneration using each regenerant fig 5 a these second cycle adsorption capacities were nearly identical using regenerants of similar ph values but higher using regenerants of ph 11 final catholytes than ph 6 7 initial background solutions p 0 01 varying the catholyte background under the same ph values did not affect the adsorption capacity confirming that ph is a major factor affecting haix regeneration to identify how ph affected different site types inside the haix r4n groups and feonp sites a similar test was conducted with sba r4n groups only fig 5b similar sba capacities p 0 5 after regeneration using catholyte ph 11 and background solutions ph 6 7 indicated that elevated ph did not affect r4n groups thus the enhanced capacity of haix using ph 11 catholyte was primarily attributed to the feonp sites to further confirm this conclusion haix beads without feonp sites were prepared by leaching feonp out using strong acids figure s6 and measuring phosphate adsorption as expected elevated ph was unable to enhance the haix capacity after feonp leaching which was similar to sba therefore feonp sites were the key factor that enhanced mild base regeneration of haix and were regenerated primarily due to the elevated ph to understand the performance limiting factor during ph 11 catholyte regeneration compared with 0 1 m naoh ph 13 solution ph changes during desorption were monitored figure s7 negligible ph changes were observed with 0 1 m naoh p 0 5 comparing initial and final ph values but ph significantly dropped in catholyte regenerants to below 10 p 0 05 comparing initial and final ph values the results imply that the 1 mm oh in ph 11 catholyte was insufficient to maintain a constant high ph causing the 50 regeneration efficiency batch studies revealed that feonp not only enhanced the haix capacity but also facilitated mild base regeneration of haix oh concentration is likely the performance limiting factor during mild base regeneration however 50 haix capacity was achieved over five cycles with ph 11 catholyte 3 6 spectroscopic analysis spectroscopic analysis was conducted to further elucidate molecular phenomena during haix regeneration atr ftir spectra of haix were collected at different time intervals during catholyte regeneration figure s8 the intensity of the peak representing the bending vibration of oh on feonp 895 cm 1 mei et al 2015 increased with regeneration time indicating the exchange of hydroxide ions adsorption and phosphate desorption on feonp sites during regeneration uptake of oh explains the ph drops during catholyte regeneration the slightly intensified bands representing the vibration of benzene ring on the polystyrene skeleton c c 1487 cm 1 and 1479 cm 1 and the stretching vibration of cn on the r4n groups 1241 cm 1 zhang et al 2019 indicated concomitant ion exchange due to phosphate desorption from the r4n groups and adsorption of the background ions in the catholyte xrf mapping of p phosphate and s sulfate on the sliced haix beads revealed a circular p distribution on the periphery of both exhausted and catholyte regenerated haix beads but not on the naoh regenerated beads figure s9 the observed circular p distribution pattern has been reported previously because it mirrors the peripheral distribution of metal oxides lin et al 2017 during hybrid ion exchanger fabrication cationic metal ions hardly penetrate the positively charged resin beads because of the donnan exclusion effect thus metal oxides sites are more distributed on the periphery of the beads kocio≈Çek balawejder et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 circular p distribution demonstrated that phosphate ion selectively bound to metal oxide sites dong et al 2018 lin et al 2017 the p distribution pattern in catholyte regenerated beads confirmed the incomplete regeneration at ph 11 and the diminished p pattern in the naoh regenerated bead confirmed the nearly complete regeneration at ph 13 3 7 continuous fixed bed column tests continuous fixed bed column tests were conducted to inform practical application of electro assisted regeneration during column adsorption with fresh haix phosphate was almost completely removed for roughly400 bvs and saturation occurred near 800 bvs figure s10a upon exhaustion ph 11 catholyte was pumped into the haix column contact time 30 min for 90 bvs exhibiting a regeneration efficiency Œ≥haix of nearly 50 by the end of the regeneration cycle fig 6 elution curve in figure s11a consistent with batch experiments the 2nd removal cycle figure s10a exhibited nearly complete phosphate removal for the initial 200 bvs despite early saturation occurring at 400 bvs 50 capacity of the initial cycle due to the strong affinity of haix onto phosphate in circumneutral influent both cycles demonstrated 97 phosphate removal the initial calcium removal cycle with fresh wac showed almost no calcium breakthrough until 1000 bvs figure s10b but the wac regeneration efficiency Œ≥wac only reached 10 at the end of the regeneration cycle using identical conditions as haix except ph 3 anolyte fig 6 elution curve in figure s11b consequently the 2nd calcium removal cycle exhibited much earlier breakthrough and higher initial calcium concentration than the first although Œ≥wac was around 80 during previous batch anolyte regeneration and higher than Œ≥haix 50 it exhibited marked decline during column regeneration considering the mild ph of the applied regenerants and the shortened contact time in column experiments 30 min vs 24 h in batch intraparticle diffusion path length is likely the primary factor explaining the different Œ≥wac but consistent Œ≥haix from batch to column experiments compared with strong regenerants mild regenerants exhibit slow intraparticle ion diffusion kinetics under small concentration gradients the limited contact time in column operation only allows counterions h or oh to diffuse a short distance into the resin bead and regenerate the adsorption sites typical resins e g wac have functional groups evenly distributed inside the beads thus a long intraparticle diffusion path length for regenerating the bead cores results in low overall regeneration efficiency greenleaf and sengupta 2006 the effect of intraparticle diffusion path length was diminished in batch experiments due to the long contact time but becomes significant in column experiments with mild regenerants greenleaf et al 2006 greenleaf and sengupta 2009 tarpeh et al 2018 which explained the high Œ≥wac in batch but low Œ≥wac in column tests in contrast the surface distributed p in the haix bead shortened the intraparticle diffusion path length which facilitated mild base regeneration and resulted in consistent Œ≥haix between batch and column experiments to further improve the wac regeneration efficiency via mild regenerants in column tests resins with shorter intraparticle diffusion path length should be further studied dong et al 2018 3 8 phosphate recovery after demonstrating that ph sensitive ion exchangers can be regenerated using electrochemically produced mild regenerants we aimed to demonstrate the potential of electro assisted phosphate recovery from the spent regenerant phosphate recovery via precipitation has been reported with calcium as hydroxyapatite and with magnesium as struvite both require high phosphorus concentration and ph to facilitate crystallization etter et al 2011 lei et al 2020 with the electro assisted regeneration approach we found phosphate concentration was five times higher in spent catholyte than in the influent by mixing the spent catholyte and anolyte regenerant more than 95 of phosphate was recovered as hydroxyapatite ftir spectra in figure s12 at elevated ph 11 by dosing naoh to facilitate chemical free phosphate recovery naoh could be replaced with additional catholyte in our system or according to previous methods for electrochemical ph elevation to precipitate phosphate hug and udert 2013 lei et al 2017 3 9 environmental implications electrochemical regeneration of ion exchange resins can accelerate implementation of resource efficiency by facilitating practical operation reduced chemical and energy inputs and process intensification practically column effluents must be monitored to optimize the transition between adsorption and regeneration service cycles for the haix wac column train phosphate and calcium may breakthrough asynchronously based on more stringent requirements for phosphate discharges we propose monitoring phosphate over calcium during adsorption during the removal cycle calcium can co precipitate with phosphate in haix however the ca p precipitate was demonstrated in resin pores not on feonp surfaces zhang et al 2019 thus precipitation does not notably affect phosphate adsorption by feonp and facilitates phosphate removal by haix washing with mild acid which could be produced onsite using our electro assisted approach could be used to remove undesired precipitates during long term operation kumar et al 2019 during regeneration spent haix regenerant dropped from ph 11 to 7 initially and eventually reached 11 after complete phosphate desorption figure s13 thus ph may be an effective real time indicator of haix regeneration progress because a major motivation for this work is minimizing the embedded energy of regenerants we also considered operational energy input for electrochemical water splitting with the electro assisted regeneration approach the required electrochemical energy input per mass of p removed was calculated as 20 kwh kg p details in si with 95 p removal from 3 mg p l wastewater at short contact time 3 min a comparable energy consumption 29 61 kwh kg p was recently reported in an electrochemical phosphate precipitation process but exhibited 61 p removal from a 18 6 mg p l solution at a contact time of 2 1 h lei et al 2019 a major drawback of conventional mild acid and base solutions is the required regenerant volume which in some cases can be larger than the volume of water treated we demonstrated that required regenerant volume was less than 30 of adsorption effluent 200 bvs treatment 60 bvs regeneration to further reduce water and energy demand it is also possible to reuse the regenerant for multiple cycles by electrochemically elevating the regenerant ph to replenish the spent regenerant after phosphate precipitation huang et al 2020 kumar et al 2019 by optimizing the use of water energy and nutrients we expect electrochemical regeneration of ion exchange resins to facilitate onsite phosphate removal and recovery to determine the environmental implications of electro assisted regeneration of ion exchange resins in real wastewaters we characterized performance in secondary effluent during adsorption organic compounds in real wastewater could compete with phosphate for haix sites we conducted haix adsorption tests using real wastewater 3 6 mg p l and 22 3 mg l cod and observed 24 cod was removed by haix although p removal remained high at 87 cod co removal by haix was expected due to previously reported hydrophobic interactions of organic compounds with the parent polystyrene anion exchange resin of haix huang et al 2020 li and sengupta 2001 although the co removed cod could foul haix during long term operation we anticipate organic fouling can be mitigated through material improvement pre filtration and resin cleaning li and sengupta 2001 o neal and boyer 2013 zhang et al 2017 recent reports of a full scale ion exchange plant demonstrated over 50 cod pre removal using a polystyrene anion exchange resin to scavenge cod which protected the downstream resins from organic fouling in addition the cod scavenger resin was completely regenerated for multiple cycle reuse chen et al 2020 the real wastewater was also used as catholyte for mild base production and paired with 0 01 m na2so4 anolyte in electrochemical water splitting tests similar ph changes were observed using real wastewater compared with synthetic wastewater ph 11 catholyte and ph 3 anolyte were obtained within 40 min figure s14 cod level did not change under the reducing conditions in the cathode chamber which indicates minimal cod interference on mild acid base production the saturated haix and wac were regenerated using the produced regenerants followed by a second cycle adsorption test using the real wastewater during the second cycle haix exhibited 40 capacity and wac exhibited 84 capacity of the first adsorption cycle figure s15 the 10 lower haix capacity p 0 02 using real wastewater 40 haix capacity during the 2nd cycle compared with using synthetic wastewater 50 haix capacity during the 2nd cycle indicates organic compounds can potentially compete with p removal by haix and cod pre removal should be considered during implementation wac did not remove cod during the first cycle adsorption and more than 80 capacity was reserved during the second cycle adsorption which demonstrated minimal cod interference on polyacrylic cation exchange resin like wac 4 conclusions we have provided a proof of concept for phosphate removal and recovery with minimized chemical inputs by combining ion exchange and electrochemical water splitting we anticipate that transforming ion exchange from a chemical driven to an electricity driven process will facilitate technology implementation especially for remote decentralized installations in future work we anticipate testing real secondary municipal wastewater through long term validation to advance toward implementation and more saline water sources to achieve fully chemical free mild acid and base production by advancing understanding and demonstration of a hybrid ion exchange electrochemical process this work catalyzes design of fit for purpose adsorbents conducive to resource efficient electrochemical regeneration key conclusions from the study were as follows both hybrid anion exchange haix and weak acid cation exchange wac resins exhibited ph dependent capacity that could be regenerated using mild regenerants mild regenerants ph 11 catholyte and ph 3 anolyte were produced via electrochemical water splitting with minimal chemical and energy inputs the majority of adsorption capacity for haix and wac 50 haix 80 wac was sustained for multiple cycles in batch tests using ph 11 catholyte and ph 3 anolyte regenerants these mild regenerants are 100 1000 times less concentrated than standard regenerants 0 1 m feonp contributed significantly to enhanced haix regeneration efficiency using ph 11 catholyte intraparticle
