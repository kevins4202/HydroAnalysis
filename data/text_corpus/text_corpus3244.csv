16220,elemental sulfur s0 is known to be an abundant non toxic material with a wide range of redox states 2 to 6 and may serve as an excellent electron carrier in wastewater treatment in turn s0 driven bioprocesses which employ s0 as electron donor or acceptor have recently established themselves as cost effective therefore attractive solutions for wastewater treatment numerous related processes have to date been developed from laboratory experiments into full scale applications including s0 driven autotrophic denitrification for nitrate removal and s0 reducing organic removal compared to the conventional activated sludge process these bioprocesses require only a small amount of organic matter and produce very little sludge there have been great efforts to characterize chemical and biogenic s0 and related functional microorganisms in order to identify the biochemical pathways upgrade the bioprocesses and assess the impact of the operating factors on process performance ultimately aiming to better understand and to optimize the processes this paper is therefore a comprehensive overview of emerging s0 driven biotechnologies including the development of s0 driven autotrophic denitrification and s0 based sulfidogenesis as well as the associated microbiology and biochemistry also reviewed here are the physicochemical characteristics of s0 and the effects that environmental factors such as ph influent sulfur nitrate ratio temperature s0 particle size and reactor configurations have on the process research gaps challenges of process applications and potential areas for future research are further proposed and discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elemental sulfur sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sulfur reducing organics removal biological wastewater treatment 1 introduction sulfur being one of the most common natural elements on the planet exhibits nine distinct valance from 2 in sulfide and reduced organic sulfur through 0 in elemental sulfur s0 to 6 in sulfate the various compounds of sulfur are products of a complicated sulfur cycle driven by chemical and biological transformations see fig 1 tang et al 2009 pokorna et al 2015 lin et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 elemental sulfur s0 as a central intermediate in the geochemical sulfur cycle in particular possesses several advantages over other intermediates of sulfur e g sulfide thiosulfate and sulfate s0 1 is the most abundant on earth 2 has versatility that allows both oxidation and reduction as it has an intermediate chemical valence and 3 is safer for storage and has low transportation costs when in solid form cai et al 2017 s0 has therefore been widely utilized for producing fertilizers rubber sulfuric acid in addition to other small niche market specialty chemicals the most notable among which include cosmetics and synthetic rubber made through vulcanization in addition to the above mentioned applications s0 has great potential for applications in wastewater treatment because of the oxidation reduction properties of s0 i e with a range from a minimum reducing state of 2 to a maximum oxidation state of 6 for instance s0 is a crucial intermediate during biological sulfide oxidation to sulfate which can also be a final product of biological sulfide oxidation zhang et al 2021 in fact using such reduction and oxidation properties of s0 in wastewater treatment has been widely reported in the past few decades such applications include s0 driven autotrophic denitrification s0ad and s0 reducing organic removal s0or zhang et al 2021 which are mediated by s0 oxidizing bacteria s0ob and s0 reducing bacteria s0rb respectively s0ad processes have also been reported to produce low biomass yield low toxicity and that such processes can be safely controlled and used on demand without overdosing concerns huang et al 2019 wang et al 2019a thus this process is commonly applied onto nitrate removal from organics deficient wastewater such as nitrogen contaminated groundwater sierra alvarez et al 2007 regeneration water vandekerckhove et al 2018 landfill leachate zeng et al 2021 and wastewater produced from leather and fertilizer processing read daily et al 2011 in s0or s0 is used as an electron acceptor by s0rb to oxidize various organic pollutants such as formate acetate lactate pyruvate peptone ethanol propionate glucose yeast extract and sugars sun et al 2020a b moreover removal of metal ions from mine wastewater is also reportedly attributing to sulfide generation from sulfate reduciuton in general biological sulfur removal bsr to minimize carbon consumption qiu et al 2017 as this process only produce a small amount of sludge it is considered to be highly cost effective for different engineering applications zhang et al 2021 over the past decades s0 driven bioprocesses have been applied to solving complicated environmental problems such as those mentioned above but reviews revolving around their emergence and development have been few and have mostly focused on mechanisms and applications critical reviews which focus on the physicochemical characteristics of s0 microorganisms as s0rb and s0ob fundamental mechanisms as s0 reduction oxidation as well as their impact factors and applications are very limited it is thus necessary to comprehensively review the significant knowledge of the various s0 driven bioprocesses this current review summarizes the latest progress in applying s0 driven bioprocesses onto wastewater treatment highlighting functional microorganisms and the biochemical principles that govern elemental sulfur s biotransformation pointing out possible engineering applications with important impact factors the review will also close a knowledge gap and increase scientists understanding of s0 driven wastewater treatment bioprocesses 2 physicochemical characteristics of elemental sulfur sulfur in its ground chemical form is known as s0 sulfur atoms have a high proclivity for forming polymeric chains or rings in a variety of forms george et al 2008 s0 solids that consist of these rings and or chains have very weak van der waals forces over 180 different allotropes and polymorphs of element sulfur have so far been identified but only modified orthorhombic α s8 0 has been verified for stability under usual temperature and air pressure 273 15 k and 1 bar steudel and eckert 2003 α s8 has strongly temperature dependent solubility 5 μg or 0 16 μmol per liter at 25 c while the equilibrium concentration of s8 aq with mineral sulfur α s8 is 6 1 nm at 4 c and 478 nm at 80 c respectively kamyshny et al 2009 s0 is soluble in compressed gases at higher temperatures 65 140 c the solubility of s8 aq is significantly subjected to the presence of surfactants for example it increases 5000 fold when several model surfactants e g sodium dodecyl sulfate and triton x 100 are present garcia and druschel 2014 this could be attributed to surfactant type molecules forming micelles with an s8 ring in its hydrophobic interior when dissolved in polar solvents s8 can partially transform to s6 and s7 and attain equilibrium in which 1 of the sulfur is present as the smaller ring toluene carbon disulfide and dichloromethane are the best solvents while cycloalkanes can dissolve smaller ring molecules of s0 only at room temperature steudel and eckert 2003 the most common types of s0 include mineral sulfur chem s0 bio s0 and colloidal s0 among these types of s0 chem s0 and bio s0 are more frequently utilized in real applications due to the impurities of mineral sulfur and high cost of colloidal s0 zhang et al 2021 besides due to its poor water solubility chemical s0 s chem has low availability toward microorganisms which is the main obstacle preventing s0 driven bioprocesses from having more real applications kostrytsia et al 2018 indeed this low solubility results in lower kinetics in comparison with conventional denitrification or sulfate reduction three possible pathways have been proposed to overcome this poor water solubility of s0 i finding a way to transform elemental sulfur into a more hydrophilic and or soluble form such as polysulfide in order to achieve quicker growth ii physically attaching elemental sulfur in solid phase to the outer membrane s surface to accelerate mass transfer subsequently allowing different microorganisms to adhere to the membrane directly and convert the elemental sulfur into sulfide iii using smaller more porous s0 particles with a higher specific surface area kostrytsia et al 2018 di capua et al 2019 seidel et al 2006 and giordano et al 2019 have mentioned another form of s0 referred to as biogenic elemental sulfur s0 bio which has greater availability to microorganisms s0 bio is a byproduct of desulfurization of natural gas and industrial waste streams as well as wastewater from metal refineries the properties of s0 bio are different from those of s chem s0 bio can be stored intra or extra cellularly as sulfur globules and s0 bio particles have a core of orthorhombic s0 rings which are covered in polymeric structures giving them a high specific surface area all this gives the s0 bio particules hydrophilic and colloidal properties enhancing its bioavailability to microorganisms kleinjan et al 2005 s0 bio could therefore be utilized as an adsorbent to remove heavy metals from wastewater in bioleaching processes and agricultural production because of this good bioaccessibility chen et al 2012 3 elemental sulfur driven bioprocesses s0 is readily available as a less toxic and low cost form of sulfur that is used as an electron donor acceptor in two main types of bioprocesses i e s0ad and s0or see fig 2 3 1 element sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification s0ad is highly recommended by engineers and researchers alike as a sustainable option for removing nitrate or nitrite from wastewater wang et al 2016 evaluating the cost difference between using reduced sulfur species such as sulfide thiosulfate and using organic substrate shows that each of them has an electron donor for nitrogen removal in wastewater clearly demonstrating that to remove an equal amount of nitrogen 1 0 kg it is significantly more economical to use elemental sulfur 0 45 than to use methanol 1 05 cui et al 2019 thus the s0ad process has been applied for nitrate or nitrite removal from carbon deficient wastewater in the literature various studies have mentioned the potential of using sulfur to remove nitrogen containing compounds from wastewater dasgupta et al 2017 sahinkaya et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a li et al 2021a zeng et al 2021 in their study wang et al 2020 found that s0ad plays a dominant role in nitrate removal in a pilot scale constructed wetland li et al 2021a investigated nitrate s removal performance in wetlands by using different sulfur sources e g s0 and fes2 and found that using s0 achieved the highest denitrification rate of 19 0 7 5 g m 2 d 1 zeng et al 2021 applied s0ad in a packed bed reactor and successfully removed nitrate from matured landfill leachate after partial nitrification and anammox pretreatment dasgupta et al 2017 combined the chemical s0ad process with the partial nitrification anammox process as an efficient way to remove nitrate from carbon deficient wastewater particularly matured landfill leachate shi et al 2020 used a sulfur based autotrophic continuous flow biosystem to realize more than 85 of vanadium v v and chromium cr vi removal from synthetic groundwater sahinkaya et al 2017 developed a s0ad process in a membrane bioreactor for removing nitrate from drinking water and almost achieved complete nitrate removal with up to 0 24 g no3 n l d of nitrate loading zhang et al 2020a found that the s0ad process could effectively remove sulfamethoxazole smx and nitrate from conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps overall these investigations have demonstrated that element sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is an underutilized alternative to heterotrophic denitrification for removing contaminants from carbon deficient wastewater besides s can also be employed as electron donor for treating perchlorate and nitrate contaminated water through transforming clo4 and no3 into innocuous cl and n2 via autotrophic s0 denitrification wan et al 2019 for instance wan et al 2017 operated a lab scale s0 packed bed reactor at a low hrt 0 75 h to simultaneously achieve 472 μg l or 22 mg l of perchlorate and nitrate 22 mgn l removal when treating low concentration perchlorate s0 disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate might occur resulting in excessive sulfate production and alkaline consumption thus a heterotrophic reactor followed by a s0 autotrophic reactor callled chsas was developed to prohibit s0 disproportionation which could remove approximate 94 of perchlorate and nitrate wan et al 2019 3 1 1 microorganisms involved in elemental sulfur driven oxidation most sobs that drive s0ad processes comprise various groups of chemolithotrophs and phototrophs cui et al 2019 among them chemolithotrophic sobs can perform sulfur oxidation in aerobic anoxic conditions by utilizing o2 and or no3 no2 as electron acceptors campos et al 2008 specific bacteria that are able to perform simultaneous anaerobic anoxic s0 oxidation and denitrification are called sob denitrifiers the majority of sobs have been reported to belong to the phylum proteobacteria in which the sobs can be classified into four classes α β γ and ε proteobacteria shao et al 2010 cui et al 2019 generally three dominant genera of proteobacteria have been found in s0ad systems they are i thiobacillus β proteobacteria along with thermothrix ii thioalkalivibrio γ proteobacteria along with thiohalorhabdus and iii sulfurimonas ε proteobacteria along with thiomicrospira in particular thiobacillus denitrificans the most common and studied genus of s0ad bacteria is a facultative anaerobe which means that it is able to use thiosulfates and thiocyanates in an aerobic environment and additional sulfides and elemental sulfur in an anaerobic environment it also has great immobilization capability on suitable carriers such as granular activated carbon shao et al 2010 cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 most sobs live in mesophilic or thermophilic conditions ranging from 20 to 90 c and ph ranging between 1 5 and 10 5 most of these sobs morphologically and taxonomically belong to rods and spheres these sobs work independently or cooperate within a biological wastewater treatment system to perform s0 driven autotrophic denitrification their physiological properties and specific taxonomy electron acceptors donors and other important environmental factors such as morphology electron donor acceptor ph and temperature are summarized in table 1 enzymes involved in elemental sulfur driven oxidation several enzymes such as sulfur dioxygenase sdo sulfur oxygenase reductase sor and heterodisulfide reductase hdr like complexes have been found to possess the ability to oxidize s0 the co existence of sdo sor and an hdr like complex in sobs indicates that s0 oxidation is diverse and complex at the same time it has been reported that these three cytoplasmic enzymes for s0 oxidation likely possess a synergistic interaction and regulation mode in sob lin et al 2018 enzyme activity of s0 oxidation was first found in acidithiobacillus thiooxidans in 1959 the associated enzyme known as sdo consists of a 21 and a 26 kda protein in acidithiobacillus thiooxidans or two 23 kda subunits in acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans it was suggested that the main physiological function of sdos and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr would work together to convert h2s to relieve its toxic effect to microorganisms it was reported that sulfane sulfur atom of glutathione persulfide gssh and its homologs gssnh n 1 were the actual substrate involved in sdo catalyzed reactions wang et al 2019a sor can catalyze the disproportionation of cytoplasmic s0 with the production of thiosulfate sulfite and sulfide sor isolated from archaea and bacteria consists of 24 identical subunits which generally have a structure of large hollow spheres each subunit has a catalytic cite that contains an essential cysteine and a low potential non heme iron site li et al 2008 the oxidation of s0 by sor requires o2 but does not need external cofactors or electron donors during which there is no electron transfer or substrate level phosphorylation the hdr like complex has been reported to serve as an enzyme for s0 oxidation in many types of sob and archaea the proteins in the hdr like complex isolated from sulfur oxidizers have been found to be homologous to those of methanogenic archaea sulfate reducing archaea and srb the hdr like complex encoded by an hdrc1b1a hyp hdrc2b2 gene usually contain more than five subunits which are hdra hdrb1 hdrb2 hdrc1 and hdrc2 wang et al 2019a 3 1 2 biochemistry in the s0ad process no3 as the electron acceptor is sequentially reduced to no2 no n2o and n2 with s0 as the electron donor eqs 1 and 2 generally the s0ad process is considered to be zero or half order kinetic reactions as proposed by kostrytsia et al 2018b the reactions include the following four steps see fig 3 1 sulfur dissolves into the liquid clinging to the surface of the s0 particles and transporting electron via sn 2 as a mediator 2 directly ingesting polymer state nanoscale elemental sulfur 3 autotrophic denitrification takes place directly interacting with s0 bound by outer membrane chemical groups e g mercaptan 4 the reaction products so4 2 n2 etc diffuse into the bulk liquid finally the s0 is oxidized into sulfate with the donation of electrons and energy production for microbial growth in the dissimilation huang et al 2019 wang et al 2019b it is generally assumed that bioreactions follow monod kinetics as its saturation constant ks of elemental sulfur for autotrophic denitrification is very low e g 0 22 mgs l huilinir et al 2020 at the same time the limiting factor in s0ad is its poor water solubility of s0 as such s0 mass transfer may restrict the overall rate of denitrification kostrytsia et al 2018b huilinir et al 2020 the energy yields from the oxidation of s0 and thiosulfate with nitrate as the electron acceptor are 91 2 and 93 0 kj electron equivalent respectively which are similar and slightly lower than the methanol 109 2 kj e eq this also suggests that s0 is a good alternative as an external carbon source to methanol when treating carbon deficient wastewater 1 s 0 3 n o 3 h 2 o s o 4 2 3 n o 2 2 h 2 s 0 2 n o 2 s o 4 2 n 2 3 1 3 types of sulfur driven denitrifications bioprocess over the past few decades the s0ad bioprocess and its derivative bioprocess have been developed effectively mainly using elemental sulfur as electron donor for nitrate or nitrite and phosphorus removal zhang et al 2021 these processes include elemental sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification s0lad integrated sulfur based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification isa hd and element sulfur driven biological simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal s0 ebpr a elemental sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification s0lad autotrophic denitrification with sulfur limestone filtration has been widely used for nitrate removal from groundwater sierra alvarez et al 2007 li et al 2020b the sulfur limestone is used to buffer any acidity generated and supply inorganic carbon to the cell most s0lad processes have been operated under a nitrate concentration between 2 1 and 50 0 mm li et al 2020b the optimum sulfur limestone ratio of 1 1 w w was found to be sufficient for nitrate removal in the s0lad system generally in this system cheap limestone can offer alkalinity and release ca2 ions that can stimulate denitrification but the amount of alkalinity production is highly dependent on the limestone dissolution and biological chemical interactions of ad in particular the limestone dissolve is inversely proportional to ph such that a higher ph will result in a lower limestone dissolution the force that drives the limestone to dissolute is related to the concentration gradient between the hs and h where hs is the hydrogen concentration in the liquid these further determine the low dissolution of limestone together with its large occupying volume which may decrease the denitrification potential of the bioreactor for instance the maximum denitrification rate was observed at approximate 0 07 g no3 n l d in a pilot scale s0lad biofilter under an hrt of 6 0 h li et al 2020b thus additional soluble alkalinity sources e g nahco3 oyster shells were employed to stimulate the denitrification rate for example sahinkaya et al 2014 used nahco3 instead of limestone to enrich the consortia with higher denitrification activity and found a maximum denitrification rate of 0 20 g no3 n l d achieved under an hrt of 1 0 h simard et al 2015 inserted an oyster shell column into a s0ad system and found oyster shell as a slow release source of alkalinity and biofilm carrier could increase the ph and alkalinity of the treated water allowing an increase in denitrification on the other hand although limestone is the most commonly used low cost alkalinity source the main drawback of using limestone is the increased hardness of treated water due to release of ca2 sahinkaya et al 2011 thus mixotrophic sulfur based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification is recommended over s0lad process alone due to the decrease of ca2 release and alkalinity requirement b integrated sulfur based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification isa hd according to reports autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrification has disadvantages such as high carbon requirement and a considerable amount of sludge generation in heterotrophic denitrification as well as a low growth rate of autotrophic denitrifiers cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 moreover the reactions of ad consume the alkalinity causing a large amount of buffer to be required in order to compensate for the drop of ph but the reactions of the hd process generate alkalinity zhang et al 2018b to overcome the disadvantages of individual heterotrophic and autotrophic processes an isa hd process has been developed and widely applied in actual wastewater with the co existence of organic carbon nitrate and inorganic sulfur compounds liang et al 2022 achieved an average nitrate reduction rate of 420 mg no3 n l d in an isa hd system by using mixture of elemental sulfur powder shell powder corncob powder and sawdust powder besides other than liquid organic carbon sources e g methanol ethanol slow release source of solid organic carbon substrates e g woodchip scrap tire chips have also been used as an alternative for no3 removal by simultaneous heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification li et al 2016 he et al 2021 li et al 2016 developed a woodchip sulfur based heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification wshad process for treating nitrate contaminated water which could achieve a higher no3 removal rates than that of sulfur based ad without so4 2 accumulation thus isa hd process has displayed several advantages including decrease in sulfate production low alkalinity necessity and low cost compared to the sole heterotrophic or autotrophic process zhang et al 2020b liang et al 2022 generally the isa hd process would have two types of bioreactors i e the mixotrophic denitrification operated in one reactor liang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020b or two separated reactors including an autotrophic denitrification reactor and a heterotrophic denitrification reactor zhang et al 2018b regarding the microbial community in one mixtrophic reactor the heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb were found to be predominated such as pseudomonas azoarcus thauera and halomonas which contributed to satisfactory sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies with respect to the microbial community of two separated reactors the autotrophic denitrification reactor is usually enriched by an autotrophic sob such as thiobacillus while the heterotrophic denitrification reactor is enriched by heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria such as thauera and allidiomarina zhang et al 2018b recently in order to accelerate the bioreactions of s0ad micro aerobic conditions have been introduced the results have shown that in micro aerobic conditions sulfide or elemental sulfur nitrate and acetate s removal rates of isa hd are 10 times higher than in anaerobic conditions thus micro oxygen might have a stimulating effect on functional bacteria resulting in enhanced isa hd performance zhang et al 2020b c element sulfur driven biological simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal s0 ebpr in recent years a novel process of s0 ebpr has been developed for the treatment of saline wastewater guo et al 2016 2019a this process integrates the c n s and p cycles for the simultaneous removal of cod nitrogen and phosphorus with minimal sludge production and works even on high temperature 25 35 c saline sewage the process likely employs two key microbial agents working cooperatively i e srb and sob sob e g thiobacillus in particular uses s0 as an electron donor to produce partial energy needed for nitrate and phosphorus removal from saline sewage in details in the anaerobic stage carbon sources are taken up by both srb and sob for sulfate reduction to form poly s s0 and synthesize pha respectively specially sulfate might be fully reduced to s2 or partially reduced to s2 then re oxidized back to s0 by both srb and sob synergistically at the same time sob perform p release and glycogen degradation in the subsequently anoxic micro aerobic stage sob oxidize intracellular pha and poly s s0 by using nitrate as the electron acceptor for p uptake glycogen replenishment and sulfate production in this microecological system srb and sob work together to produce a synergic effect on p release and p uptake where sulfur cycle participates in p removal as an electron carrier in addition the s0 sn 2 species stored in the universal pool of bioavailable sulfur proved to be the energy source for phosphorus removal guo et al 2019a when compared to the metabolism of conventional ebpr sob in the s0 ebpr system seemingly replace the role of conventional phosphate accumulating organisms paos by generating sulfur and polyp pools to perform sulfur conversion associated phosphorus removal as well as compete with glycogen accumulating organisms gaos for limited carbon sources this process offers an alternative for meeting the increasing demand for removing p from saline wastewater d other elemental sulfur based denitrifications apart from the above mentioned three derivative bioprocesses a typical sulfur ad process have been developed for municipal wastewater treatment with low c n ratio in hong kong called sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process wu et al 2016 the sani process uses the sulfate originating from seawater toilet flushing as an electron carrier and produce reduced sulfur species i e sulfide s0 and thiosulfate for nitrogen removal during autotrophic denitrification the sani process has recently been scaled up to a 1000 m3 d demoplante which not only meet the local effluent standards but also achieved 60 70 less biological sludge production and 30 40 less space compared to conventional wwtps wu et al 2016 one drawback of this process is sulfur compounds remaining in the effluent likely causing secondary sulfate pollution besides s0ad has also been combined with membrane technology sahinkaya et al 2017 constructed wetlands li et al 2020a and anammox li et al 2019 chen et al 2019 for the treatment of different wastewater displaying high process efficiency these s0ad combined processes have been applied onto nitrate removal from waters such as polluted wastewater and groundwater and select wastewater such as ion exchange resins nitrified leachate septic effluent and a few types of synthetic wastewater post denitrification of industrial effluents and some other oxidized contaminants such as cr vi bromate hexavalent uranium and perchlorate sahinkaya et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 3 2 elemental sulfur driven reduction s can be reduced to sulfide using organics as an electron donor s0rb for metal precipitation from mine wastewater thereby using less carbon source than biological sulfate reduction especially when treating carbon deficient mine wastewater li et al 2021a indeed with the same amount of organic matter higher around 4 times amount of sulfide can be generated in s0 reduction compared to sulfate reduction see eqs 3 and 4 as such s0 reduction can be employed for organic removal from wastewater sludge reduction generation of sulfide for heavy metal precipitation etc zhang et al 2018a developed a high rate sulfur reducing anaerobic sulfidogenic process in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor where s0 worked as an electron acceptor for sludge minimized wastewater treatment sun et al 2018 produced sulfide at a rate of 47 9 mgs l h through adding sublimed sulfur into a lab scale s0 reducing biological sulfide production reactor sun et al 2020a b used high rate s0 reduction to achieve even better effluent and higher cost effectiveness in a sulfidogenic acid mine drainage amd treatment system without ph amelioration li et al 2021a recently applied a pilot scale s0 based sulfidogenic treatment system to treat cu laden electroplating wastewater and achieved 99 9 cu2 removal wang et al 2019c set up a s0 reduction process to treat mercury rich wastewater and achieved a high removal efficiency of hg ii without mehg accumulation zhang et al 2018a developed a novel internal sulfur cycling system comprising a s0 reducing reactor for organics removal and a sulfide oxidizing reactor and sedimentation tank for sulfur recovery to treat sulfate deficit wastewater and found that the internal sulfur cycling process was a cost effective sludge minimized biotechnology all of these studies have further indicated that s could be converted to sulfide for heavy metal precipitation and utilized as an electron acceptor for organic removal 3 c h 3 c o o 4 s 0 2 h 2 o 2 c o 2 4 h s 3 h δ g 0 39 k j m o l 4 c h 3 c o o s o 4 2 2 h c o 3 h s δ

conditions see table 2 this adaptability gives them the ability to treat various wastewaters in different environments to date s0 reducers that have been reported spread among over 69 genera within nine phyla of the bacteria domain and 37 genera within two phyla of the archaea domain in the bacteria domain the nine phyla that s0rbs belong to are aquificiae chrysiogenetes deferribacteres firmicutes proteobacteria thermodesulfobacteria thermotogae spirochaetes and synergistetes the two phyla that s0 reducing archaea s0ra in the archaea domain belong to are euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota florentino et al 2016 additionally some s0rbs are able to use not only s0 thiosulfate and sulfite but also other electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate nitrite manganese iv iron iii iron iii and ferric see table 2 s0 reducers use many kinds of organics as electron donors such as acetate propionate formate sugars lactate ethanol etc some species of srb such as desulfitibacter desulfobacter desulfovibrio desulfurobacterium and desulfuromusa have also been reported to carry out s0 reduction table 2 it has been reported that s0rb can grow under a broad range of temperatures from 2 to 110 c and ph values from 1 to 10 5 s0ras generally like to live in hyperthermophilic environments and they are seldom found in mesophilic s0 driven reduction processes although most s0 reducers thrive at neutral ph environments some of them can acclimatize to extremely low ph for example acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans desulfosporosinus acididurans and desulfurobacterium thermolithotrophum are productive at ph values of 1 3 3 8 and 4 5 respectively main enzymes involved in elemental sulfur reduction despite a lack in depth understanding of the enzymatic level of sulfur reduction four enzymes involved in the reduction of s0 and conversion of polysulfide to h2s have been classified they are 1 polysulfide reductase isolated from wolinella succinogenes 2 sulfide dehydrogenase isolated from pyrococcus furiosus 3 sulfhydrogenase isolated from pyrococcus furiosus and 4 sulfur reductase isolated from acidianus ambivalens florentino et al 2019 on the other hand enzymes that are involved in related carbon oxidization coupled with elemental sulfur reduction have been well reported so they will not be discussed further in this review polysulfide reductase polysulfide reductase is an integral membrane protein complex which plays an important role in quinone oxidation and polysulfide reduction that exists in neutrophiles in an aqueous solution that contains nucleophiles such as cysteine or sulfide s can be converted into polysulfide and then to sulfide by being catalyzed by polysulfide reductase at neutral or basic ph this enzyme comprises three psrabc subunits i e psra psrb and psrc the psra subunit is the catalytic unit that first catalyzes the chain of polysulfide cleaved at the last sulfur atom that has been released and bound to the molybdenum cofactor and then oxidized psrb is an iron sulfur protein at the periplasmic side of the membrane that has an iron sulfur 4fe 4s center as an electron transport chain to transfer an electron from psra to the membrane anchor psrc is an integral membrane protein that helps to anchor other subunits on the membrane wang et al 2021 sulfide dehydrogenase sulfide dehydrogenase which generally exists in hyperthermophilic s0 reducers such as pyrococcus furiosus and caldisericum exile is reported to be a biofunctional cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of polysulfides into h2s the protein of this enzyme consists of three different iron sulfur centers 1 a 2fe 2s center coordinated by both aspartate and three cysteines asp cys 3 that combine physico chemical properties 2 a 3fe 4s center with high potential of sulfide reduction 3 a 4fe 4s center with unusual properties of sulfide reduction the role of the last two clusters working on the high sulfide reduction potentials is not yet clear but it has been reported that sulfide dehydrogenase significantly affects the redox potential of the flavins hagen et al 2000 as the properties of the fe s groups in sulfide dehydrogenase are not yet fully understood the in depth related bioreactions still needs rigorous research sulfhydrogenase sulfhydrogenase a cytoplasmic hydrogen metabolizing enzyme found in pyrococcus furiosus dethiobacter alkaliphilus and palaeococcus ferrophilus is identical to hydrogenase and is capable of catalyzing the reduction of sulfur and polysulfide and the oxidation of h2 it has two types of sulfhydrogenase namely sulfhydrogenase i and ii sulfhydrogenase i has been reported to play a significant role in sulfur reduction and hydrogen production ma et al 1993 sulfhydrogenase ii has a higher affinity for s0 and polysulfide indicating that it has a physiological relevance at a low concentration of s0 while sulfhydrogenase i potentially uses both of them with equal efficiency sulfur reductase sulfur reductase is a membrane bound protein with several subunits which exhibits similar structure and properties to polysulfide reductase this enzyme likely consists of three proteins a catalytic subunit probably molybdopterin srea an fe s protein sreb and a membrane anchor srec since sulfur reductase is isolated under the condition that no sulfide existed it was assumed to reduce s0 itself instead of polysulfide because the enzyme cannot be purified without hydrogenase information on the mechanism of this enzyme has been limited and deeper investigations has not been possible ma et al 1993 further thorough characterization of this enzyme is therefore necessary 3 2 2 biochemistry in general s0 reduction has relatively low activities due to its solubility in water polysulfide has been reported as an intermediate that significantly hinders elemental sulfur reduction zhang et al 2021 in the process of s0 reduction the s8 ring of s0 is first attacked by the nucleophilic hs anion and is then cleaved in the presence of sulfide resulting in the formation of polysulfide as mentioned in section 2 polysulfide is a soluble carrier of s0 atoms with linear s molecules making it more accessible to microorganisms than s8 ring polysulfide is then readily reduced to sulfide catalyzed by polysulfide reductase see eqs 5 and 6 liang et al 2016 the sulfide thus produced continues to attack the s0 and produce more polysulfide accelerating the reduction of s0 the possible pathways for s0 reduction are notably dependent on ph conditions generally polysulfide is the most common electron acceptor donor during s0 metabolism under neutral alkaline conditions ph 7 but is unstable at low ph what polysulfide sulfur transferase synthesized by an s0 reducer does is to allow fast polysulfide respiration when polysulfide concentration becomes low to ensure sufficient polysulfide in the substrate zhang et al 2021 see fig 4 for instance at ph 10 polysulfide is the main form of sulfide when there is sufficient s0 at ph 7 s0 is mainly used by the extracellular electron transfer and direct cell s contact which would lower the conversion of s0 specifically a ph lower than 6 0 would almost completely inhibit polysulfide formation causing the rates of s0 reduction oxidation under acidic conditions to be much lower than under neutral or alkaline conditions sun et al 2019 5 h s n 1 s 0 s n 2 h 6 hc o 2 s n 2 h 2 o hc o 3 h s s n 1 2 h moreover during the s0 reduction no formation of polysulfide has been reported indicating that elemental sulfur reduction may proceed in dissimilation even with no involvement of polysulfide zhang et al 2021 though our understanding on the mechanism of s0 reduction by different s0 reducers is still limited we can conjecture that when polysulfide cannot be used as an intermediate product a direct change of sulfur into sulfide has occurred 3 2 3 elemental sulfur based sulfidogenesis sulfidogenic processes performed by s0 reducers is a potential alternative for sulfide production and precipitation of chalcophilic metals for treating acid mine drainage eqs 3 4 and 7 pozo et al 2017 kumar et al 2021 compared to conventional chemical precipitation for heavy metal removal biological sulfidogenesis is effective with substantially lower costs and less sludge production since under neutral or alkaline conditions the theoretical solubility of most metal sulfide is much lower than that of metal hydroxide sun et al 2018 therefore the integration of sulfidogenesis and metal removal have attracted some attention for treating waters contaminated by metals two types of s0 based sulfidogenic processes have been developed the first type consists of a biological and a chemical part operating independently the biological part produces hydrogen sulfide and transfers it through a gas circulation to the chemical part then it is used for subsequent metal precipitation using this bioreactor specific heavy metals can be selectively precipitated by regulating the values of ph and ps log s2 in the settlers the other s0 based sulfidogenic bioreactor only has one compartment where the biological s2 production and heavy metal precipitation occur concurrently zhang et al 2021 7 h 2 s m e 2 me s s 2 h δ g 0 48 kj mol apart from sulfur reduction researchers have employed s0 as an alternative to sulfate to remove organics from wastewater for treating metal containing wastewater for instance zhang et al 2018a used sublimed sulfur powder as an electron acceptor in s0 reducing fluidized bed reactor to remove 81 of carbon in domestic wastewater lin et al 2018 built a lab scale internal sulfur cycling isc system that removed 94 of cod using elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor moreover s0 reduction has recently been demonstrated to achieve sludge reduction during high rate organic carbon removal the sludge yield of s0 based sulfidogenesis was 0 16 kg vss kg cod which is much lower than that of conventional activated sludge process 0 35 0 47 kg vss kg cod thus could minimize sludge production in wwtps zhang et al 2021 4 factors effecting sulfur driven wastewater treatment numerous studies have investigated the various environmental factors that influence s0 oxidizing bacteria and s0 reducer involved in element sulfur based bioprocesses these includes ph s n mass ratio temperature and do concentration these are briefly described below 4 1 ph ph is considered as one of the main factors significantly influencing the activity of sob in the s0ad and s0rb in elemental sulfur reduction generally a ph range of 6 9 has been reported to support the growth of sob in the s0ad process a higher ph 7 0 could favor the specific autotrophic denitrification rate while a relatively lower ph 6 8 would decrease this rate lin et al 2018 note that a foremost drawback existing in the s0ad process is its high alkalinity requirement due to consequent reactions that consume the alkalinity a large amount of buffer is required to compensate for the drop of ph zhang et al 2021 for instance 4 57 g of alkalinity as caco3 is consumed per gram of no3 n removal according to the stoichiometric equation crushed oyster shells are often used as buffer for these following reasons 1 low cost 2 the release of buffering agents such as hydroxide carbonate and bicarbonate 3 specific buffer surface supporting microbial attachment sengupta et al 2007 another method to satisfy the alkalinity demand in s0ad is to incorporate it with hd since the latter process provides 3 57 g of alkalinity per gram of no3 n removal in the process of s0 reduction the formation of polysulfide could significantly enable high rate bioreactions neutral or alkaline conditions 7 0 are described as important for polysulfide formation indeed when ph is kept at 7 the main species of polysulfides are tetrasulfide s4 2 and pentasulfide s5 2 and other types of polysulfides these species of polysulfides can be interconverted rapidly in comparison under acidic conditions polysulfide is unstable and easily decomposes into s0 and sulfide causing poor water solubility and low bioaccessibility florentino et al 2016 a neutral or alkaline ph 6 0 is therefore essential to maintain a high rate s0 reduction sun et al 2020a b 4 2 s n ratio the sulfur nitrate s n ratio has a greater impact on the s0ad process s reactions and bioproducts the theoretical value of the s n ratio for complete s0ad is 1 3 which significantly affects the final products from s0 oxidation and from denitrification pokorna and zabranska 2015 when the s n molar ratio is kept at 1 3 mol mol the final products of the s0ad process are nitrite and sulfate see eq 1 that nitrite can then serve as an electron acceptor see equitation 2 even if a suitable s n ratio is maintained sudden changes in environments can still significantly affect the efficiency of n and s removal cai et al 2008 in addition anoxic conditions are required for s0ad bioreactions since dissolved oxygen may inhibit the activity of the enzymes of s0ob note that a high concentration of nitrate e g 670 mg n l in sewage may inhibit the activity of the microbial community in the s0ad process additionally nitrite or its accompanying product free nitrite acid is reported to be toxic to most microorganisms including s0ob because it may passively diffuse across the membrane of the cells and react with their metabolic enzymes oh et al 2000 moreover a high concentration of sulfide 80 mg l can limit its ability to continuously accelerate sulfur reduction in the s0 reduction process due to the toxicity of unionized h2s to s0rb cardoso et al 2006 4 3 temperature temperature is an important aspect influencing the activities of sob and s0rb shao et al 2010 low temperatures 20 c are believed to suppress most bioreactions of the s0 driven bioprocess for the s0ad process the optimal temperature for most sob in mesophilic conditions is reported to be 25 35 c while a low temperature range e g 5 10 c would significantly decrease the nitrogen removal efficiency florentino et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 li et al 2020b for instance zhou et al 2011 have found that the nitrogen removal rate of a sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification reactor decreases sharply from 99 to 50 when temperature decreases from 20 25 c to 5 10 c since most studies described in the literature were carried out at room temperature only a few of them have reported on the impact of temperature on the performance of the elemental sulfur reduction process generally s0rb can grow in a wide range of temperatures from 2 to 110 c leading to the rapid reduction of elemental sulfur at a broader range of temperatures hao et al 2014 for instance sun et al 2020a b operated an elemental sulfur driven sulfidogenic process to treat mine acid wastewater at room temperature and the production rate of sulfide was 47 9 mgs l h 4 4 s0 particle size previous studies reported that s0 particle size is related to the mass transfer rate which may affect the reaction rate and performance of s0 driven processes cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the use of smaller s0 granules with a larger surface area is reported to be beneficial to the reaction efficiency but excessively small s0 particles would also result in low porosity and severe clogging and channeling which further deteriorate the normal operation of the system di capua et al 2016 in order to achieve desirable process performance s0 particle size should be as smaller as it can on the premise of avoiding the above stated issues as possible according to previous studies s0 particle sizes of 0 5 16 mm have been frequently used in laboratory and pilot scale s0ad bioprocess treating nitrate contaminated wastewater di capua et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 as for s0 based sulfidogenesis 0 6 50 mm of the s0 particles sizes were used in previous studies sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020a b as compared s0 particle size used for s0 based sulfidogenesis can be larger than that for s0ad but using the optimal samller particle size in both of processes could ensure highly efficient system performance 4 5 reactor configurations in almost all cases reported several types of reactor configurations were used for operation of s0 driven bioprocesses such as cylindrical reactor plexiglass column reactor sulfur packed bed bioreactor and s0 based constructed wetland cw see fig 5 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2019 guo et al 2021 li et al 2021b for instance qiu et al 2017 utilized a cylindrical type sulfur reducing bioreactor operated in sequencing batch to realize high rate sulfur reduction for metal laden wastewater treatment guo et al 2021 used a plexiglass column sulfidogenic bioreactor filled with sulfur particles particle size 3 5 cm to achieve high rate and low cost sulfide production under neutral conditions for subsequent metal laden wastewater treatment sun et al 2019 applied a plexiglass column sulfur packed bed bio reactor filled with sulfur particles 10 30 mesh to construct a sulfidogenic system for arsenite removal under acidic conditions li et al 2021b used a vertical up flow s0 based cw realizing high rate nitrogen removal in treating a real typical river in beijing all of these studies indicate such reactor configurations could realize the operation of s0 driven bioprocess in particular s can serve as both a biofilm carrier and slow release source of substrate in such types of bioreactors for s0 driven bioprocesses which is useful in areas where a liquid chemical feed system is impractical however until now limited studies reported how such reactor configuration affected the flow pattern of liquid efficiency of bireactions especially s0 transformation and conversion and microbial aggregates including s0rb and s0ob in the reactor which needs in depth research in future 4 6 other factors other factors such as oxygen concentration muyzer et al 2013 hao et al 2014 oxidation reduction potential orp lin et al 2018 and types of electron receptor donor lin et al 2018 hao et al 2014 may also have significant effect on the reactions and performance of s0 based bioprocesses especially the types of electron receptor donor are considered as key factors that strongly influence s0 driven bioprocess for s0 reduction the s0rb can use a wide range of electron donors such as acetate propionate h2 etc changing the type of organic substrate could significantly affect the sulfidogenic activity of the s0 reducer sodium acetate is generally believed to be the best electron donor for s0rb to achieve the highest rate of sulfide production 28 20 mg s l h followed by ethanol methanol glycerol pyruvic acid acetic acid glucose etc on the other hand in terms of costs glucose is believed to be the most cost effective organic substrate to realize a high sulfide production rate with low cost in the s0 reduction process the summary of the pathways of different organic substrates utilized in s0 reduction can be found in guo et al 2019b 5 future perspectives thanks to many previous valuable studies over the past decades our knowledge of s0 driven bioprocesses has significantly improved however much related to the mechanisms and applications remain unclear the following therefore offers some perspectives on further research as it is known that s0 has poor water solubility finding valuable strategies is key to improving its bioavailability increasing the bioavailability of s0 is in turn important for promoting the applications of s0 driven bioprocesses in addition to the above other strategies including using smaller s0 granules medicating the surface of the s0 particles and introducing extracellular redox mediators or conductive materials deserve attention we recommend using molecular tools to investigate and gather more information on the functional bacteria involved in s0 driven bioprocesses and their biochemical pathways moreover a microbiological method is needed to efficiently isolate and enrich the potential s0rb and sob imported from other cultures the related genetics and gene expressions of the relevant enzymes also deserve further research there is still limited understanding on the chemical nature of s0 such as its structure composition and storage states due to the complexity involved in converting s species as well as limitations in analysis more analytical techniques for measuring s0 in a dynamic system is important for elucidating the mechanisms of s0 driven bioprocess to optimize the process systematic testing should be undertaken to evaluate effects of such primary components as ph temperature and s n ratio s0 particle size and reactor configurations on the bioprocesses furthermore additional methods to better control these parameters in operation are required to optimize the performance of s0 based processes to date mathematical simulation models that describe s0 based bioprocesses for wastewater treatment are very limited given the merit of modeling in biological wastewater treatment it is necessary to either develop new models based on machine learning or extend current models for process design as well as performance optimization in engineering applications 6 conclusion this paper has provided a complete overview of new s0 driven bioprocesses including the development of s0ad and s0or as well as the microbiology and biochemistry involved in comparison to traditional wastewater treatment methods s0 driven bioprocesses use less organic matter and create less sludge great efforts have been made to classify chemical and biogenic s0 and related functional microbes in order to identify their biological mechanisms develop and improve bioprocesses and measure the impact of operating parameters on performance in order to gain a better understanding on the optimization of these processes the overall goal is to apply our improved knowledge of s0 driven bioprocesses and find ways to increase the accessibility of s0 accelerate the reaction and improve the overall performance to realize their

16220,elemental sulfur s0 is known to be an abundant non toxic material with a wide range of redox states 2 to 6 and may serve as an excellent electron carrier in wastewater treatment in turn s0 driven bioprocesses which employ s0 as electron donor or acceptor have recently established themselves as cost effective therefore attractive solutions for wastewater treatment numerous related processes have to date been developed from laboratory experiments into full scale applications including s0 driven autotrophic denitrification for nitrate removal and s0 reducing organic removal compared to the conventional activated sludge process these bioprocesses require only a small amount of organic matter and produce very little sludge there have been great efforts to characterize chemical and biogenic s0 and related functional microorganisms in order to identify the biochemical pathways upgrade the bioprocesses and assess the impact of the operating factors on process performance ultimately aiming to better understand and to optimize the processes this paper is therefore a comprehensive overview of emerging s0 driven biotechnologies including the development of s0 driven autotrophic denitrification and s0 based sulfidogenesis as well as the associated microbiology and biochemistry also reviewed here are the physicochemical characteristics of s0 and the effects that environmental factors such as ph influent sulfur nitrate ratio temperature s0 particle size and reactor configurations have on the process research gaps challenges of process applications and potential areas for future research are further proposed and discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elemental sulfur sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sulfur reducing organics removal biological wastewater treatment 1 introduction sulfur being one of the most common natural elements on the planet exhibits nine distinct valance from 2 in sulfide and reduced organic sulfur through 0 in elemental sulfur s0 to 6 in sulfate the various compounds of sulfur are products of a complicated sulfur cycle driven by chemical and biological transformations see fig 1 tang et al 2009 pokorna et al 2015 lin et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 elemental sulfur s0 as a central intermediate in the geochemical sulfur cycle in particular possesses several advantages over other intermediates of sulfur e g sulfide thiosulfate and sulfate s0 1 is the most abundant on earth 2 has versatility that allows both oxidation and reduction as it has an intermediate chemical valence and 3 is safer for storage and has low transportation costs when in solid form cai et al 2017 s0 has therefore been widely utilized for producing fertilizers rubber sulfuric acid in addition to other small niche market specialty chemicals the most notable among which include cosmetics and synthetic rubber made through vulcanization in addition to the above mentioned applications s0 has great potential for applications in wastewater treatment because of the oxidation reduction properties of s0 i e with a range from a minimum reducing state of 2 to a maximum oxidation state of 6 for instance s0 is a crucial intermediate during biological sulfide oxidation to sulfate which can also be a final product of biological sulfide oxidation zhang et al 2021 in fact using such reduction and oxidation properties of s0 in wastewater treatment has been widely reported in the past few decades such applications include s0 driven autotrophic denitrification s0ad and s0 reducing organic removal s0or zhang et al 2021 which are mediated by s0 oxidizing bacteria s0ob and s0 reducing bacteria s0rb respectively s0ad processes have also been reported to produce low biomass yield low toxicity and that such processes can be safely controlled and used on demand without overdosing concerns huang et al 2019 wang et al 2019a thus this process is commonly applied onto nitrate removal from organics deficient wastewater such as nitrogen contaminated groundwater sierra alvarez et al 2007 regeneration water vandekerckhove et al 2018 landfill leachate zeng et al 2021 and wastewater produced from leather and fertilizer processing read daily et al 2011 in s0or s0 is used as an electron acceptor by s0rb to oxidize various organic pollutants such as formate acetate lactate pyruvate peptone ethanol propionate glucose yeast extract and sugars sun et al 2020a b moreover removal of metal ions from mine wastewater is also reportedly attributing to sulfide generation from sulfate reduciuton in general biological sulfur removal bsr to minimize carbon consumption qiu et al 2017 as this process only produce a small amount of sludge it is considered to be highly cost effective for different engineering applications zhang et al 2021 over the past decades s0 driven bioprocesses have been applied to solving complicated environmental problems such as those mentioned above but reviews revolving around their emergence and development have been few and have mostly focused on mechanisms and applications critical reviews which focus on the physicochemical characteristics of s0 microorganisms as s0rb and s0ob fundamental mechanisms as s0 reduction oxidation as well as their impact factors and applications are very limited it is thus necessary to comprehensively review the significant knowledge of the various s0 driven bioprocesses this current review summarizes the latest progress in applying s0 driven bioprocesses onto wastewater treatment highlighting functional microorganisms and the biochemical principles that govern elemental sulfur s biotransformation pointing out possible engineering applications with important impact factors the review will also close a knowledge gap and increase scientists understanding of s0 driven wastewater treatment bioprocesses 2 physicochemical characteristics of elemental sulfur sulfur in its ground chemical form is known as s0 sulfur atoms have a high proclivity for forming polymeric chains or rings in a variety of forms george et al 2008 s0 solids that consist of these rings and or chains have very weak van der waals forces over 180 different allotropes and polymorphs of element sulfur have so far been identified but only modified orthorhombic α s8 0 has been verified for stability under usual temperature and air pressure 273 15 k and 1 bar steudel and eckert 2003 α s8 has strongly temperature dependent solubility 5 μg or 0 16 μmol per liter at 25 c while the equilibrium concentration of s8 aq with mineral sulfur α s8 is 6 1 nm at 4 c and 478 nm at 80 c respectively kamyshny et al 2009 s0 is soluble in compressed gases at higher temperatures 65 140 c the solubility of s8 aq is significantly subjected to the presence of surfactants for example it increases 5000 fold when several model surfactants e g sodium dodecyl sulfate and triton x 100 are present garcia and druschel 2014 this could be attributed to surfactant type molecules forming micelles with an s8 ring in its hydrophobic interior when dissolved in polar solvents s8 can partially transform to s6 and s7 and attain equilibrium in which 1 of the sulfur is present as the smaller ring toluene carbon disulfide and dichloromethane are the best solvents while cycloalkanes can dissolve smaller ring molecules of s0 only at room temperature steudel and eckert 2003 the most common types of s0 include mineral sulfur chem s0 bio s0 and colloidal s0 among these types of s0 chem s0 and bio s0 are more frequently utilized in real applications due to the impurities of mineral sulfur and high cost of colloidal s0 zhang et al 2021 besides due to its poor water solubility chemical s0 s chem has low availability toward microorganisms which is the main obstacle preventing s0 driven bioprocesses from having more real applications kostrytsia et al 2018 indeed this low solubility results in lower kinetics in comparison with conventional denitrification or sulfate reduction three possible pathways have been proposed to overcome this poor water solubility of s0 i finding a way to transform elemental sulfur into a more hydrophilic and or soluble form such as polysulfide in order to achieve quicker growth ii physically attaching elemental sulfur in solid phase to the outer membrane s surface to accelerate mass transfer subsequently allowing different microorganisms to adhere to the membrane directly and convert the elemental sulfur into sulfide iii using smaller more porous s0 particles with a higher specific surface area kostrytsia et al 2018 di capua et al 2019 seidel et al 2006 and giordano et al 2019 have mentioned another form of s0 referred to as biogenic elemental sulfur s0 bio which has greater availability to microorganisms s0 bio is a byproduct of desulfurization of natural gas and industrial waste streams as well as wastewater from metal refineries the properties of s0 bio are different from those of s chem s0 bio can be stored intra or extra cellularly as sulfur globules and s0 bio particles have a core of orthorhombic s0 rings which are covered in polymeric structures giving them a high specific surface area all this gives the s0 bio particules hydrophilic and colloidal properties enhancing its bioavailability to microorganisms kleinjan et al 2005 s0 bio could therefore be utilized as an adsorbent to remove heavy metals from wastewater in bioleaching processes and agricultural production because of this good bioaccessibility chen et al 2012 3 elemental sulfur driven bioprocesses s0 is readily available as a less toxic and low cost form of sulfur that is used as an electron donor acceptor in two main types of bioprocesses i e s0ad and s0or see fig 2 3 1 element sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification s0ad is highly recommended by engineers and researchers alike as a sustainable option for removing nitrate or nitrite from wastewater wang et al 2016 evaluating the cost difference between using reduced sulfur species such as sulfide thiosulfate and using organic substrate shows that each of them has an electron donor for nitrogen removal in wastewater clearly demonstrating that to remove an equal amount of nitrogen 1 0 kg it is significantly more economical to use elemental sulfur 0 45 than to use methanol 1 05 cui et al 2019 thus the s0ad process has been applied for nitrate or nitrite removal from carbon deficient wastewater in the literature various studies have mentioned the potential of using sulfur to remove nitrogen containing compounds from wastewater dasgupta et al 2017 sahinkaya et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a li et al 2021a zeng et al 2021 in their study wang et al 2020 found that s0ad plays a dominant role in nitrate removal in a pilot scale constructed wetland li et al 2021a investigated nitrate s removal performance in wetlands by using different sulfur sources e g s0 and fes2 and found that using s0 achieved the highest denitrification rate of 19 0 7 5 g m 2 d 1 zeng et al 2021 applied s0ad in a packed bed reactor and successfully removed nitrate from matured landfill leachate after partial nitrification and anammox pretreatment dasgupta et al 2017 combined the chemical s0ad process with the partial nitrification anammox process as an efficient way to remove nitrate from carbon deficient wastewater particularly matured landfill leachate shi et al 2020 used a sulfur based autotrophic continuous flow biosystem to realize more than 85 of vanadium v v and chromium cr vi removal from synthetic groundwater sahinkaya et al 2017 developed a s0ad process in a membrane bioreactor for removing nitrate from drinking water and almost achieved complete nitrate removal with up to 0 24 g no3 n l d of nitrate loading zhang et al 2020a found that the s0ad process could effectively remove sulfamethoxazole smx and nitrate from conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps overall these investigations have demonstrated that element sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is an underutilized alternative to heterotrophic denitrification for removing contaminants from carbon deficient wastewater besides s can also be employed as electron donor for treating perchlorate and nitrate contaminated water through transforming clo4 and no3 into innocuous cl and n2 via autotrophic s0 denitrification wan et al 2019 for instance wan et al 2017 operated a lab scale s0 packed bed reactor at a low hrt 0 75 h to simultaneously achieve 472 μg l or 22 mg l of perchlorate and nitrate 22 mgn l removal when treating low concentration perchlorate s0 disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate might occur resulting in excessive sulfate production and alkaline consumption thus a heterotrophic reactor followed by a s0 autotrophic reactor callled chsas was developed to prohibit s0 disproportionation which could remove approximate 94 of perchlorate and nitrate wan et al 2019 3 1 1 microorganisms involved in elemental sulfur driven oxidation most sobs that drive s0ad processes comprise various groups of chemolithotrophs and phototrophs cui et al 2019 among them chemolithotrophic sobs can perform sulfur oxidation in aerobic anoxic conditions by utilizing o2 and or no3 no2 as electron acceptors campos et al 2008 specific bacteria that are able to perform simultaneous anaerobic anoxic s0 oxidation and denitrification are called sob denitrifiers the majority of sobs have been reported to belong to the phylum proteobacteria in which the sobs can be classified into four classes α β γ and ε proteobacteria shao et al 2010 cui et al 2019 generally three dominant genera of proteobacteria have been found in s0ad systems they are i thiobacillus β proteobacteria along with thermothrix ii thioalkalivibrio γ proteobacteria along with thiohalorhabdus and iii sulfurimonas ε proteobacteria along with thiomicrospira in particular thiobacillus denitrificans the most common and studied genus of s0ad bacteria is a facultative anaerobe which means that it is able to use thiosulfates and thiocyanates in an aerobic environment and additional sulfides and elemental sulfur in an anaerobic environment it also has great immobilization capability on suitable carriers such as granular activated carbon shao et al 2010 cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 most sobs live in mesophilic or thermophilic conditions ranging from 20 to 90 c and ph ranging between 1 5 and 10 5 most of these sobs morphologically and taxonomically belong to rods and spheres these sobs work independently or cooperate within a biological wastewater treatment system to perform s0 driven autotrophic denitrification their physiological properties and specific taxonomy electron acceptors donors and other important environmental factors such as morphology electron donor acceptor ph and temperature are summarized in table 1 enzymes involved in elemental sulfur driven oxidation several enzymes such as sulfur dioxygenase sdo sulfur oxygenase reductase sor and heterodisulfide reductase hdr like complexes have been found to possess the ability to oxidize s0 the co existence of sdo sor and an hdr like complex in sobs indicates that s0 oxidation is diverse and complex at the same time it has been reported that these three cytoplasmic enzymes for s0 oxidation likely possess a synergistic interaction and regulation mode in sob lin et al 2018 enzyme activity of s0 oxidation was first found in acidithiobacillus thiooxidans in 1959 the associated enzyme known as sdo consists of a 21 and a 26 kda protein in acidithiobacillus thiooxidans or two 23 kda subunits in acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans it was suggested that the main physiological function of sdos and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr would work together to convert h2s to relieve its toxic effect to microorganisms it was reported that sulfane sulfur atom of glutathione persulfide gssh and its homologs gssnh n 1 were the actual substrate involved in sdo catalyzed reactions wang et al 2019a sor can catalyze the disproportionation of cytoplasmic s0 with the production of thiosulfate sulfite and sulfide sor isolated from archaea and bacteria consists of 24 identical subunits which generally have a structure of large hollow spheres each subunit has a catalytic cite that contains an essential cysteine and a low potential non heme iron site li et al 2008 the oxidation of s0 by sor requires o2 but does not need external cofactors or electron donors during which there is no electron transfer or substrate level phosphorylation the hdr like complex has been reported to serve as an enzyme for s0 oxidation in many types of sob and archaea the proteins in the hdr like complex isolated from sulfur oxidizers have been found to be homologous to those of methanogenic archaea sulfate reducing archaea and srb the hdr like complex encoded by an hdrc1b1a hyp hdrc2b2 gene usually contain more than five subunits which are hdra hdrb1 hdrb2 hdrc1 and hdrc2 wang et al 2019a 3 1 2 biochemistry in the s0ad process no3 as the electron acceptor is sequentially reduced to no2 no n2o and n2 with s0 as the electron donor eqs 1 and 2 generally the s0ad process is considered to be zero or half order kinetic reactions as proposed by kostrytsia et al 2018b the reactions include the following four steps see fig 3 1 sulfur dissolves into the liquid clinging to the surface of the s0 particles and transporting electron via sn 2 as a mediator 2 directly ingesting polymer state nanoscale elemental sulfur 3 autotrophic denitrification takes place directly interacting with s0 bound by outer membrane chemical groups e g mercaptan 4 the reaction products so4 2 n2 etc diffuse into the bulk liquid finally the s0 is oxidized into sulfate with the donation of electrons and energy production for microbial growth in the dissimilation huang et al 2019 wang et al 2019b it is generally assumed that bioreactions follow monod kinetics as its saturation constant ks of elemental sulfur for autotrophic denitrification is very low e g 0 22 mgs l huilinir et al 2020 at the same time the limiting factor in s0ad is its poor water solubility of s0 as such s0 mass transfer may restrict the overall rate of denitrification kostrytsia et al 2018b huilinir et al 2020 the energy yields from the oxidation of s0 and thiosulfate with nitrate as the electron acceptor are 91 2 and 93 0 kj electron equivalent respectively which are similar and slightly lower than the methanol 109 2 kj e eq this also suggests that s0 is a good alternative as an external carbon source to methanol when treating carbon deficient wastewater 1 s 0 3 n o 3 h 2 o s o 4 2 3 n o 2 2 h 2 s 0 2 n o 2 s o 4 2 n 2 3 1 3 types of sulfur driven denitrifications bioprocess over the past few decades the s0ad bioprocess and its derivative bioprocess have been developed effectively mainly using elemental sulfur as electron donor for nitrate or nitrite and phosphorus removal zhang et al 2021 these processes include elemental sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification s0lad integrated sulfur based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification isa hd and element sulfur driven biological simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal s0 ebpr a elemental sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification s0lad autotrophic denitrification with sulfur limestone filtration has been widely used for nitrate removal from groundwater sierra alvarez et al 2007 li et al 2020b the sulfur limestone is used to buffer any acidity generated and supply inorganic carbon to the cell most s0lad processes have been operated under a nitrate concentration between 2 1 and 50 0 mm li et al 2020b the optimum sulfur limestone ratio of 1 1 w w was found to be sufficient for nitrate removal in the s0lad system generally in this system cheap limestone can offer alkalinity and release ca2 ions that can stimulate denitrification but the amount of alkalinity production is highly dependent on the limestone dissolution and biological chemical interactions of ad in particular the limestone dissolve is inversely proportional to ph such that a higher ph will result in a lower limestone dissolution the force that drives the limestone to dissolute is related to the concentration gradient between the hs and h where hs is the hydrogen concentration in the liquid these further determine the low dissolution of limestone together with its large occupying volume which may decrease the denitrification potential of the bioreactor for instance the maximum denitrification rate was observed at approximate 0 07 g no3 n l d in a pilot scale s0lad biofilter under an hrt of 6 0 h li et al 2020b thus additional soluble alkalinity sources e g nahco3 oyster shells were employed to stimulate the denitrification rate for example sahinkaya et al 2014 used nahco3 instead of limestone to enrich the consortia with higher denitrification activity and found a maximum denitrification rate of 0 20 g no3 n l d achieved under an hrt of 1 0 h simard et al 2015 inserted an oyster shell column into a s0ad system and found oyster shell as a slow release source of alkalinity and biofilm carrier could increase the ph and alkalinity of the treated water allowing an increase in denitrification on the other hand although limestone is the most commonly used low cost alkalinity source the main drawback of using limestone is the increased hardness of treated water due to release of ca2 sahinkaya et al 2011 thus mixotrophic sulfur based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification is recommended over s0lad process alone due to the decrease of ca2 release and alkalinity requirement b integrated sulfur based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification isa hd according to reports autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrification has disadvantages such as high carbon requirement and a considerable amount of sludge generation in heterotrophic denitrification as well as a low growth rate of autotrophic denitrifiers cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 moreover the reactions of ad consume the alkalinity causing a large amount of buffer to be required in order to compensate for the drop of ph but the reactions of the hd process generate alkalinity zhang et al 2018b to overcome the disadvantages of individual heterotrophic and autotrophic processes an isa hd process has been developed and widely applied in actual wastewater with the co existence of organic carbon nitrate and inorganic sulfur compounds liang et al 2022 achieved an average nitrate reduction rate of 420 mg no3 n l d in an isa hd system by using mixture of elemental sulfur powder shell powder corncob powder and sawdust powder besides other than liquid organic carbon sources e g methanol ethanol slow release source of solid organic carbon substrates e g woodchip scrap tire chips have also been used as an alternative for no3 removal by simultaneous heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification li et al 2016 he et al 2021 li et al 2016 developed a woodchip sulfur based heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification wshad process for treating nitrate contaminated water which could achieve a higher no3 removal rates than that of sulfur based ad without so4 2 accumulation thus isa hd process has displayed several advantages including decrease in sulfate production low alkalinity necessity and low cost compared to the sole heterotrophic or autotrophic process zhang et al 2020b liang et al 2022 generally the isa hd process would have two types of bioreactors i e the mixotrophic denitrification operated in one reactor liang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020b or two separated reactors including an autotrophic denitrification reactor and a heterotrophic denitrification reactor zhang et al 2018b regarding the microbial community in one mixtrophic reactor the heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb were found to be predominated such as pseudomonas azoarcus thauera and halomonas which contributed to satisfactory sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies with respect to the microbial community of two separated reactors the autotrophic denitrification reactor is usually enriched by an autotrophic sob such as thiobacillus while the heterotrophic denitrification reactor is enriched by heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria such as thauera and allidiomarina zhang et al 2018b recently in order to accelerate the bioreactions of s0ad micro aerobic conditions have been introduced the results have shown that in micro aerobic conditions sulfide or elemental sulfur nitrate and acetate s removal rates of isa hd are 10 times higher than in anaerobic conditions thus micro oxygen might have a stimulating effect on functional bacteria resulting in enhanced isa hd performance zhang et al 2020b c element sulfur driven biological simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal s0 ebpr in recent years a novel process of s0 ebpr has been developed for the treatment of saline wastewater guo et al 2016 2019a this process integrates the c n s and p cycles for the simultaneous removal of cod nitrogen and phosphorus with minimal sludge production and works even on high temperature 25 35 c saline sewage the process likely employs two key microbial agents working cooperatively i e srb and sob sob e g thiobacillus in particular uses s0 as an electron donor to produce partial energy needed for nitrate and phosphorus removal from saline sewage in details in the anaerobic stage carbon sources are taken up by both srb and sob for sulfate reduction to form poly s s0 and synthesize pha respectively specially sulfate might be fully reduced to s2 or partially reduced to s2 then re oxidized back to s0 by both srb and sob synergistically at the same time sob perform p release and glycogen degradation in the subsequently anoxic micro aerobic stage sob oxidize intracellular pha and poly s s0 by using nitrate as the electron acceptor for p uptake glycogen replenishment and sulfate production in this microecological system srb and sob work together to produce a synergic effect on p release and p uptake where sulfur cycle participates in p removal as an electron carrier in addition the s0 sn 2 species stored in the universal pool of bioavailable sulfur proved to be the energy source for phosphorus removal guo et al 2019a when compared to the metabolism of conventional ebpr sob in the s0 ebpr system seemingly replace the role of conventional phosphate accumulating organisms paos by generating sulfur and polyp pools to perform sulfur conversion associated phosphorus removal as well as compete with glycogen accumulating organisms gaos for limited carbon sources this process offers an alternative for meeting the increasing demand for removing p from saline wastewater d other elemental sulfur based denitrifications apart from the above mentioned three derivative bioprocesses a typical sulfur ad process have been developed for municipal wastewater treatment with low c n ratio in hong kong called sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process wu et al 2016 the sani process uses the sulfate originating from seawater toilet flushing as an electron carrier and produce reduced sulfur species i e sulfide s0 and thiosulfate for nitrogen removal during autotrophic denitrification the sani process has recently been scaled up to a 1000 m3 d demoplante which not only meet the local effluent standards but also achieved 60 70 less biological sludge production and 30 40 less space compared to conventional wwtps wu et al 2016 one drawback of this process is sulfur compounds remaining in the effluent likely causing secondary sulfate pollution besides s0ad has also been combined with membrane technology sahinkaya et al 2017 constructed wetlands li et al 2020a and anammox li et al 2019 chen et al 2019 for the treatment of different wastewater displaying high process efficiency these s0ad combined processes have been applied onto nitrate removal from waters such as polluted wastewater and groundwater and select wastewater such as ion exchange resins nitrified leachate septic effluent and a few types of synthetic wastewater post denitrification of industrial effluents and some other oxidized contaminants such as cr vi bromate hexavalent uranium and perchlorate sahinkaya et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 3 2 elemental sulfur driven reduction s can be reduced to sulfide using organics as an electron donor s0rb for metal precipitation from mine wastewater thereby using less carbon source than biological sulfate reduction especially when treating carbon deficient mine wastewater li et al 2021a indeed with the same amount of organic matter higher around 4 times amount of sulfide can be generated in s0 reduction compared to sulfate reduction see eqs 3 and 4 as such s0 reduction can be employed for organic removal from wastewater sludge reduction generation of sulfide for heavy metal precipitation etc zhang et al 2018a developed a high rate sulfur reducing anaerobic sulfidogenic process in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor where s0 worked as an electron acceptor for sludge minimized wastewater treatment sun et al 2018 produced sulfide at a rate of 47 9 mgs l h through adding sublimed sulfur into a lab scale s0 reducing biological sulfide production reactor sun et al 2020a b used high rate s0 reduction to achieve even better effluent and higher cost effectiveness in a sulfidogenic acid mine drainage amd treatment system without ph amelioration li et al 2021a recently applied a pilot scale s0 based sulfidogenic treatment system to treat cu laden electroplating wastewater and achieved 99 9 cu2 removal wang et al 2019c set up a s0 reduction process to treat mercury rich wastewater and achieved a high removal efficiency of hg ii without mehg accumulation zhang et al 2018a developed a novel internal sulfur cycling system comprising a s0 reducing reactor for organics removal and a sulfide oxidizing reactor and sedimentation tank for sulfur recovery to treat sulfate deficit wastewater and found that the internal sulfur cycling process was a cost effective sludge minimized biotechnology all of these studies have further indicated that s could be converted to sulfide for heavy metal precipitation and utilized as an electron acceptor for organic removal 3 c h 3 c o o 4 s 0 2 h 2 o 2 c o 2 4 h s 3 h δ g 0 39 k j m o l 4 c h 3 c o o s o 4 2 2 h c o 3 h s δ

conditions see table 2 this adaptability gives them the ability to treat various wastewaters in different environments to date s0 reducers that have been reported spread among over 69 genera within nine phyla of the bacteria domain and 37 genera within two phyla of the archaea domain in the bacteria domain the nine phyla that s0rbs belong to are aquificiae chrysiogenetes deferribacteres firmicutes proteobacteria thermodesulfobacteria thermotogae spirochaetes and synergistetes the two phyla that s0 reducing archaea s0ra in the archaea domain belong to are euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota florentino et al 2016 additionally some s0rbs are able to use not only s0 thiosulfate and sulfite but also other electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate nitrite manganese iv iron iii iron iii and ferric see table 2 s0 reducers use many kinds of organics as electron donors such as acetate propionate formate sugars lactate ethanol etc some species of srb such as desulfitibacter desulfobacter desulfovibrio desulfurobacterium and desulfuromusa have also been reported to carry out s0 reduction table 2 it has been reported that s0rb can grow under a broad range of temperatures from 2 to 110 c and ph values from 1 to 10 5 s0ras generally like to live in hyperthermophilic environments and they are seldom found in mesophilic s0 driven reduction processes although most s0 reducers thrive at neutral ph environments some of them can acclimatize to extremely low ph for example acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans desulfosporosinus acididurans and desulfurobacterium thermolithotrophum are productive at ph values of 1 3 3 8 and 4 5 respectively main enzymes involved in elemental sulfur reduction despite a lack in depth understanding of the enzymatic level of sulfur reduction four enzymes involved in the reduction of s0 and conversion of polysulfide to h2s have been classified they are 1 polysulfide reductase isolated from wolinella succinogenes 2 sulfide dehydrogenase isolated from pyrococcus furiosus 3 sulfhydrogenase isolated from pyrococcus furiosus and 4 sulfur reductase isolated from acidianus ambivalens florentino et al 2019 on the other hand enzymes that are involved in related carbon oxidization coupled with elemental sulfur reduction have been well reported so they will not be discussed further in this review polysulfide reductase polysulfide reductase is an integral membrane protein complex which plays an important role in quinone oxidation and polysulfide reduction that exists in neutrophiles in an aqueous solution that contains nucleophiles such as cysteine or sulfide s can be converted into polysulfide and then to sulfide by being catalyzed by polysulfide reductase at neutral or basic ph this enzyme comprises three psrabc subunits i e psra psrb and psrc the psra subunit is the catalytic unit that first catalyzes the chain of polysulfide cleaved at the last sulfur atom that has been released and bound to the molybdenum cofactor and then oxidized psrb is an iron sulfur protein at the periplasmic side of the membrane that has an iron sulfur 4fe 4s center as an electron transport chain to transfer an electron from psra to the membrane anchor psrc is an integral membrane protein that helps to anchor other subunits on the membrane wang et al 2021 sulfide dehydrogenase sulfide dehydrogenase which generally exists in hyperthermophilic s0 reducers such as pyrococcus furiosus and caldisericum exile is reported to be a biofunctional cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of polysulfides into h2s the protein of this enzyme consists of three different iron sulfur centers 1 a 2fe 2s center coordinated by both aspartate and three cysteines asp cys 3 that combine physico chemical properties 2 a 3fe 4s center with high potential of sulfide reduction 3 a 4fe 4s center with unusual properties of sulfide reduction the role of the last two clusters working on the high sulfide reduction potentials is not yet clear but it has been reported that sulfide dehydrogenase significantly affects the redox potential of the flavins hagen et al 2000 as the properties of the fe s groups in sulfide dehydrogenase are not yet fully understood the in depth related bioreactions still needs rigorous research sulfhydrogenase sulfhydrogenase a cytoplasmic hydrogen metabolizing enzyme found in pyrococcus furiosus dethiobacter alkaliphilus and palaeococcus ferrophilus is identical to hydrogenase and is capable of catalyzing the reduction of sulfur and polysulfide and the oxidation of h2 it has two types of sulfhydrogenase namely sulfhydrogenase i and ii sulfhydrogenase i has been reported to play a significant role in sulfur reduction and hydrogen production ma et al 1993 sulfhydrogenase ii has a higher affinity for s0 and polysulfide indicating that it has a physiological relevance at a low concentration of s0 while sulfhydrogenase i potentially uses both of them with equal efficiency sulfur reductase sulfur reductase is a membrane bound protein with several subunits which exhibits similar structure and properties to polysulfide reductase this enzyme likely consists of three proteins a catalytic subunit probably molybdopterin srea an fe s protein sreb and a membrane anchor srec since sulfur reductase is isolated under the condition that no sulfide existed it was assumed to reduce s0 itself instead of polysulfide because the enzyme cannot be purified without hydrogenase information on the mechanism of this enzyme has been limited and deeper investigations has not been possible ma et al 1993 further thorough characterization of this enzyme is therefore necessary 3 2 2 biochemistry in general s0 reduction has relatively low activities due to its solubility in water polysulfide has been reported as an intermediate that significantly hinders elemental sulfur reduction zhang et al 2021 in the process of s0 reduction the s8 ring of s0 is first attacked by the nucleophilic hs anion and is then cleaved in the presence of sulfide resulting in the formation of polysulfide as mentioned in section 2 polysulfide is a soluble carrier of s0 atoms with linear s molecules making it more accessible to microorganisms than s8 ring polysulfide is then readily reduced to sulfide catalyzed by polysulfide reductase see eqs 5 and 6 liang et al 2016 the sulfide thus produced continues to attack the s0 and produce more polysulfide accelerating the reduction of s0 the possible pathways for s0 reduction are notably dependent on ph conditions generally polysulfide is the most common electron acceptor donor during s0 metabolism under neutral alkaline conditions ph 7 but is unstable at low ph what polysulfide sulfur transferase synthesized by an s0 reducer does is to allow fast polysulfide respiration when polysulfide concentration becomes low to ensure sufficient polysulfide in the substrate zhang et al 2021 see fig 4 for instance at ph 10 polysulfide is the main form of sulfide when there is sufficient s0 at ph 7 s0 is mainly used by the extracellular electron transfer and direct cell s contact which would lower the conversion of s0 specifically a ph lower than 6 0 would almost completely inhibit polysulfide formation causing the rates of s0 reduction oxidation under acidic conditions to be much lower than under neutral or alkaline conditions sun et al 2019 5 h s n 1 s 0 s n 2 h 6 hc o 2 s n 2 h 2 o hc o 3 h s s n 1 2 h moreover during the s0 reduction no formation of polysulfide has been reported indicating that elemental sulfur reduction may proceed in dissimilation even with no involvement of polysulfide zhang et al 2021 though our understanding on the mechanism of s0 reduction by different s0 reducers is still limited we can conjecture that when polysulfide cannot be used as an intermediate product a direct change of sulfur into sulfide has occurred 3 2 3 elemental sulfur based sulfidogenesis sulfidogenic processes performed by s0 reducers is a potential alternative for sulfide production and precipitation of chalcophilic metals for treating acid mine drainage eqs 3 4 and 7 pozo et al 2017 kumar et al 2021 compared to conventional chemical precipitation for heavy metal removal biological sulfidogenesis is effective with substantially lower costs and less sludge production since under neutral or alkaline conditions the theoretical solubility of most metal sulfide is much lower than that of metal hydroxide sun et al 2018 therefore the integration of sulfidogenesis and metal removal have attracted some attention for treating waters contaminated by metals two types of s0 based sulfidogenic processes have been developed the first type consists of a biological and a chemical part operating independently the biological part produces hydrogen sulfide and transfers it through a gas circulation to the chemical part then it is used for subsequent metal precipitation using this bioreactor specific heavy metals can be selectively precipitated by regulating the values of ph and ps log s2 in the settlers the other s0 based sulfidogenic bioreactor only has one compartment where the biological s2 production and heavy metal precipitation occur concurrently zhang et al 2021 7 h 2 s m e 2 me s s 2 h δ g 0 48 kj mol apart from sulfur reduction researchers have employed s0 as an alternative to sulfate to remove organics from wastewater for treating metal containing wastewater for instance zhang et al 2018a used sublimed sulfur powder as an electron acceptor in s0 reducing fluidized bed reactor to remove 81 of carbon in domestic wastewater lin et al 2018 built a lab scale internal sulfur cycling isc system that removed 94 of cod using elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor moreover s0 reduction has recently been demonstrated to achieve sludge reduction during high rate organic carbon removal the sludge yield of s0 based sulfidogenesis was 0 16 kg vss kg cod which is much lower than that of conventional activated sludge process 0 35 0 47 kg vss kg cod thus could minimize sludge production in wwtps zhang et al 2021 4 factors effecting sulfur driven wastewater treatment numerous studies have investigated the various environmental factors that influence s0 oxidizing bacteria and s0 reducer involved in element sulfur based bioprocesses these includes ph s n mass ratio temperature and do concentration these are briefly described below 4 1 ph ph is considered as one of the main factors significantly influencing the activity of sob in the s0ad and s0rb in elemental sulfur reduction generally a ph range of 6 9 has been reported to support the growth of sob in the s0ad process a higher ph 7 0 could favor the specific autotrophic denitrification rate while a relatively lower ph 6 8 would decrease this rate lin et al 2018 note that a foremost drawback existing in the s0ad process is its high alkalinity requirement due to consequent reactions that consume the alkalinity a large amount of buffer is required to compensate for the drop of ph zhang et al 2021 for instance 4 57 g of alkalinity as caco3 is consumed per gram of no3 n removal according to the stoichiometric equation crushed oyster shells are often used as buffer for these following reasons 1 low cost 2 the release of buffering agents such as hydroxide carbonate and bicarbonate 3 specific buffer surface supporting microbial attachment sengupta et al 2007 another method to satisfy the alkalinity demand in s0ad is to incorporate it with hd since the latter process provides 3 57 g of alkalinity per gram of no3 n removal in the process of s0 reduction the formation of polysulfide could significantly enable high rate bioreactions neutral or alkaline conditions 7 0 are described as important for polysulfide formation indeed when ph is kept at 7 the main species of polysulfides are tetrasulfide s4 2 and pentasulfide s5 2 and other types of polysulfides these species of polysulfides can be interconverted rapidly in comparison under acidic conditions polysulfide is unstable and easily decomposes into s0 and sulfide causing poor water solubility and low bioaccessibility florentino et al 2016 a neutral or alkaline ph 6 0 is therefore essential to maintain a high rate s0 reduction sun et al 2020a b 4 2 s n ratio the sulfur nitrate s n ratio has a greater impact on the s0ad process s reactions and bioproducts the theoretical value of the s n ratio for complete s0ad is 1 3 which significantly affects the final products from s0 oxidation and from denitrification pokorna and zabranska 2015 when the s n molar ratio is kept at 1 3 mol mol the final products of the s0ad process are nitrite and sulfate see eq 1 that nitrite can then serve as an electron acceptor see equitation 2 even if a suitable s n ratio is maintained sudden changes in environments can still significantly affect the efficiency of n and s removal cai et al 2008 in addition anoxic conditions are required for s0ad bioreactions since dissolved oxygen may inhibit the activity of the enzymes of s0ob note that a high concentration of nitrate e g 670 mg n l in sewage may inhibit the activity of the microbial community in the s0ad process additionally nitrite or its accompanying product free nitrite acid is reported to be toxic to most microorganisms including s0ob because it may passively diffuse across the membrane of the cells and react with their metabolic enzymes oh et al 2000 moreover a high concentration of sulfide 80 mg l can limit its ability to continuously accelerate sulfur reduction in the s0 reduction process due to the toxicity of unionized h2s to s0rb cardoso et al 2006 4 3 temperature temperature is an important aspect influencing the activities of sob and s0rb shao et al 2010 low temperatures 20 c are believed to suppress most bioreactions of the s0 driven bioprocess for the s0ad process the optimal temperature for most sob in mesophilic conditions is reported to be 25 35 c while a low temperature range e g 5 10 c would significantly decrease the nitrogen removal efficiency florentino et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 li et al 2020b for instance zhou et al 2011 have found that the nitrogen removal rate of a sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification reactor decreases sharply from 99 to 50 when temperature decreases from 20 25 c to 5 10 c since most studies described in the literature were carried out at room temperature only a few of them have reported on the impact of temperature on the performance of the elemental sulfur reduction process generally s0rb can grow in a wide range of temperatures from 2 to 110 c leading to the rapid reduction of elemental sulfur at a broader range of temperatures hao et al 2014 for instance sun et al 2020a b operated an elemental sulfur driven sulfidogenic process to treat mine acid wastewater at room temperature and the production rate of sulfide was 47 9 mgs l h 4 4 s0 particle size previous studies reported that s0 particle size is related to the mass transfer rate which may affect the reaction rate and performance of s0 driven processes cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the use of smaller s0 granules with a larger surface area is reported to be beneficial to the reaction efficiency but excessively small s0 particles would also result in low porosity and severe clogging and channeling which further deteriorate the normal operation of the system di capua et al 2016 in order to achieve desirable process performance s0 particle size should be as smaller as it can on the premise of avoiding the above stated issues as possible according to previous studies s0 particle sizes of 0 5 16 mm have been frequently used in laboratory and pilot scale s0ad bioprocess treating nitrate contaminated wastewater di capua et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 as for s0 based sulfidogenesis 0 6 50 mm of the s0 particles sizes were used in previous studies sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020a b as compared s0 particle size used for s0 based sulfidogenesis can be larger than that for s0ad but using the optimal samller particle size in both of processes could ensure highly efficient system performance 4 5 reactor configurations in almost all cases reported several types of reactor configurations were used for operation of s0 driven bioprocesses such as cylindrical reactor plexiglass column reactor sulfur packed bed bioreactor and s0 based constructed wetland cw see fig 5 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2019 guo et al 2021 li et al 2021b for instance qiu et al 2017 utilized a cylindrical type sulfur reducing bioreactor operated in sequencing batch to realize high rate sulfur reduction for metal laden wastewater treatment guo et al 2021 used a plexiglass column sulfidogenic bioreactor filled with sulfur particles particle size 3 5 cm to achieve high rate and low cost sulfide production under neutral conditions for subsequent metal laden wastewater treatment sun et al 2019 applied a plexiglass column sulfur packed bed bio reactor filled with sulfur particles 10 30 mesh to construct a sulfidogenic system for arsenite removal under acidic conditions li et al 2021b used a vertical up flow s0 based cw realizing high rate nitrogen removal in treating a real typical river in beijing all of these studies indicate such reactor configurations could realize the operation of s0 driven bioprocess in particular s can serve as both a biofilm carrier and slow release source of substrate in such types of bioreactors for s0 driven bioprocesses which is useful in areas where a liquid chemical feed system is impractical however until now limited studies reported how such reactor configuration affected the flow pattern of liquid efficiency of bireactions especially s0 transformation and conversion and microbial aggregates including s0rb and s0ob in the reactor which needs in depth research in future 4 6 other factors other factors such as oxygen concentration muyzer et al 2013 hao et al 2014 oxidation reduction potential orp lin et al 2018 and types of electron receptor donor lin et al 2018 hao et al 2014 may also have significant effect on the reactions and performance of s0 based bioprocesses especially the types of electron receptor donor are considered as key factors that strongly influence s0 driven bioprocess for s0 reduction the s0rb can use a wide range of electron donors such as acetate propionate h2 etc changing the type of organic substrate could significantly affect the sulfidogenic activity of the s0 reducer sodium acetate is generally believed to be the best electron donor for s0rb to achieve the highest rate of sulfide production 28 20 mg s l h followed by ethanol methanol glycerol pyruvic acid acetic acid glucose etc on the other hand in terms of costs glucose is believed to be the most cost effective organic substrate to realize a high sulfide production rate with low cost in the s0 reduction process the summary of the pathways of different organic substrates utilized in s0 reduction can be found in guo et al 2019b 5 future perspectives thanks to many previous valuable studies over the past decades our knowledge of s0 driven bioprocesses has significantly improved however much related to the mechanisms and applications remain unclear the following therefore offers some perspectives on further research as it is known that s0 has poor water solubility finding valuable strategies is key to improving its bioavailability increasing the bioavailability of s0 is in turn important for promoting the applications of s0 driven bioprocesses in addition to the above other strategies including using smaller s0 granules medicating the surface of the s0 particles and introducing extracellular redox mediators or conductive materials deserve attention we recommend using molecular tools to investigate and gather more information on the functional bacteria involved in s0 driven bioprocesses and their biochemical pathways moreover a microbiological method is needed to efficiently isolate and enrich the potential s0rb and sob imported from other cultures the related genetics and gene expressions of the relevant enzymes also deserve further research there is still limited understanding on the chemical nature of s0 such as its structure composition and storage states due to the complexity involved in converting s species as well as limitations in analysis more analytical techniques for measuring s0 in a dynamic system is important for elucidating the mechanisms of s0 driven bioprocess to optimize the process systematic testing should be undertaken to evaluate effects of such primary components as ph temperature and s n ratio s0 particle size and reactor configurations on the bioprocesses furthermore additional methods to better control these parameters in operation are required to optimize the performance of s0 based processes to date mathematical simulation models that describe s0 based bioprocesses for wastewater treatment are very limited given the merit of modeling in biological wastewater treatment it is necessary to either develop new models based on machine learning or extend current models for process design as well as performance optimization in engineering applications 6 conclusion this paper has provided a complete overview of new s0 driven bioprocesses including the development of s0ad and s0or as well as the microbiology and biochemistry involved in comparison to traditional wastewater treatment methods s0 driven bioprocesses use less organic matter and create less sludge great efforts have been made to classify chemical and biogenic s0 and related functional microbes in order to identify their biological mechanisms develop and improve bioprocesses and measure the impact of operating parameters on performance in order to gain a better understanding on the optimization of these processes the overall goal is to apply our improved knowledge of s0 driven bioprocesses and find ways to increase the accessibility of s0 accelerate the reaction and improve the overall performance to realize their

16221,ozonation has been applied in water treatment for more than a century first for disinfection later for oxidation of inorganic and organic pollutants in recent years ozone has been increasingly applied for enhanced municipal wastewater treatment for ecosystem protection and for potable water reuse these applications triggered significant research efforts on the abatement efficiency of organic contaminants and the ensuing formation of transformation products this endeavor was accompanied by developments in analytical and computational chemistry which allowed to improve the mechanistic understanding of ozone reactions this critical review assesses the challenges of ozonation of impaired water qualities such as wastewaters and provides an up to date compilation of the

area is being further extended to wastewater treatment and potable water reuse ozonation is facing new challenges associated with higher concentrations and new types of dissolved organic matter as well as a larger range of organic contaminants this critical review provides the background of the current developments in ozonation applications section 2 addresses new challenges associated with the impact of dissolved organic matter on ozonation performance section 3 and provides a critical compilation of kinetic and mechanistic information necessary to evaluate abatement of organic compounds during ozonation section 4 furthermore the abatement of antibiotic resistance is discussed section 5 and compared to the abatement of micropollutants and bromate formation 2 ozonation in drinking water and wastewater treatments 2 1 drinking water 2 1 1 from disinfection to oxidation ozonation has been applied in drinking water for more than a century mainly for disinfection purposes fig 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 it was considered as an equivalent to chlorine and in some cases an ozone residual was maintained in the distribution system for groundwaters with low doc concentrations and with high carbonate alkalinity conditions which warrant a high ozone stability courbat et al 1999 hoigné 1998 in addition to its outstanding capacity for the inactivation of microorganisms such as viruses bacteria and protozoa von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wolf et al 2018 ozone was also applied at an early stage to oxidatively abate inorganic compounds e g fe ii mn ii no2 hs and to control taste and odor issues fig 1 von gunten 2003b only in the 1970s and 1980s the mechanism of ozone decomposition in water was elucidated and it was demonstrated that hydroxyl radicals oh are formed during this process bühler et al 1984 hoigné and bader 1975 staehelin et al 1984 staehelin and hoigné 1985 it was also shown that ozone transformation to oh can be accelerated by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which opened up the possibility for ozone based advanced oxidation processes aops which combine ozone and oh oxidation and are applicable for oxidant resistant micropollutant abatement fig 1 aieta et al 1988 von gunten 2018 as a consequence of this discovery ozone based aops were implemented in the 1990s especially in france to abate ozone resistant pesticides mainly atrazine duguet et al 1990 however due to the drinking water regulations of the european union in 1998 eu 1998 which included metabolites from pesticides as regulated products this approach was no longer accepted in france and as a consequence aops were banned for the abatement of pesticides and only admitted for the treatment of chlorinated solvents von gunten 2018 the formation of transformation products during ozonation of micropollutants will be discussed in more detail in several sections below 2 1 2 disinfection byproducts formation and mitigation in applications of chlorine trihalomethanes thms were reported as disinfection byproducts dbps in the mid 1970s rook 1974 however it took much longer until dbps were considered during ozonation processes hoigné 1998 von gunten 2018 first the formation and removal by biological post filtration of aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids was studied glaze et al 1989 hammes et al 2006 hammes et al 2007 nawrocki et al 2003 ramseier et al 2011a swietlik et al 2004 swietlik et al 2009 van der kooij et al 1989 zürcher et al 1978 and then the formation of trichloronitromethane chloropicrin during post chlorination of ozonated waters was investigated fig 1 hoigné and bader 1988 thibaud et al 1987 even though bromate formation during ozonation of bromide containing waters was already investigated in the early 1980s haag and hoigné 1983b it only became an issue when it was found to be a possible human carcinogen in the early 1990s fig 1 who 2017 the relatively stringent and quite universal drinking water standard for bromate 10 µg l often limits ozone applications for disinfection purposes therefore several mitigation options were developed such as ph depression ammonium addition chlorine ammonium or ammonium chlorine addition when disinfection is the main purpose and hydrogen peroxide addition when disinfection is not the primary target for ozonation buffle et al 2004 haag and hoigné 1983b krasner et al 1993 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 song et al 1996 song et al 1997 von gunten and hoigné 1994 von gunten and oliveras 1998 von gunten 2003a an updated mechanism for bromate formation during ozonation is presented elsewhere

2001 pre oxidation by ozone was found to be an interesting option for the mitigation of these undesired compounds chen and valentine 2008 krasner et al 2018 lee et al 2007a mccurry et al 2015 shah et al 2012 however numerous studies also reported n nitrosamine formation during ozonation of individual target compounds andrzejewski et al 2008 lim et al 2016 marti et al 2015 oya et al 2008 schmidt and brauch 2008 including a case of bromide catalysis for dimethylsulfamide trogolo et al 2015 von gunten et al 2010 and real water matrices fig 1 gerrity et al 2015 krasner et al 2013 pisarenko et al 2015 finally with the discovery of toxic iodo dbps which can be formed during oxidative processes in presence of iodide dong et al 2019 li et al 2020 pre ozonation was recognized as an efficient mitigation strategy to minimize iodo dbps by oxidizing iodide quickly to iodate fig 1 allard et al 2013 bichsel and von gunten 1999 2 2 wastewater 2 2 1 disinfection similar to drinking water ozonation has been implemented in wastewater as a disinfectant before its discharge to the receiving water bodies fig 1 gerrity et al 2012 janex et al 2000 paraskeva and graham 2002 xu et al 2002 however wastewater disinfection requires quite high doses and it is expected that disinfection including inactivation of ozone resistant microorganisms such as protozoa will lead to the formation of bromate above the drinking water standard of 10 µg l lee et al 2016b schindler wildhaber et al 2015 zimmermann et al 2011 2 2 2 oxidation of micropollutants for potable water reuse purposes human health due to issues related to water scarcity and water security potable water reuse projects are increasing with 25 full scale systems in operation worldwide marron et al 2019 potable water reuse requires a multibarrier approach to guarantee microbial and chemical drinking water safety gerrity et al 2013 marron et al 2019 currently most of the water reuse facilities rely on systems which treat municipal wastewater effluent by a sequence of membranes micro or ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis ro followed by an advanced oxidation process most commonly uv h2o2 and a disinfection step for the distribution system marron et al 2019 this scheme can also include a pre ozonation for disinfection as the primary treatment step gerrity et al 2013 often an additional cycle through a natural or managed system reservoir groundwater is used to condition the water in terms of temperature mineral content and to remove biodegradable organic compounds this approach which is known as indirect potable reuse also has reasonable consumer acceptance recently more direct potable reuse projects have been implemented due to the lack of suitable systems or regulations for the storage recharge of the treated water steinle darling 2015 even though these potable reuse systems provide high quality drinking water the main drawback is the high waste stream from the concentrate of the ro also containing antiscalants which consists of about 20 of the treated water pérez gonzález et al 2012 in coastal areas this reject can be discharged to the ocean however for inland water reuse applications far from the ocean such discharges are not possible and alternative treatment strategies have to be developed less tight membranes such as nanofiltration can ease this situation to a certain extent but will still produce a significant waste stream and reject micropollutants to a smaller extent marron et al 2019 alternatively treatment schemes involving activated carbon or ozonation combined with biological activated carbon bac filtration were suggested which reduce the problem of waste streams inherent to tight membrane based systems significantly and can still provide a good drinking water quality which was demonstrated in laboratory and pilot studies gerrity et al 2011 gerrity and snyder 2011 gerrity et al 2014 hooper et al 2020 reungoat et al 2012 sundaram et al 2020 vaidya et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the first potable reuse system worldwide in windhoek namibia comprised several treatment steps including the combination of ozonation with biological activated carbon filtration gerrity et al 2013 the assessment of ozone based reuse systems was mainly based on the microbiological and the chemical quality related to micropollutants even though this approach seems quite promising there are several critical points which need to be addressed more carefully for potable reuse systems i presence of ozone and oh resistant compounds that are also not well removed during bac treatment ii formation of transformation products during ozonation of micropollutants which are not abated during bac treatment iii formation of oxidation byproducts from dissolved organic matter dom ozonation which are not removed in bac treatment iv bromate formation during ozonation of bromide which is often elevated in municipal wastewater effluent see below and v formation of precursors for disinfection byproduct during post chlorination fig 2 shows a summary of these different aspects some of these issues are the same as for enhanced wastewater treatment for ecological reasons however in the context of potable water reuse they become more critical i the occurrence of oxidant resistant compounds such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas makes this class of toxic compounds a problem not only in drinking water resources but also in wastewater effluents crone et al 2019 gallen et al 2018 due to their resistance against oxidation they are difficult to be abated by ozone and oh lutze et al 2018 and also limited removal efficiencies for activated carbon have been observed crone et al 2019 inyang and dickenson 2017 sun et al 2018 ii ozonation of micropollutants leads to the formation of transformation products which are not necessarily biodegradable gulde et al 2021a hübner et al 2015 fig 2 predictive tools have been developed to assess their formation and it has been demonstrated that several to tens of transformation products can be formed per compound lee et al 2017a this has also been confirmed by non target analysis for which a huge increase in features has been observed during ozonation and only a partial abatement during biological post filtration gulde et al 2021a gulde et al 2021b schollée et al 2018 it can be assumed that the primary biological effects of the target compounds are abated but it cannot be excluded that toxic compounds are formed which are more problematic than the target compounds however due to the low concentrations of the micropollutants it can be expected that the resulting toxicity will be minimal since only very few classes of organic compounds are still toxic at such low levels iii many of the oxygen rich compounds formed during ozonation of dom e g aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids are quite well biodegradable hammes et al 2006 van der kooij et al 1989 fig 2 in a recent study α β unsaturated carbonyl compounds were detected after wastewater ozonation marron et al 2020 such electrophilic compounds are problematic because they can bind to dna and proteins even though they are removed by about 90 in biological post treatment this class of compounds should be carefully monitored in potable water reuse systems iv so far in potable water reuse systems applying ozone there is only limited information on bromate formation hooper et al 2020 based on the experiences from enhanced wastewater treatment it can be expected that bromate will become a critical factor especially if ozonation is applied to inactivate protozoa or bacterial spores morrison et al submitted soltermann et al 2016 soltermann et al 2017 fig 2 however if ozonation is applied for the inactivation of viruses or vegetative bacteria significant disinfection credit can be achieved with limited bromate formation because of the high second order inactivation rate constants of such microorganisms hunt and marinas 1999 morrison et al submitted voumard et al submitted wolf et al 2018 v whereas ozonation alone may lead to an increase of the dbp precursors a combination of ozonation with biological treatment is effective in dbp precursor control chuang et al 2019 krasner 2009 sun et al 2018 fig 2 one case in point is nitromethane formation during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluent which then leads to the formation of trichloronitromethane during post chlorination shi and mccurry 2020 nitromethane formed during wastewater ozonation was subsequently found to persist through membrane and advanced oxidation processes but to be effectively removed by bac shi et al 2021 in addition to dbp concentrations a toxicity based approach has to be considered it has been shown that the combined effect of ozonation bac may lead to similar overall toxicity because of a shift to more toxic dbps chuang et al 2019 2 2 3 oxidation of micropollutants to reduce their discharge to water bodies ecosystem health with the development of the coupling of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry a new analytical window was established which allowed the measurement of more polar compounds and led to the discovery of a wide range of biologically active organic micropollutants in municipal wastewater snyder 2008 ternes 1998 these observations triggered environmental concerns and the ensuing ecological consequences were broadly investigated furthermore the potential for abatement of micropollutants from municipal wastewaters by various strategies was explored including membranes activated carbon and chemical oxidation which is the focus of this review fig 1 joss et al 2008 ternes and joss 2006 ternes et al 2004 in these studies several oxidation processes were investigated for enhanced wastewater treatment including ferrate vi lee et al 2009 chlorine dioxide huber et al 2005b uv h2o2 and ozone huber et al 2003 huber et al 2005a lee et al 2013 lee et al 2016a ternes et al 2003 wert et al 2009 and fe tetramido macrocyclic ligands taml h2o2 jans et al 2021 based on these studies and other information from literature ozonation was selected as the oxidation process of choice for enhanced wastewater treatment in switzerland and in other countries because of the broad spectrum of micropollutants which can be abated during ozonation domenjoud et al 2017 eggen et al 2014 gerrity et al 2012 hollender et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 lee et al 2013 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 miklos et al 2018 ternes et al 2003 ternes et al 2017 zimmermann et al 2011 this initiative triggered significant interest on the influence of oxidative treatment on biological effects of micropollutants and their transformation products prasse et al 2015 it was shown that biologically active compounds such as estrogens antibiotics antivirals and pesticides lost their primary target effects during ozonation and other aops in laboratory in vitro studies dodd et al 2009 huber et al 2004 lange et al 2006 lee et al 2008 mestankova et al 2011 mestankova et al 2012 during ozonation of real wastewaters in laboratory pilot and full scale studies mixed results were obtained with various toxicological endpoints such as the fish early life stage toxicity test the chironomid toxicity test the lumbriculus toxicity test the ceriodaphnia dubia toxicity test with mostly a reduction in toxicity but in some cases also an increase angeles et al 2020 escher et al 2009 magdeburg et al 2014 prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2010a stalter et al 2010b völker et al 2019 von gunten 2018 however biological post treatment by sand or activated carbon filtration led mostly to a significant reduction of the toxicity wherefore typically a biological post treatment step is implemented after ozonation of wastewater bourgin et al 2018 chys et al 2017b itzel et al 2020 knopp et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 this observation can most likely be explained by potentially eco toxic dbps such as aldehydes and ketones formed during ozonation of wastewater dom which are often easily biodegradable see above however potential for the formation of eco toxic transformation products from micropollutants exists as mentioned in section 2 2 2 schollée et al 2018 from a theoretical study and experimental results it is expected that mainly transformation products from olefins and aromatic compounds are biodegradable whereas products from nitrogen containing compounds are expected to be mostly persistent bourgin et al 2018 hübner et al 2015 zucker et al 2018 however often such a simplified approach is not justified gulde et al 2021b an additional benefit of biological post treatment is a significant abatement of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which is already present in the raw wastewater and or formed during ozonation bourgin et al 2018 krauss et al 2009 to assess the feasibility of ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents considering also toxicity test procedures including chemical and toxicological methods have been developed and applied itzel et al 2017 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 bromide levels in municipal wastewaters can be significantly higher than in drinking waters occasionally reaching levels of tens of mg l lee et al 2013 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 this may lead to significant bromate formation during ozonation of municipal wastewaters especially for specific ozone doses 0 5 go3 gdoc which are typical for enhanced wastewater treatment for micropollutant abatement soltermann et al 2016 soltermann et al 2017 under oxic conditions which are prevalent after ozonation bromate persists in biological post treatment see fig 2 and below 3 challenges in wastewater matrices and characterization of dom by surrogate parameters 3 1 water matrix differences between drinking water and wastewater ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluents entails some challenges which are not serious issues during drinking water treatment i higher concentrations and different types of dom ii potential presence of nitrite and iii higher and variable concentrations of bromide i as a consequence of the higher dom concentrations higher concentrations of ozone and oh are consumed by reactive dom sites and lead to higher concentrations of aoc bdoc and low molecular weight oxygen containing compounds aldehydes carboxylic acids marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 zimmermann et al 2011 because these compounds may lead to enhanced toxicity a biological post treatment is necessary for their removal prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2010b furthermore the concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen is typically much higher in secondary municipal wastewater effluent chon et al 2013 parkin and mccarty 1981 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 shon et al 2006 and may lead to nitro and nitroso moieties pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 shi and mccurry 2020 see below ii in secondary wastewater effluents which are not or incompletely nitrified elevated nitrite concentrations can be found since ozone reacts readily with nitrite k o3 3 7 105 m 1s 1 hoigné et al 1985 its presence leads to a stoichiometric consumption of ozone furthermore it has been shown that nitro compounds can be formed as side reactions during ozonation of nitrite containing waters hu et al 2010 manasfi et al in prep thibaud et al 1987 iii similar to drinking waters ozonation of bromide containing wastewaters leads to bromate formation bourgin et al 2018 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 wu et al 2019 compared to typical drinking waters the bromide concentrations in secondary wastewater effluents are more variable and can also be significantly higher this may be caused by discharge from industry municipal incineration plants fracking wastewaters seawater intrusion etc dong et al 2017 harkness et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 bromate is only removable under anaerobic conditions van ginkel et al 2005 which are unlikely during biological post treatment after ozonation nevertheless there are several options to minimize bromate formation during ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluent such as addition of hydrogen peroxide or a distributed dosing of ozone each of which entails certain limitations and needs to be tested on a case by case basis merle et al 2017 soltermann et al 2017 3 2 control of ozonation systems for enhanced municipal wastewater treatment compared to typical drinking water ozonation with ozone lifetimes in the range of tens of minutes the lifetime of ozone in municipal wastewater effluents is much smaller acero and von gunten 2001 buffle et al 2006b therefore ozone monitoring and control in drinking waters which is based on direct ozone concentration and decay measurements kaiser et al 2013 is not applicable to municipal wastewater for which specialized equipment such as stopped flow or quench flow is needed to monitor kinetics buffle et al 2006b due to this shortcoming and the lack of fast monitoring systems for micropollutants and microorganisms empirical methods have been developed which correlate the abatement of microorganisms or micropollutants to surrogate parameters it has been shown that the natural logarithm of the relative abatement of the uv absorption at 285 nm is correlated to the ozone exposure buffle et al 2006a since the ozone exposure is the relevant parameter for disinfection and oxidation this opens up the possibility to use uv absorption to assess the efficiency of wastewater ozonation in addition to uv changes in fluorescence have been tested as descriptors for micropollutant abatement during ozonation chys et al 2017a park et al 2017 a recently developed method to characterize the electron donor properties of the dom is the electron donating capacity edc see below table 1 summarizes selected studies in which surrogate parameters have been applied to predict micropollutant abatement and inactivation of microorganisms a detailed discussion of these proxies is provided in the sections below 3 2 1 characterization of dom and derived surrogate parameters dom plays a crucial role during ozonation in several ways i direct consumption of ozone ii acceleration of ozone decomposition by radical type chain reactions staehelin and hoigné 1985 iii formation of oxygenated disinfection byproducts hammes et al 2007 nawrocki et al 2003 van der kooij et al 1989 wert et al 2007 iv abatement or formation of precursors for the formation of disinfection byproducts during post disinfection fig 2 hoigné and bader 1988 hua and reckhow 2013 mccurry et al 2016 reckhow and singer 1984 reckhow et al 1986 wert and rosario ortiz 2011 and v changes in photochemical and photophysical dom properties leresche et al 2019 leresche et al 2021 to better understand the reactions of ozone with dom various dom characterization methods have been developed with surrogate parameters e g uv absorbance fluorescence excitation emission spectra molecular weight distributions relative intensities of different chemical shift regions in nmr edc table 1 rather than attempting to characterize individual moieties in highly heterogeneous mixtures beggs et al 2013 chen et al 2003 her et al 2003 lyon et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 in addition oxidative titration methods with chlorine chlorine dioxide and ozone have been developed to estimate the concentrations of oxidant reactive moieties in dom essaïed et al 2022 houska et al 2021 finally high resolution mass spectrometry can been applied to characterize molecular features of dom see below 3 2 2 specific uv absorption suva one of the first methods to characterize changes in dom upon ozonation is based on optical properties in particular uv measurements at various wavelengths and a derived parameter the specific uv absorbance suva which is the uv absorbance normalized to the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration the uv absorbance typically decreases during ozonation due to bleaching of the dom wenk et al 2013 this effect is caused by the oxidation of activated aromatic systems leading to moieties with lower uv absorbances other optical methods based on fluorescence measurements are also applied to characterize dom during ozonation gerrity et al 2012 swietlik and sikorska 2004 which allows a qualitative classification of dom moieties mckay et al 2018 3 2 3 electron donating capacity edc another tool for characterization of dom is based on its edc this can be measured by electrochemical or spectrophotometric methods aeschbacher et al 2010 önnby et al 2018b walpen et al 2020 walpen et al 2022 by the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazo line 6 sulphonate abts which can be produced electrochemically or by oxidation with chlorine aeschbacher et al 2010 önnby et al 2018b abts which absorbs light at various wavelengths in the visible range is reduced by reaction with electron donating moieties to abts which is non colored pinkernell et al 1997 the edc can be derived from the decoloration of abts and allows a semi quantitative determination of the availability of electrons which can be abstracted by oxidants such as ozone chlorine and chlorine dioxide wenk et al 2013 edc has also been shown in laboratory and full scale experiments with a continuous online system to be a useful proxy for the abatement of micropollutants and the formation of bromate during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents chon et al 2015 walpen et al 2022 furthermore it has been shown that the combination of uv and edc measurements can provide valuable insights into the dom functional groups which are oxidized and formed typically a more efficient decrease of the edc was observed compared to the uv absorbance önnby et al 2018a wenk et al 2013 this can be interpreted by the oxidation of phenolic moieties leading to quinone type and ring opening products which have a limited capacity to donate electrons to abts but might still have uv absorption properties mvula and von sonntag 2003 önnby et al 2018a ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 wenk et al 2013 3 2 4 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms recent increases in the accessibility of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms instruments including fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ft icr and bench top orbitrap instruments with mass resolution of up to 1 000 000 have led to molecular level characterization of natural organic matter nom rather than attempting to connect peaks on a mass spectrum to specific molecular structures these efforts generally make empirical formula assignments and draw conclusions based on those most commonly h c and o c ratios are compared in van krevelen diagrams andersson et al 2020 gonsior et al 2014 lavonen et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 to infer functional group abundances and degrees of oxidation and to calculate the number of double bond equivalents dbe in the molecules hrms has been applied to study the transformation of dom by ozone in nom isolates remucal et al 2020 these and reemtsma 2005 solid phase extracts from surface waters phungsai et al 2018 2019 and wastewaters phungsai et al 2016 such studies typically find several thousand molecular features i e mass spectral signals corresponding to putative molecules and infer information about dom composition and reactivity from trends in van krevelen diagrams and dbe changes as a function of ozonation and or advanced oxidation processes the strongest effect of ozone is to increase the o c ratio of molecular features by up to 35 at 1 3 mg o3 mg c in dom isolates remucal et al 2020 and by a factor of 3 5 at 2 5 mg o3 mg c in suwannee river fulvic acid these and reemtsma 2005 indicating oxygen transfer reactions in both the presence and absence of tert butanol pointing to a role for both ozone and oh fig 3 remucal et al 2020 double bond equivalents have been generally found to decrease slightly but not as strongly as uv signals phungsai et al 2018 remucal et al 2020 and h c ratios are largely unchanged or slightly increased phungsai et al 2018 remucal et al 2020 these and reemtsma 2005 consistent with ozonation of phenol type functional groups to highly oxygenated lower molecular weight products fig 3 among partially abated compounds those with lower h c ratios i e more aromatic favor reactions with ozone while those with high h c ratios i e more aliphatic favor oh reactions remucal et al 2020 finally oh has been shown to be a more potent initiator of decarboxylation reactions than ozone with loss of co2 seen from 3 5 more molecular features ozonated under oh promoting conditions than in the presence of a radical scavenger remucal et al 2020 3 2 5 use of multiple characterization methods because single methods are not suitable to fully characterize dom a combination of bulk techniques e g uv edc and hrms can be applied to get further insights into dom reactive moieties phungsai et al 2016 remucal et al 2020 fig 4 shows the change of various dom parameters for the ozonation of dom uv absorbance at 254 nm decreases strongly upon exposure to ozone but less so when oh formation is promoted likely due to the preference of ozone for attacking conjugated and aromatic functional groups that are also often chromophores whereas oh can react with the same functional groups through insertion reactions that might not lead to loss of uv absorbance fig 4 uv signal losses greatly exceed the degree of mineralization 10 measured as doc loss remucal et al 2020 edc and suva254 significantly decrease by ozone attack possibly by fragmentation of phenolic groups to ring opening products or oxidation of them to quinone type structures fig 4 while oh does not change edc significantly ozone and oh both modestly increase the oxygen carbon ratio of dom presumably through oxygen transfer and insertion reactions respectively neither ozone nor oh substantially affect the hydrogen carbon ratio fig 4 finally the number of double bond equivalents is modestly decreased by both ozone and oh likely due to loss of alkene and phenolic structures by reactions with ozone fig 4 and loss of double bonds to oh through addition reactions overall available evidence is consistent with the bulk of ozone reactive sites in dom being phenolic and that they react analogously to phenol with ozone leading to oxygen addition and a decrease in molecular weight fig 4 however reactions between ozone and other functional groups as well as reactions with oh likely make some contribution to these bulk phenomena as well 3 2 6 chemical derivatization chemical derivatization has long been used in environmental analytical chemistry such as derivatization of charged haloacetic acids to neutral methyl esters for analysis via gas chromatography domino et al 2003 and derivatization of small polar compounds such as dimethylamine to improve retention on hydrophobic stationary phases prior to liquid chromatography mitch et al 2003a however most applications to date have been to aid in targeted quantification of known compounds more recently progress has been made in using derivatization techniques often borrowed from the synthesis or biochemistry literature to characterize dom and its reactions with oxidants including ozone leading to unwanted byproducts in one example a derivatization reaction was used to block specific ozone reactive functional groups in water to establish the importance of compounds with those functional groups as dbp precursors a reaction used synthetically to protect primary and secondary amines addition of a tert butoxycarbonyl group with di tert butyl dicarbonate einhorn et al 1991 was applied to dom extracts prior to ozonation mccurry et al 2016 the resulting carbamates are much less reactive with ozone than the parent amine compounds which was demonstrated with control experiments using model amines post chlorination after ozone of derivatized dom formed 90 less chloropicrin than in controls establishing primary and or secondary amines as the principal chloropicrin precursors in water sequentially treated with ozone and chlorine a similar approach has been applied for chlorine titrations with and without derivatization of amines to quantify primary and secondary amine moieties in dom essaïed et al 2022 in a more recent study another derivatization reaction was applied to identify amines in water amines in dom extracted by spe were derivatized with either light ordinary or heavy deuterated isotopes of formaldehyde prior to analysis with hrms liu et al 2019 the mass difference between the heavy and light isotopes of the resulting derivatives 4 025 da was used to pinpoint amines among the noise of other compounds in the dom mass spectrum further because primary amines were dimethylated while secondary amines were monomethylated information about amine order could also be extracted from the mass spectra the authors used this technique to identify several dipeptides in water which were then confirmed with analytical standards liu et al 2019 derivatization was also applied to waters disinfected with chlorine chloramines or ozone to identify carbonyl containing compounds suwannee river fulvic acid was derivatized with a hydrazine compound which was either partially deuterated or unlabelled then analyzed via hrms to search for peaks showing characteristic mass differences as described above in liu et al 2019 prior to disinfection most identified compounds in dom before oxidation were polyoxygenated with between five and ten double bond equivalents and were proposed to be lignin type structures liu et al 2020 ozonation led to a greater disappearance of putative lignin structures than chlorine or chloramines liu et al 2020 consistent with selective reactivity toward activated aromatic compounds ozone increased the number of carbonyl containing products relative to controls whereas chlorine and chloramines led to their loss ozone tended to reduce the size of detected carbonyl compounds relative to controls consistent with molecular fragmentation e g via criegee type reactions liu et al 2020 in another study phenolic moieties in dom were derivatized with acetic anhydride to the phenylacetates the latter have a very low reactivity with chemical oxidants and this approach can be used to block phenolic moieties from reaction with e g ozone or chlorine dioxide houska et al 2021 even though this approach works well for synthetic chemicals only part of the electron rich sites could be derivatized potentially due to steric effects houska et al 2021 overall derivatization shows promise as a means of reducing the complexity of analyzing reactions between dom and oxidants by i allowing attribution of oxidation byproduct formation to specific precursor functional groups regardless of the identity of individual precursor molecules and ii adding characteristic functional group specific tags to oxidation reaction precursors and products to deconvolute their signals from analytical noise in complex matrices 4 ozone reaction kinetics and mechanisms 4 1 introduction 4 1 1 general kinetic considerations understanding reaction kinetics is important for predicting micropollutant abatement efficiency during ozonation process von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the abatement kinetics for a micropollutant mp results from the concurrent oxidation by ozone and oh formed from ozone decomposition reactions and can be formulated by the following integrated rate law eq 1 lee and von gunten 2016 1 ln mp t mp 0 k o 3 0 t o 3 dt k oh 0 t oh dt with k o3 and k oh as second order rate constants for the reactions of micropollutant with ozone and oh respectively and with 0 t o 3 dt and 0 t oh dt as ozone and oh exposures respectively lee and von gunten 2016 the oxidant exposure is experimentally determined for a given water matrix and for a specific ozone dose matrix components such as dom nitrite and carbonate significantly influence the stability of ozone and oh and thereby their exposures ozone and oh exposures have been determined for various types of wastewater e g municipal wastewater industrial wastewater landfill leachate and their correlations with the specific ozone doses normalized by doc concentration has been determined lee and von gunten 2016 wildhaber et al 2015 wolf et al 2019 based on this empirical model the micropollutant abatement for a specific ozone dose can be predicted compounds with k o3 higher than 103 m 1s 1 are considered to be well abated during ozonation for typical municipal wastewater with 80 abatement bourgin et al 2018 to determine the fraction of a micropollutant reacting with ozone or oh respectively the rct concept has been developed elovitz and von gunten 1999 it has been experimentally observed that the ratio of the oh and ozone exposures rct is constant for most of the duration of ozone decomposition elovitz and von gunten 1999 elovitz et al 2000a b eq 2 2 r c t 0 t oh dt 0 t o 3 dt 0 t oh dt r c t 0 t o 3 dt substituting 0 t oh dt in eq 1 by r c t 0 t o 3 dt yields a rate law for the abatement of a mp which only depends on the ozone exposure and the rct eq 3 3 ln mp t mp o k o 3 0 t o 3 dt k oh r c t 0 t o 3 dt 0 t o 3 dt k o 3 k oh r c t based on eq 3 the fraction of the oxidation occurring by reacting with oh can be calculated from eq 4 elovitz and von gunten 1999 4 f oh k oh r c t k oh r c t k o 3 the fraction of the mp reaction with oh as a function of the rct and for selected values of k o3 is shown in fig 5 elovitz and von gunten 1999 4 1 2 determination of reaction kinetics second order rate constants for the reactions of ozone with inorganic and organic compounds have been determined experimentally by directly monitoring the decrease of ozone or substrate over time under pseudo first order conditions or by using competition kinetics methods von sonntag and von gunten 2012 to date k o3 for several hundred organic and inorganic compounds have been compiled von sonntag and von gunten 2012 based on this wealth of information regression models employing quantitative structure activity relationships qsar have been developed to predict unknown k o3 for target compounds lee et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2012 sudhakaran and amy 2013 hammett and taft constants are common molecular descriptors which showed reliable prediction results for diverse ozone reactive functional groups lee and von gunten 2012 however empirical parameters such as hammett and taft constants are not always available to overcome this limitation quantum chemically computed molecular descriptors such as orbital energies or average local ionization energies have been assessed showing promising results see fig 8 and ensuing discussion lee et al 2015 tentscher et al 2019 an in silico pathway prediction tool has been developed which includes a module for quantum chemically based prediction of k o3 for target compounds lee et al 2017a the current computed descriptors also have certain caveats e g failing to account for steric effects tentscher et al 2019 and an effort for building better qsar models should be continued a multivariate model containing complementary quantum chemical variables may enhance the model performance additionally ab initio calculations of barrier height δg could be alternative qsar variables which have been successfully applied for predicting k oh minakata and crittenden 2011 however for ozone reactions ab initio calculations suffer from serious uncertainties of up to 5 orders of magnitude trogolo et al 2015 the cause and possible solutions of this issue are worthy of further investigations as an electrophilic agent ozone attacks moieties with high electron density thus any modifications that alter the electron density of the moieties change their ozone reactivity typical examples are dissociating compounds when protonated a dissociating compound has a much lower k o3 than when deprotonated because the electrons of the dissociating center are shared with the proton and less available for ozone see e g aliphatic amines in section 4 5 the protonation can also decrease the electron density inductively or by prohibiting resonance structures available to the deprotonated molecule e g phenolic compounds in section 4 3 another example is compounds substituted by electron donating withdrawing groups typically electron donating groups such as alkyl groups increase k o3 whereas electron withdrawing groups like carbonyl groups decrease k o3 e g olefins with various substituents in section 4 2 an exception exists for heterocyclic compounds some of which have higher k o3 with the addition of carbonyl groups to the ring than without section 4 4 substitution with electron withdrawing groups can result in an increased apparent k o3 at circumneutral ph k o3 app ph7 for dissociating compounds bearing a pk a in the alkaline ph range e g phenolic compounds in section 4 3 4 1 3 transformation products and reaction mechanisms over the last few decades many studies have investigated transformation products formed during ozonation and elucidated ozone reaction mechanisms the principal ozone reaction mechanisms and the corresponding products are summarized in scheme 1 the reaction type i is a carbon carbon double bond cleavage based on the well known criegee mechanism criegee 1975 an ozone molecule is added to a double bond to create an ozonide as a key intermediate which subsequently degrades into carbonyl products this type of reaction is also observed during the reaction of aromatic heterocyclic compounds with ozone opening the ring structure and forming aliphatic products with carbonyl groups aromatic and heterocyclic compounds also undergo reaction type ii leading to the oxygen added ring products via radical intermediates von sonntag and von gunten 2012 reaction types iii and iv show oxygen transfer to the heteroatoms nitrogen and sulfur respectively resulting in the corresponding n oxygenated and s oxygenated products von sonntag and von gunten 2012 nitrogen containing compounds can also react with ozone via electron transfer forming an aminyl radical cation and subsequently a dealkylated amine as shown by reaction type v von sonntag and von gunten 2012 each reaction type is also characterized by the formation of distinct reactive oxygen species for example hydrogen peroxide singlet oxygen and oh are known as byproducts for the criegee mechanism i o addition to heteroatoms iii iv and n c bond cleavage v respectively leitzke and von sonntag 2009 muñoz et al 2001 von gunten 2003b thus identifying quantifying reactive oxygen species can provide additional evidence for certain reaction pathways alternatively reaction mechanisms can be explored by quantum chemical computations an increasing number of studies employs quantum chemical computations to corroborate experimental findings quantum chemical computations can predict initial reaction sites in a given molecular structure by computing molecular descriptors such as orbital energies or assess the thermodynamic feasibility of a proposed reaction mechanism by computing the gibbs free energy tentscher et al 2019 in addition quantum chemical computations can provide insights related to unstable reaction intermediates which escape experimental identification a case in point is the formation of ndma during ozonation of bromide and dimethylsulfamide containing waters for which a detailed mechanism has been proposed based on experimental evidence and quantum chemical computations trogolo et al 2015 in sections 4 2 to 4 9 ozone reaction kinetics and mechanisms are discussed on the basis of ozone reactive functional groups direct ozone reactions are the main focus for most reaction mechanisms as the role of oh is minimal for the first generation transformation products for compounds with high ozone reactivity fig 5 the majority of the recent findings in product analyses were obtained by hrms to discuss hrms results in a clear manner the confidence level system from level 1 to 5 defined by schymanski et al 2014 is employed briefly confidence level 1 indicates a confirmed structure with a reference standard level 2 indicates a probable structure by e g a ms library match level 3 provides some structural information by ms data and compound class level 4 provides an unequivocal molecular formula and level 5 provides an exact mass 4 2 olefins and alkynes olefins are well known ozone reactive functional groups in the 1970s rudolf criegee revealed the key mechanism of the reaction of olefins with ozone characterized by a cycloaddition of ozone to a carbon carbon double bond to form carbonyl compounds as final products via ozonide as a cyclic intermediate reaction type i in scheme 1 criegee 1975 on the basis of this landmark study olefin ozone reactions have been extensively studied in organic solvents and later on the knowledge has been transferred to aqueous solutions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this section focuses on recent findings on k o3 and summarizes briefly the olefin ozone reaction mechanisms and ozonation products of aliphatic olefins cyclic olefins or olefin moieties included in aromatic rings are discussed in separate sections 4 3 aromatic compounds and 4 4 heterocyclic compounds 4 2 1 kinetics 4 2 1 1 kinetics of alkene ozone reactions unsubstituted olefins react fast with ozone with k o3 of approximately 105 m 1s 1 e g ethene k o3 1 8 105 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 in contrast substituted olefins have a wide range of k o3 from 101 to 106 m 1s 1 table s1 supporting information si depending on the nature of the substituents von sonntag and von gunten 2012 fig 6 addition of electron donating alkyl groups increases k o3 e g propene k o3 8 0 105 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 but the magnitude of this effect is generally smaller than for electron withdrawing groups as shown in fig 6 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 this is consistent with induction effects anslyn and dougherty 2006 olefins with multiple electron withdrawing substituents exhibit further decrease in reactivity e g trichloroethene k o3 14 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 tetrachloroethene k o3 0 1 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983b such additive effects of electron withdrawing groups on k o3 were also found in a study on polychloro 1 3 butadienes e g tetrachloro 1 3 butadienes k o3 1 6 102 7 8 103 m 1s 1 pentachloro 1 3 butadienes k o3 0 8 and 10 m 1s 1 and hexachloro 1 3 butadiene k o3 0 1 m 1s 1 lee et al 2017b differences in k o3 also exist among the olefins substituted by the same number of electron withdrawing groups but in different positions i e stereoisomers examples are cis 1 2 dichloroethene k o3 5 4 102 m 1s 1 vs trans 1 2 dichloroethene k o3 6 5 103 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 and e 1 1 3 4 tetrachlorobutadiene k o3 1 1 103 m 1s 1 vs z 1 1 3 4 tetrachlorobutadiene k o3 4 0 102 m 1s 1 lee et al 2017b these significant differences in ozone reactivity between seemingly similar compounds may be explained by the geometry of the transition state in the rate limiting step based on the reaction mechanism discussed in section 4 2 2 the rate limiting step of the ozonolysis reaction likely requires the sp2 carbon s in the double bond to rehybridize to sp3 resulting in a decrease of the c cl or c c bond angle from 120 planar geometry to 109 5 tetrahedral geometry this geometry brings the substituents in the cis position closer to each other and if both substituents are bulky chlorines rather than one chlorine and one methyl group repulsion between these two chlorines in the transition state may potentially explain the lower k o3 observed from the cis isomer of 1 2 dichloroethene besides the induction effects from electron donating withdrawing groups steric effects from bulky substituents can also affect k o3 an example is cis 1 2 dichloroethene k o3 5 4 102 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 vs endrin k o3 0 02 m 1s 1 yao and haag 1991 endrin also has a cis 1 2 dichloroethene moiety but the ozone attack is hindered by the presence of the neighboring chlorinated carbons resulting in a much lower k o3 yao and haag 1991 4 2 1 2 kinetics of alkyne ozone reactions alkynes can react with ozone through a similar reaction mechanism as olefins but with generally lower k o3 for example the k o3 for the reaction of 1 ethinyl 1 cyclohexanol with ozone k o3 2 0 102 m 1s 1 huber et al 2004 is much lower than for buten 3 ol k o3 7 9 104 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 both of which feature the reactive moiety geminal to a substituted alcohol to date there is lack of information on ozonation kinetics of alkynes to make further generalizations about their reactivity 4 2 2 reaction mechanisms the predominant pathway for the reaction of olefins with ozone is through pathway i in scheme 2 in which the first zwitterion a formed in aqueous solutions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 leads to an ozonide b which subsequently forms a second zwitterion c or decomposes via a concerted reaction to the third zwitterion d and a carbonyl product zwitterion d is the branching point where aqueous reactions deviate from reactions in organic solvents in aprotic solvents the zwitterion d recombines with the carbonyl product to produce a criegee ozonide e criegee 1975 in water the zwitterion d rapidly hydrates to α hydroxyalkylhydroperoxide f which reversibly dissociates to hydrogen peroxide and the second carbonyl product complete mass balances were achieved by the corresponding carbonyl products for the reactions of ozone with simple olefins like ethene and propene dowideit and von sonntag 1998 there are minor pathways leading to the formation of partial cleavage products from zwitterion a such as a carbonyl product g a glycol h and an epoxide i all of which contain the two initial olefin carbons still linked by a single bond after ozonation partial cleavage products were observed in early studies in organic solvents typically for sterically hindered compounds like 3 3 dimethyl 2 tert butyl butene and 3 3 dimethyl 2 isoproyl butene in methylene chloride bailey and lane 1967 and 1 1 2 trichloro 1 2 2 trifluoroethene in dichloromethane agopovich and gillies 1980 keay and hamilton 1976 dichloroacetaldehyde was identified as a minor product from ozonating dichloroethane scheme 2 ii dowideit and von sonntag 1998 glycol and carbonyl compounds with two carbon atoms linked were quantified in aqueous ozone reactions from tetramethylethene dichloroethenes and trichloroethene with yields 15 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 scheme 2 iii epoxides were suggested as intermediates in aqueous ozone reactions mostly for olefin moieties in aromatic heteroaromatic compounds but with limited experimental evidence see section 4 2 3 4 2 3 micropollutants many ozone reactive micropollutants in water feature olefin functional groups some important taste and odor compounds in drinking water contain an olefin moiety they can be quickly inactivated during ozonation because of their high k o3 for the reactions with ozone table s1 si examples are 3 hexen 1 ol k o3 5 4 105 m 1s 1 β ionone k o3 1 6 105 m 1s 1 2 6 nonadienal k o3 8 7 105 m 1s 1 and 1 penten 3 ol k o3 5 9 104 m 1s 1 peter and von gunten 2007 microcystins are a class of compounds with multiple ozone reactive sites the olefin moieties are the main ozone reaction sites for most microcystins except the ones with tyrosine and tryptophan substituents mc yr and mc lw respectively kim and lee 2019 onstad et al 2007 as a result primary ozonation products of mc yr and mc lw are likely to contain undamaged olefins and to retain toxicity for small specific ozone doses note that the conjugated olefins of the base structure of microcystins are responsible for hepatotoxicity kim and lee 2019 see section 4 9 for more discussions on compounds with multiple reaction sites the ozone reactions of natural olefinic compounds have also been investigated in the aqueous phase of the atmosphere such as clouds and fogs examples are β caryophyllonic acid k o3 app 4 8 105 m 1s 1 at ph 2 witkowski et al 2019 limononic acid k o3 app 4 2 105 m 1s 1 at ph 2 witkowski et al 2018 and α terpineol k o3 9 9 106 m 1s 1 in the absence of radical scavenger leviss et al 2016 full mineralization of micropollutants is typically not achieved during ozonation olefin containing micropollutants react with ozone leading to the formation of transformation products through pathways listed in scheme 2 the chemical structures of the major transformation products from ozone reactions of selected olefin type micropollutants are provided in table s2 si ozonation of micropollutants containing an olefin moiety such as imazalil genena et al 2011 octinoxate hopkins et al 2017 tamoxifen and toremifene knoop et al 2018 and carbamazepine hübner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 follow the predominant pathway scheme 2 i because there is no steric hindrance on the olefin group this leads to the formation of expected carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes and ketones keto limononic acid was semi quantified by lc ms with a surrogate standard 30 yield after ozonation of limononic acid witkowski et al 2019 for ozonation of α terpineol more than 90 of a primary aldehyde product was expected based on the yields of the subsequent products trans and cis lactol by rearrangement of the aldehyde quantified by nmr leviss et al 2016 for micropollutants containing olefin moieties that are less accessible hindering formation of the initial ozonide such as carotenoids henry et al 2000 acyclovir prasse et al 2012 acetamidoantipyrine favier et al 2015 carbamazepine hübner et al 2014 and tetracycline khan et al 2010 partial cleavage products such as glycol or epoxides have been suggested to be formed scheme 2 iv table s2 si however these reports were based on confidence level 2b by diagnostic evidence and there is no direct confirmation with reference standards of epoxide formation in aqueous ozone reactions alkyne containing micropollutants react with ozone through a mechanism analogous to criegee ozonation of alkenes without any bulky substituent groups nearby complete cleavage products including ketones and carboxylic acids are formed huber et al 2004 4 3 aromatic compounds 4 3 1 kinetics aromatic compounds react with ozone with a large range of second order rate constants k o3 app 0 1 to 109 m 1s 1 basic structures and recently reported examples in table s3 si depending on the substituents unsubstituted arenes react with ozone slowly e g benzene k o3 2 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983b electron donating alkyl substituents modestly increase k o3 e g 14 m 1s 1 for toluene hoigné and bader 1983b as with olefins electron withdrawing substituents reduce k o3 e g 0 57 m 1s 1 for 1 3 dichlorobenzene hoigné and bader 1983b ring substituents featuring lone pairs of electrons which can delocalize into the ring somewhat increase k o3 e g 2 9 102 m 1s 1 for methoxybenzene hoigné and bader 1983b one exceptional class are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which have significantly higher k o3 than benzene or alkylbenzenes e g 3 103 m 1s 1 for naphthalene hoigné and bader 1983b for reasons which have never been fully elucidated phenol and phenol derived compounds have high k o3 table s3 si even in a wastewater matrix with strong scavenging of ozone phenolic compounds can be abated to a large extent by ozone at relatively low specific ozone doses chedeville et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 the apparent k o3 for the reaction of phenol with ozone increases with increasing ph because of greater electron density of phenolate than phenol due to the delocalization of phenolate electron lone pair into the ring the k o3 is 1 3 103 m 1s 1 for phenol which is 6 orders of magnitude lower than for phenolate 1 4 109 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a this corresponds to a half life of 12 s at ph 2 and 10 μs at ph 12 for an ozone concentration of 2 mg l the pk a of phenol and phenol derivatives is a critical parameter for determining k o3 app the apparent second order rate constant at a given ph it is influenced by electron withdrawing or donating groups on the ring for example substitution by halogen or nitro groups decreases the pk a of the hydroxyl group e g the pk a of dibromo phenol is 6 67 serjeant and dempsey 1979 compared to 9 98 for phenol gross and seybold 2001 the k o3 app for the reactions of phenols at different ph can be expressed as eq 5 5 k o 3 a p p k o 3 p h e n o l a t e k a k a h k o 3 p h e n o l h k a h where k a is the acid dissociation constant for a pk a decrease the apparent second order rate constant increases at a given ph even though electron withdrawing groups such as halogens will reduce the electron density of the substituted phenolate relative to the unsubstituted phenolate the net effect can be an increased reactivity at neutral ph the tradeoff effect can be observed by comparing the k o3 app of phenol pk a 9 98 4 chlorophenol pk a 9 2 and 4 nitrophenol pk a 7 2 as a function of ph fig 7 for substituted phenols with lower pk a than the pk a of phenol the k o3 app can be higher at neutral ph than for phenol while at low or high ph the k o3 app are lower a similar trend in k o3 app at neutral ph is observed for substituted nitrogen containing compounds discussed in section 4 6 fig 12 the ozone reactivity of anilines is also influenced by pk a and given ph conditions aniline pk a of conjugate acid 4 6 reacts readily with ozone k o3 app 1 4 107 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 but under acidic conditions the positively charged anilinium has a significantly lower ozone reactivity k o3 app 5 9 104 m 1s 1 at ph 1 5 hoigné and bader 1983a pierpoint et al 2001 because the nitrogen lone pair is unable to delocalize into the ring when protonated substituted anilines have a range of k o3 values depending on the ring substituents table s3 within approximately two orders of magnitude pierpoint et al 2001 tekle röttering et al 2016c qsar methods have been applied to predict k o3 for aromatic compounds based on empirically determined hammett and taft constants lee and von gunten 2012 and quantum chemically computed energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo lee et al 2015 tentscher et al 2019 other tested descriptors include the number of bonds dipole moment partial charge distribution and 3d configuration of the molecule cheng et al 2018 huang et al 2020 jiang et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 in fig 8 k o3 for aromatic compounds are plotted as a function of the e homo tentscher et al 2019 it shows an overall good correlation for various types of aromatic compounds suggesting e homo as a promising quantum molecular descriptor for aromatic ring systems generally for aromatic compounds the predicted k o3 based on both e homo and hammett and taft constants agree well with the experimentally determined k o3 within a factor of 4 lee et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2012 4 3 2 reaction mechanisms the three major pathways for oxidation of aromatic compounds by ozone are oxygen addition electron transfer and the criegee type mechanism scheme 3 of these the most common reaction is oxygen addition to the ring reaction type ii in scheme 1 and pathway i in scheme 3 for activated aromatic compounds with high k o3 e g phenols ozone adduct formation occurs in ortho para position which has an elevated electron density the ozone adduct can then lose singlet oxygen and form a hydroxylated product scheme 3 i mvula and von sonntag 2003 hydroquinones and catechol are the major products through this pathway for phenolate mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 for aniline the major products are p hydroxyaniline and o hydroxyaniline with the sum of all hydroxyanilines accounting for 40 of the initial aniline tekle röttering et al 2016c the second pathway is electron transfer scheme 3 ii it is unclear if this occurs via an ozone adduct formation or a direct electron transfer phenolate reacts with ozone to phenoxyl radical that can further react to benzoquinone ramseier and von gunten 2009 the coupling product 4 4 dihydroxybiphenyl is an artefact of high phenol concentrations in laboratory experiments similar dimerization products were hypothesized from aniline such as 2 amino 5 anilino benzochinon anil and 2 5 dianilino p benzochinon imin which are only expected at high initial concentrations of aniline tekle röttering et al 2016c finally aromatic compounds can react through a criegee type mechanism scheme 3 iii producing ring opening products such as muconic acid ramseier and von gunten 2009 similar products were also observed from the ozone reaction with anisole 1 2 dimethoxybenzene and 1 3 5 trimethpxylbenzene mvula et al 2009 2 pyridine carboxylic acid is a criegee type product detected from ozone reactions with aniline sarasa et al 2002 however it cannot be confirmed that ozone is responsible for its formation because oh was not scavenged in this study for aniline type compounds the sites of ozone attack can also be the nitrogen producing nitrosobenzene nitrobenzene azobenzene and azoxybenzene as products chan and larson 1991 sarasa et al 2002 but these reactions are minor based on the observed low yields 8 tekle röttering et al 2016c ozonation of nitrogen containing compounds will be further discussed in sections 4 5 and 4 6 ring substitution can affect the final products from the reactions of phenol with ozone in a systematic study of phenol substituent effects on product distribution para substituted catechols were found to be the most common products at ph 7 quantified from ozonation of para substituted phenols tentscher et al 2018 but with no obvious trend in their yields with respect to substitution somewhat surprisingly many para substituted phenols formed 1 4 benzoquinone indicating loss of the substituent group during ozonation tentscher et al 2018 quinones have been previously observed as products of chlorophenol ozonation hong and zeng 2002 qiu et al 2004 tentscher et al 2018 utsumi et al 1998 and the dechlorination achieved by ozone tentscher et al 2018 may increase the biodegradability adams et al 1997 hong and zeng 2002 pi et al 2007 qiu et al 2004 utsumi et al 1998 for two para alkylated phenols formation of the corresponding 4 hydroxy 4 alkylcyclohexadienone was observed but not for any other phenols possibly due to the poor leaving group properties of the alkyl substituents preventing further transformation to benzoquinones hydroquinones were only detected as ozonation products from 4 methoxyphenol mequinol and 4 formylphenol and were attributed to reactions other than direct attack by ozone tentscher et al 2018 4 3 3 micropollutants micropollutants and biomolecules bearing aromatic moieties generally react with ozone to produce hydroxylated and or ring opening products analogously to scheme 3 because many of the hydroxylated moieties have higher ozone reactivities than the parent compounds these primary products often escape detection gulde et al 2021a reported ozone induced transformation products of aromatic micropollutants are provided in table s4 si hydroxylated products such as hydroquinone and catechols are expected products of micropollutants scheme 3 i for 17α ethinylestradiol estrone and 5 6 7 8 tetrahydro 2 naphthol ozone was proposed to attack the phenolic moieties to form catechols by an oxygen transfer huber et al 2004 lee et al 2008 benzoquinone formation results from an electron transfer pathway scheme 3 ii ozonation of bisphenol a a widely used industrial chemical forms benzoquinone as the main product along with 3 cyclohexene 1 carboxylic acid ethyl ester and benzaldehyde deborde et al 2008 mutseyekwa et al 2017 the formation of benzoquinones may be of toxicological relevance tentscher et al 2021 one case in point is ozonation of n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n phenyl p phenylenediamine a widely applied tire antiozonant forming a quinone product highly toxic to aquatic organisms tian et al 2021 many ring opening products are expected from ozone reactions with aromatic compounds such as muconic acid or muconic aldehyde scheme 3 iii which can potentially explain dicarbonyl compound formation it has been shown that triazole 4 5 dicarbaldehyde is a product from the ozone attack of benzotriazole mawhinney et al 2012 formation of a dicarbonyl compound was reported from the ozone reaction with bezafibrate dantas et al 2007 when ozone is in excess further oxidation of the muconic type compounds is expected to form small carbonyl species and carboxylic acids such as formic acid ramseier and von gunten 2009 the final products of the ozone oxidation of benzophenone 2 a common photo inhibitor include oxalic acid and formic acid wang et al 2017 these polar and low molecular weight compounds may escape detection for analysis with solid phase extraction and lc hrms ms gulde et al 2021a 4 4 heterocyclic compounds heterocyclic compounds are an important class of functional groups in micropollutants as well as in dom they usually consist of five membered six membered or fused rings and include at least one heteroatom e g n o s in the ring for n containing heterocyclic compounds only unsaturated compounds are discussed in this section the reactions of n containing saturated heterocyclic compounds with ozone are similar to aliphatic amines their acyclic analogues tekle röttering et al 2016a aromatic rings without heteroatoms are discussed in the section 4 3 4 4 1 kinetics heterocyclic compounds are characterized by extraordinarily diverse chemical properties and therefore undergo a wide range of reaction types some react readily with electrophiles while others do not joule and mills 2012 their reactivity with ozone varies widely with reported k o3 from 0 1 m 1s 1 to 108 m 1s 1 table s5 si 4 4 1 1 n containing heterocyclic compounds six membered n containing heterocyclic compounds like pyridine and pyrazine react slowly with ozone with k o3 3 m 1s 1 tekle röttering et al 2016b whereas five membered rings such as pyrrole and imidazole react much faster with ozone with k o3 105 m 1s 1 tekle röttering et al 2020 the surprisingly large difference in k o3 between six and five membered heterocycles seems attributable to the electron distribution in the rings in pyridine resonance withdraws electron density from carbons to the nitrogen fig 9 as a result pyridine carbons become π deficient and thus less reactive towards ozone resonance in pyrrole works in the opposite way pushing the electron density from the nitrogen towards carbons making carbon carbon double bonds more susceptible to an electrophilic ozone attack heterocycles consist often of complex structures with diverse substituents effects of substituents on k o3 for selected heterocyclic compounds are shown in fig 10 i pyrimidine and ii purine derivatives the addition of a carbonyl or an amino group to the pyrimidine or purine significantly increases k o3 all derivatives have higher k o3 than the simple heterocycles by up to 7 orders of magnitude pyrimidine vs 2 4 diamine 5 methylpyrimidine iii pyrrole diazole derivatives unlike pyrimidines and purines pyrrole and imidazole derivatives with a carbonyl or amino group show lower k o3 imidazole vs creatinine for pyrazole derivatives k o3 seems to increase by a carbonyl group pyrazole vs phenazone as for pyrimidines and purines but the benzene ring on a nitrogen of phenazone may also contribute to the increase in k o3 to confirm this it is necessary to compare pyrazole with pyrazole derivatives substituted only by a carbonyl group however kinetic information of such derivatives is currently not available the higher k o3 of uracil than for pyrimidine is especially interesting as the substitution by an electron withdrawing carbonyl group is expected to reduce the ozone reactivity one way to explain these unusual cases with carbonyl substituents is by their resonance structures fig 9 while pyridine lacks in electron density in the ring as discussed above a 1h pyridin 2 one pyridine with a carbonyl substituent develops a higher negative charge on the ring by resonance suggesting a possibly higher k o3 4 4 1 2 o containing heterocyclic compounds generally there is little information on the ozone reactivity of heterocyclic compounds containing heteroatoms other than nitrogen furans five membered heterocyclic rings containing oxygen show high reactivity towards ozone with k o3 app ph 7 104 m 1s 1 table s5 si jeon et al 2016 zoumpouli et al 2021 depending on the type of substituents e g methyl carboxyl groups and their locations on the ring e g α β carbons the k o3 app ph7 varied from 8 5 104 m 1s 1 for furan 2 5 dicarboxylic acid to 3 2 106 m 1s 1 for 3 2 furyl propanoic acid zoumpouli et al 2021 4 4 2 reaction mechanisms heterocyclic compounds react with ozone by various types of mechanisms mostly by reaction type i in scheme 1 which opens the ring by carbon carbon double bond cleavage criegee type mechanism as a result ring opened primary products with two carbonyl groups on each end are formed the ring opened products undergo subsequent reactions sub categorized as i a i b and i c in scheme 4 they are subject to further transformation by ozone to form secondary products with typically a shorter chain length i a examples of such secondary products are quinolinic acid from quinoline with 65 yield andreozzi et al 1992b and glyoxal from pyrrole with 5 yield tekle röttering et al 2020 in a rarer case ring opened products are fully fragmented without further oxidation i b a case in point is imidazole which is transformed to formamide cyanate and formate with 100 yields respectively by a single ozone attack tekle röttering et al 2020 ring opened products are also susceptible to an intramolecular cyclization i c this results in the formation of products with smaller ring size as the parent heterocyclic compounds for example hydantoins with a five membered ring were identified after the reactions of ozone with six membered heterocyclic compounds like uracil matsui et al 1990 and thymine flyunt et al 2002 at yields of 30 although it is unclear whether these products resulted from direct ozone reactions because of lack of information on the use of radical scavengers similar ring products with reduced size were also identified in more controlled experiments in the presence of tert butanol for 2 hydroxypyridine andreozzi et al 1992a and thymidine confidence level 3 funke et al 2021 the reaction type i was also suggested for reactions of furans with ozone based on the formation of ring opened products α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds zoumpouli et al 2021 however the products were identified in absence of radical scavengers therefore experimental evidence under more controlled conditions is required to confirm the proposed mechanism of the furan ozone reaction some heterocyclic compounds react with ozone via reaction type ii scheme 1 and scheme 4 in analogy to typical reactions of aromatic compounds with ozone section 4 3 2 in this case oxygen added ring products with the same ring structure as the parent heterocycle are formed the formation of maleimide 34 yield from the reaction of pyrrole with ozone supports an oxygen addition mechanism tekle röttering et al 2020 another ring product structurally close to maleimide called tp2 in the original study was also identified but with unknown yield one heterocyclic compound can react through multiple reaction types as for pyrrole which reacts with ozone via reaction types i and ii in scheme 4 tekle röttering et al 2020 ozone attack on the heteroatom instead of a carbon carbon double bond is rarely reported during ozonation of heterocyclic compounds scheme 4 iii pyridine and pyridazine are transformed to n oxides with yields of 93 andreozzi et al 1991 tekle röttering et al 2016b this n oxide formation is similar to reactions of tertiary amines with ozone as illustrated in reaction type iii in scheme 1 nevertheless high yields of n oxides from heterocycles are unlikely under realistic ozonation conditions because of the low ozone reactivity of pyridine and pyridazine k o3 2 m 1s 1 for both tekle röttering et al 2016b such ozone refractory compounds are mainly oxidized by oh fig 5 which consequently leads to a different spectrum of transformation products during ozonation in absence of tert butanol oh reaction possible pyridine was transformed to ring opened products like formamido oxo acetic acid and oxamic acid andreozzi et al 1991 4 4 3 micropollutants micropollutants often contain heterocyclic moieties which are the main site of ozone attack acesulfame is attacked on the carbon carbon double bond in the ring to form ring opened products susceptible to further oxidation as described in i a in scheme 4 the resulting products are a hydrated form of a carbonyl product and carboxylic acid with 50 and 80 yields respectively scheurer et al 2012 phenazone derivatives favier et al 2015 and benzotriazole mawhinney et al 2012 were also reported to form ring opened products upon ozonation with sufficient ms evidences confidence level 2 but with unknown yields furosemide and ranitidine both of which feature a furan moiety were also suggested to be oxidized at a carbon carbon double bond of furan to form the corresponding ring opened products based on ms results confidence level 2 zoumpouli et al 2021 caffeine was found to be oxidized by ozone to form five and six membered ring products with 20 30 yields resulting from the intramolecular cyclization of an initial ring opened product i c in scheme 4 kolonko et al 1979 in this study however ozonation experiments were conducted in absence of oh scavengers and thus an impact of oh cannot be excluded kolonko et al 1979 carboxy acyclovir containing a purine moiety was attacked by ozone at the carbon carbon double bond shared by the fused six and five membered rings prasse et al 2012 the resulting ozonide intermediate underwent rearrangement of the ring and hydrolyzed to form a final product containing a five membered ring with 100 yield similar to i c in scheme 4 prasse et al 2012 zidovudine a thymidine derivative reacted with ozone at the carbon carbon double bond of the thymine moiety ring opened products via i a as well as ring products by rearrangement via i c were proposed by ms analyses confidence level 3 funke et al 2021 lamotrigine containing a 1 2 4 triazine moiety was oxidized by ozone at the nitrogen to form a n oxide iii in scheme 4 which underwent subsequent oxidation bollmann et al 2016 4 5 aliphatic amines 4 5 1 kinetics aliphatic amines are present in natural waters as part of the dissolved organic nitrogen pool westerhoff and mash 2002 they are also common functional groups of micropollutants bourgin et al 2018 the lone electron pair on the nitrogen of aliphatic amines is susceptible to an electrophilic attack by ozone as a result aliphatic amines in the neutral form react fast with ozone with k o3 ranging from 103 to 108 m 1s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 because of this high ozone reactivity aliphatic amines are considered key ozone reactive moieties at neutral ph aliphatic amines are mostly present in the protonated form because the pk a of the protonated form of aliphatic amines typically lies in the range of 9 11 amines in their protonated form have low reactivities with ozone k o3 0 1 m 1s 1 due to the lack of a lone electron pair hoigné and bader 1983a consequently apparent second order rate constants at ph 7 k o3 app ph7 decrease by 3 4 orders of magnitude relative to k o3 of the neutral form resulting in typical k o3 app ph7 values of 10 to 103 m 1s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the ozone reactivity of aliphatic amines is affected by the nature of substituents that can increase or decrease the electron density of the nitrogen for example an alkyl substituent generally increases ozone reactivity by inductive effects therefore tertiary amines typically have higher second order rate constants for the reaction with ozone than primary and secondary amines von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in contrast amides are practically unreactive towards ozone due to the presence of the electron withdrawing carbonyl group halogen substituents typically decrease the ozone reactivity by an electron withdrawing effect as is shown for methylamine k o3 1 105 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a methylchloramine k o3 8 1 102 m 1s 1 haag and hoigné 1983a and dichloromethylamine k o3 1 10 2 m 1s 1 haag and hoigné 1983a however exceptional cases exist as for monochloramine k o3 26 m 1s 1 haag and hoigné 1983a and monobromamine k o3 40 m 1s 1 haag et al 1984 in comparison to ammonia k o3 20 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a the reason why the electron withdrawing effect by halogens is not as pronounced as expected is not clear in the case of dimethylsulfamide dms the effect of halogenation is even more pronounced for the reactions of dms and br dms with ozone k o3 app 20 m 1s 1 and k o3 app 5 103 m 1s 1 were determined at ph 8 respectively by kinetic modeling of experimental data von gunten et al 2010 this is due to a depression of the pk a of br dms which results in a partially deprotonated amine moiety more aliphatic amine derivatives containing substituents other than alkyl and carbonyl groups are discussed in section 4 6 4 5 2 reaction mechanisms ozonation of tertiary amines has been studied extensively n oxides were identified as major products with high yields 90 for simple tertiary amines with short alkyl chains and micropollutants containing a tertiary amine moiety von sonntag and von gunten 2012 scheme 5 and reaction type iii in scheme 1 besides n oxides dealkylated products were also identified from the reaction of tertiary amines with ozone but as minor products with yields 10 lange et al 2006 lim et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2012 while n oxides are products formed via an oxygen transfer pathway dealkylated products result from an electron transfer pathway involving an amine radical cation as a reaction intermediate von sonntag and von gunten 2012 reaction type v in scheme 1 the mechanisms of the reactions of primary and secondary amines with ozone have also been investigated de vera et al 2017 essaïed et al 2022 lim et al 2019 mccurry et al 2016 shi and mccurry 2020 tekle röttering et al 2016a nitroalkanes were identified as major products yields up to 100 from simple primary and secondary amines lim et al 2019 mccurry et al 2016 scheme 5 a potentially undesirable outcome associated with the formation of nitroalkanes is discussed in section 2 2 2 hydroxylamines were suggested as ozonation products of secondary amines benner and ternes 2009a benner and ternes 2009b tekle röttering et al 2016a von gunten 2003b in analogy to n oxides as ozonation products of tertiary amines however recent studies identified hydroxylamines not as end products but as reaction intermediates that further react with ozone to eventually form nitroalkanes scheme 5 see also section 4 6 this occurs especially under neutral ph conditions where the ozone reactivity of hydroxylamines is typically much higher than the ozone reactivity of amines because of the lower pk a of protonated hydroxylamines compared to protonated amines besides hydroxylamines nitroxides nitrones and nitrosoalkanes have been suggested as other reaction intermediates but only the formation of nitrone was confirmed by an analytical standard during ozonation of a secondary amine lim et al 2019 nitrate is also a final product for ozonation of aliphatic amines along with carbonyl products originating from the carbonaceous part of the amine compounds it was shown that the yields of nitrate were highly variable for primary and secondary amines with a 20 fold molar ozone excess 17 100 de vera et al 2017 essaïed et al 2022 amino acids showed consistently high yields of nitrate under similar ozonation conditions essaïed et al 2022 under these extreme conditions nitroalkanes and n oxides were possibly further oxidized to nitrate certain primary amines form nitrate more efficiently glycine was transformed into nitrate with a 80 yield with a 5 fold ozone excess berger et al 1999 this is in contrast to ethylamine forming nitroethane as the only product under similar ozonation conditions lim et al 2019 nitrate formation during continuous ozonation was used as a surrogate for the potential formation nitro and or nitroso compounds from dom it could be shown that the nitrate formation potential during ozonation was in the range of 13 45 of the dissolved organic nitrogen for 6 different dom sources essaïed et al 2022 overall all types of aliphatic amines primary secondary and tertiary are transformed into products containing n o bonds nitroalkanes n oxides and nitrate with high yields this indicates that aliphatic amines react with ozone mainly via oxygen transfer pathways reaction type iii in scheme 1 additional evidence is provided by high yields of singlet oxygen a byproduct of the oxygen transfer pathway and quantum chemically computed gibbs free energy favoring an oxygen transfer over an electron transfer pathway lim et al 2019 however the reaction pathway can be shifted to some extent under real ozonation conditions where oh is formed as a secondary oxidant and plays a role in oxidizing aliphatic amines fig 5 due to the relatively low k o3 app at neutral ph in this case aliphatic amines undergo hydrogen atom abstraction to form n centered radicals that are subsequently degraded into dealkylated products and ultimately ammonia reaction type v in scheme 1 de vera et al 2017 le lacheur and glaze 1996 4 5 3 micropollutants the formation of n oxides during ozonation has been reported for many pharmaceuticals containing a tertiary amine moiety such as clarithromycin tramadol venlafaxine tamoxifen and toremifene knoop et al 2018 lange et al 2006 lester et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2012 pharmaceuticals containing a tertiary amine moiety in a saturated heterocyclic form such as cetirizine containing piperazine fexofenadine piperidine sulpiride pyrrolidine and amisulpride pyrrolidine were also transformed into n oxides upon ozonation bollmann et al 2016 borowska et al 2016 the formation of n oxides has been also observed in pilot and full scale wastewater treatment plants with ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent bourgin et al 2018 merel et al 2017 zucker et al 2018 once formed n oxides are persistent in the treated water they are not biodegradable during typical aerobic biological post treatments after ozonation bourgin et al 2018 hübner et al 2015 knopp et al 2016 zucker et al 2018 in contrast to the ample evidence of the n oxide formation the formation of hydroxylamines from the oxidation of micropollutants containing secondary primary amines by ozone has been reported to a lesser extent e g propranolol benner and ternes 2009a this is probably because of the further oxidation of hydroxylamines ultimately forming nitro compounds as is shown for sitagliptin a pharmaceutical containing a primary amine moiety hermes et al 2020 the corresponding nitro product of sitagliptin was also detected in pilot scale and full scale ozonation process gulde et al 2021a hermes et al 2020 4 6 other aliphatic nitrogen containing compounds 4 6 1 kinetics various derivatives are related to aliphatic amines by substitution of the nitrogen with heteroatoms e g o n s the k o3 of these compounds are in the range from 1 to 106 m 1s 1 currently available information on k o3 is summarized in fig 11 categorized by characteristic chemical bonds found in the functional groups differences in pk a values result in a different trend in k o3 app as a function of the ph for substituted nitrogen containing compounds in comparison to aliphatic amines fig 12 i n o bond compounds containing n o bonds e g n oxides hydroxylamines nitrones and nitroalkanes are common ozonation products of aliphatic amines section 4 5 2 they show a wide range of k o3 from slow reacting n oxides and nitroalkanes k o3 app ph7 10 m 1s 1 to fast reacting nitrones and hydroxylamines k o3 app ph7 103 m 1s 1 it should be noted that the reported k o3 for the fexofenadine n oxide is associated with other moieties borowska et al 2016 and therefore k o3 of the n oxide moiety would be even lower than 6 m 1s 1 hydroxylamines are especially reactive because of their pk a values 3 5 units lower than the pk a of the amine analogous table s6 si therefore unlike aliphatic amines hydroxylamines remain highly reactive towards ozone at ph 7 where they are dominantly present in the neutral form fig 12 ii n n bond hydrazines and hydrazides react fast with ozone with high k o3 similarly to hydroxylamines their protonated forms have a lower pk a than protonated aliphatic amines table s6 si resulting in high k o3 app ph7 fig 12 daminozide reacts fast with ozone over a wide ph range k o3 105 m 1s 1 for ph 3 9 due to its low pk a of 3 7 iii n n o bond nitrosamines and nitroamines react very slowly with ozone with most k o3 0 5 m 1s 1 mestankova et al 2014 iv n c n n bond the nitrogen of guanidine derivatives is present in the protonated form under most ph conditions because of the high pk a e g 13 6 for guanidine table s6 si as a consequence their k o3 are likely to be low as shown for metformin 1 2 m 1s 1 and creatine 0 5 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a jin et al 2012 v n s o o bond the nitrogen adjacent to sulfur in sulfonamides sulfamides and sulfamates undergoes acid base speciation from the neutral to the deprotonated anionic form table s6 si and therefore k o3 strongly depends on the ph k o3 of the deprotonated forms are 3 105 m 1s 1 for hydrochlorothiazide borowska et al 2016 2 6 102 m 1s 1 for n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole dodd et al 2006 103 m 1s 1 for n n dimethylsulfamide von gunten et al 2010 and 88 m 1s 1 for acesulfame kaiser et al 2013 only hydrochlorothiazide with a pk a 7 0 remains ozone reactive at neutral ph with k o3 app ph7 8 5 104 m 1s 1 while the other compounds show low to moderate k o3 app ph7 4 6 2 reaction mechanisms depending on the substituents the reactions of aliphatic amine derivatives with ozone differ significantly some are attacked by ozone on the nitrogen e g 1 1 dimethylhydrazine whereas others shift the main attack site to an α carbon e g nitroethane section 4 8 1 the reactions for which nitrogen is the main ozone reactive site are summarized in scheme 6 systematic investigations on product formation and reaction mechanisms for this group of compounds are scarce because of the lack of information with model compounds some of the mechanisms are discussed for micropollutants i compounds with n o bond hydroxylamines are quantitatively transformed to nitroalkanes upon ozonation forming nitrones as reaction intermediates lim et al 2019 shi and mccurry 2020 this supports that hydroxylamines are likely involved in the reactions of primary secondary amines with ozone which also form nitroalkanes as final products ii compounds with an n n bond hydrazine hydrazide ozone reactions have been studied mainly with regard to the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a probable human carcinogen upon ozonation one of the two nitrogen atoms is directly attacked by ozone and forms a new n o bond ndma was quantified as final product with high molar yields for 1 1 dimethylhydrazine and daminozide lim et al 2016 and industrial chemicals containing semicarbazides kosaka et al 2009 kosaka et al 2014 hydrazides are also found in heterocycles section 4 4 e g phenazone type pharmaceuticals favier et al 2015 in this case however the main ozone attack site is not the hydrazide nitrogen but an endocyclic double bond iii and iv compounds with n n o and n c n n bonds there is little information on the direct ozone reactions with nitrosamines nitroamines and guanidines mostly because of their low ozone reactivity which will promote an oh oxidation under realistic ozonation conditions fig 5 iv compounds with a n s o o bond typically substitution by electron withdrawing groups reduces the ozone reactivity of the nitrogen in certain cases if the electron withdrawing effect is strong enough that the substituted nitrogen becomes acidic the deprotonated nitrogen is the favorable target site for ozone this was observed for hydrochlorothiazide of which the sulfonamide nitrogen was oxidized by ozone via electron transfer and transformed into chlorothiazide as a primary product borowska et al 2016 in contrast n 4 acetyl sufamethoxazole with the aniline nitrogen deactivated by an amide is likely oxidized by ozone on the isoxazole or the aniline ring rather than on the sulfonamide dodd et al 2006 acesulfame containing a nitrogen substituted by both sulfonyl and amide groups reacts with ozone mainly via an oxidation on the endocyclic double bond scheurer et al 2012 the presence of the second substitution group or other ozone reactive moieties seems a determining factor for assessing the sulfonamide ozone reaction the reaction of n n dimethylsulfamide with ozone was studied in detail because of its potential to form ndma schmidt and brauch 2008 trogolo et al 2015 von gunten et al 2010 the ozone reaction is slow and does not lead to ndma formation however in presence of bromide n n dimethylsulfamide dms reacts fast with hypobromous acid hobr k hobr dms 8 1 108 m 1s 1 with the deprotonated form of n n dimethylsulfamide heeb et al 2017 to a bromamine hobr is formed as a secondary oxidant from the reaction of bromide with ozone haag and hoigné 1983b this intermediate is then further transformed to ndma with a yield of about 50 von gunten et al 2010 see above for kinetic assessment 4 7 organosulfur compounds 4 7 1 kinetics ozonation of sulfur has been observed for at least 75 years such as the reaction of aqueous 2 chloroethyl sulfide with ozone to produce the corresponding sulfoxide price and bullitt 1947 sulfur compounds can exist in oxidation states between ii and vi fig 13 s vi compounds such as sulfate do not react with ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 sulfur containing functional groups in oxidation states vi with the exception of sulfones and analogues react with ozone with generally higher k o3 with increasing sulfur electron density sulfoxides react sparingly with ozone e g dimethylsulfoxide k o3 8 m 1s 1 pryor et al 1984 and compounds with sulfur bonded to carbonyls are moderately reactive e g molinate k o3 5 102 m 1s 1 s ethyl n n dipropylthiocarbamate k o3 5 102 m 1s 1 chen et al 2008 however sulfurous functional groups in lower oxidation states such as thiols thioethers and disulfides react readily with ozone thiols and thioethers react very fast with ozone cysteine k o3 4 104 m 1s 1 methionine k o3 4 106 m 1s 1 pryor et al 1984 thioglycolic acid was found to be completely oxidized within 9 minutes of exposure to 12 mg l ozone gilbert and hoffmann glewe 1990 but oh was not suppressed so the k o3 cannot be determined reactions with disulfides are generally fast e g bis 2 hydroxyethyl disulfide k o3 1 7 105 m 1s 1 trans 1 2 dithiane 4 5 diol k o3 2 1 105 m 1s 1 muñoz et al 2001 with final products being s alkyl sulfinates muñoz et al 2001 cystine is an unusual outlier as a slower reacting disulfide k o3 1 103 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a a difference for which no explanation has been proposed thioether containing β lactam antibiotics react quickly with ozone penicillin and cephalexin were both observed to react quickly with ozone at ph 7 with high k o3 app ph7 of 4 8 103 m 1s 1 and 8 7 104 m 1s 1 respectively dodd et al 2006 penicillin has no other clearly oxidizable functional groups so the k o3 app was interpreted as the species specific k o3 for the reaction with the thioether but cephalexin also features olefin and primary amine functional groups complicating the kinetic interpretation lincomycin and methicillin also react quickly at their thioether sites with k o3 app ph7 of 6 75 105 m 1s 1 and 3 9 104 m 1s 1 respectively qiang et al 2004 jin et al 2012 the thioether of ranitidine was reported to be highly reactive with ozone with a species specific k o3 of 2 0 105 m 1s 1 jeon et al 2016 data on ozone reactions with aromatic sulfur are scarce benzothiazole and analogues were reportedly abated during ozonation of synthetic wastewater derco et al 2011 however no studies to date have reported species specific k o3 or products for benzothiazole reactions with ozone or oh therefore it cannot be determined whether the site of ozone attack was at the sulfur the nitrogen or an aromatic carbon site increased abatement rates at ph 8 5 compared to 5 8 suggested that oh may have been responsible for the benzothiazole degradation implying a low second order rate constant for the reaction with ozone one study measured second order rate constants for benzothiazole reactions with ozone and oh and found them to be k o3 2 3 m 1s 1 and k oh 6 109 m 1s 1 respectively valdés et al 2004 the measurements were made in a solution with continuous ozone sparging during which the concentration of ozone and oh may be somewhat unstable nevertheless these measurements are useful as preliminary estimates after ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluent at 0 6 mg o3 mg doc the benzothiazole concentration was found to decrease by 70 in one study hollender et al 2009 but in another after ozonation at 0 81 mg o3 mg doc benzothiazole was observed to be abated by only 7 margot et al 2013 and the reason for the discrepancy is unclear 4 7 2 reaction mechanisms information on the mechanisms and products of sulfur reactions with ozone are relatively scarce but available evidence points to oxygen transfer reactions as the dominant pathway with sulfoxides being the most commonly reported product functional groups reaction type iv in scheme 1 ozonation of methionine was found to convert the thioether to the corresponding sulfoxide as the quantitative product muñoz et al 2001 ozonation of thioglycolic acid was reported to first lead to a dimerization to the corresponding thioether thiodiglycolic acid although no mechanism was proposed gilbert and hoffmann glewe 1990 this thioether was then reported to undergo a series of further ozonation reactions first to the sulfoxide then the corresponding sulfone then to the sulfonic acid finally at high ph fragmentation and further oxidation produced sulfate and oxalic acid gilbert and hoffmann glewe 1990 because no oh scavenger was used involvement of oh in the fragmentation reaction seems likely the thioether of penicillin g was reported to be ozonated quantitatively to the corresponding sulfoxide while for cephalexin the criegee product is also observed from alkene scission in addition to oxidation of the thioether dodd et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation of reduced sulfur seems to occur generally via stepwise oxygen transfer reactions increasing the oxidation state by 2 at each step scheme 1 iv however it is currently unknown why some reduced sulfur compounds appear to stop at the sulfoxide as a stable product while others proceed further in the presence of ozone to the sulfone sulfonic acid and possibly sulfate in experiments with oh scavenging direct ozone oxidation beyond sulfones to sulfonic acids and sulfate has not yet been conclusively established the role of ozone versus oh in breaking c s bonds to fragment sulfones is also unclear at present however oh involvement seems likely as sulfones have no obvious available sites for ozone reactions 4 8 other functional groups while the majority of research on ozonation of organic compounds has focused on electron rich moieties such as olefins activated aromatic compounds reduced nitrogen and reduced sulfur ozone may attack other functional groups as well comparatively less is known about these reactions but ozone has been shown to oxidize carbanions produced by the deprotonation of relatively strong carbon acids to react fast with a β diketone and to directly functionalize certain carbon hydrogen bonds by hydride transfer or other mechanisms 4 8 1 carbanions despite a lack of obviously oxidizable functional groups i e no carbon carbon double bonds no activated aromatic moieties no lone pairs on n or s some alkyl compounds with electron withdrawing substituents have been observed to react with ozone however these reactions are typically slow and under realistic ozonation conditions the reactions with oh will dominate fig 5 nitroethane was reported to have a k o3 app of 3 4 m 1s 1 at ph 7 lim et al 2019 ozonation of the amino acids serine le lacheur and glaze 1996 and glycine berger et al 1999 de vera et al 2017 mccurry et al 2016 and other amino acids and amines essaïed et al 2022 produces nitrate upon exposure to excess ozone potentially implicating further oxidation of an oxime de vera et al 2017 lim et al 2019 or nitro intermediate mccurry et al 2016 the latter of which lacking any clear ozone attack sites one explanation for these reactions is an ozone attack of a carbanion conjugate base of electron deficient structures such as nitroalkanes pk a 14 anslyn and dougherty 2006 aqueous oxidation of carbanions has been reported for chlorine orvik 1980 and has been proposed to explain halonitromethane formation from nitromethane mccurry et al 2016 orvik 1980 shi and mccurry 2020 and halonitroalkane formation from the ε nitro analogue of lysine during chlorination mccurry et al 2016 less is known about carbanion reactions with ozone but carbanion intermediates have been proposed in the synthesis literature as sites for electrophilic ozone attack the carbanion resonance structure of nitrones was invoked to explain electrophilic attack of ozone on nitrone carbon erickson and myszkiewicz 1965 leading to aldehydes and c nitroso compounds ozone reactions with deprotonated secondary nitro compounds to ketones were rationalized by invoking a nitronate structure mcmurry et al 1974 which is in resonance with the corresponding nitroalkyl anion scheme 7 deprotonation of a malonate derivative to the corresponding carbanion and subsequent carbanion oxidation was proposed to explain the hydroxylation of the central acidic carbon by ozone white and egger 1984 kinetic data on carbanion oxidation are scarce based on reported k for the reaction with chlorine the deprotonation of nitromethane pk a 10 2 to nitromethyl anion is the rate limiting step below ph 11 5 rather than oxidation of the corresponding carbanion orvik 1980 it is unclear why deprotonation is the rate limiting step during neutral oxidation of nitromethane in contrast to other weak acids in which the conjugate base is more reactive e g phenol for which the reaction can be successfully modeled assuming base in equilibrium with acid regardless it appears likely that deprotonation of nitromethane will also be rate limiting at neutral ph for the reaction with ozone given that ozone reactions generally proceed with higher k o3 than reactions with chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 von gunten 2003b the species specific second order rate constant for hocl reacting with the nitromethyl anion was reported to be 9 5 103 m 1s 1 orvik 1980 which is likely a lower bound for its reaction rate constant with ozone to date the only reported k o3 for carbanions are for nitroethane k o3 app 3 4 m 1s 1 at ph 7 lim et al 2019 and malonate k o3 7 2 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a wherefore determining structure activity relationships is not possible however it is likely that as with phenols phenolates or amines carbanions and their conjugate acids will be subject to a tradeoff in which increasing electron withdrawing substituents will decrease the pk a and shift speciation from the unreactive neutral acid to the reactive base while also decreasing electron density at the nucleophilic site scheme s1 si to date the net effect of these competing phenomena is not clear and should be investigated further however in each of these pathways ozone would be competing against oh for reactive sites and ozone reactions will rarely be more important than oh reactions because at rct values typical of water and wastewater 10 8 10 9 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone reactions with an apparent second order rate constant below 5 50 m 1s 1 will be less important than oh reactions with the same compound fig 5 4 8 2 β diketones despite the presence of electron withdrawing carbonyl groups simple β diketones e g acetylacetone dimedone exhibit generally high reactivities towards various oxidants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide and permanganate deborde and von gunten 2008 hoigné and bader 1994 jáky et al 2006 acetylacetone shows very high reactivity towards ozone with k o3 app ph7 5 1 105 m 1s 1 houska et al 2021 the reason for the unusually high reactivity for β diketones is not entirely clear like the nitroalkanes discussed in the previous section β diketones are present in different forms in aqueous solution due to tautomerization keto and enol form and dissociation enol and enolate with the enolate featuring a carbanion resonance structure scheme 8 the relative contributions of these different forms to ozone reactivity should be carefully assessed because β diketones are common moieties of dom understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of their reactions with ozone is highly relevant to predict potential oxidation byproducts and warrants further investigation 4 8 3 hydrocarbons for compounds with no ozone reactive moieties limited ozone reactivity has still been observed at the site of carbon hydrogen bonds four possible mechanisms have been proposed including h abstraction direct electron transfer hydride transfer and insertion von sonntag and von gunten 2012 k o3 spanning seven orders of magnitude 50 m 1s 1 have been reported for more than 25 of such compounds von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the most ozone reactive compound in this category formate has been reported to have a species specific k o3 of 46 5 m 1s 1 when measured with careful oh scavenging reisz et al 2014 this reaction proceeds primarily through hydride transfer with some contribution from h abstraction leading to co2 as the primary product however the reason for the unusually high k o3 for a hydrocarbon is still unknown reisz et al 2014 ozonation of tert butanol k o3 10 3 m 1s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 was found to proceed to butan 2 one via hydride transfer from one of the methyl groups followed by methyl transfer to the carbanion and oxygen deprotonation reisz et al 2014 likewise hydride transfer was found to be the dominant mechanism of 2 propanol k o3 2 7 0 1 m 1s 1 reisz et al 2018 and 1 propanol k o3 0 64 0 02 m 1s 1 reisz et al 2019 oxidation leading to acetone and propionaldehyde acid as the major products respectively while direct c h bond oxidation with ozone is possible because the corresponding k o3 are low under most circumstances relevant to water treatment oh reactions will dominate transformation of these compounds fig 5 4 9 compounds with multiple ozone reaction sites the ozone reactive moieties discussed individually throughout section 4 can be present simultaneously within a molecule one way to determine the main reaction site is by studying the moiety specific reactivity with model compounds representing key substructures of a target compound this approach was applied to study the reaction of ozone with compounds with complex structures such as pharmaceuticals dodd et al 2006 huber et al 2004 jeon et al 2016 and cyanotoxins onstad et al 2007 if a compound contains multiple ozone reactive moieties including ionizable groups such as aliphatic amines or phenols the reactivity of the main reaction site alters as a function of the ph for example ozone attacks mainly at an amine moiety at a ph higher than the protonated amine s pk a i e where the neutral amine is dominant at ph pk a the ozone reactivity of the amine moiety significantly decreases due to protonation section 4 5 in this case the main reaction site is shifted to another moiety that is not affected by ph e g olefin an example is tamoxifen contains a tertiary amine and an olefin of which species specific k o3 for the neutral and the protonated forms are 3 2 108 m 1s 1 and 1 6 104 m 1s 1 respectively knoop et al 2018 in contrast to the typical k o3 of 0 1 m 1s 1 for the protonated form of simple aliphatic amines von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the k o3 of the protonated tamoxifen is still very high indicating the shift of the reaction site from the amine moiety to the olefin the second reactive moiety in this sense the species specific k o3 for the neutral and protonated forms of tamoxifen can be considered the moiety specific k o3 for the amine and olefin moieties respectively by combining the moiety specific k o3 of the two reaction sites amine and olefin with the degree of protonation of the amine moiety the fraction of ozone attacking at the amine moiety of tamoxifen at a specific ph can be expressed as eq 6 6 f r a c t i o n o f o z o n e a t t a c k a t a m i n e k o 3 a m i n e n 1 α k o 3 a m i n e n h α k o 3 a m i n e n 1 α k o 3 a m i n e n h α k o 3 o l e f i n where α h h k a is the degree of protonation of the amine moiety of tamoxifen r3nh r3n based on the reported pk a 9 49 knoop et al 2018 k o3 amine n is the moiety specific k o3 for the amine moiety neutral form i e 3 2 108 m 1s 1 knoop et al 2018 k o3 olefin is the moiety specific k o3 for the olefin moiety approximated by the reported species specific k o3 for the protonated tamoxifen i e 1 6 104 m 1s 1 knoop et al 2018 k o3 amine nh is the moiety specific k o3 for the amine moiety as the protonated form arbitrarily given 0 1 m 1s 1 according to the typical k o3 for protonated amines fig 14 shows the calculated ozone attack at the amine moiety for selected pharmaceuticals containing multiple reaction sites based on eq 6 by extending the approximation to other secondary reaction sites aromatic and sulfur moieties depending on the difference of moiety specific k o3 the main reaction site at a specific ph can differ significantly fig 14 for tamoxifen the moiety specific k o3 for the neutral tertiary amine is about four orders of magnitude higher than for the olefin 3 2 108 m 1s 1 and 1 6 104 m 1s 1 respectively knoop et al 2018 this results in 98 of ozone attack at the tertiary amine at ph 7 despite the predominance of the protonated form of the amine tamoxifen pk a 9 5 in contrast for nortriptyline with a comparable pk a of 10 2 the difference in the moiety specific k o3 is smaller k o3 4 3 105 m 1s 1 for the neutral secondary amine and 2 1 103 m 1s 1 for the olefin benitez et al 2013 as a consequence at ph 7 nortriptyline is oxidized by ozone mostly at the olefin moiety the pk a of amine moieties also plays a role in determining the main reaction site for a given ph the k o3 of the thiazine moiety of cephalexin is as high as the k o3 of the primary amine moiety 8 2 104 m 1s 1 and 9 3 104 m 1s 1 respectively dodd et al 2006 see the structure in figure s1 si at ph 7 cephalexin is attacked by ozone at the amine moiety with a moderate proportion 33 because of a pk a of 7 1 more acidic than typical primary amines due to the presence of a carbonyl as a neighboring group at higher ph the thiazine and the amino groups contribute similarly to the oxidation of cephalexin by ozone due to the similar k o3 for the two moieties many heterocyclic moieties contain an ionizable nitrogen as well as a carbon carbon double bond within a cyclic structure therefore identifying the main ozone reaction site within a heterocyclic moiety can be challenging regioselectivity prediction by quantum chemical computations could be especially useful in these cases computed molecular descriptors such as average local ionization energies orbital energies and bond dissociation energies can describe where the ozone reaction would preferentially take place within a molecule tentscher et al 2019 and have been applied recently in an ozone pathway prediction system lee et al 2017a and for studying the ozone reaction for selected heterocyclic compounds chen et al 2019 yao et al 2020 5 kinetics of the reaction of ozone with macromolecules antibiotic resistance gene arg inactivation and dna oxidation some macromolecules e g dom are highly heterogeneous and therefore their reactions with ozone are largely assessed in terms of the effect on bulk parameters e g specific uv absorbance edc etc or elemental ratios see section 3 2 however because biomolecules e g proteins nucleic acids are often macromolecules consisting of known sequences of discrete subunits e g amino acids nucleobases they present an opportunity to predict the kinetics of macromolecule in ozonation as the aggregation of reactions with individual subunits for which reactivities with ozone are generally known one example is the reaction of ozone with antibiotic resistance genes discussed below 5 1 ozonation of antibiotic resistant bacteria concerns about the potential for wastewater treatment facilities to act as breeding grounds for antibiotic resistant bacteria dodd 2012 pruden et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 zarei baygi et al 2019 have led to interest in the use of ozone and other disinfectants for antibiotic resistance control antibiotic resistance inactivation presents a special challenge for chemical disinfectants for ordinary microorganisms the outcome is agnostic of the means of action i e inactivating a bacterium by oxidizing its cell membrane proteins and or its dna both achieve the same outcome however for antibiotic resistant bacteria inactivating the organism does not guarantee loss of the potential for antibiotic resistance as multiple mechanisms of antibiotic resistance gene arg horizontal transfer exist including uptake by non resistant organisms of args from dead cells particularly if their cell membranes are lysed during disinfection dodd 2012 additionally several studies have indicated the possibility for antibiotic resistance rebound after disinfection in which the absolute and or relative abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb increases after disinfection czekalski et al 2016 iakovides et al 2019 finally the disinfection process may select for arbs over non resistant populations alexander et al 2016 therefore in addition to the interest in arb inactivation attention has more recently been focused on inactivation of the args themselves which is the primary subject of this critical review as with most microorganisms ozone rapidly inactivates antibiotic resistant bacteria pak et al 2016 achieving for instance 3 4 log inactivation of sulfonamide resistant e coli j53 after application of 0 08 mg l ozone in buffered deionized water czekalski et al 2016 arb inactivation in secondary wastewater effluent is also highly effective 2 log inactivation of trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole resistant e coli was achieved with specific ozone doses as low as 0 25 mg o3 mg doc in secondary effluent and was unaffected by the addition of hydrogen peroxide iakovides et al 2019 5 2 ozonation of antibiotic resistance genes inactivation of args by ozone has been widely measured including in clean systems czekalski et al 2016 he et al 2019 secondary wastewater effluent alexander et al 2016 ben et al 2017 czekalski et al 2016 iakovides et al 2019 lamba and ahammad 2017 zheng et al 2017 zhuang et al 2015 sludge pei et al 2016 and cow manure cengiz et al 2010 early quantification of arg depletion by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in clean systems reported 1 5 log abatement of the arg sul1 with an ozone dose of 0 2 mg l applied to arg containing e coli at a contact time of 30 minutes i e complete ozone depletion in buffered ultrapurified water at ph 7 4 czekalski et al 2016 ozonation conducted at rapid time scales with quench flow kinetics revealed that arg inactivation happens subsequent to cell inactivation czekalski et al 2016 potentially supporting the hypothesis that cell membranes must first be ruptured to expose args to bulk solution before they can be inactivated dodd 2012 however previous studies on bacterial inactivation by ozone found nearly complete inactivation at very low specific ozone doses 0 2 mg o3 mg doc for 15 s occurring prior to cell membrane destruction ramseier et al 2011b leaving open the possibility of ozone diffusion into the cell leading to arg oxidation a study aiming to measure the ozonation kinetics of args themselves ozonated extracellular dna extracted from an antibiotic resistant strain of bacillus subtilis in buffered deionized water the k o3 of four amplicons 266 1017 base pairs of the arg blt were measured to be 1 8 6 9 104 m 1s 1 corresponding to an average per base k o3 of 65 m 1s 1 he et al 2019 based on the average of the k o3 of the four amplicons a pseudo first order rate constant with 0 04 mm 2 mg l ozone would be 2 1 s 1 corresponding to a half life of 0 33 s previously the k o3 of calf dna oxidation was measured and the per base k o3 was 410 m 1s 1 theruvathu et al 2001 the rate of dna oxidation by ozone was slower than would be predicted if dna strands reacted equivalently to a mixture of their component nucleobases if it is assumed that a reaction between ozone and any of the nucleobases on a strand of dna is sufficient to degrade it measured by pcr signal then degradation kinetics should be controlled by the sum of the reactions between each of its nucleobases and ozone as follows eqs 7 and 8 explained in text s1 si 7 d d n a d t d n a o 3 k o 3 d n a 8 k o 3 d n a m k a n k g q k c p k t where m n q and p are the sums of adenine a guanine g cytosine c and thymine t bases per strand of dna and k a k g k c and k t are the respective second order rate constants for their reactions with ozone before calculating the overall predicted rate of dna oxidation the acid base speciation of nucleobases must be accounted for by converting species specific k o3 to ph dependent k o3 app for each nucleobase as shown in table s7 si computing this overall predicted k o3 from the shortest 266 bp amplicon in he et al 2019 leads to an overall expected k o3 for the reaction between ozone and the amplicon of 6 49 106 m 1s 1 and a specific per nucleobase k o3 of 2 40 104 m 1s 1 table s8 si approximately 370 times higher than that observed by he et al 2019 and 59 times higher than observed with calf dna theruvathu et al 2001 the reasons for this discrepancy between the predicted and observed k o3 for dna in clean systems are not immediately clear but several possibilities exist one option is analytical artifacts dna abatement during disinfection is commonly monitored by qpcr mckinney and pruden 2012 yoon et al 2017 but a single modification at certain sites may be insufficient to eliminate or drastically reduce amplification efficiency sikorsky et al 2004 2007 leading to underprediction of the extent of dna damage additionally different amplification efficiencies of damaged dna are observed when using different polymerase reagent kits hajibabaei et al 2005 and certain polymerase reagents are specifically designed to amplify damaged dna robertson et al 2014 another possibility is tertiary structure leading to reduced reactivity due to steric shielding of ozone targets from the bulk solution as is observed during protein oxidation in which some oxidizable residues may be buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein and unavailable for oxidation reactions choe et al 2015 jensen et al 2012 lundeen and mcneill 2013 sivey et al 2013 finally one possibility to explain the dramatically lower k o3 observed for dna than would be predicted based on the sum of the constituent nucleobases is an increase in the pk a of nucleobases due to a combination of hydrogen bonding between bases and pi stacking interactions these interactions have been reported to increase the pk a of protonated nucleobases by up to 3 4 orders of magnitude which in some cases a c could convert the majority of the bases from their neutral or negatively charged reactive forms to their charged forms which are nearly inert tang et al 2007 wilcox et al 2011 however performing the same calculation as in table s7 si but assuming that the pk a of all nucleobases is 1 4 units higher produces only a modest decrease in calculated k o3 app therefore this pk a shift alone is unlikely to explain the discrepancy between calculated and observed k o3 of dna ozonation the reason that a dramatic pk a shift fails to produce a major change in outcome is likely that overall reactivity appears dominated by thymine table s7 si and the protonated form of thymine is still quite reactive with ozone k o3 4 2 104 m 1s 1 in contrast to ozonation of arbs in clean systems or of extracted dna inactivation of antibiotic resistance genes in real wastewater effluent and sludge is relatively ineffective alexander et al 2016 ben et al 2017 cengiz et al 2010 iakovides et al 2019 lamba and ahammad 2017 pei et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 zhuang et al 2015 arb and arg inactivation generally require comparable doses as 80 abatement of group i and group ii micropollutants identified by lee et al 2013 as being highly k o3 app ph7 105 m 1s 1 and moderately 10 m 1s 1 k o3 app ph7 105 m 1s 1 reactive with ozone fig 15 in fig 15 group ii is further divided into group iia 103 m 1s 1 k o3 app ph7 105 m 1s 1 and group iib 10 m 1s 1 k o3 app ph7 103 m 1s 1 using micropollutant abatement data from bourgin et al 2018 ozone doses are often constrained in practice by bromate formation which strongly depends on the specific ozone doses soltermann et al 2017 specific ozone doses shown to achieve 2 log inactivation of arb 0 4 mg o3 mg doc czekalski et al 2016 are generally at or below the threshold for moderate bromate formation soltermann et al 2017 while specific ozone doses to achieve 2 log abatement of args alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 are in the ozone dose range with moderate to high bromate yields fig 15 reconciling the paradox of effective arg inactivation in clean systems or with extracted dna with relatively ineffective inactivation in practical systems will require further studies possible contributors to this discrepancy include the location of the args chromosomal vs plasmid intracellular vs extracellular dodd 2012 and issues potentially related to the lower reactivity of dna than one would predict as discussed above 6 conclusions due to a significant knowledge gain in the ozone chemistry in aqueous solution and shifts in application of ozonation processes this critical review highlights the most important aspects of the ozone chemistry and applications as follows a paradigm shift in the application of ozone for impaired water qualities enhanced wastewater treatment water reuse needs a new focus on higher levels and different types of dissolved organic matter dom than for typical drinking water applications furthermore bromate formation has to be carefully monitored due to sometimes higher and variable levels of bromide several bulk parameters uv absorbance electron donating capacity and high resolution mass spectrometry can be applied to elucidate changes in dom properties and or used as proxies to monitor and control ozonation processes for micropollutant abatement an updated compilation of the kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of the main reactive functional groups olefins activated aromatic compounds nitrogen containing compounds sulfur containing compounds and relatively less known functional groups carbanions hydrocarbons β diketones with ozone is provided the kinetics of ozone reactions have been used to assess the main reaction site of the organic compounds containing multiple reactive functional groups to anticipate the formation of transformation products the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes by ozone are discussed in comparison to the reactivity of dna and a paradox of different reaction kinetics is highlighted the consequences of the formation of oxidation byproducts from dom and transformation products from micropollutants are not discussed in this review however this compilation of ozone reaction mechanisms will be the basis to predict oxidation byproducts and transformation products and assess the eco toxicological consequences and their potential biodegradability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16221,ozonation has been applied in water treatment for more than a century first for disinfection later for oxidation of inorganic and organic pollutants in recent years ozone has been increasingly applied for enhanced municipal wastewater treatment for ecosystem protection and for potable water reuse these applications triggered significant research efforts on the abatement efficiency of organic contaminants and the ensuing formation of transformation products this endeavor was accompanied by developments in analytical and computational chemistry which allowed to improve the mechanistic understanding of ozone reactions this critical review assesses the challenges of ozonation of impaired water qualities such as wastewaters and provides an up to date compilation of the recent kinetic and mechanistic findings of ozone reactions with dissolved organic matter various functional groups olefins aromatic compounds heterocyclic compounds aliphatic nitrogen containing compounds sulfur containing compounds hydrocarbons carbanions β diketones and antibiotic resistance genes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic contaminants kinetics mechanisms dissolved organic matter antibiotic resistance genes ozone 1 introduction ozonation has been applied in drinking water treatment for disinfection and oxidation for decades currently as its application area is being further extended to wastewater treatment and potable water reuse ozonation is facing new challenges associated with higher concentrations and new types of dissolved organic matter as well as a larger range of organic contaminants this critical review provides the background of the current developments in ozonation applications section 2 addresses new challenges associated with the impact of dissolved organic matter on ozonation performance section 3 and provides a critical compilation of kinetic and mechanistic information necessary to evaluate abatement of organic compounds during ozonation section 4 furthermore the abatement of antibiotic resistance is discussed section 5 and compared to the abatement of micropollutants and bromate formation 2 ozonation in drinking water and wastewater treatments 2 1 drinking water 2 1 1 from disinfection to oxidation ozonation has been applied in drinking water for more than a century mainly for disinfection purposes fig 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 it was considered as an equivalent to chlorine and in some cases an ozone residual was maintained in the distribution system for groundwaters with low doc concentrations and with high carbonate alkalinity conditions which warrant a high ozone stability courbat et al 1999 hoigné 1998 in addition to its outstanding capacity for the inactivation of microorganisms such as viruses bacteria and protozoa von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wolf et al 2018 ozone was also applied at an early stage to oxidatively abate inorganic compounds e g fe ii mn ii no2 hs and to control taste and odor issues fig 1 von gunten 2003b only in the 1970s and 1980s the mechanism of ozone decomposition in water was elucidated and it was demonstrated that hydroxyl radicals oh are formed during this process bühler et al 1984 hoigné and bader 1975 staehelin et al 1984 staehelin and hoigné 1985 it was also shown that ozone transformation to oh can be accelerated by hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which opened up the possibility for ozone based advanced oxidation processes aops which combine ozone and oh oxidation and are applicable for oxidant resistant micropollutant abatement fig 1 aieta et al 1988 von gunten 2018 as a consequence of this discovery ozone based aops were implemented in the 1990s especially in france to abate ozone resistant pesticides mainly atrazine duguet et al 1990 however due to the drinking water regulations of the european union in 1998 eu 1998 which included metabolites from pesticides as regulated products this approach was no longer accepted in france and as a consequence aops were banned for the abatement of pesticides and only admitted for the treatment of chlorinated solvents von gunten 2018 the formation of transformation products during ozonation of micropollutants will be discussed in more detail in several sections below 2 1 2 disinfection byproducts formation and mitigation in applications of chlorine trihalomethanes thms were reported as disinfection byproducts dbps in the mid 1970s rook 1974 however it took much longer until dbps were considered during ozonation processes hoigné 1998 von gunten 2018 first the formation and removal by biological post filtration of aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids was studied glaze et al 1989 hammes et al 2006 hammes et al 2007 nawrocki et al 2003 ramseier et al 2011a swietlik et al 2004 swietlik et al 2009 van der kooij et al 1989 zürcher et al 1978 and then the formation of trichloronitromethane chloropicrin during post chlorination of ozonated waters was investigated fig 1 hoigné and bader 1988 thibaud et al 1987 even though bromate formation during ozonation of bromide containing waters was already investigated in the early 1980s haag and hoigné 1983b it only became an issue when it was found to be a possible human carcinogen in the early 1990s fig 1 who 2017 the relatively stringent and quite universal drinking water standard for bromate 10 µg l often limits ozone applications for disinfection purposes therefore several mitigation options were developed such as ph depression ammonium addition chlorine ammonium or ammonium chlorine addition when disinfection is the main purpose and hydrogen peroxide addition when disinfection is not the primary target for ozonation buffle et al 2004 haag and hoigné 1983b krasner et al 1993 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 song et al 1996 song et al 1997 von gunten and hoigné 1994 von gunten and oliveras 1998 von gunten 2003a an updated mechanism for bromate formation during ozonation is presented elsewhere von sonntag and von gunten 2012 with the discovery of the formation of n nitrosamines during chlorination chloramination in the early 2000s mitch and sedlak 2002 mitch et al 2003b najm and trussell 2001 pre oxidation by ozone was found to be an interesting option for the mitigation of these undesired compounds chen and valentine 2008 krasner et al 2018 lee et al 2007a mccurry et al 2015 shah et al 2012 however numerous studies also reported n nitrosamine formation during ozonation of individual target compounds andrzejewski et al 2008 lim et al 2016 marti et al 2015 oya et al 2008 schmidt and brauch 2008 including a case of bromide catalysis for dimethylsulfamide trogolo et al 2015 von gunten et al 2010 and real water matrices fig 1 gerrity et al 2015 krasner et al 2013 pisarenko et al 2015 finally with the discovery of toxic iodo dbps which can be formed during oxidative processes in presence of iodide dong et al 2019 li et al 2020 pre ozonation was recognized as an efficient mitigation strategy to minimize iodo dbps by oxidizing iodide quickly to iodate fig 1 allard et al 2013 bichsel and von gunten 1999 2 2 wastewater 2 2 1 disinfection similar to drinking water ozonation has been implemented in wastewater as a disinfectant before its discharge to the receiving water bodies fig 1 gerrity et al 2012 janex et al 2000 paraskeva and graham 2002 xu et al 2002 however wastewater disinfection requires quite high doses and it is expected that disinfection including inactivation of ozone resistant microorganisms such as protozoa will lead to the formation of bromate above the drinking water standard of 10 µg l lee et al 2016b schindler wildhaber et al 2015 zimmermann et al 2011 2 2 2 oxidation of micropollutants for potable water reuse purposes human health due to issues related to water scarcity and water security potable water reuse projects are increasing with 25 full scale systems in operation worldwide marron et al 2019 potable water reuse requires a multibarrier approach to guarantee microbial and chemical drinking water safety gerrity et al 2013 marron et al 2019 currently most of the water reuse facilities rely on systems which treat municipal wastewater effluent by a sequence of membranes micro or ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis ro followed by an advanced oxidation process most commonly uv h2o2 and a disinfection step for the distribution system marron et al 2019 this scheme can also include a pre ozonation for disinfection as the primary treatment step gerrity et al 2013 often an additional cycle through a natural or managed system reservoir groundwater is used to condition the water in terms of temperature mineral content and to remove biodegradable organic compounds this approach which is known as indirect potable reuse also has reasonable consumer acceptance recently more direct potable reuse projects have been implemented due to the lack of suitable systems or regulations for the storage recharge of the treated water steinle darling 2015 even though these potable reuse systems provide high quality drinking water the main drawback is the high waste stream from the concentrate of the ro also containing antiscalants which consists of about 20 of the treated water pérez gonzález et al 2012 in coastal areas this reject can be discharged to the ocean however for inland water reuse applications far from the ocean such discharges are not possible and alternative treatment strategies have to be developed less tight membranes such as nanofiltration can ease this situation to a certain extent but will still produce a significant waste stream and reject micropollutants to a smaller extent marron et al 2019 alternatively treatment schemes involving activated carbon or ozonation combined with biological activated carbon bac filtration were suggested which reduce the problem of waste streams inherent to tight membrane based systems significantly and can still provide a good drinking water quality which was demonstrated in laboratory and pilot studies gerrity et al 2011 gerrity and snyder 2011 gerrity et al 2014 hooper et al 2020 reungoat et al 2012 sundaram et al 2020 vaidya et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the first potable reuse system worldwide in windhoek namibia comprised several treatment steps including the combination of ozonation with biological activated carbon filtration gerrity et al 2013 the assessment of ozone based reuse systems was mainly based on the microbiological and the chemical quality related to micropollutants even though this approach seems quite promising there are several critical points which need to be addressed more carefully for potable reuse systems i presence of ozone and oh resistant compounds that are also not well removed during bac treatment ii formation of transformation products during ozonation of micropollutants which are not abated during bac treatment iii formation of oxidation byproducts from dissolved organic matter dom ozonation which are not removed in bac treatment iv bromate formation during ozonation of bromide which is often elevated in municipal wastewater effluent see below and v formation of precursors for disinfection byproduct during post chlorination fig 2 shows a summary of these different aspects some of these issues are the same as for enhanced wastewater treatment for ecological reasons however in the context of potable water reuse they become more critical i the occurrence of oxidant resistant compounds such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas makes this class of toxic compounds a problem not only in drinking water resources but also in wastewater effluents crone et al 2019 gallen et al 2018 due to their resistance against oxidation they are difficult to be abated by ozone and oh lutze et al 2018 and also limited removal efficiencies for activated carbon have been observed crone et al 2019 inyang and dickenson 2017 sun et al 2018 ii ozonation of micropollutants leads to the formation of transformation products which are not necessarily biodegradable gulde et al 2021a hübner et al 2015 fig 2 predictive tools have been developed to assess their formation and it has been demonstrated that several to tens of transformation products can be formed per compound lee et al 2017a this has also been confirmed by non target analysis for which a huge increase in features has been observed during ozonation and only a partial abatement during biological post filtration gulde et al 2021a gulde et al 2021b schollée et al 2018 it can be assumed that the primary biological effects of the target compounds are abated but it cannot be excluded that toxic compounds are formed which are more problematic than the target compounds however due to the low concentrations of the micropollutants it can be expected that the resulting toxicity will be minimal since only very few classes of organic compounds are still toxic at such low levels iii many of the oxygen rich compounds formed during ozonation of dom e g aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids are quite well biodegradable hammes et al 2006 van der kooij et al 1989 fig 2 in a recent study α β unsaturated carbonyl compounds were detected after wastewater ozonation marron et al 2020 such electrophilic compounds are problematic because they can bind to dna and proteins even though they are removed by about 90 in biological post treatment this class of compounds should be carefully monitored in potable water reuse systems iv so far in potable water reuse systems applying ozone there is only limited information on bromate formation hooper et al 2020 based on the experiences from enhanced wastewater treatment it can be expected that bromate will become a critical factor especially if ozonation is applied to inactivate protozoa or bacterial spores morrison et al submitted soltermann et al 2016 soltermann et al 2017 fig 2 however if ozonation is applied for the inactivation of viruses or vegetative bacteria significant disinfection credit can be achieved with limited bromate formation because of the high second order inactivation rate constants of such microorganisms hunt and marinas 1999 morrison et al submitted voumard et al submitted wolf et al 2018 v whereas ozonation alone may lead to an increase of the dbp precursors a combination of ozonation with biological treatment is effective in dbp precursor control chuang et al 2019 krasner 2009 sun et al 2018 fig 2 one case in point is nitromethane formation during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluent which then leads to the formation of trichloronitromethane during post chlorination shi and mccurry 2020 nitromethane formed during wastewater ozonation was subsequently found to persist through membrane and advanced oxidation processes but to be effectively removed by bac shi et al 2021 in addition to dbp concentrations a toxicity based approach has to be considered it has been shown that the combined effect of ozonation bac may lead to similar overall toxicity because of a shift to more toxic dbps chuang et al 2019 2 2 3 oxidation of micropollutants to reduce their discharge to water bodies ecosystem health with the development of the coupling of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry a new analytical window was established which allowed the measurement of more polar compounds and led to the discovery of a wide range of biologically active organic micropollutants in municipal wastewater snyder 2008 ternes 1998 these observations triggered environmental concerns and the ensuing ecological consequences were broadly investigated furthermore the potential for abatement of micropollutants from municipal wastewaters by various strategies was explored including membranes activated carbon and chemical oxidation which is the focus of this review fig 1 joss et al 2008 ternes and joss 2006 ternes et al 2004 in these studies several oxidation processes were investigated for enhanced wastewater treatment including ferrate vi lee et al 2009 chlorine dioxide huber et al 2005b uv h2o2 and ozone huber et al 2003 huber et al 2005a lee et al 2013 lee et al 2016a ternes et al 2003 wert et al 2009 and fe tetramido macrocyclic ligands taml h2o2 jans et al 2021 based on these studies and other information from literature ozonation was selected as the oxidation process of choice for enhanced wastewater treatment in switzerland and in other countries because of the broad spectrum of micropollutants which can be abated during ozonation domenjoud et al 2017 eggen et al 2014 gerrity et al 2012 hollender et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 lee et al 2013 lee et al 2014 lee and von gunten 2016 miklos et al 2018 ternes et al 2003 ternes et al 2017 zimmermann et al 2011 this initiative triggered significant interest on the influence of oxidative treatment on biological effects of micropollutants and their transformation products prasse et al 2015 it was shown that biologically active compounds such as estrogens antibiotics antivirals and pesticides lost their primary target effects during ozonation and other aops in laboratory in vitro studies dodd et al 2009 huber et al 2004 lange et al 2006 lee et al 2008 mestankova et al 2011 mestankova et al 2012 during ozonation of real wastewaters in laboratory pilot and full scale studies mixed results were obtained with various toxicological endpoints such as the fish early life stage toxicity test the chironomid toxicity test the lumbriculus toxicity test the ceriodaphnia dubia toxicity test with mostly a reduction in toxicity but in some cases also an increase angeles et al 2020 escher et al 2009 magdeburg et al 2014 prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2010a stalter et al 2010b völker et al 2019 von gunten 2018 however biological post treatment by sand or activated carbon filtration led mostly to a significant reduction of the toxicity wherefore typically a biological post treatment step is implemented after ozonation of wastewater bourgin et al 2018 chys et al 2017b itzel et al 2020 knopp et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 this observation can most likely be explained by potentially eco toxic dbps such as aldehydes and ketones formed during ozonation of wastewater dom which are often easily biodegradable see above however potential for the formation of eco toxic transformation products from micropollutants exists as mentioned in section 2 2 2 schollée et al 2018 from a theoretical study and experimental results it is expected that mainly transformation products from olefins and aromatic compounds are biodegradable whereas products from nitrogen containing compounds are expected to be mostly persistent bourgin et al 2018 hübner et al 2015 zucker et al 2018 however often such a simplified approach is not justified gulde et al 2021b an additional benefit of biological post treatment is a significant abatement of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which is already present in the raw wastewater and or formed during ozonation bourgin et al 2018 krauss et al 2009 to assess the feasibility of ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents considering also toxicity test procedures including chemical and toxicological methods have been developed and applied itzel et al 2017 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 bromide levels in municipal wastewaters can be significantly higher than in drinking waters occasionally reaching levels of tens of mg l lee et al 2013 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 this may lead to significant bromate formation during ozonation of municipal wastewaters especially for specific ozone doses 0 5 go3 gdoc which are typical for enhanced wastewater treatment for micropollutant abatement soltermann et al 2016 soltermann et al 2017 under oxic conditions which are prevalent after ozonation bromate persists in biological post treatment see fig 2 and below 3 challenges in wastewater matrices and characterization of dom by surrogate parameters 3 1 water matrix differences between drinking water and wastewater ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluents entails some challenges which are not serious issues during drinking water treatment i higher concentrations and different types of dom ii potential presence of nitrite and iii higher and variable concentrations of bromide i as a consequence of the higher dom concentrations higher concentrations of ozone and oh are consumed by reactive dom sites and lead to higher concentrations of aoc bdoc and low molecular weight oxygen containing compounds aldehydes carboxylic acids marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 zimmermann et al 2011 because these compounds may lead to enhanced toxicity a biological post treatment is necessary for their removal prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2010b furthermore the concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen is typically much higher in secondary municipal wastewater effluent chon et al 2013 parkin and mccarty 1981 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 shon et al 2006 and may lead to nitro and nitroso moieties pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 shi and mccurry 2020 see below ii in secondary wastewater effluents which are not or incompletely nitrified elevated nitrite concentrations can be found since ozone reacts readily with nitrite k o3 3 7 105 m 1s 1 hoigné et al 1985 its presence leads to a stoichiometric consumption of ozone furthermore it has been shown that nitro compounds can be formed as side reactions during ozonation of nitrite containing waters hu et al 2010 manasfi et al in prep thibaud et al 1987 iii similar to drinking waters ozonation of bromide containing wastewaters leads to bromate formation bourgin et al 2018 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 wu et al 2019 compared to typical drinking waters the bromide concentrations in secondary wastewater effluents are more variable and can also be significantly higher this may be caused by discharge from industry municipal incineration plants fracking wastewaters seawater intrusion etc dong et al 2017 harkness et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 bromate is only removable under anaerobic conditions van ginkel et al 2005 which are unlikely during biological post treatment after ozonation nevertheless there are several options to minimize bromate formation during ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluent such as addition of hydrogen peroxide or a distributed dosing of ozone each of which entails certain limitations and needs to be tested on a case by case basis merle et al 2017 soltermann et al 2017 3 2 control of ozonation systems for enhanced municipal wastewater treatment compared to typical drinking water ozonation with ozone lifetimes in the range of tens of minutes the lifetime of ozone in municipal wastewater effluents is much smaller acero and von gunten 2001 buffle et al 2006b therefore ozone monitoring and control in drinking waters which is based on direct ozone concentration and decay measurements kaiser et al 2013 is not applicable to municipal wastewater for which specialized equipment such as stopped flow or quench flow is needed to monitor kinetics buffle et al 2006b due to this shortcoming and the lack of fast monitoring systems for micropollutants and microorganisms empirical methods have been developed which correlate the abatement of microorganisms or micropollutants to surrogate parameters it has been shown that the natural logarithm of the relative abatement of the uv absorption at 285 nm is correlated to the ozone exposure buffle et al 2006a since the ozone exposure is the relevant parameter for disinfection and oxidation this opens up the possibility to use uv absorption to assess the efficiency of wastewater ozonation in addition to uv changes in fluorescence have been tested as descriptors for micropollutant abatement during ozonation chys et al 2017a park et al 2017 a recently developed method to characterize the electron donor properties of the dom is the electron donating capacity edc see below table 1 summarizes selected studies in which surrogate parameters have been applied to predict micropollutant abatement and inactivation of microorganisms a detailed discussion of these proxies is provided in the sections below 3 2 1 characterization of dom and derived surrogate parameters dom plays a crucial role during ozonation in several ways i direct consumption of ozone ii acceleration of ozone decomposition by radical type chain reactions staehelin and hoigné 1985 iii formation of oxygenated disinfection byproducts hammes et al 2007 nawrocki et al 2003 van der kooij et al 1989 wert et al 2007 iv abatement or formation of precursors for the formation of disinfection byproducts during post disinfection fig 2 hoigné and bader 1988 hua and reckhow 2013 mccurry et al 2016 reckhow and singer 1984 reckhow et al 1986 wert and rosario ortiz 2011 and v changes in photochemical and photophysical dom properties leresche et al 2019 leresche et al 2021 to better understand the reactions of ozone with dom various dom characterization methods have been developed with surrogate parameters e g uv absorbance fluorescence excitation emission spectra molecular weight distributions relative intensities of different chemical shift regions in nmr edc table 1 rather than attempting to characterize individual moieties in highly heterogeneous mixtures beggs et al 2013 chen et al 2003 her et al 2003 lyon et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 in addition oxidative titration methods with chlorine chlorine dioxide and ozone have been developed to estimate the concentrations of oxidant reactive moieties in dom essaïed et al 2022 houska et al 2021 finally high resolution mass spectrometry can been applied to characterize molecular features of dom see below 3 2 2 specific uv absorption suva one of the first methods to characterize changes in dom upon ozonation is based on optical properties in particular uv measurements at various wavelengths and a derived parameter the specific uv absorbance suva which is the uv absorbance normalized to the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration the uv absorbance typically decreases during ozonation due to bleaching of the dom wenk et al 2013 this effect is caused by the oxidation of activated aromatic systems leading to moieties with lower uv absorbances other optical methods based on fluorescence measurements are also applied to characterize dom during ozonation gerrity et al 2012 swietlik and sikorska 2004 which allows a qualitative classification of dom moieties mckay et al 2018 3 2 3 electron donating capacity edc another tool for characterization of dom is based on its edc this can be measured by electrochemical or spectrophotometric methods aeschbacher et al 2010 önnby et al 2018b walpen et al 2020 walpen et al 2022 by the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazo line 6 sulphonate abts which can be produced electrochemically or by oxidation with chlorine aeschbacher et al 2010 önnby et al 2018b abts which absorbs light at various wavelengths in the visible range is reduced by reaction with electron donating moieties to abts which is non colored pinkernell et al 1997 the edc can be derived from the decoloration of abts and allows a semi quantitative determination of the availability of electrons which can be abstracted by oxidants such as ozone chlorine and chlorine dioxide wenk et al 2013 edc has also been shown in laboratory and full scale experiments with a continuous online system to be a useful proxy for the abatement of micropollutants and the formation of bromate during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents chon et al 2015 walpen et al 2022 furthermore it has been shown that the combination of uv and edc measurements can provide valuable insights into the dom functional groups which are oxidized and formed typically a more efficient decrease of the edc was observed compared to the uv absorbance önnby et al 2018a wenk et al 2013 this can be interpreted by the oxidation of phenolic moieties leading to quinone type and ring opening products which have a limited capacity to donate electrons to abts but might still have uv absorption properties mvula and von sonntag 2003 önnby et al 2018a ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 wenk et al 2013 3 2 4 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms recent increases in the accessibility of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms instruments including fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ft icr and bench top orbitrap instruments with mass resolution of up to 1 000 000 have led to molecular level characterization of natural organic matter nom rather than attempting to connect peaks on a mass spectrum to specific molecular structures these efforts generally make empirical formula assignments and draw conclusions based on those most commonly h c and o c ratios are compared in van krevelen diagrams andersson et al 2020 gonsior et al 2014 lavonen et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 to infer functional group abundances and degrees of oxidation and to calculate the number of double bond equivalents dbe in the molecules hrms has been applied to study the transformation of dom by ozone in nom isolates remucal et al 2020 these and reemtsma 2005 solid phase extracts from surface waters phungsai et al 2018 2019 and wastewaters phungsai et al 2016 such studies typically find several thousand molecular features i e mass spectral signals corresponding to putative molecules and infer information about dom composition and reactivity from trends in van krevelen diagrams and dbe changes as a function of ozonation and or advanced oxidation processes the strongest effect of ozone is to increase the o c ratio of molecular features by up to 35 at 1 3 mg o3 mg c in dom isolates remucal et al 2020 and by a factor of 3 5 at 2 5 mg o3 mg c in suwannee river fulvic acid these and reemtsma 2005 indicating oxygen transfer reactions in both the presence and absence of tert butanol pointing to a role for both ozone and oh fig 3 remucal et al 2020 double bond equivalents have been generally found to decrease slightly but not as strongly as uv signals phungsai et al 2018 remucal et al 2020 and h c ratios are largely unchanged or slightly increased phungsai et al 2018 remucal et al 2020 these and reemtsma 2005 consistent with ozonation of phenol type functional groups to highly oxygenated lower molecular weight products fig 3 among partially abated compounds those with lower h c ratios i e more aromatic favor reactions with ozone while those with high h c ratios i e more aliphatic favor oh reactions remucal et al 2020 finally oh has been shown to be a more potent initiator of decarboxylation reactions than ozone with loss of co2 seen from 3 5 more molecular features ozonated under oh promoting conditions than in the presence of a radical scavenger remucal et al 2020 3 2 5 use of multiple characterization methods because single methods are not suitable to fully characterize dom a combination of bulk techniques e g uv edc and hrms can be applied to get further insights into dom reactive moieties phungsai et al 2016 remucal et al 2020 fig 4 shows the change of various dom parameters for the ozonation of dom uv absorbance at 254 nm decreases strongly upon exposure to ozone but less so when oh formation is promoted likely due to the preference of ozone for attacking conjugated and aromatic functional groups that are also often chromophores whereas oh can react with the same functional groups through insertion reactions that might not lead to loss of uv absorbance fig 4 uv signal losses greatly exceed the degree of mineralization 10 measured as doc loss remucal et al 2020 edc and suva254 significantly decrease by ozone attack possibly by fragmentation of phenolic groups to ring opening products or oxidation of them to quinone type structures fig 4 while oh does not change edc significantly ozone and oh both modestly increase the oxygen carbon ratio of dom presumably through oxygen transfer and insertion reactions respectively neither ozone nor oh substantially affect the hydrogen carbon ratio fig 4 finally the number of double bond equivalents is modestly decreased by both ozone and oh likely due to loss of alkene and phenolic structures by reactions with ozone fig 4 and loss of double bonds to oh through addition reactions overall available evidence is consistent with the bulk of ozone reactive sites in dom being phenolic and that they react analogously to phenol with ozone leading to oxygen addition and a decrease in molecular weight fig 4 however reactions between ozone and other functional groups as well as reactions with oh likely make some contribution to these bulk phenomena as well 3 2 6 chemical derivatization chemical derivatization has long been used in environmental analytical chemistry such as derivatization of charged haloacetic acids to neutral methyl esters for analysis via gas chromatography domino et al 2003 and derivatization of small polar compounds such as dimethylamine to improve retention on hydrophobic stationary phases prior to liquid chromatography mitch et al 2003a however most applications to date have been to aid in targeted quantification of known compounds more recently progress has been made in using derivatization techniques often borrowed from the synthesis or biochemistry literature to characterize dom and its reactions with oxidants including ozone leading to unwanted byproducts in one example a derivatization reaction was used to block specific ozone reactive functional groups in water to establish the importance of compounds with those functional groups as dbp precursors a reaction used synthetically to protect primary and secondary amines addition of a tert butoxycarbonyl group with di tert butyl dicarbonate einhorn et al 1991 was applied to dom extracts prior to ozonation mccurry et al 2016 the resulting carbamates are much less reactive with ozone than the parent amine compounds which was demonstrated with control experiments using model amines post chlorination after ozone of derivatized dom formed 90 less chloropicrin than in controls establishing primary and or secondary amines as the principal chloropicrin precursors in water sequentially treated with ozone and chlorine a similar approach has been applied for chlorine titrations with and without derivatization of amines to quantify primary and secondary amine moieties in dom essaïed et al 2022 in a more recent study another derivatization reaction was applied to identify amines in water amines in dom extracted by spe were derivatized with either light ordinary or heavy deuterated isotopes of formaldehyde prior to analysis with hrms liu et al 2019 the mass difference between the heavy and light isotopes of the resulting derivatives 4 025 da was used to pinpoint amines among the noise of other compounds in the dom mass spectrum further because primary amines were dimethylated while secondary amines were monomethylated information about amine order could also be extracted from the mass spectra the authors used this technique to identify several dipeptides in water which were then confirmed with analytical standards liu et al 2019 derivatization was also applied to waters disinfected with chlorine chloramines or ozone to identify carbonyl containing compounds suwannee river fulvic acid was derivatized with a hydrazine compound which was either partially deuterated or unlabelled then analyzed via hrms to search for peaks showing characteristic mass differences as described above in liu et al 2019 prior to disinfection most identified compounds in dom before oxidation were polyoxygenated with between five and ten double bond equivalents and were proposed to be lignin type structures liu et al 2020 ozonation led to a greater disappearance of putative lignin structures than chlorine or chloramines liu et al 2020 consistent with selective reactivity toward activated aromatic compounds ozone increased the number of carbonyl containing products relative to controls whereas chlorine and chloramines led to their loss ozone tended to reduce the size of detected carbonyl compounds relative to controls consistent with molecular fragmentation e g via criegee type reactions liu et al 2020 in another study phenolic moieties in dom were derivatized with acetic anhydride to the phenylacetates the latter have a very low reactivity with chemical oxidants and this approach can be used to block phenolic moieties from reaction with e g ozone or chlorine dioxide houska et al 2021 even though this approach works well for synthetic chemicals only part of the electron rich sites could be derivatized potentially due to steric effects houska et al 2021 overall derivatization shows promise as a means of reducing the complexity of analyzing reactions between dom and oxidants by i allowing attribution of oxidation byproduct formation to specific precursor functional groups regardless of the identity of individual precursor molecules and ii adding characteristic functional group specific tags to oxidation reaction precursors and products to deconvolute their signals from analytical noise in complex matrices 4 ozone reaction kinetics and mechanisms 4 1 introduction 4 1 1 general kinetic considerations understanding reaction kinetics is important for predicting micropollutant abatement efficiency during ozonation process von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the abatement kinetics for a micropollutant mp results from the concurrent oxidation by ozone and oh formed from ozone decomposition reactions and can be formulated by the following integrated rate law eq 1 lee and von gunten 2016 1 ln mp t mp 0 k o 3 0 t o 3 dt k oh 0 t oh dt with k o3 and k oh as second order rate constants for the reactions of micropollutant with ozone and oh respectively and with 0 t o 3 dt and 0 t oh dt as ozone and oh exposures respectively lee and von gunten 2016 the oxidant exposure is experimentally determined for a given water matrix and for a specific ozone dose matrix components such as dom nitrite and carbonate significantly influence the stability of ozone and oh and thereby their exposures ozone and oh exposures have been determined for various types of wastewater e g municipal wastewater industrial wastewater landfill leachate and their correlations with the specific ozone doses normalized by doc concentration has been determined lee and von gunten 2016 wildhaber et al 2015 wolf et al 2019 based on this empirical model the micropollutant abatement for a specific ozone dose can be predicted compounds with k o3 higher than 103 m 1s 1 are considered to be well abated during ozonation for typical municipal wastewater with 80 abatement bourgin et al 2018 to determine the fraction of a micropollutant reacting with ozone or oh respectively the rct concept has been developed elovitz and von gunten 1999 it has been experimentally observed that the ratio of the oh and ozone exposures rct is constant for most of the duration of ozone decomposition elovitz and von gunten 1999 elovitz et al 2000a b eq 2 2 r c t 0 t oh dt 0 t o 3 dt 0 t oh dt r c t 0 t o 3 dt substituting 0 t oh dt in eq 1 by r c t 0 t o 3 dt yields a rate law for the abatement of a mp which only depends on the ozone exposure and the rct eq 3 3 ln mp t mp o k o 3 0 t o 3 dt k oh r c t 0 t o 3 dt 0 t o 3 dt k o 3 k oh r c t based on eq 3 the fraction of the oxidation occurring by reacting with oh can be calculated from eq 4 elovitz and von gunten 1999 4 f oh k oh r c t k oh r c t k o 3 the fraction of the mp reaction with oh as a function of the rct and for selected values of k o3 is shown in fig 5 elovitz and von gunten 1999 4 1 2 determination of reaction kinetics second order rate constants for the reactions of ozone with inorganic and organic compounds have been determined experimentally by directly monitoring the decrease of ozone or substrate over time under pseudo first order conditions or by using competition kinetics methods von sonntag and von gunten 2012 to date k o3 for several hundred organic and inorganic compounds have been compiled von sonntag and von gunten 2012 based on this wealth of information regression models employing quantitative structure activity relationships qsar have been developed to predict unknown k o3 for target compounds lee et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2012 sudhakaran and amy 2013 hammett and taft constants are common molecular descriptors which showed reliable prediction results for diverse ozone reactive functional groups lee and von gunten 2012 however empirical parameters such as hammett and taft constants are not always available to overcome this limitation quantum chemically computed molecular descriptors such as orbital energies or average local ionization energies have been assessed showing promising results see fig 8 and ensuing discussion lee et al 2015 tentscher et al 2019 an in silico pathway prediction tool has been developed which includes a module for quantum chemically based prediction of k o3 for target compounds lee et al 2017a the current computed descriptors also have certain caveats e g failing to account for steric effects tentscher et al 2019 and an effort for building better qsar models should be continued a multivariate model containing complementary quantum chemical variables may enhance the model performance additionally ab initio calculations of barrier height δg could be alternative qsar variables which have been successfully applied for predicting k oh minakata and crittenden 2011 however for ozone reactions ab initio calculations suffer from serious uncertainties of up to 5 orders of magnitude trogolo et al 2015 the cause and possible solutions of this issue are worthy of further investigations as an electrophilic agent ozone attacks moieties with high electron density thus any modifications that alter the electron density of the moieties change their ozone reactivity typical examples are dissociating compounds when protonated a dissociating compound has a much lower k o3 than when deprotonated because the electrons of the dissociating center are shared with the proton and less available for ozone see e g aliphatic amines in section 4 5 the protonation can also decrease the electron density inductively or by prohibiting resonance structures available to the deprotonated molecule e g phenolic compounds in section 4 3 another example is compounds substituted by electron donating withdrawing groups typically electron donating groups such as alkyl groups increase k o3 whereas electron withdrawing groups like carbonyl groups decrease k o3 e g olefins with various substituents in section 4 2 an exception exists for heterocyclic compounds some of which have higher k o3 with the addition of carbonyl groups to the ring than without section 4 4 substitution with electron withdrawing groups can result in an increased apparent k o3 at circumneutral ph k o3 app ph7 for dissociating compounds bearing a pk a in the alkaline ph range e g phenolic compounds in section 4 3 4 1 3 transformation products and reaction mechanisms over the last few decades many studies have investigated transformation products formed during ozonation and elucidated ozone reaction mechanisms the principal ozone reaction mechanisms and the corresponding products are summarized in scheme 1 the reaction type i is a carbon carbon double bond cleavage based on the well known criegee mechanism criegee 1975 an ozone molecule is added to a double bond to create an ozonide as a key intermediate which subsequently degrades into carbonyl products this type of reaction is also observed during the reaction of aromatic heterocyclic compounds with ozone opening the ring structure and forming aliphatic products with carbonyl groups aromatic and heterocyclic compounds also undergo reaction type ii leading to the oxygen added ring products via radical intermediates von sonntag and von gunten 2012 reaction types iii and iv show oxygen transfer to the heteroatoms nitrogen and sulfur respectively resulting in the corresponding n oxygenated and s oxygenated products von sonntag and von gunten 2012 nitrogen containing compounds can also react with ozone via electron transfer forming an aminyl radical cation and subsequently a dealkylated amine as shown by reaction type v von sonntag and von gunten 2012 each reaction type is also characterized by the formation of distinct reactive oxygen species for example hydrogen peroxide singlet oxygen and oh are known as byproducts for the criegee mechanism i o addition to heteroatoms iii iv and n c bond cleavage v respectively leitzke and von sonntag 2009 muñoz et al 2001 von gunten 2003b thus identifying quantifying reactive oxygen species can provide additional evidence for certain reaction pathways alternatively reaction mechanisms can be explored by quantum chemical computations an increasing number of studies employs quantum chemical computations to corroborate experimental findings quantum chemical computations can predict initial reaction sites in a given molecular structure by computing molecular descriptors such as orbital energies or assess the thermodynamic feasibility of a proposed reaction mechanism by computing the gibbs free energy tentscher et al 2019 in addition quantum chemical computations can provide insights related to unstable reaction intermediates which escape experimental identification a case in point is the formation of ndma during ozonation of bromide and dimethylsulfamide containing waters for which a detailed mechanism has been proposed based on experimental evidence and quantum chemical computations trogolo et al 2015 in sections 4 2 to 4 9 ozone reaction kinetics and mechanisms are discussed on the basis of ozone reactive functional groups direct ozone reactions are the main focus for most reaction mechanisms as the role of oh is minimal for the first generation transformation products for compounds with high ozone reactivity fig 5 the majority of the recent findings in product analyses were obtained by hrms to discuss hrms results in a clear manner the confidence level system from level 1 to 5 defined by schymanski et al 2014 is employed briefly confidence level 1 indicates a confirmed structure with a reference standard level 2 indicates a probable structure by e g a ms library match level 3 provides some structural information by ms data and compound class level 4 provides an unequivocal molecular formula and level 5 provides an exact mass 4 2 olefins and alkynes olefins are well known ozone reactive functional groups in the 1970s rudolf criegee revealed the key mechanism of the reaction of olefins with ozone characterized by a cycloaddition of ozone to a carbon carbon double bond to form carbonyl compounds as final products via ozonide as a cyclic intermediate reaction type i in scheme 1 criegee 1975 on the basis of this landmark study olefin ozone reactions have been extensively studied in organic solvents and later on the knowledge has been transferred to aqueous solutions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this section focuses on recent findings on k o3 and summarizes briefly the olefin ozone reaction mechanisms and ozonation products of aliphatic olefins cyclic olefins or olefin moieties included in aromatic rings are discussed in separate sections 4 3 aromatic compounds and 4 4 heterocyclic compounds 4 2 1 kinetics 4 2 1 1 kinetics of alkene ozone reactions unsubstituted olefins react fast with ozone with k o3 of approximately 105 m 1s 1 e g ethene k o3 1 8 105 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 in contrast substituted olefins have a wide range of k o3 from 101 to 106 m 1s 1 table s1 supporting information si depending on the nature of the substituents von sonntag and von gunten 2012 fig 6 addition of electron donating alkyl groups increases k o3 e g propene k o3 8 0 105 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 but the magnitude of this effect is generally smaller than for electron withdrawing groups as shown in fig 6 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 this is consistent with induction effects anslyn and dougherty 2006 olefins with multiple electron withdrawing substituents exhibit further decrease in reactivity e g trichloroethene k o3 14 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 tetrachloroethene k o3 0 1 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983b such additive effects of electron withdrawing groups on k o3 were also found in a study on polychloro 1 3 butadienes e g tetrachloro 1 3 butadienes k o3 1 6 102 7 8 103 m 1s 1 pentachloro 1 3 butadienes k o3 0 8 and 10 m 1s 1 and hexachloro 1 3 butadiene k o3 0 1 m 1s 1 lee et al 2017b differences in k o3 also exist among the olefins substituted by the same number of electron withdrawing groups but in different positions i e stereoisomers examples are cis 1 2 dichloroethene k o3 5 4 102 m 1s 1 vs trans 1 2 dichloroethene k o3 6 5 103 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 and e 1 1 3 4 tetrachlorobutadiene k o3 1 1 103 m 1s 1 vs z 1 1 3 4 tetrachlorobutadiene k o3 4 0 102 m 1s 1 lee et al 2017b these significant differences in ozone reactivity between seemingly similar compounds may be explained by the geometry of the transition state in the rate limiting step based on the reaction mechanism discussed in section 4 2 2 the rate limiting step of the ozonolysis reaction likely requires the sp2 carbon s in the double bond to rehybridize to sp3 resulting in a decrease of the c cl or c c bond angle from 120 planar geometry to 109 5 tetrahedral geometry this geometry brings the substituents in the cis position closer to each other and if both substituents are bulky chlorines rather than one chlorine and one methyl group repulsion between these two chlorines in the transition state may potentially explain the lower k o3 observed from the cis isomer of 1 2 dichloroethene besides the induction effects from electron donating withdrawing groups steric effects from bulky substituents can also affect k o3 an example is cis 1 2 dichloroethene k o3 5 4 102 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 vs endrin k o3 0 02 m 1s 1 yao and haag 1991 endrin also has a cis 1 2 dichloroethene moiety but the ozone attack is hindered by the presence of the neighboring chlorinated carbons resulting in a much lower k o3 yao and haag 1991 4 2 1 2 kinetics of alkyne ozone reactions alkynes can react with ozone through a similar reaction mechanism as olefins but with generally lower k o3 for example the k o3 for the reaction of 1 ethinyl 1 cyclohexanol with ozone k o3 2 0 102 m 1s 1 huber et al 2004 is much lower than for buten 3 ol k o3 7 9 104 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 both of which feature the reactive moiety geminal to a substituted alcohol to date there is lack of information on ozonation kinetics of alkynes to make further generalizations about their reactivity 4 2 2 reaction mechanisms the predominant pathway for the reaction of olefins with ozone is through pathway i in scheme 2 in which the first zwitterion a formed in aqueous solutions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 leads to an ozonide b which subsequently forms a second zwitterion c or decomposes via a concerted reaction to the third zwitterion d and a carbonyl product zwitterion d is the branching point where aqueous reactions deviate from reactions in organic solvents in aprotic solvents the zwitterion d recombines with the carbonyl product to produce a criegee ozonide e criegee 1975 in water the zwitterion d rapidly hydrates to α hydroxyalkylhydroperoxide f which reversibly dissociates to hydrogen peroxide and the second carbonyl product complete mass balances were achieved by the corresponding carbonyl products for the reactions of ozone with simple olefins like ethene and propene dowideit and von sonntag 1998 there are minor pathways leading to the formation of partial cleavage products from zwitterion a such as a carbonyl product g a glycol h and an epoxide i all of which contain the two initial olefin carbons still linked by a single bond after ozonation partial cleavage products were observed in early studies in organic solvents typically for sterically hindered compounds like 3 3 dimethyl 2 tert butyl butene and 3 3 dimethyl 2 isoproyl butene in methylene chloride bailey and lane 1967 and 1 1 2 trichloro 1 2 2 trifluoroethene in dichloromethane agopovich and gillies 1980 keay and hamilton 1976 dichloroacetaldehyde was identified as a minor product from ozonating dichloroethane scheme 2 ii dowideit and von sonntag 1998 glycol and carbonyl compounds with two carbon atoms linked were quantified in aqueous ozone reactions from tetramethylethene dichloroethenes and trichloroethene with yields 15 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 scheme 2 iii epoxides were suggested as intermediates in aqueous ozone reactions mostly for olefin moieties in aromatic heteroaromatic compounds but with limited experimental evidence see section 4 2 3 4 2 3 micropollutants many ozone reactive micropollutants in water feature olefin functional groups some important taste and odor compounds in drinking water contain an olefin moiety they can be quickly inactivated during ozonation because of their high k o3 for the reactions with ozone table s1 si examples are 3 hexen 1 ol k o3 5 4 105 m 1s 1 β ionone k o3 1 6 105 m 1s 1 2 6 nonadienal k o3 8 7 105 m 1s 1 and 1 penten 3 ol k o3 5 9 104 m 1s 1 peter and von gunten 2007 microcystins are a class of compounds with multiple ozone reactive sites the olefin moieties are the main ozone reaction sites for most microcystins except the ones with tyrosine and tryptophan substituents mc yr and mc lw respectively kim and lee 2019 onstad et al 2007 as a result primary ozonation products of mc yr and mc lw are likely to contain undamaged olefins and to retain toxicity for small specific ozone doses note that the conjugated olefins of the base structure of microcystins are responsible for hepatotoxicity kim and lee 2019 see section 4 9 for more discussions on compounds with multiple reaction sites the ozone reactions of natural olefinic compounds have also been investigated in the aqueous phase of the atmosphere such as clouds and fogs examples are β caryophyllonic acid k o3 app 4 8 105 m 1s 1 at ph 2 witkowski et al 2019 limononic acid k o3 app 4 2 105 m 1s 1 at ph 2 witkowski et al 2018 and α terpineol k o3 9 9 106 m 1s 1 in the absence of radical scavenger leviss et al 2016 full mineralization of micropollutants is typically not achieved during ozonation olefin containing micropollutants react with ozone leading to the formation of transformation products through pathways listed in scheme 2 the chemical structures of the major transformation products from ozone reactions of selected olefin type micropollutants are provided in table s2 si ozonation of micropollutants containing an olefin moiety such as imazalil genena et al 2011 octinoxate hopkins et al 2017 tamoxifen and toremifene knoop et al 2018 and carbamazepine hübner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 follow the predominant pathway scheme 2 i because there is no steric hindrance on the olefin group this leads to the formation of expected carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes and ketones keto limononic acid was semi quantified by lc ms with a surrogate standard 30 yield after ozonation of limononic acid witkowski et al 2019 for ozonation of α terpineol more than 90 of a primary aldehyde product was expected based on the yields of the subsequent products trans and cis lactol by rearrangement of the aldehyde quantified by nmr leviss et al 2016 for micropollutants containing olefin moieties that are less accessible hindering formation of the initial ozonide such as carotenoids henry et al 2000 acyclovir prasse et al 2012 acetamidoantipyrine favier et al 2015 carbamazepine hübner et al 2014 and tetracycline khan et al 2010 partial cleavage products such as glycol or epoxides have been suggested to be formed scheme 2 iv table s2 si however these reports were based on confidence level 2b by diagnostic evidence and there is no direct confirmation with reference standards of epoxide formation in aqueous ozone reactions alkyne containing micropollutants react with ozone through a mechanism analogous to criegee ozonation of alkenes without any bulky substituent groups nearby complete cleavage products including ketones and carboxylic acids are formed huber et al 2004 4 3 aromatic compounds 4 3 1 kinetics aromatic compounds react with ozone with a large range of second order rate constants k o3 app 0 1 to 109 m 1s 1 basic structures and recently reported examples in table s3 si depending on the substituents unsubstituted arenes react with ozone slowly e g benzene k o3 2 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983b electron donating alkyl substituents modestly increase k o3 e g 14 m 1s 1 for toluene hoigné and bader 1983b as with olefins electron withdrawing substituents reduce k o3 e g 0 57 m 1s 1 for 1 3 dichlorobenzene hoigné and bader 1983b ring substituents featuring lone pairs of electrons which can delocalize into the ring somewhat increase k o3 e g 2 9 102 m 1s 1 for methoxybenzene hoigné and bader 1983b one exceptional class are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which have significantly higher k o3 than benzene or alkylbenzenes e g 3 103 m 1s 1 for naphthalene hoigné and bader 1983b for reasons which have never been fully elucidated phenol and phenol derived compounds have high k o3 table s3 si even in a wastewater matrix with strong scavenging of ozone phenolic compounds can be abated to a large extent by ozone at relatively low specific ozone doses chedeville et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 the apparent k o3 for the reaction of phenol with ozone increases with increasing ph because of greater electron density of phenolate than phenol due to the delocalization of phenolate electron lone pair into the ring the k o3 is 1 3 103 m 1s 1 for phenol which is 6 orders of magnitude lower than for phenolate 1 4 109 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a this corresponds to a half life of 12 s at ph 2 and 10 μs at ph 12 for an ozone concentration of 2 mg l the pk a of phenol and phenol derivatives is a critical parameter for determining k o3 app the apparent second order rate constant at a given ph it is influenced by electron withdrawing or donating groups on the ring for example substitution by halogen or nitro groups decreases the pk a of the hydroxyl group e g the pk a of dibromo phenol is 6 67 serjeant and dempsey 1979 compared to 9 98 for phenol gross and seybold 2001 the k o3 app for the reactions of phenols at different ph can be expressed as eq 5 5 k o 3 a p p k o 3 p h e n o l a t e k a k a h k o 3 p h e n o l h k a h where k a is the acid dissociation constant for a pk a decrease the apparent second order rate constant increases at a given ph even though electron withdrawing groups such as halogens will reduce the electron density of the substituted phenolate relative to the unsubstituted phenolate the net effect can be an increased reactivity at neutral ph the tradeoff effect can be observed by comparing the k o3 app of phenol pk a 9 98 4 chlorophenol pk a 9 2 and 4 nitrophenol pk a 7 2 as a function of ph fig 7 for substituted phenols with lower pk a than the pk a of phenol the k o3 app can be higher at neutral ph than for phenol while at low or high ph the k o3 app are lower a similar trend in k o3 app at neutral ph is observed for substituted nitrogen containing compounds discussed in section 4 6 fig 12 the ozone reactivity of anilines is also influenced by pk a and given ph conditions aniline pk a of conjugate acid 4 6 reacts readily with ozone k o3 app 1 4 107 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 but under acidic conditions the positively charged anilinium has a significantly lower ozone reactivity k o3 app 5 9 104 m 1s 1 at ph 1 5 hoigné and bader 1983a pierpoint et al 2001 because the nitrogen lone pair is unable to delocalize into the ring when protonated substituted anilines have a range of k o3 values depending on the ring substituents table s3 within approximately two orders of magnitude pierpoint et al 2001 tekle röttering et al 2016c qsar methods have been applied to predict k o3 for aromatic compounds based on empirically determined hammett and taft constants lee and von gunten 2012 and quantum chemically computed energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo lee et al 2015 tentscher et al 2019 other tested descriptors include the number of bonds dipole moment partial charge distribution and 3d configuration of the molecule cheng et al 2018 huang et al 2020 jiang et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 in fig 8 k o3 for aromatic compounds are plotted as a function of the e homo tentscher et al 2019 it shows an overall good correlation for various types of aromatic compounds suggesting e homo as a promising quantum molecular descriptor for aromatic ring systems generally for aromatic compounds the predicted k o3 based on both e homo and hammett and taft constants agree well with the experimentally determined k o3 within a factor of 4 lee et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2012 4 3 2 reaction mechanisms the three major pathways for oxidation of aromatic compounds by ozone are oxygen addition electron transfer and the criegee type mechanism scheme 3 of these the most common reaction is oxygen addition to the ring reaction type ii in scheme 1 and pathway i in scheme 3 for activated aromatic compounds with high k o3 e g phenols ozone adduct formation occurs in ortho para position which has an elevated electron density the ozone adduct can then lose singlet oxygen and form a hydroxylated product scheme 3 i mvula and von sonntag 2003 hydroquinones and catechol are the major products through this pathway for phenolate mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 for aniline the major products are p hydroxyaniline and o hydroxyaniline with the sum of all hydroxyanilines accounting for 40 of the initial aniline tekle röttering et al 2016c the second pathway is electron transfer scheme 3 ii it is unclear if this occurs via an ozone adduct formation or a direct electron transfer phenolate reacts with ozone to phenoxyl radical that can further react to benzoquinone ramseier and von gunten 2009 the coupling product 4 4 dihydroxybiphenyl is an artefact of high phenol concentrations in laboratory experiments similar dimerization products were hypothesized from aniline such as 2 amino 5 anilino benzochinon anil and 2 5 dianilino p benzochinon imin which are only expected at high initial concentrations of aniline tekle röttering et al 2016c finally aromatic compounds can react through a criegee type mechanism scheme 3 iii producing ring opening products such as muconic acid ramseier and von gunten 2009 similar products were also observed from the ozone reaction with anisole 1 2 dimethoxybenzene and 1 3 5 trimethpxylbenzene mvula et al 2009 2 pyridine carboxylic acid is a criegee type product detected from ozone reactions with aniline sarasa et al 2002 however it cannot be confirmed that ozone is responsible for its formation because oh was not scavenged in this study for aniline type compounds the sites of ozone attack can also be the nitrogen producing nitrosobenzene nitrobenzene azobenzene and azoxybenzene as products chan and larson 1991 sarasa et al 2002 but these reactions are minor based on the observed low yields 8 tekle röttering et al 2016c ozonation of nitrogen containing compounds will be further discussed in sections 4 5 and 4 6 ring substitution can affect the final products from the reactions of phenol with ozone in a systematic study of phenol substituent effects on product distribution para substituted catechols were found to be the most common products at ph 7 quantified from ozonation of para substituted phenols tentscher et al 2018 but with no obvious trend in their yields with respect to substitution somewhat surprisingly many para substituted phenols formed 1 4 benzoquinone indicating loss of the substituent group during ozonation tentscher et al 2018 quinones have been previously observed as products of chlorophenol ozonation hong and zeng 2002 qiu et al 2004 tentscher et al 2018 utsumi et al 1998 and the dechlorination achieved by ozone tentscher et al 2018 may increase the biodegradability adams et al 1997 hong and zeng 2002 pi et al 2007 qiu et al 2004 utsumi et al 1998 for two para alkylated phenols formation of the corresponding 4 hydroxy 4 alkylcyclohexadienone was observed but not for any other phenols possibly due to the poor leaving group properties of the alkyl substituents preventing further transformation to benzoquinones hydroquinones were only detected as ozonation products from 4 methoxyphenol mequinol and 4 formylphenol and were attributed to reactions other than direct attack by ozone tentscher et al 2018 4 3 3 micropollutants micropollutants and biomolecules bearing aromatic moieties generally react with ozone to produce hydroxylated and or ring opening products analogously to scheme 3 because many of the hydroxylated moieties have higher ozone reactivities than the parent compounds these primary products often escape detection gulde et al 2021a reported ozone induced transformation products of aromatic micropollutants are provided in table s4 si hydroxylated products such as hydroquinone and catechols are expected products of micropollutants scheme 3 i for 17α ethinylestradiol estrone and 5 6 7 8 tetrahydro 2 naphthol ozone was proposed to attack the phenolic moieties to form catechols by an oxygen transfer huber et al 2004 lee et al 2008 benzoquinone formation results from an electron transfer pathway scheme 3 ii ozonation of bisphenol a a widely used industrial chemical forms benzoquinone as the main product along with 3 cyclohexene 1 carboxylic acid ethyl ester and benzaldehyde deborde et al 2008 mutseyekwa et al 2017 the formation of benzoquinones may be of toxicological relevance tentscher et al 2021 one case in point is ozonation of n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n phenyl p phenylenediamine a widely applied tire antiozonant forming a quinone product highly toxic to aquatic organisms tian et al 2021 many ring opening products are expected from ozone reactions with aromatic compounds such as muconic acid or muconic aldehyde scheme 3 iii which can potentially explain dicarbonyl compound formation it has been shown that triazole 4 5 dicarbaldehyde is a product from the ozone attack of benzotriazole mawhinney et al 2012 formation of a dicarbonyl compound was reported from the ozone reaction with bezafibrate dantas et al 2007 when ozone is in excess further oxidation of the muconic type compounds is expected to form small carbonyl species and carboxylic acids such as formic acid ramseier and von gunten 2009 the final products of the ozone oxidation of benzophenone 2 a common photo inhibitor include oxalic acid and formic acid wang et al 2017 these polar and low molecular weight compounds may escape detection for analysis with solid phase extraction and lc hrms ms gulde et al 2021a 4 4 heterocyclic compounds heterocyclic compounds are an important class of functional groups in micropollutants as well as in dom they usually consist of five membered six membered or fused rings and include at least one heteroatom e g n o s in the ring for n containing heterocyclic compounds only unsaturated compounds are discussed in this section the reactions of n containing saturated heterocyclic compounds with ozone are similar to aliphatic amines their acyclic analogues tekle röttering et al 2016a aromatic rings without heteroatoms are discussed in the section 4 3 4 4 1 kinetics heterocyclic compounds are characterized by extraordinarily diverse chemical properties and therefore undergo a wide range of reaction types some react readily with electrophiles while others do not joule and mills 2012 their reactivity with ozone varies widely with reported k o3 from 0 1 m 1s 1 to 108 m 1s 1 table s5 si 4 4 1 1 n containing heterocyclic compounds six membered n containing heterocyclic compounds like pyridine and pyrazine react slowly with ozone with k o3 3 m 1s 1 tekle röttering et al 2016b whereas five membered rings such as pyrrole and imidazole react much faster with ozone with k o3 105 m 1s 1 tekle röttering et al 2020 the surprisingly large difference in k o3 between six and five membered heterocycles seems attributable to the electron distribution in the rings in pyridine resonance withdraws electron density from carbons to the nitrogen fig 9 as a result pyridine carbons become π deficient and thus less reactive towards ozone resonance in pyrrole works in the opposite way pushing the electron density from the nitrogen towards carbons making carbon carbon double bonds more susceptible to an electrophilic ozone attack heterocycles consist often of complex structures with diverse substituents effects of substituents on k o3 for selected heterocyclic compounds are shown in fig 10 i pyrimidine and ii purine derivatives the addition of a carbonyl or an amino group to the pyrimidine or purine significantly increases k o3 all derivatives have higher k o3 than the simple heterocycles by up to 7 orders of magnitude pyrimidine vs 2 4 diamine 5 methylpyrimidine iii pyrrole diazole derivatives unlike pyrimidines and purines pyrrole and imidazole derivatives with a carbonyl or amino group show lower k o3 imidazole vs creatinine for pyrazole derivatives k o3 seems to increase by a carbonyl group pyrazole vs phenazone as for pyrimidines and purines but the benzene ring on a nitrogen of phenazone may also contribute to the increase in k o3 to confirm this it is necessary to compare pyrazole with pyrazole derivatives substituted only by a carbonyl group however kinetic information of such derivatives is currently not available the higher k o3 of uracil than for pyrimidine is especially interesting as the substitution by an electron withdrawing carbonyl group is expected to reduce the ozone reactivity one way to explain these unusual cases with carbonyl substituents is by their resonance structures fig 9 while pyridine lacks in electron density in the ring as discussed above a 1h pyridin 2 one pyridine with a carbonyl substituent develops a higher negative charge on the ring by resonance suggesting a possibly higher k o3 4 4 1 2 o containing heterocyclic compounds generally there is little information on the ozone reactivity of heterocyclic compounds containing heteroatoms other than nitrogen furans five membered heterocyclic rings containing oxygen show high reactivity towards ozone with k o3 app ph 7 104 m 1s 1 table s5 si jeon et al 2016 zoumpouli et al 2021 depending on the type of substituents e g methyl carboxyl groups and their locations on the ring e g α β carbons the k o3 app ph7 varied from 8 5 104 m 1s 1 for furan 2 5 dicarboxylic acid to 3 2 106 m 1s 1 for 3 2 furyl propanoic acid zoumpouli et al 2021 4 4 2 reaction mechanisms heterocyclic compounds react with ozone by various types of mechanisms mostly by reaction type i in scheme 1 which opens the ring by carbon carbon double bond cleavage criegee type mechanism as a result ring opened primary products with two carbonyl groups on each end are formed the ring opened products undergo subsequent reactions sub categorized as i a i b and i c in scheme 4 they are subject to further transformation by ozone to form secondary products with typically a shorter chain length i a examples of such secondary products are quinolinic acid from quinoline with 65 yield andreozzi et al 1992b and glyoxal from pyrrole with 5 yield tekle röttering et al 2020 in a rarer case ring opened products are fully fragmented without further oxidation i b a case in point is imidazole which is transformed to formamide cyanate and formate with 100 yields respectively by a single ozone attack tekle röttering et al 2020 ring opened products are also susceptible to an intramolecular cyclization i c this results in the formation of products with smaller ring size as the parent heterocyclic compounds for example hydantoins with a five membered ring were identified after the reactions of ozone with six membered heterocyclic compounds like uracil matsui et al 1990 and thymine flyunt et al 2002 at yields of 30 although it is unclear whether these products resulted from direct ozone reactions because of lack of information on the use of radical scavengers similar ring products with reduced size were also identified in more controlled experiments in the presence of tert butanol for 2 hydroxypyridine andreozzi et al 1992a and thymidine confidence level 3 funke et al 2021 the reaction type i was also suggested for reactions of furans with ozone based on the formation of ring opened products α β unsaturated dicarbonyl compounds zoumpouli et al 2021 however the products were identified in absence of radical scavengers therefore experimental evidence under more controlled conditions is required to confirm the proposed mechanism of the furan ozone reaction some heterocyclic compounds react with ozone via reaction type ii scheme 1 and scheme 4 in analogy to typical reactions of aromatic compounds with ozone section 4 3 2 in this case oxygen added ring products with the same ring structure as the parent heterocycle are formed the formation of maleimide 34 yield from the reaction of pyrrole with ozone supports an oxygen addition mechanism tekle röttering et al 2020 another ring product structurally close to maleimide called tp2 in the original study was also identified but with unknown yield one heterocyclic compound can react through multiple reaction types as for pyrrole which reacts with ozone via reaction types i and ii in scheme 4 tekle röttering et al 2020 ozone attack on the heteroatom instead of a carbon carbon double bond is rarely reported during ozonation of heterocyclic compounds scheme 4 iii pyridine and pyridazine are transformed to n oxides with yields of 93 andreozzi et al 1991 tekle röttering et al 2016b this n oxide formation is similar to reactions of tertiary amines with ozone as illustrated in reaction type iii in scheme 1 nevertheless high yields of n oxides from heterocycles are unlikely under realistic ozonation conditions because of the low ozone reactivity of pyridine and pyridazine k o3 2 m 1s 1 for both tekle röttering et al 2016b such ozone refractory compounds are mainly oxidized by oh fig 5 which consequently leads to a different spectrum of transformation products during ozonation in absence of tert butanol oh reaction possible pyridine was transformed to ring opened products like formamido oxo acetic acid and oxamic acid andreozzi et al 1991 4 4 3 micropollutants micropollutants often contain heterocyclic moieties which are the main site of ozone attack acesulfame is attacked on the carbon carbon double bond in the ring to form ring opened products susceptible to further oxidation as described in i a in scheme 4 the resulting products are a hydrated form of a carbonyl product and carboxylic acid with 50 and 80 yields respectively scheurer et al 2012 phenazone derivatives favier et al 2015 and benzotriazole mawhinney et al 2012 were also reported to form ring opened products upon ozonation with sufficient ms evidences confidence level 2 but with unknown yields furosemide and ranitidine both of which feature a furan moiety were also suggested to be oxidized at a carbon carbon double bond of furan to form the corresponding ring opened products based on ms results confidence level 2 zoumpouli et al 2021 caffeine was found to be oxidized by ozone to form five and six membered ring products with 20 30 yields resulting from the intramolecular cyclization of an initial ring opened product i c in scheme 4 kolonko et al 1979 in this study however ozonation experiments were conducted in absence of oh scavengers and thus an impact of oh cannot be excluded kolonko et al 1979 carboxy acyclovir containing a purine moiety was attacked by ozone at the carbon carbon double bond shared by the fused six and five membered rings prasse et al 2012 the resulting ozonide intermediate underwent rearrangement of the ring and hydrolyzed to form a final product containing a five membered ring with 100 yield similar to i c in scheme 4 prasse et al 2012 zidovudine a thymidine derivative reacted with ozone at the carbon carbon double bond of the thymine moiety ring opened products via i a as well as ring products by rearrangement via i c were proposed by ms analyses confidence level 3 funke et al 2021 lamotrigine containing a 1 2 4 triazine moiety was oxidized by ozone at the nitrogen to form a n oxide iii in scheme 4 which underwent subsequent oxidation bollmann et al 2016 4 5 aliphatic amines 4 5 1 kinetics aliphatic amines are present in natural waters as part of the dissolved organic nitrogen pool westerhoff and mash 2002 they are also common functional groups of micropollutants bourgin et al 2018 the lone electron pair on the nitrogen of aliphatic amines is susceptible to an electrophilic attack by ozone as a result aliphatic amines in the neutral form react fast with ozone with k o3 ranging from 103 to 108 m 1s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 because of this high ozone reactivity aliphatic amines are considered key ozone reactive moieties at neutral ph aliphatic amines are mostly present in the protonated form because the pk a of the protonated form of aliphatic amines typically lies in the range of 9 11 amines in their protonated form have low reactivities with ozone k o3 0 1 m 1s 1 due to the lack of a lone electron pair hoigné and bader 1983a consequently apparent second order rate constants at ph 7 k o3 app ph7 decrease by 3 4 orders of magnitude relative to k o3 of the neutral form resulting in typical k o3 app ph7 values of 10 to 103 m 1s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the ozone reactivity of aliphatic amines is affected by the nature of substituents that can increase or decrease the electron density of the nitrogen for example an alkyl substituent generally increases ozone reactivity by inductive effects therefore tertiary amines typically have higher second order rate constants for the reaction with ozone than primary and secondary amines von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in contrast amides are practically unreactive towards ozone due to the presence of the electron withdrawing carbonyl group halogen substituents typically decrease the ozone reactivity by an electron withdrawing effect as is shown for methylamine k o3 1 105 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a methylchloramine k o3 8 1 102 m 1s 1 haag and hoigné 1983a and dichloromethylamine k o3 1 10 2 m 1s 1 haag and hoigné 1983a however exceptional cases exist as for monochloramine k o3 26 m 1s 1 haag and hoigné 1983a and monobromamine k o3 40 m 1s 1 haag et al 1984 in comparison to ammonia k o3 20 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a the reason why the electron withdrawing effect by halogens is not as pronounced as expected is not clear in the case of dimethylsulfamide dms the effect of halogenation is even more pronounced for the reactions of dms and br dms with ozone k o3 app 20 m 1s 1 and k o3 app 5 103 m 1s 1 were determined at ph 8 respectively by kinetic modeling of experimental data von gunten et al 2010 this is due to a depression of the pk a of br dms which results in a partially deprotonated amine moiety more aliphatic amine derivatives containing substituents other than alkyl and carbonyl groups are discussed in section 4 6 4 5 2 reaction mechanisms ozonation of tertiary amines has been studied extensively n oxides were identified as major products with high yields 90 for simple tertiary amines with short alkyl chains and micropollutants containing a tertiary amine moiety von sonntag and von gunten 2012 scheme 5 and reaction type iii in scheme 1 besides n oxides dealkylated products were also identified from the reaction of tertiary amines with ozone but as minor products with yields 10 lange et al 2006 lim et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2012 while n oxides are products formed via an oxygen transfer pathway dealkylated products result from an electron transfer pathway involving an amine radical cation as a reaction intermediate von sonntag and von gunten 2012 reaction type v in scheme 1 the mechanisms of the reactions of primary and secondary amines with ozone have also been investigated de vera et al 2017 essaïed et al 2022 lim et al 2019 mccurry et al 2016 shi and mccurry 2020 tekle röttering et al 2016a nitroalkanes were identified as major products yields up to 100 from simple primary and secondary amines lim et al 2019 mccurry et al 2016 scheme 5 a potentially undesirable outcome associated with the formation of nitroalkanes is discussed in section 2 2 2 hydroxylamines were suggested as ozonation products of secondary amines benner and ternes 2009a benner and ternes 2009b tekle röttering et al 2016a von gunten 2003b in analogy to n oxides as ozonation products of tertiary amines however recent studies identified hydroxylamines not as end products but as reaction intermediates that further react with ozone to eventually form nitroalkanes scheme 5 see also section 4 6 this occurs especially under neutral ph conditions where the ozone reactivity of hydroxylamines is typically much higher than the ozone reactivity of amines because of the lower pk a of protonated hydroxylamines compared to protonated amines besides hydroxylamines nitroxides nitrones and nitrosoalkanes have been suggested as other reaction intermediates but only the formation of nitrone was confirmed by an analytical standard during ozonation of a secondary amine lim et al 2019 nitrate is also a final product for ozonation of aliphatic amines along with carbonyl products originating from the carbonaceous part of the amine compounds it was shown that the yields of nitrate were highly variable for primary and secondary amines with a 20 fold molar ozone excess 17 100 de vera et al 2017 essaïed et al 2022 amino acids showed consistently high yields of nitrate under similar ozonation conditions essaïed et al 2022 under these extreme conditions nitroalkanes and n oxides were possibly further oxidized to nitrate certain primary amines form nitrate more efficiently glycine was transformed into nitrate with a 80 yield with a 5 fold ozone excess berger et al 1999 this is in contrast to ethylamine forming nitroethane as the only product under similar ozonation conditions lim et al 2019 nitrate formation during continuous ozonation was used as a surrogate for the potential formation nitro and or nitroso compounds from dom it could be shown that the nitrate formation potential during ozonation was in the range of 13 45 of the dissolved organic nitrogen for 6 different dom sources essaïed et al 2022 overall all types of aliphatic amines primary secondary and tertiary are transformed into products containing n o bonds nitroalkanes n oxides and nitrate with high yields this indicates that aliphatic amines react with ozone mainly via oxygen transfer pathways reaction type iii in scheme 1 additional evidence is provided by high yields of singlet oxygen a byproduct of the oxygen transfer pathway and quantum chemically computed gibbs free energy favoring an oxygen transfer over an electron transfer pathway lim et al 2019 however the reaction pathway can be shifted to some extent under real ozonation conditions where oh is formed as a secondary oxidant and plays a role in oxidizing aliphatic amines fig 5 due to the relatively low k o3 app at neutral ph in this case aliphatic amines undergo hydrogen atom abstraction to form n centered radicals that are subsequently degraded into dealkylated products and ultimately ammonia reaction type v in scheme 1 de vera et al 2017 le lacheur and glaze 1996 4 5 3 micropollutants the formation of n oxides during ozonation has been reported for many pharmaceuticals containing a tertiary amine moiety such as clarithromycin tramadol venlafaxine tamoxifen and toremifene knoop et al 2018 lange et al 2006 lester et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2012 pharmaceuticals containing a tertiary amine moiety in a saturated heterocyclic form such as cetirizine containing piperazine fexofenadine piperidine sulpiride pyrrolidine and amisulpride pyrrolidine were also transformed into n oxides upon ozonation bollmann et al 2016 borowska et al 2016 the formation of n oxides has been also observed in pilot and full scale wastewater treatment plants with ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent bourgin et al 2018 merel et al 2017 zucker et al 2018 once formed n oxides are persistent in the treated water they are not biodegradable during typical aerobic biological post treatments after ozonation bourgin et al 2018 hübner et al 2015 knopp et al 2016 zucker et al 2018 in contrast to the ample evidence of the n oxide formation the formation of hydroxylamines from the oxidation of micropollutants containing secondary primary amines by ozone has been reported to a lesser extent e g propranolol benner and ternes 2009a this is probably because of the further oxidation of hydroxylamines ultimately forming nitro compounds as is shown for sitagliptin a pharmaceutical containing a primary amine moiety hermes et al 2020 the corresponding nitro product of sitagliptin was also detected in pilot scale and full scale ozonation process gulde et al 2021a hermes et al 2020 4 6 other aliphatic nitrogen containing compounds 4 6 1 kinetics various derivatives are related to aliphatic amines by substitution of the nitrogen with heteroatoms e g o n s the k o3 of these compounds are in the range from 1 to 106 m 1s 1 currently available information on k o3 is summarized in fig 11 categorized by characteristic chemical bonds found in the functional groups differences in pk a values result in a different trend in k o3 app as a function of the ph for substituted nitrogen containing compounds in comparison to aliphatic amines fig 12 i n o bond compounds containing n o bonds e g n oxides hydroxylamines nitrones and nitroalkanes are common ozonation products of aliphatic amines section 4 5 2 they show a wide range of k o3 from slow reacting n oxides and nitroalkanes k o3 app ph7 10 m 1s 1 to fast reacting nitrones and hydroxylamines k o3 app ph7 103 m 1s 1 it should be noted that the reported k o3 for the fexofenadine n oxide is associated with other moieties borowska et al 2016 and therefore k o3 of the n oxide moiety would be even lower than 6 m 1s 1 hydroxylamines are especially reactive because of their pk a values 3 5 units lower than the pk a of the amine analogous table s6 si therefore unlike aliphatic amines hydroxylamines remain highly reactive towards ozone at ph 7 where they are dominantly present in the neutral form fig 12 ii n n bond hydrazines and hydrazides react fast with ozone with high k o3 similarly to hydroxylamines their protonated forms have a lower pk a than protonated aliphatic amines table s6 si resulting in high k o3 app ph7 fig 12 daminozide reacts fast with ozone over a wide ph range k o3 105 m 1s 1 for ph 3 9 due to its low pk a of 3 7 iii n n o bond nitrosamines and nitroamines react very slowly with ozone with most k o3 0 5 m 1s 1 mestankova et al 2014 iv n c n n bond the nitrogen of guanidine derivatives is present in the protonated form under most ph conditions because of the high pk a e g 13 6 for guanidine table s6 si as a consequence their k o3 are likely to be low as shown for metformin 1 2 m 1s 1 and creatine 0 5 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a jin et al 2012 v n s o o bond the nitrogen adjacent to sulfur in sulfonamides sulfamides and sulfamates undergoes acid base speciation from the neutral to the deprotonated anionic form table s6 si and therefore k o3 strongly depends on the ph k o3 of the deprotonated forms are 3 105 m 1s 1 for hydrochlorothiazide borowska et al 2016 2 6 102 m 1s 1 for n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole dodd et al 2006 103 m 1s 1 for n n dimethylsulfamide von gunten et al 2010 and 88 m 1s 1 for acesulfame kaiser et al 2013 only hydrochlorothiazide with a pk a 7 0 remains ozone reactive at neutral ph with k o3 app ph7 8 5 104 m 1s 1 while the other compounds show low to moderate k o3 app ph7 4 6 2 reaction mechanisms depending on the substituents the reactions of aliphatic amine derivatives with ozone differ significantly some are attacked by ozone on the nitrogen e g 1 1 dimethylhydrazine whereas others shift the main attack site to an α carbon e g nitroethane section 4 8 1 the reactions for which nitrogen is the main ozone reactive site are summarized in scheme 6 systematic investigations on product formation and reaction mechanisms for this group of compounds are scarce because of the lack of information with model compounds some of the mechanisms are discussed for micropollutants i compounds with n o bond hydroxylamines are quantitatively transformed to nitroalkanes upon ozonation forming nitrones as reaction intermediates lim et al 2019 shi and mccurry 2020 this supports that hydroxylamines are likely involved in the reactions of primary secondary amines with ozone which also form nitroalkanes as final products ii compounds with an n n bond hydrazine hydrazide ozone reactions have been studied mainly with regard to the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a probable human carcinogen upon ozonation one of the two nitrogen atoms is directly attacked by ozone and forms a new n o bond ndma was quantified as final product with high molar yields for 1 1 dimethylhydrazine and daminozide lim et al 2016 and industrial chemicals containing semicarbazides kosaka et al 2009 kosaka et al 2014 hydrazides are also found in heterocycles section 4 4 e g phenazone type pharmaceuticals favier et al 2015 in this case however the main ozone attack site is not the hydrazide nitrogen but an endocyclic double bond iii and iv compounds with n n o and n c n n bonds there is little information on the direct ozone reactions with nitrosamines nitroamines and guanidines mostly because of their low ozone reactivity which will promote an oh oxidation under realistic ozonation conditions fig 5 iv compounds with a n s o o bond typically substitution by electron withdrawing groups reduces the ozone reactivity of the nitrogen in certain cases if the electron withdrawing effect is strong enough that the substituted nitrogen becomes acidic the deprotonated nitrogen is the favorable target site for ozone this was observed for hydrochlorothiazide of which the sulfonamide nitrogen was oxidized by ozone via electron transfer and transformed into chlorothiazide as a primary product borowska et al 2016 in contrast n 4 acetyl sufamethoxazole with the aniline nitrogen deactivated by an amide is likely oxidized by ozone on the isoxazole or the aniline ring rather than on the sulfonamide dodd et al 2006 acesulfame containing a nitrogen substituted by both sulfonyl and amide groups reacts with ozone mainly via an oxidation on the endocyclic double bond scheurer et al 2012 the presence of the second substitution group or other ozone reactive moieties seems a determining factor for assessing the sulfonamide ozone reaction the reaction of n n dimethylsulfamide with ozone was studied in detail because of its potential to form ndma schmidt and brauch 2008 trogolo et al 2015 von gunten et al 2010 the ozone reaction is slow and does not lead to ndma formation however in presence of bromide n n dimethylsulfamide dms reacts fast with hypobromous acid hobr k hobr dms 8 1 108 m 1s 1 with the deprotonated form of n n dimethylsulfamide heeb et al 2017 to a bromamine hobr is formed as a secondary oxidant from the reaction of bromide with ozone haag and hoigné 1983b this intermediate is then further transformed to ndma with a yield of about 50 von gunten et al 2010 see above for kinetic assessment 4 7 organosulfur compounds 4 7 1 kinetics ozonation of sulfur has been observed for at least 75 years such as the reaction of aqueous 2 chloroethyl sulfide with ozone to produce the corresponding sulfoxide price and bullitt 1947 sulfur compounds can exist in oxidation states between ii and vi fig 13 s vi compounds such as sulfate do not react with ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 sulfur containing functional groups in oxidation states vi with the exception of sulfones and analogues react with ozone with generally higher k o3 with increasing sulfur electron density sulfoxides react sparingly with ozone e g dimethylsulfoxide k o3 8 m 1s 1 pryor et al 1984 and compounds with sulfur bonded to carbonyls are moderately reactive e g molinate k o3 5 102 m 1s 1 s ethyl n n dipropylthiocarbamate k o3 5 102 m 1s 1 chen et al 2008 however sulfurous functional groups in lower oxidation states such as thiols thioethers and disulfides react readily with ozone thiols and thioethers react very fast with ozone cysteine k o3 4 104 m 1s 1 methionine k o3 4 106 m 1s 1 pryor et al 1984 thioglycolic acid was found to be completely oxidized within 9 minutes of exposure to 12 mg l ozone gilbert and hoffmann glewe 1990 but oh was not suppressed so the k o3 cannot be determined reactions with disulfides are generally fast e g bis 2 hydroxyethyl disulfide k o3 1 7 105 m 1s 1 trans 1 2 dithiane 4 5 diol k o3 2 1 105 m 1s 1 muñoz et al 2001 with final products being s alkyl sulfinates muñoz et al 2001 cystine is an unusual outlier as a slower reacting disulfide k o3 1 103 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a a difference for which no explanation has been proposed thioether containing β lactam antibiotics react quickly with ozone penicillin and cephalexin were both observed to react quickly with ozone at ph 7 with high k o3 app ph7 of 4 8 103 m 1s 1 and 8 7 104 m 1s 1 respectively dodd et al 2006 penicillin has no other clearly oxidizable functional groups so the k o3 app was interpreted as the species specific k o3 for the reaction with the thioether but cephalexin also features olefin and primary amine functional groups complicating the kinetic interpretation lincomycin and methicillin also react quickly at their thioether sites with k o3 app ph7 of 6 75 105 m 1s 1 and 3 9 104 m 1s 1 respectively qiang et al 2004 jin et al 2012 the thioether of ranitidine was reported to be highly reactive with ozone with a species specific k o3 of 2 0 105 m 1s 1 jeon et al 2016 data on ozone reactions with aromatic sulfur are scarce benzothiazole and analogues were reportedly abated during ozonation of synthetic wastewater derco et al 2011 however no studies to date have reported species specific k o3 or products for benzothiazole reactions with ozone or oh therefore it cannot be determined whether the site of ozone attack was at the sulfur the nitrogen or an aromatic carbon site increased abatement rates at ph 8 5 compared to 5 8 suggested that oh may have been responsible for the benzothiazole degradation implying a low second order rate constant for the reaction with ozone one study measured second order rate constants for benzothiazole reactions with ozone and oh and found them to be k o3 2 3 m 1s 1 and k oh 6 109 m 1s 1 respectively valdés et al 2004 the measurements were made in a solution with continuous ozone sparging during which the concentration of ozone and oh may be somewhat unstable nevertheless these measurements are useful as preliminary estimates after ozonation of secondary municipal wastewater effluent at 0 6 mg o3 mg doc the benzothiazole concentration was found to decrease by 70 in one study hollender et al 2009 but in another after ozonation at 0 81 mg o3 mg doc benzothiazole was observed to be abated by only 7 margot et al 2013 and the reason for the discrepancy is unclear 4 7 2 reaction mechanisms information on the mechanisms and products of sulfur reactions with ozone are relatively scarce but available evidence points to oxygen transfer reactions as the dominant pathway with sulfoxides being the most commonly reported product functional groups reaction type iv in scheme 1 ozonation of methionine was found to convert the thioether to the corresponding sulfoxide as the quantitative product muñoz et al 2001 ozonation of thioglycolic acid was reported to first lead to a dimerization to the corresponding thioether thiodiglycolic acid although no mechanism was proposed gilbert and hoffmann glewe 1990 this thioether was then reported to undergo a series of further ozonation reactions first to the sulfoxide then the corresponding sulfone then to the sulfonic acid finally at high ph fragmentation and further oxidation produced sulfate and oxalic acid gilbert and hoffmann glewe 1990 because no oh scavenger was used involvement of oh in the fragmentation reaction seems likely the thioether of penicillin g was reported to be ozonated quantitatively to the corresponding sulfoxide while for cephalexin the criegee product is also observed from alkene scission in addition to oxidation of the thioether dodd et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation of reduced sulfur seems to occur generally via stepwise oxygen transfer reactions increasing the oxidation state by 2 at each step scheme 1 iv however it is currently unknown why some reduced sulfur compounds appear to stop at the sulfoxide as a stable product while others proceed further in the presence of ozone to the sulfone sulfonic acid and possibly sulfate in experiments with oh scavenging direct ozone oxidation beyond sulfones to sulfonic acids and sulfate has not yet been conclusively established the role of ozone versus oh in breaking c s bonds to fragment sulfones is also unclear at present however oh involvement seems likely as sulfones have no obvious available sites for ozone reactions 4 8 other functional groups while the majority of research on ozonation of organic compounds has focused on electron rich moieties such as olefins activated aromatic compounds reduced nitrogen and reduced sulfur ozone may attack other functional groups as well comparatively less is known about these reactions but ozone has been shown to oxidize carbanions produced by the deprotonation of relatively strong carbon acids to react fast with a β diketone and to directly functionalize certain carbon hydrogen bonds by hydride transfer or other mechanisms 4 8 1 carbanions despite a lack of obviously oxidizable functional groups i e no carbon carbon double bonds no activated aromatic moieties no lone pairs on n or s some alkyl compounds with electron withdrawing substituents have been observed to react with ozone however these reactions are typically slow and under realistic ozonation conditions the reactions with oh will dominate fig 5 nitroethane was reported to have a k o3 app of 3 4 m 1s 1 at ph 7 lim et al 2019 ozonation of the amino acids serine le lacheur and glaze 1996 and glycine berger et al 1999 de vera et al 2017 mccurry et al 2016 and other amino acids and amines essaïed et al 2022 produces nitrate upon exposure to excess ozone potentially implicating further oxidation of an oxime de vera et al 2017 lim et al 2019 or nitro intermediate mccurry et al 2016 the latter of which lacking any clear ozone attack sites one explanation for these reactions is an ozone attack of a carbanion conjugate base of electron deficient structures such as nitroalkanes pk a 14 anslyn and dougherty 2006 aqueous oxidation of carbanions has been reported for chlorine orvik 1980 and has been proposed to explain halonitromethane formation from nitromethane mccurry et al 2016 orvik 1980 shi and mccurry 2020 and halonitroalkane formation from the ε nitro analogue of lysine during chlorination mccurry et al 2016 less is known about carbanion reactions with ozone but carbanion intermediates have been proposed in the synthesis literature as sites for electrophilic ozone attack the carbanion resonance structure of nitrones was invoked to explain electrophilic attack of ozone on nitrone carbon erickson and myszkiewicz 1965 leading to aldehydes and c nitroso compounds ozone reactions with deprotonated secondary nitro compounds to ketones were rationalized by invoking a nitronate structure mcmurry et al 1974 which is in resonance with the corresponding nitroalkyl anion scheme 7 deprotonation of a malonate derivative to the corresponding carbanion and subsequent carbanion oxidation was proposed to explain the hydroxylation of the central acidic carbon by ozone white and egger 1984 kinetic data on carbanion oxidation are scarce based on reported k for the reaction with chlorine the deprotonation of nitromethane pk a 10 2 to nitromethyl anion is the rate limiting step below ph 11 5 rather than oxidation of the corresponding carbanion orvik 1980 it is unclear why deprotonation is the rate limiting step during neutral oxidation of nitromethane in contrast to other weak acids in which the conjugate base is more reactive e g phenol for which the reaction can be successfully modeled assuming base in equilibrium with acid regardless it appears likely that deprotonation of nitromethane will also be rate limiting at neutral ph for the reaction with ozone given that ozone reactions generally proceed with higher k o3 than reactions with chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 von gunten 2003b the species specific second order rate constant for hocl reacting with the nitromethyl anion was reported to be 9 5 103 m 1s 1 orvik 1980 which is likely a lower bound for its reaction rate constant with ozone to date the only reported k o3 for carbanions are for nitroethane k o3 app 3 4 m 1s 1 at ph 7 lim et al 2019 and malonate k o3 7 2 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a wherefore determining structure activity relationships is not possible however it is likely that as with phenols phenolates or amines carbanions and their conjugate acids will be subject to a tradeoff in which increasing electron withdrawing substituents will decrease the pk a and shift speciation from the unreactive neutral acid to the reactive base while also decreasing electron density at the nucleophilic site scheme s1 si to date the net effect of these competing phenomena is not clear and should be investigated further however in each of these pathways ozone would be competing against oh for reactive sites and ozone reactions will rarely be more important than oh reactions because at rct values typical of water and wastewater 10 8 10 9 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone reactions with an apparent second order rate constant below 5 50 m 1s 1 will be less important than oh reactions with the same compound fig 5 4 8 2 β diketones despite the presence of electron withdrawing carbonyl groups simple β diketones e g acetylacetone dimedone exhibit generally high reactivities towards various oxidants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide and permanganate deborde and von gunten 2008 hoigné and bader 1994 jáky et al 2006 acetylacetone shows very high reactivity towards ozone with k o3 app ph7 5 1 105 m 1s 1 houska et al 2021 the reason for the unusually high reactivity for β diketones is not entirely clear like the nitroalkanes discussed in the previous section β diketones are present in different forms in aqueous solution due to tautomerization keto and enol form and dissociation enol and enolate with the enolate featuring a carbanion resonance structure scheme 8 the relative contributions of these different forms to ozone reactivity should be carefully assessed because β diketones are common moieties of dom understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of their reactions with ozone is highly relevant to predict potential oxidation byproducts and warrants further investigation 4 8 3 hydrocarbons for compounds with no ozone reactive moieties limited ozone reactivity has still been observed at the site of carbon hydrogen bonds four possible mechanisms have been proposed including h abstraction direct electron transfer hydride transfer and insertion von sonntag and von gunten 2012 k o3 spanning seven orders of magnitude 50 m 1s 1 have been reported for more than 25 of such compounds von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the most ozone reactive compound in this category formate has been reported to have a species specific k o3 of 46 5 m 1s 1 when measured with careful oh scavenging reisz et al 2014 this reaction proceeds primarily through hydride transfer with some contribution from h abstraction leading to co2 as the primary product however the reason for the unusually high k o3 for a hydrocarbon is still unknown reisz et al 2014 ozonation of tert butanol k o3 10 3 m 1s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 was found to proceed to butan 2 one via hydride transfer from one of the methyl groups followed by methyl transfer to the carbanion and oxygen deprotonation reisz et al 2014 likewise hydride transfer was found to be the dominant mechanism of 2 propanol k o3 2 7 0 1 m 1s 1 reisz et al 2018 and 1 propanol k o3 0 64 0 02 m 1s 1 reisz et al 2019 oxidation leading to acetone and propionaldehyde acid as the major products respectively while direct c h bond oxidation with ozone is possible because the corresponding k o3 are low under most circumstances relevant to water treatment oh reactions will dominate transformation of these compounds fig 5 4 9 compounds with multiple ozone reaction sites the ozone reactive moieties discussed individually throughout section 4 can be present simultaneously within a molecule one way to determine the main reaction site is by studying the moiety specific reactivity with model compounds representing key substructures of a target compound this approach was applied to study the reaction of ozone with compounds with complex structures such as pharmaceuticals dodd et al 2006 huber et al 2004 jeon et al 2016 and cyanotoxins onstad et al 2007 if a compound contains multiple ozone reactive moieties including ionizable groups such as aliphatic amines or phenols the reactivity of the main reaction site alters as a function of the ph for example ozone attacks mainly at an amine moiety at a ph higher than the protonated amine s pk a i e where the neutral amine is dominant at ph pk a the ozone reactivity of the amine moiety significantly decreases due to protonation section 4 5 in this case the main reaction site is shifted to another moiety that is not affected by ph e g olefin an example is tamoxifen contains a tertiary amine and an olefin of which species specific k o3 for the neutral and the protonated forms are 3 2 108 m 1s 1 and 1 6 104 m 1s 1 respectively knoop et al 2018 in contrast to the typical k o3 of 0 1 m 1s 1 for the protonated form of simple aliphatic amines von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the k o3 of the protonated tamoxifen is still very high indicating the shift of the reaction site from the amine moiety to the olefin the second reactive moiety in this sense the species specific k o3 for the neutral and protonated forms of tamoxifen can be considered the moiety specific k o3 for the amine and olefin moieties respectively by combining the moiety specific k o3 of the two reaction sites amine and olefin with the degree of protonation of the amine moiety the fraction of ozone attacking at the amine moiety of tamoxifen at a specific ph can be expressed as eq 6 6 f r a c t i o n o f o z o n e a t t a c k a t a m i n e k o 3 a m i n e n 1 α k o 3 a m i n e n h α k o 3 a m i n e n 1 α k o 3 a m i n e n h α k o 3 o l e f i n where α h h k a is the degree of protonation of the amine moiety of tamoxifen r3nh r3n based on the reported pk a 9 49 knoop et al 2018 k o3 amine n is the moiety specific k o3 for the amine moiety neutral form i e 3 2 108 m 1s 1 knoop et al 2018 k o3 olefin is the moiety specific k o3 for the olefin moiety approximated by the reported species specific k o3 for the protonated tamoxifen i e 1 6 104 m 1s 1 knoop et al 2018 k o3 amine nh is the moiety specific k o3 for the amine moiety as the protonated form arbitrarily given 0 1 m 1s 1 according to the typical k o3 for protonated amines fig 14 shows the calculated ozone attack at the amine moiety for selected pharmaceuticals containing multiple reaction sites based on eq 6 by extending the approximation to other secondary reaction sites aromatic and sulfur moieties depending on the difference of moiety specific k o3 the main reaction site at a specific ph can differ significantly fig 14 for tamoxifen the moiety specific k o3 for the neutral tertiary amine is about four orders of magnitude higher than for the olefin 3 2 108 m 1s 1 and 1 6 104 m 1s 1 respectively knoop et al 2018 this results in 98 of ozone attack at the tertiary amine at ph 7 despite the predominance of the protonated form of the amine tamoxifen pk a 9 5 in contrast for nortriptyline with a comparable pk a of 10 2 the difference in the moiety specific k o3 is smaller k o3 4 3 105 m 1s 1 for the neutral secondary amine and 2 1 103 m 1s 1 for the olefin benitez et al 2013 as a consequence at ph 7 nortriptyline is oxidized by ozone mostly at the olefin moiety the pk a of amine moieties also plays a role in determining the main reaction site for a given ph the k o3 of the thiazine moiety of cephalexin is as high as the k o3 of the primary amine moiety 8 2 104 m 1s 1 and 9 3 104 m 1s 1 respectively dodd et al 2006 see the structure in figure s1 si at ph 7 cephalexin is attacked by ozone at the amine moiety with a moderate proportion 33 because of a pk a of 7 1 more acidic than typical primary amines due to the presence of a carbonyl as a neighboring group at higher ph the thiazine and the amino groups contribute similarly to the oxidation of cephalexin by ozone due to the similar k o3 for the two moieties many heterocyclic moieties contain an ionizable nitrogen as well as a carbon carbon double bond within a cyclic structure therefore identifying the main ozone reaction site within a heterocyclic moiety can be challenging regioselectivity prediction by quantum chemical computations could be especially useful in these cases computed molecular descriptors such as average local ionization energies orbital energies and bond dissociation energies can describe where the ozone reaction would preferentially take place within a molecule tentscher et al 2019 and have been applied recently in an ozone pathway prediction system lee et al 2017a and for studying the ozone reaction for selected heterocyclic compounds chen et al 2019 yao et al 2020 5 kinetics of the reaction of ozone with macromolecules antibiotic resistance gene arg inactivation and dna oxidation some macromolecules e g dom are highly heterogeneous and therefore their reactions with ozone are largely assessed in terms of the effect on bulk parameters e g specific uv absorbance edc etc or elemental ratios see section 3 2 however because biomolecules e g proteins nucleic acids are often macromolecules consisting of known sequences of discrete subunits e g amino acids nucleobases they present an opportunity to predict the kinetics of macromolecule in ozonation as the aggregation of reactions with individual subunits for which reactivities with ozone are generally known one example is the reaction of ozone with antibiotic resistance genes discussed below 5 1 ozonation of antibiotic resistant bacteria concerns about the potential for wastewater treatment facilities to act as breeding grounds for antibiotic resistant bacteria dodd 2012 pruden et al 2013 rizzo et al 2013 zarei baygi et al 2019 have led to interest in the use of ozone and other disinfectants for antibiotic resistance control antibiotic resistance inactivation presents a special challenge for chemical disinfectants for ordinary microorganisms the outcome is agnostic of the means of action i e inactivating a bacterium by oxidizing its cell membrane proteins and or its dna both achieve the same outcome however for antibiotic resistant bacteria inactivating the organism does not guarantee loss of the potential for antibiotic resistance as multiple mechanisms of antibiotic resistance gene arg horizontal transfer exist including uptake by non resistant organisms of args from dead cells particularly if their cell membranes are lysed during disinfection dodd 2012 additionally several studies have indicated the possibility for antibiotic resistance rebound after disinfection in which the absolute and or relative abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb increases after disinfection czekalski et al 2016 iakovides et al 2019 finally the disinfection process may select for arbs over non resistant populations alexander et al 2016 therefore in addition to the interest in arb inactivation attention has more recently been focused on inactivation of the args themselves which is the primary subject of this critical review as with most microorganisms ozone rapidly inactivates antibiotic resistant bacteria pak et al 2016 achieving for instance 3 4 log inactivation of sulfonamide resistant e coli j53 after application of 0 08 mg l ozone in buffered deionized water czekalski et al 2016 arb inactivation in secondary wastewater effluent is also highly effective 2 log inactivation of trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole resistant e coli was achieved with specific ozone doses as low as 0 25 mg o3 mg doc in secondary effluent and was unaffected by the addition of hydrogen peroxide iakovides et al 2019 5 2 ozonation of antibiotic resistance genes inactivation of args by ozone has been widely measured including in clean systems czekalski et al 2016 he et al 2019 secondary wastewater effluent alexander et al 2016 ben et al 2017 czekalski et al 2016 iakovides et al 2019 lamba and ahammad 2017 zheng et al 2017 zhuang et al 2015 sludge pei et al 2016 and cow manure cengiz et al 2010 early quantification of arg depletion by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in clean systems reported 1 5 log abatement of the arg sul1 with an ozone dose of 0 2 mg l applied to arg containing e coli at a contact time of 30 minutes i e complete ozone depletion in buffered ultrapurified water at ph 7 4 czekalski et al 2016 ozonation conducted at rapid time scales with quench flow kinetics revealed that arg inactivation happens subsequent to cell inactivation czekalski et al 2016 potentially supporting the hypothesis that cell membranes must first be ruptured to expose args to bulk solution before they can be inactivated dodd 2012 however previous studies on bacterial inactivation by ozone found nearly complete inactivation at very low specific ozone doses 0 2 mg o3 mg doc for 15 s occurring prior to cell membrane destruction ramseier et al 2011b leaving open the possibility of ozone diffusion into the cell leading to arg oxidation a study aiming to measure the ozonation kinetics of args themselves ozonated extracellular dna extracted from an antibiotic resistant strain of bacillus subtilis in buffered deionized water the k o3 of four amplicons 266 1017 base pairs of the arg blt were measured to be 1 8 6 9 104 m 1s 1 corresponding to an average per base k o3 of 65 m 1s 1 he et al 2019 based on the average of the k o3 of the four amplicons a pseudo first order rate constant with 0 04 mm 2 mg l ozone would be 2 1 s 1 corresponding to a half life of 0 33 s previously the k o3 of calf dna oxidation was measured and the per base k o3 was 410 m 1s 1 theruvathu et al 2001 the rate of dna oxidation by ozone was slower than would be predicted if dna strands reacted equivalently to a mixture of their component nucleobases if it is assumed that a reaction between ozone and any of the nucleobases on a strand of dna is sufficient to degrade it measured by pcr signal then degradation kinetics should be controlled by the sum of the reactions between each of its nucleobases and ozone as follows eqs 7 and 8 explained in text s1 si 7 d d n a d t d n a o 3 k o 3 d n a 8 k o 3 d n a m k a n k g q k c p k t where m n q and p are the sums of adenine a guanine g cytosine c and thymine t bases per strand of dna and k a k g k c and k t are the respective second order rate constants for their reactions with ozone before calculating the overall predicted rate of dna oxidation the acid base speciation of nucleobases must be accounted for by converting species specific k o3 to ph dependent k o3 app for each nucleobase as shown in table s7 si computing this overall predicted k o3 from the shortest 266 bp amplicon in he et al 2019 leads to an overall expected k o3 for the reaction between ozone and the amplicon of 6 49 106 m 1s 1 and a specific per nucleobase k o3 of 2 40 104 m 1s 1 table s8 si approximately 370 times higher than that observed by he et al 2019 and 59 times higher than observed with calf dna theruvathu et al 2001 the reasons for this discrepancy between the predicted and observed k o3 for dna in clean systems are not immediately clear but several possibilities exist one option is analytical artifacts dna abatement during disinfection is commonly monitored by qpcr mckinney and pruden 2012 yoon et al 2017 but a single modification at certain sites may be insufficient to eliminate or drastically reduce amplification efficiency sikorsky et al 2004 2007 leading to underprediction of the extent of dna damage additionally different amplification efficiencies of damaged dna are observed when using different polymerase reagent kits hajibabaei et al 2005 and certain polymerase reagents are specifically designed to amplify damaged dna robertson et al 2014 another possibility is tertiary structure leading to reduced reactivity due to steric shielding of ozone targets from the bulk solution as is observed during protein oxidation in which some oxidizable residues may be buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein and unavailable for oxidation reactions choe et al 2015 jensen et al 2012 lundeen and mcneill 2013 sivey et al 2013 finally one possibility to explain the dramatically lower k o3 observed for dna than would be predicted based on the sum of the constituent nucleobases is an increase in the pk a of nucleobases due to a combination of hydrogen bonding between bases and pi stacking interactions these interactions have been reported to increase the pk a of protonated nucleobases by up to 3 4 orders of magnitude which in some cases a c could convert the majority of the bases from their neutral or negatively charged reactive forms to their charged forms which are nearly inert tang et al 2007 wilcox et al 2011 however performing the same calculation as in table s7 si but assuming that the pk a of all nucleobases is 1 4 units higher produces only a modest decrease in calculated k o3 app therefore this pk a shift alone is unlikely to explain the discrepancy between calculated and observed k o3 of dna ozonation the reason that a dramatic pk a shift fails to produce a major change in outcome is likely that overall reactivity appears dominated by thymine table s7 si and the protonated form of thymine is still quite reactive with ozone k o3 4

chromosomal vs plasmid intracellular vs extracellular dodd 2012 and issues potentially related to the lower reactivity of dna than one would predict as discussed above 6 conclusions due to a significant knowledge gain in the ozone chemistry in aqueous solution and shifts in application of ozonation processes this critical review highlights the most important aspects of the ozone chemistry and applications as follows a paradigm shift in the application of ozone for impaired water qualities enhanced wastewater treatment water reuse needs a new focus on higher levels and different types of dissolved organic matter dom than for typical drinking water applications furthermore bromate formation has to be carefully monitored due to sometimes higher and variable levels of bromide several bulk parameters uv absorbance electron donating capacity and high resolution mass spectrometry can be applied to elucidate changes in dom properties and or used as proxies to monitor and control ozonation processes for micropollutant abatement an updated compilation of the kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of the main reactive functional groups olefins activated aromatic compounds nitrogen containing compounds sulfur containing compounds and relatively less known functional groups carbanions hydrocarbons β diketones with ozone is provided the kinetics of ozone reactions have been used to assess the main reaction site of the organic compounds containing multiple reactive functional groups to anticipate the formation of transformation products the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes by ozone are discussed in comparison to the reactivity of dna and a paradox of different reaction kinetics is highlighted the consequences of the formation of oxidation byproducts from dom and transformation products from micropollutants are not discussed in this review however this compilation of ozone reaction mechanisms will be the basis to

16222,lake geoengineering with phosphorus p inactivating materials to reduce sediment p loading is often used for eutrophication control the redistribution of materials in sediment especially those induced by resuspension is reportedly a common phenomenon during practical applications which may interfere with the pollution control notably a recent study by the authors initially found that the heterogeneous properties of materials and sediments varied the p immobilization in different sized sediments which exhibited diverse movement characteristics therefore this study hypothesizes a particle size related vertical redistribution of materials in the sediment profile induced by resuspension which shapes sediment p immobilization at different depths based on two differently sized materials lanthanum la modified bentonite clay phoslock and drinking water treatment residue dwtr this study found a weakened reduction of mobile p and bioavailable p pool by both dwtr and phoslock in surface sediment after resuspension as the depth decreased from 12 to surface 0 1 cm the remaining mobile p increased from 7 11 10 8 to 11 0 17 8 of the total p in the sediment with phoslock and from 1 66 4 73 to 9 70 20 7 of the total p in the sediment with dwtr meanwhile bioavailable p pool reduction proportions decreased from 48 6 72 3 to 3 23 45 1 for phoslock and from 51 5 71 4 to 4 94 25 2 for dwtr further analysis verified the hypothesis of this study importantly the redistributions of the potential target p including mobile and bioavailable p for immobilization were regulated by relatively small sediments e g 8 μm fraction which tended to become enriched in surface sediment after resuspension while relatively large materials e g 63 μm fraction regulated their redistributions and were more likely to be buried at the bottom of the sediments accordingly to design appropriate strategies for lake geoengineering relatively small materials e g 8 μm targeting to immobilize both mobile and bioavailable p are typically recommended to be developed for restoration of lakes with frequent sediment resuspension graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication lake particle size internal p pollution sediment p immobilization 1 introduction excessive phosphorus p in lake ecosystems mainly due to increased external p loading from frequent human activities is a primary cause of eutrophication horppila 2019 recent studies have shown that the accumulated p in sediment from loaded external p zhang et al 2021b could be re released leading to internal p pollution and creating an essential source of excessive p in lake water chai et al 2020 xu et al 2020 the importance of controlling internal p pollution has been widely recognized especially when external p pollution has been effectively reduced li et al 2021a wang et al 2021b since internal p pollution predominately results from the excessive loading of external p accompanied by relatively low sediment p deposition wang and jiang 2016 lake geoengineering based on in situ p immobilization by dosing p inactivating materials is a commonly considered strategies to rebuild p balance and control eutrophication lürling et al 2016 successful application of the immobilization method has been globally reported in many lakes copetti et al 2016 however in situ p immobilization still faces a crisis of confidence due to various unexpected remediation observed immers et al 2015 ozkundakci et al 2011 which could result from inappropriate or poorly designed applications spears et al 2014 accordingly assessing the feasibility of this method under various lake background conditions has been widely recognized as essential to provide support for internal p pollution control de lucena silva et al 2019 li et al 2021b for the reason that sediment p immobilization by p inactivating materials is mainly through physicochemical reactions between p and metals the responses of these reactions to different physicochemical conditions e g ph organic matter and redox conditions have attracted special attention from scientists kong et al 2021 reitzel et al 2017 zeller and alperin 2021 many studies have demonstrated highly stable physicochemical reactions for p immobilization using various p inactivating materials wang and jiang 2016 notably practical applications indicate that the redistribution of p inactivating materials in sediment typically induced by sediment resuspension may interfere with the effectiveness of the in situ p immobilization method egemose et al 2013 james et al 2011 welch and cooke 1999 although the resuspension has been reported to have a limited effect on the physicochemical reactions of immobilizing soluble p egemose et al 2010 funes et al 2021 yin et al 2017 sediment resuspension can lead to the movement of sediments to the overlying water and redistribution of sediments at the lakebed li et al 2018 thus resuspension has been found to induce the burial of materials lewandowski et al 2003 meis et al 2013 welch and cooke 1999 mediating the distributions of materials and p in sediment egemose et al 2013 james et al 2011 ozkundakci et al 2011 this suggests that sediment resuspension varies the performance of the p immobilization method because of migrating materials and not because it affects p immobilization reactions by materials sediment resuspension is a critical physical process in lakes especially those with strong hydrodynamic disturbances jalil et al 2019 wang et al 2015 accordingly this study aimed to determine the redistribution characteristics and mechanisms of p inactivating materials in sediments induced by the resuspension thereby providing support for the development of appropriate p immobilization strategies notably a recent study by the authors initially found that the heterogeneous properties of p inactivating materials and sediments caused varied immobilization in sediments of different sizes which exhibited diverse movements with hydrodynamic disturbances wang et al 2022 therefore this study hypothesized that sediment resuspension induced the particle size related vertical redistribution of p inactivating materials in the sediment profile which further shaped sediment p immobilization at different depths many modified materials industrial by products and chemical agents have been developed for p immobilization methods lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 and the hypothesis herein was verified using two common materials namely lanthanum la modified bentonite clay phoslock and drinking water treatment residue dwtr these materials have different particle size distributions as detailed in section 2 1 phoslock developed by csiro australia has been increasingly applied to control internal p pollution of lakes douglas 2002 copetti et al 2016 dwtr is a by product of potable water production and often contains high aluminum al and iron fe concentrations due to coagulant utilization during water treatment processes and has been found to effectively inhibit p release from sediments kuster et al 2021 based on the determined redistribution characteristics and mechanisms recommendations were provided for the practical application of lake geoengineering to control internal p pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection and preparation block shaped dwtr was sampled from a drinking water treatment plant in beijing china and was air dried and crushed the basic dwtr properties have been previously investigated wang et al 2021a phoslock was purchased from a branch of the phoslock company in china additionally lake water and sediments were sampled from lake xuanwu 118 47 n 32 4 e one of the three famous shallow lakes along the south of the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china overlying water samples at a depth of 10 cm and surface sediment samples from 0 to 10 cm were collected from lake xuanwu collected samples were filtered through a 2 mm sieve to remove impurities as detailed in section 2 2 2 then mixed completely and stored at 4 c the particle size distributions of the raw sediment phoslock and dwtr showed relatively large differences table s1 in brief sediment was dominated by 8 and 8 16 μm particles accounting for 32 1 and 28 4 of the total phoslock was dominated by 8 μm particles accounting for 43 8 and dwtr was dominated by fractions of 63 0 μm particles accounting for 52 4 of the particles 2 2 sediment redistribution tests 2 2 1 resuspension test as described in section 1 sediment redistribution in lake ecosystems is predominately caused by sediment resuspension thus sediment redistribution tests were based on resuspension tests the resuspension test was carried out based on a column with a height of 1 35 m and inner diameter of 0 14 m figure s1 following the procedures of previous studies you et al 2007 disturbances were implemented from the side and top of the columns based on stirring to reduce potential whirlpool effects sediments of 0 10 m height were packed at the bottom and lake water was slowly siphoned in to obtain 1 00 m of overlying water sediments were incubated for 14 days to ensure stabilization then the p inactivating materials were evenly dosed leading to 1 2 cm of materials capping the surface sediment such dosing procedures are a method often used in practical applications wang and jiang 2016 after the materials had completely settled for 1 d the columns were used for the resuspension test then further incubated for 1 and 40 d sediment resuspension tests included the resuspension and settlement stages during the resuspension stage the disturbance intensities gradually increased until the sediments were completely resuspended with intensities of approximately 1 3 m s continuous stirring was performed for 1 h and then the settlement stage was carried out to investigate the settlement effect comprehensively three disturbance intensities i e 0 000 0 020 and 0 030 m s were adopted during the settlement stage overlying water samples were intermittently collected between depths of 0 10 and 0 80 m until the suspended solids ss changed little within 96 h after the resuspension test sediments were collected at different depths for analysis 2 2 2 test methodologies in this study the dosages of the materials were approximately 10 of the sediment dry weight wang et al 2017a to obtain intuitive results regarding sediment redistribution after resuspension uniform sediments were prepared impurities e g macroscopic gravel in sediments were removed dong et al 2016 and the sediments were then homogenized egemose et al 2010 considering that this preparation destroyed the sediment structures pre incubation 14 d of packed sediments in the columns were utilized for stabilization moreover further incubation of the columns after material addition 1 and 40 d was used to assess the effect of incubation time on the redistribution of the amended sediment according to previous studies colomer et al 2019 egemose et al 2010 incubation times of 14 and 40 d were sufficient for sediment and material stabilization additionally the relatively low disturbance intensities adopted during the settlement stage of the resuspension tests were due to the fact that practical lake hydrodynamic disturbances are often dominated by relatively low intensities jalil et al 2017 a depth of 0 10 m was adopted for sediment packing as lake surface sediments at such depths are the most reactive layer involved in various physical chemical and biological processes wang and jiang 2016 2 3 overlying water and sediment properties analysis the disturbance intensity was reflected by the flow velocity ls300a china and determined at 0 10 m above the sediments the membrane filtration method was applied to determine ss yin et al 2016 the particle size distributions of ss and sediment were analyzed using a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 england and the particle sizes were divided into 8 8 16 16 32 32 63 and 63 μm fractions fractionation of p in sediment were applied which divided sediment p into nh4cl extractable p nh4cl p na2s2o4 nahco3 extractable p bd p naoh extractable inorganic p naoh ip naoh extractable organic p naoh op hcl extractable p hcl p and residual p christophoridis and fytianos 2006 wang et al 2017a total p tp is the sum of different p fractions and nh4cl p and bd p are mobile p with relatively high release potential in the sediment christophoridis and fytianos 2006 sediment p bioavailability was determined using nahco3 nahco3 p and fe oxide paper strip fe paper p extraction methods sharpley 1993 zhou et al 2001 oxalate extractable al and fe alox and feox and hcl extractable la hcl la contents in the sediment were also determined the detailed analytical methods for alox and feox are similar to those used by wang et al 2021a and the hcl la was determined using 0 5 m hcl similar to hcl p extraction the extracted al fe and la contents were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700x usa 2 4 data processing the suspended sediment transport model see section 1 in supporting information was applied to describe the settlement processes zhu et al 2017 in which eddy diffusivity e z t could indicate settlement characteristics specifically higher e z t values indicated a stronger sediment resuspension the model was described based on the curve fitting tool in matlab r2018a additionally pearson correlation analysis was performed using spss version 18 0 3 results 3 1 particle size distributions of ss in overlying water during the sediment resuspension tests the addition of phoslock and dwtr substantially reduced soluble p in overlying water figure s2 while the additions only tended to have a clear effect on ss variations in the bottom water during the 0 5 3 h of sediment settlement figure s3 during settlement figure s3 ss gradually reduced with time increased and with decreases in water depth i e the vertical distance from the water surface to the sampling site in the column while increased disturbance intensities remarkably weakened the reduction trends for columns incubated at different times 1 and 40 d increasing disturbance intensities from 0 000 to 0 030 m s increased the relative settlement equilibrium time from 48 to 96 h furthermore the suspended sediment transport model could describe ss variations during sediment settlement well with r 2 0 800 mostly tables s2 and s3 the addition of phoslock and dwtr did not substantially affect e z t variations during the entire settlement process for columns incubated at different times however as the disturbance intensities increased a clear increase in e z t was observed for sediments with and without materials indicating that ss variations were mainly regulated by disturbances during sediment settlement the variations in ss particle sizes were similar to those of sediments with and without p inactivating material additions after 1 and 40 d of incubation under different disturbance intensities figure l as the water depth increased the 8 μm ss in the overlying water gradually decreased while other ss tended to increase especially the 63 μm ss as settlement time increased the 8 μm ss gradually increased and finally became the dominant ss 57 5 80 2 in the overlying water these results suggest a close relationship between sediment particle size distributions and settleability 3 2 sediment particle size distributions after settlement at different intensities fig 2 the whole particle size distributions were similar to those of sediments with and without materials after 1 and 40 d of incubation with proportions of 4 60 10 85 for 63 μm sediments 7 89 9 81 for 32 63 μm sediments 17 0 18 8 for 16 32 μm sediments 24 6 29 2 for 8 16 μm sediments and 37 6 42 1 for 8 μm sediments indicating the minor effect of material additions on sediment particle size distributions the particle size distributions at different sediment depths were also similar to those of different sediments with 1 and 40 d incubation after settlement at different intensities fig 2 the sediment depth did not exhibit a close relation with the 16 32 μm sediment fractions in most groups table s4 whereas the depth had significant positive pearson correlations to 63 and 32 63 μm sediment fractions in all groups at p 0 01 level with correlation coefficients cc of 0 693 0 975 while it had significant negative pearson correlations to 8 μm sediment fractions in all groups at p 0 01 with cc of 0 780 0 948 and to 8 16 μm sediment fractions in most groups at p 0 01 or 0 05 with cc of 0 651 0 951 respectively typically as sediment depth increased from 0 1 to 12 cm 63 μm sediment fractions increased from 0 4 75 to 11 6 34 7 whereas 8 μm sediment fractions decreased from 38 1 76 8 to 22 7 36 6 notably 8 μm fractions were still a dominant fraction at the bottom these results suggest sediment depth related particle size distributions after sediment resuspension 3 3 p fractionation since tp in sediments with and without p inactivating materials did not show any clear differences figure s4 sediment p fractionation was analyzed in detail figs 3 and s5 mobile p including nh4cl p and bd p was mainly distributed as bd p figure s5 after settlement at different intensities mobile p naoh ip and hcl p were the major p forms accounting for 23 5 25 4 31 8 35 6 and 18 2 23 3 of tp respectively in sediments without material at different depths after material additions with 1 and 40 d incubation mobile p substantially decreased by 50 of total mobile p in sediments without material resulting in naoh ip and hcl p being the major p forms in the sediments at different depths as a whole typically phoslock increased hcl p to 33 2 42 1 while dwtr increased naoh ip to 42 4 43 7 therefore phoslock and dwtr reduced the sediment p release potential by transforming mobile p into hcl p and naoh ip respectively however for the sediments after settlement at different intensities with 1 and 40 d incubation as depth decreased from 12 to 0 1 cm the remaining mobile p increased from 7 11 10 8 to 11 0 17 8 of the total p in the groups with phoslock while in the groups with dwtr they increased from 1 66 4 73 to 9 70 20 7 of the total p these results suggest a more clear variation of mobile p in sediments with dwtr at different depths compared to those of phoslock furthermore pearson correlation analysis also verified the variations table s4 mobile p showed a negative correlation with sediment depth in all sediments with and without material addition with most correlations statistically significant at p 0 01 or 0 05 with a cc of 0 566 0 964 therefore the reduction in mobile p varied in sediments at different depths after resuspension 3 4 p bioavailability after settlement at different intensities with 1 and 40 d incubation fig 4 material additions clearly reduced sediment bioavailable p compared to the control phoslock and dwtr reduced nahco3 p by 32 6 57 9 and 24 8 37 7 and decreased fe paper p by 24 4 40 9 and 24 5 26 3 respectively in sediments at different depths as a whole which tended to be less than mobile p reduction fig 3 however pearson correlation analysis table s4 showed that sediment depth and bioavailable p in sediments with and without materials had negative correlations in particular the correlations were statistically significant at p 0 01 or 0 05 with a cc of 0 658 0 966 in most of the sediments with materials this phenomenon further caused significantly better performance in reducing bioavailable p in bottom sediments as sediment depth increased from 0 1 to 12 cm the reduction proportions of nahco3 p increased from 20 7 45 1 to 52 9 72 3 by phoslock and from 4 94 25 2 to 51 5 63 6 by dwtr the reduction proportions of fe paper p increased from 3 23 29 7 to 48 6 69 0 by phoslock and from 8 06 17 0 to 59 5 71 4 by dwtr compared to the control these results suggest that bioavailable p reduction by p inactivating materials is related to sediment depth after resuspension 3 5 p inactivating metals the incubation time and disturbance intensity during sediment settlement had limited effects on the feox alox and hcl la distributions in the sediments with and without materials fig 5 dwtr addition increased feox from 19 2 20 2 control to 28 3 39 9 g kg and alox from 4 96 6 59 control to 16 0 19 8 g kg and phoslock addition increased hcl la in sediments to 3 78 4 68 g kg in sediments at different depths as a whole hcl la was not detectable in sediments without material further pearson correlation analysis suggested that in most cases sediment depth had significant negative correlations with alox in the control groups at p 0 01 with cc of 0 757 0 912 while it had significant positive correlations with alox and feox in sediments with dwtr at p 0 01 or 0 05 and with cc of 0 595 0 702 table s4 these variations resulted in an increase of feox and alox by dwtr at bottom sediments typically at the depth of 0 10 cm the feox and alox in sediment with dwtr were approximately 24 9 5 58 and 11 2 3 02 g kg respectively as the depth increased from 10 to 12 cm feox and alox were further increased to 87 6 5 93 and 62 6 8 48 g kg respectively at the depth 12 cm these results suggest that dwtr addition also changed the feox and alox distributions at different depths accompanied by increasing their contents additionally statistically significant pearson correlations between sediment depth and hcl la were only observed for sediment after incubation for 40 d positive correlations p 0 01 were observed at disturbance intensities of 0 000 and 0 015 m s whereas a negative correlation p 0 05 was observed at 0 030 m s nevertheless hcl la varied by 16 1 at different depths for sediments with phoslock at different incubation times after settlement under different disturbance intensities indicating a relatively minor change in hcl la in sediment at different depths 4 discussion 4 1 sediment redistribution characteristics it has been widely demonstrated that sediment p immobilization by phoslock is mainly based on la accompanied by transforming mobile p to hcl p while that by dwtr is based on amorphous al and fe namely alox and feox by transforming mobile p to naoh ip wang and jiang 2016 this study found the same p immobilization by phoslock and dwtr fig 3 therefore the redistributions of phoslock and dwtr in the sediment after resuspension can be indicated by hcl la and by alox and feox fig 5 respectively ideally p inactivating materials capped on surface sediment under static conditions would form an isolation layer to immobilize soluble p released from bottom sediment to control p pollution augustyniak et al 2021 wang et al 2017b sediment resuspension could destroy the surface capping layer of materials inducing the resuspension of bottom sediment and promoting the mixing of materials and sediment after resuspension egemose et al 2013 li et al 2018 meis et al 2013 this study also found the promoted material movement from surface to bottom sediments after resuspension as the hcl la contents in sediments with phoslock and the alox and feox contents in sediments with dwtr increased at different depths fig 5 in addition to material redistribution varied p distributions were also observed at different sediment depths figs 3 and 4 moreover the reduction of the potential target p including mobile p and bioavailable p for immobilization increased in deeper sediments pearson correlation analysis suggested that all ratios for the potential target p mobile p nahco3 p and fe paper p in control to both phoslock hcl la and dwtr alox and feox had significant negative correlations with sediment depth p 0 01 and n 78 table s5 indicating that the varied p immobilization in sediments at different depths could be caused by the redistribution of p inactivating materials and target p after resuspension the sediments at surface layer were reasonably the resuspended sediment having relatively long retention times in the overlying water compared to those of the bottom sediments during settlement therefore the redistributions of p inactivating materials could be closely related to the settleability of materials and sediment which were closely related to particle sizes wei et al 2021 accordingly pearson correlation analyses were performed between the particle size distributions and sediment properties at different depths n 78 mobile p naoh ip hcl p nahco3 p fe paper p feox alox and hcl la were used for the correlation analyses because the addition of materials mainly led to variations in these properties figs 2 5 however in the control group mobile p nahco3 p and fe paper p were positively correlated with 16 μm particles and had negative correlations with 16 μm particles especially the 63 and 8 μm fractions which were statistically significant in most cases therefore target p tended to be enriched in relatively small sediment particles at different depths after resuspension in sediments with phoslock although hcl la at different sediment depths showed minor changes fig 5 the material redistributions tended to be regulated by relatively large particles as significant positive correlations were observed for hcl la with 63 μm particles p 0 01 whereas the correlations with different fractions of 32 μm particles were significantly negative p 0 01 such distributions further led to significant negative correlations of 32 μm particles and significant positive correlations of 16 μm particles with mobile p p 0 01 nahco3 p p 0 01 or 0 05 and fe paper p p 0 01 as well as significant positive correlations of 32 μm particles p 0 01 with hcl p similar to phoslock dwtr redistributions tended to be regulated by relatively large particles as significant positive correlations were observed for feox and alox with 32 μm particles p 0 01 whereas the correlations with different fractions of 32 μm particles were significantly negative p 0 01 such distributions further led to significant negative correlations of 32 μm particles and significant positive correlations of 16 μm particles with mobile p p 0 01 nahco3 p p 0 01 and fe paper p p 0 01 as well as positive correlations of 32 μm particles to naoh ip especially 32 63 μm particles p 0 01 as observed in the particle size distributions of ss in overlying water during sediment settlement fig 1 larger particles e g 63 μm tended to have higher settleability which implied that larger particles especially the 63 μm fraction tended to be distributed in deeper sediments with and without materials fig 2 according to these findings and the results of pearson correlation analysis we concluded that particle size distributions regulated the redistribution of p inactivating materials and the potential target p in sediments and then shaped p immobilization at different depths after resuspension verifying our hypothesis made in section 1 such mechanisms could explain the limited effect of incubation time on sediment redistributions as the particle size distributions of sediments under different incubation times changed minimally fig 2 furthermore the importance of particle size distributions is supported by the findings of more apparent sediment depth related mobile p reductions by dwtr than those by phoslock fig 3 which resulted from more prominent movement to bottom sediment after resuspension fig 5 for feox and alox in the relatively large dwtr composed of 52 4 63 μm particles table s1 compared to the hcl la in the relatively small phoslock composed of 43 8 8 μm particles additionally this study found that the phoslock and dwtr redistributions were regulated by relatively large particles e g 63 μm whereas a recent study by the authors suggested that phoslock was more likely to immobilize p in relatively small particles e g 8 μm wang et al 2022 these differences may be caused by the fact that the relatively small fractions of phoslock tended to be uniformly distributed in sediment just as the finding of the minor variations in hcl la at different depths fig 5 resulting from the fact that the relatively small particles 8 μm were the dominant fractions in sediments with and without materials at different depths fig 2 4 2 the differences in the variations of mobile p and bioavailable p notably this study also found that the substantially weak reduction of bioavailable p in surface sediment by both phoslock and dwtr were observed compared to those in bottom sediments and bioavailable p reductions were less effective than mobile p immobilization by materials in sediments figs 3 and 4 commonly mobile p defined herein is the p in sediment that has a relatively high release potential under various physicochemical conditions typically under anoxic conditions however to determine the changes in sediment p lability involved in biological effects this study comprehensively investigated the potential bioavailable p pool variations in sediments at different depths after resuspension nahco3 p and fe paper p were adopted for sediment bioavailable p pool assessment as they are closely related to phytoplankton growth boström et al 1988 sharpley 1993 wang et al 2017a this study generally indicated the different reduction mechanisms for sediment mobile and bioavailable p by materials after resuspension accordingly to better understand the relationships between bioavailable and mobile p reduction pearson correlation analysis n 78 was performed table 2 the results showed that in sediments with phoslock nahco3 p and fe paper p showed significant p 0 01 positive correlations with mobile p with cc of 0 580 and 0 412 and naoh ip with cc of 0 431 and 0 328 and had a significant negative correlation with hcl p with cc of 0 536 and 0 527 considering that phoslock mainly transformed mobile p to hcl p the bioavailable p pool could be involved in mobile p and naoh ip in fact similar to the distribution of mobile p naoh ip also tended to be distributed at surface sediment with phoslock because in the sediment naoh ip had significant negative correlations p 0 01 or 0 05 with sediment depth under different conditions table s4 and exhibited significant positive correlations with 32 μm sediment table 1 these findings could explain the varied reductions of bioavailable p by phoslock at different sediment depths and the less bioavailable p reduction by phoslock compared to those for mobile p reduction previous studies have demonstrated that sediment bioavailable p tended to be distributed in various forms of p such as mobile p hcl p and naoh ip wang et al 2017a in sediments with dwtr nahco3 p and fe paper p only showed significant p 0 01 positive correlations with mobile p with cc of 0 573 and 0 676 indicating that the mechanisms for bioavailable p variations were mainly similar to those of mobile p 4 3 perspectives for future works as described in section 1 practical applications have shown that p inactivating material distributions in sediment induced by resuspension may interfere with in situ p immobilization to control lake internal p pollution egemose et al 2013 james et al 2011 welch and cooke 1999 this study further indicated that redistribution tended to weaken p immobilization in the surface sediment figs 3 and 4 accordingly the sediment resuspension characteristics of potential target lakes ready for remediation can be adopted as an essential background for designing specific strategies this study also demonstrated that the potential interference of sediment redistribution to p immobilization tended to vary between dwtr and phoslock mainly due to the different particle size distributions which indicated that before practical application the potential sediment redistribution effect on the selected specific materials should be carefully considered in combination with the background sediment resuspension characteristics to eliminate potential sediment redistribution interferences application of in situ p immobilization with other methods for example microbial technology yallop et al 2000 which can enhance sediment stability and reduce the sediment resuspension effect may be a feasible strategy to improve the feasibility of the p immobilization method for lake internal p pollution control however to improve the immobilization method further studies should focus on developing appropriate p inactivating materials for lake geoengineering design to develop p inactivating materials particle size distribution can be applied as a key property for consideration according to the determined sediment redistribution effect we inferred that the post resuspension materials that still tended to distribute in the surface layer of the sediment would weaken the interference of material redistribution materials with size 63 μm fractions were found to have more likely been buried in the bottom sediment after resuspension fig 2 suggesting that the particle sizes of the potentially developed materials should be 63 μm since 8 μm particles tended to be retained in the overlying water fig 1 and distributed in the surface sediment fig 2 8 μm particles could be referred to as a preliminary basis for material development naturally particle sizes of lake sediments were predominately higher than 0 3 μm darricau et al 2021 wei et al 2021 just as the sediments used herein figure s6 nano materials have also been developed for sediment p immobilization li et al 2019a the response of the vertical redistribution of relatively small materials 8 μm to sediment resuspension requires further investigation special attention should also be paid to the development of p inactivating materials with a high capability to reduce the sediment bioavailable p pool aside from mobile p the main objective of the immobilization method so far has been to reduce the release potential of soluble p from sediment lürling et al 2016 the results of less effective bioavailable p reductions by materials herein suggest that the current p immobilization method does not meet the p pollution control demand involving biological effects figs 3 and 4 importantly after resuspension the redistribution of both dwtr and phoslock clearly weakened the bioavailable p pool reduction in surface sediment it is easy to understand that p in surface sediment has a higher potential to attend lake biological cycles this demonstrates the necessity to adopt sediment bioavailable p pool as the target p for immobilization especially in lakes with frequent sediment resuspension notably applying higher doses of materials compared to those for mobile p reduction has been found to substantially reduce the sediment bioavailable p pool li et al 2019b wang et al 2017a which implies the high feasibility for bioavailable p pool reduction by immobilization using materials sediment resuspension characteristics often changed with different sediment properties wei et al 2021 disturbance characteristics wei et al 2021 and other background conditions e g water depth li et al 2018 all of which varied in different lakes or seasons moreover this study mainly focused on the vertical redistribution of materials in sediment induced by resuspension however the resuspension may also induce plane redistributions especially for fine particles wang et al 2020 suggesting that although disturbance intensities did not have a substantial effect on sediment redistributions herein the potential effect of sediment resuspension on material redistribution may be more complex and vary in different lakes however this study comprehensively demonstrates that resuspension induced material redistribution should be given close attention during lake restoration and our results are essential for designing appropriate lake geoengineering strategies 5 conclusions this study found that sediment resuspension promotes the material movement from the surface capping layer to the bottom layer in sediment such movement varied the distributions of materials and potential target p for immobilization at different sediment depths typically resulting in relatively low mobile p and bioavailable p reduction in the surface sediment moreover bioavailable p reductions were less effective than mobile p immobilization by materials in sediments further analysis suggested that target p redistributions were regulated by relatively small sediments especially the 8 μm fraction which tended to be retained in surface sediment while relatively large materials especially the 63 μm fraction regulated their redistributions and were more likely to be buried in bottom sediments the results suggest that the vertical redistribution of p inactivating materials in the sediment profile induced by resuspension shaped lake internal p pollution control accordingly specific recommendations such as developing relatively small e g 8 μm materials and using sediment bioavailable p and mobile p as target p for immobilization were finally provided for appropriate lake geoengineering applications declaration of competing

16222,lake geoengineering with phosphorus p inactivating materials to reduce sediment p loading is often used for eutrophication control the redistribution of materials in sediment especially those induced by resuspension is reportedly a common phenomenon during practical applications which may interfere with the pollution control notably a recent study by the authors initially found that the heterogeneous properties of materials and sediments varied the p immobilization in different sized sediments which exhibited diverse movement characteristics therefore this study hypothesizes a particle size related vertical redistribution of materials in the sediment profile induced by resuspension which shapes sediment p immobilization at different depths based on two differently sized materials lanthanum la modified bentonite clay phoslock and drinking water treatment residue dwtr this study found a weakened reduction of mobile p and bioavailable p pool by both dwtr and phoslock in surface sediment after resuspension as the depth decreased from 12 to surface 0 1 cm the remaining mobile p increased from 7 11 10 8 to 11 0 17 8 of the total p in the sediment with phoslock and from 1 66 4 73 to 9 70 20 7 of the total p in the sediment with dwtr meanwhile bioavailable p pool reduction proportions decreased from 48 6 72 3 to 3 23 45 1 for phoslock and from 51 5 71 4 to 4 94 25 2 for dwtr further analysis verified the hypothesis of this study importantly the redistributions of the potential target p including mobile and bioavailable p for immobilization were regulated by relatively small sediments e g 8 μm fraction which tended to become enriched in surface sediment after resuspension while relatively large materials e g 63 μm fraction regulated their redistributions and were more likely to be buried at the bottom of the sediments accordingly to design appropriate strategies for lake geoengineering relatively small materials e g 8 μm targeting to immobilize both mobile and bioavailable p are typically recommended to be developed for restoration of lakes with frequent sediment resuspension graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication lake particle size internal p pollution sediment p immobilization 1 introduction excessive phosphorus p in lake ecosystems mainly due to increased external p loading from frequent human activities is a primary cause of eutrophication horppila 2019 recent studies have shown that the accumulated p in sediment from loaded external p zhang et al 2021b could be re released leading to internal p pollution and creating an essential source of excessive p in lake water chai et al 2020 xu et al 2020 the importance of controlling internal p pollution has been widely recognized especially when external p pollution has been effectively reduced li et al 2021a wang et al 2021b since internal p pollution predominately results from the excessive loading of external p accompanied by relatively low sediment p deposition wang and jiang 2016 lake geoengineering based on in situ p immobilization by dosing p inactivating materials is a commonly considered strategies to rebuild p balance and control eutrophication lürling et al 2016 successful application of the immobilization method has been globally reported in many lakes copetti et al 2016 however in situ p immobilization still faces a crisis of confidence due to various unexpected remediation observed immers et al 2015 ozkundakci et al 2011 which could result from inappropriate or poorly designed applications spears et al 2014 accordingly assessing the feasibility of this method under various lake background conditions has been widely recognized as essential to provide support for internal p pollution control de lucena silva et al 2019 li et al 2021b for the reason that sediment p immobilization by p inactivating materials is mainly through physicochemical reactions between p and metals the responses of these reactions to different physicochemical conditions e g ph organic matter and redox conditions have attracted special attention from scientists kong et al 2021 reitzel et al 2017 zeller and alperin 2021 many studies have demonstrated highly stable physicochemical reactions for p immobilization using various p inactivating materials wang and jiang 2016 notably practical applications indicate that the redistribution of p inactivating materials in sediment typically induced by sediment resuspension may interfere with the effectiveness of the in situ p immobilization method egemose et al 2013 james et al 2011 welch and cooke 1999 although the resuspension has been reported to have a limited effect on the physicochemical reactions of immobilizing soluble p egemose et al 2010 funes et al 2021 yin et al 2017 sediment resuspension can lead to the movement of sediments to the overlying water and redistribution of sediments at the lakebed li et al 2018 thus resuspension has been found to induce the burial of materials lewandowski et al 2003 meis et al 2013 welch and cooke 1999 mediating the distributions of materials and p in sediment egemose et al 2013 james et al 2011 ozkundakci et al 2011 this suggests that sediment resuspension varies the performance of the p immobilization method because of migrating materials and not because it affects p immobilization reactions by materials sediment resuspension is a critical physical process in lakes especially those with strong hydrodynamic disturbances jalil et al 2019 wang et al 2015 accordingly this study aimed to determine the redistribution characteristics and mechanisms of p inactivating materials in sediments induced by the resuspension thereby providing support for the development of appropriate p immobilization strategies notably a recent study by the authors initially found that the heterogeneous properties of p inactivating materials and sediments caused varied immobilization in sediments of different sizes which exhibited diverse movements with hydrodynamic disturbances wang et al 2022 therefore this study hypothesized that sediment resuspension induced the particle size related vertical redistribution of p inactivating materials in the sediment profile which further shaped sediment p immobilization at different depths many modified materials industrial by products and chemical agents have been developed for p immobilization methods lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 and the hypothesis herein was verified using two common materials namely lanthanum la modified bentonite clay phoslock and drinking water treatment residue dwtr these materials have different particle size distributions as detailed in section 2 1 phoslock developed by csiro australia has been increasingly applied to control internal p pollution of lakes douglas 2002 copetti et al 2016 dwtr is a by product of potable water production and often contains high aluminum al and iron fe concentrations due to coagulant utilization during water treatment processes and has been found to effectively inhibit p release from sediments kuster et al 2021 based on the determined redistribution characteristics and mechanisms recommendations were provided for the practical application of lake geoengineering to control internal p pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection and preparation block shaped dwtr was sampled from a drinking water treatment plant in beijing china and was air dried and crushed the basic dwtr properties have been previously investigated wang et al 2021a phoslock was purchased from a branch of the phoslock company in china additionally lake water and sediments were sampled from lake xuanwu 118 47 n 32 4 e one of the three famous shallow lakes along the south of the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china overlying water samples at a depth of 10 cm and surface sediment samples from 0 to 10 cm were collected from lake xuanwu collected samples were filtered through a 2 mm sieve to remove impurities as detailed in section 2 2 2 then mixed completely and stored at 4 c the particle size distributions of the raw sediment phoslock and dwtr showed relatively large differences table s1 in brief sediment was dominated by 8 and 8 16 μm particles accounting for 32 1 and 28 4 of the total phoslock was dominated by 8 μm particles accounting for 43 8 and dwtr was dominated by fractions of 63 0 μm particles accounting for 52 4 of the particles 2 2 sediment redistribution tests 2 2 1 resuspension test as described in section 1 sediment redistribution in lake ecosystems is predominately caused by sediment resuspension thus sediment redistribution tests were based on resuspension tests the resuspension test was carried out based on a column with a height of 1 35 m and inner diameter of 0 14 m figure s1 following the procedures of previous studies you et al 2007 disturbances were implemented from the side and top of the columns based on stirring to reduce potential whirlpool effects sediments of 0 10 m height were packed at the bottom and lake water was slowly siphoned in to obtain 1 00 m of overlying water sediments were incubated for 14 days to ensure stabilization then the p inactivating materials were evenly dosed leading to 1 2 cm of materials capping the surface sediment such dosing procedures are a method often used in practical applications wang and jiang 2016 after the materials had completely settled for 1 d the columns were used for the resuspension test then further incubated for 1 and 40 d sediment resuspension tests included the resuspension and settlement stages during the resuspension stage the disturbance intensities gradually increased until the sediments were completely resuspended with intensities of approximately 1 3 m s continuous stirring was performed for 1 h and then the settlement stage was carried out to investigate the settlement effect comprehensively three disturbance intensities i e 0 000 0 020 and 0 030 m s were adopted during the settlement stage overlying water samples were intermittently collected between depths of 0 10 and 0 80 m until the suspended solids ss changed little within 96 h after the resuspension test sediments were collected at different depths for analysis 2 2 2 test methodologies in this study the dosages of the materials were approximately 10 of the sediment dry weight wang et al 2017a to obtain intuitive results regarding sediment redistribution after resuspension uniform sediments were prepared impurities e g macroscopic gravel in sediments were removed dong et al 2016 and the sediments were then homogenized egemose et al 2010 considering that this preparation destroyed the sediment structures pre incubation 14 d of packed sediments in the columns were utilized for stabilization moreover further incubation of the columns after material addition 1 and 40 d was used to assess the effect of incubation time on the redistribution of the amended sediment according to previous studies colomer et al 2019 egemose et al 2010 incubation times of 14 and 40 d were sufficient for sediment and material stabilization additionally the relatively low disturbance intensities adopted during the settlement stage of the resuspension tests were due to the fact that practical lake hydrodynamic disturbances are often dominated by relatively low intensities jalil et al 2017 a depth of 0 10 m was adopted for sediment packing as lake surface sediments at such depths are the most reactive layer involved in various physical chemical and biological processes wang and jiang 2016 2 3 overlying water and sediment properties analysis the disturbance intensity was reflected by the flow velocity ls300a china and determined at 0 10 m above the sediments the membrane filtration method was applied to determine ss yin et al 2016 the particle size distributions of ss and sediment were analyzed using a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 england and the particle sizes were divided into 8 8 16 16 32 32 63 and 63 μm fractions fractionation of p in sediment were applied which divided sediment p into nh4cl extractable p nh4cl p na2s2o4 nahco3 extractable p bd p naoh extractable inorganic p naoh ip naoh extractable organic p naoh op hcl extractable p hcl p and residual p christophoridis and fytianos 2006 wang et al 2017a total p tp is the sum of different p fractions and nh4cl p and bd p are mobile p with relatively high release potential in the sediment christophoridis and fytianos 2006 sediment p bioavailability was determined using nahco3 nahco3 p and fe oxide paper strip fe paper p extraction methods sharpley 1993 zhou et al 2001 oxalate extractable al and fe alox and feox and hcl extractable la hcl la contents in the sediment were also determined the detailed analytical methods for alox and feox are similar to those used by wang et al 2021a and the hcl la was determined using 0 5 m hcl similar to hcl p extraction the extracted al fe and la contents were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700x usa 2 4 data processing the suspended sediment transport model see section 1 in supporting information was applied to describe the settlement processes zhu et al 2017 in which eddy diffusivity e z t could indicate settlement characteristics specifically higher e z t values indicated a stronger sediment resuspension the model was described based on the curve fitting tool in matlab r2018a additionally pearson correlation analysis was performed using spss version 18 0 3 results 3 1 particle size distributions of ss in overlying water during the sediment resuspension tests the addition of phoslock and dwtr substantially reduced soluble p in overlying water figure s2 while the additions only tended to have a clear effect on ss variations in the bottom water during the 0 5 3 h of sediment settlement figure s3 during settlement figure s3 ss gradually reduced with time increased and with decreases in water depth i e the vertical distance from the water surface to the sampling site in the column while increased disturbance intensities remarkably weakened the reduction trends for columns incubated at different times 1 and 40 d increasing disturbance intensities from 0 000 to 0 030 m s increased the relative settlement equilibrium time from 48 to 96 h furthermore the suspended sediment transport model could describe ss variations during sediment settlement well with r 2 0 800 mostly tables s2 and s3 the addition of phoslock and dwtr did not substantially affect e z t variations during the entire settlement process for columns incubated at different times however as the disturbance intensities increased a clear increase in e z t was observed for sediments with and without materials indicating that ss variations were mainly regulated by disturbances during sediment settlement the variations in ss particle sizes were similar to those of sediments with and without p inactivating material additions after 1 and 40 d of incubation under different disturbance intensities figure l as the water depth increased the 8 μm ss in the overlying water gradually decreased while other ss tended to increase especially the 63 μm ss as settlement time increased the 8 μm ss gradually increased and finally became the dominant ss 57 5 80 2 in the overlying water these results suggest a close relationship between sediment particle size distributions and settleability 3 2 sediment particle size distributions after settlement at different intensities fig 2 the whole particle size distributions were similar to those of sediments with and without materials after 1 and 40 d of incubation with proportions of 4 60 10 85 for 63 μm sediments 7 89 9 81 for 32 63 μm sediments 17 0 18 8 for 16 32 μm sediments 24 6 29 2 for 8 16 μm sediments and 37 6 42 1 for 8 μm sediments indicating the minor effect of material additions on sediment particle size distributions the particle size distributions at different sediment depths were also similar to those of different sediments with 1 and 40 d incubation after settlement at different intensities fig 2 the sediment depth did not exhibit a close relation with the 16 32 μm sediment fractions in most groups table s4 whereas the depth had significant positive pearson correlations to 63 and 32 63 μm sediment fractions in all groups at p 0 01 level with correlation coefficients cc of 0 693 0 975 while it had significant negative pearson correlations to 8 μm sediment fractions in all groups at p 0 01 with cc of 0 780 0 948 and to 8 16 μm sediment fractions in most groups at p 0 01 or 0 05 with cc of 0 651 0 951 respectively typically as sediment depth increased from 0 1 to 12 cm 63 μm sediment fractions increased from 0 4 75 to 11 6 34 7 whereas 8 μm sediment fractions decreased from 38 1 76 8 to 22 7 36 6 notably 8 μm fractions were still a dominant fraction at the bottom these results suggest sediment depth related particle size distributions after sediment resuspension 3 3 p fractionation since tp in sediments with and without p inactivating materials did not show any clear differences figure s4 sediment p fractionation was analyzed in detail figs 3 and s5 mobile p including nh4cl p and bd p was mainly distributed as bd p figure s5 after settlement at different intensities mobile p naoh ip and hcl p were the major p forms accounting for 23 5 25 4 31 8 35 6 and 18 2 23 3 of tp respectively in sediments without material at different depths after material additions with 1 and 40 d incubation mobile p substantially decreased by 50 of total mobile p in sediments without material resulting in naoh ip and hcl p being the major p forms in the sediments at different depths as a whole typically phoslock increased hcl p to 33 2 42 1 while dwtr increased naoh ip to 42 4 43 7 therefore phoslock and dwtr reduced the sediment p release potential by transforming mobile p into hcl p and naoh ip respectively however for the sediments after settlement at different intensities with 1 and 40 d incubation as depth decreased from 12 to 0 1 cm the remaining mobile p increased from 7 11 10 8 to 11 0 17 8 of the total p in the groups with phoslock while in the groups with dwtr they increased from 1 66 4 73 to 9 70 20 7 of the total p these results suggest a more clear variation of mobile p in sediments with dwtr at different depths compared to those of phoslock furthermore pearson correlation analysis also verified the variations table s4 mobile p showed a negative correlation with sediment depth in all sediments with and without material addition with most correlations statistically significant at p 0 01 or 0 05 with a cc of 0 566 0 964 therefore the reduction in mobile p varied in sediments at different depths after resuspension 3 4 p bioavailability after settlement at different intensities with 1 and 40 d incubation fig 4 material additions clearly reduced sediment bioavailable p compared to the control phoslock and dwtr reduced nahco3 p by 32 6 57 9 and 24 8 37 7 and decreased fe paper p by 24 4 40 9 and 24 5 26 3 respectively in sediments at different depths as a whole which tended to be less than mobile p reduction fig 3 however pearson correlation analysis table s4 showed that sediment depth and bioavailable p in sediments with and without materials had negative correlations in particular the correlations were statistically significant at p 0 01 or 0 05 with a cc of 0 658 0 966 in most of the sediments with materials this phenomenon further caused significantly better performance in reducing bioavailable p in bottom sediments as sediment depth increased from 0 1 to 12 cm the reduction proportions of nahco3 p increased from 20 7 45 1 to 52 9 72 3 by phoslock and from 4 94 25 2 to 51 5 63 6 by dwtr the reduction proportions of fe paper p increased from 3 23 29 7 to 48 6 69 0 by phoslock and from 8 06 17 0 to 59 5 71 4 by dwtr compared to the control these results suggest that bioavailable p reduction by p inactivating materials is related to sediment depth after resuspension 3 5 p inactivating metals the incubation time and disturbance intensity during sediment settlement had limited effects on the feox alox and hcl la distributions in the sediments with and without materials fig 5 dwtr addition increased feox from 19 2 20 2 control to 28 3 39 9 g kg and alox from 4 96 6 59 control to 16 0 19 8 g kg and phoslock addition increased hcl la in sediments to 3 78 4 68 g kg in sediments at different depths as a whole hcl la was not detectable in sediments without material further pearson correlation analysis suggested that in most cases sediment depth had significant negative correlations with alox in the control groups at p 0 01 with cc of 0 757 0 912 while it had significant positive correlations with alox and feox in sediments with dwtr at p 0 01 or 0 05 and with cc of 0 595 0 702 table s4 these variations resulted in an increase of feox and alox by dwtr at bottom sediments typically at the depth of 0 10 cm the feox and alox in sediment with dwtr were approximately 24 9 5 58 and 11 2 3 02 g kg respectively as the depth increased from 10 to 12 cm feox and alox were further increased to 87 6 5 93 and 62 6 8 48 g kg respectively at the depth 12 cm these results suggest that dwtr addition also changed the feox and alox distributions at different depths accompanied by increasing their contents additionally statistically significant pearson correlations between sediment depth and hcl la were only observed for sediment after incubation for 40 d positive correlations p 0 01 were observed at disturbance intensities of 0 000 and 0 015 m s whereas a negative correlation p 0 05 was observed at 0 030 m s nevertheless hcl la varied by 16 1 at different depths for sediments with phoslock at different incubation times after settlement under different disturbance intensities indicating a relatively minor change in hcl la in sediment at different depths 4 discussion 4 1 sediment redistribution characteristics it has been widely demonstrated that sediment p immobilization by phoslock is mainly based on la accompanied by transforming mobile p to hcl p while that by dwtr is based on amorphous al and fe namely alox and feox by transforming mobile p to naoh ip wang and jiang 2016 this study found the same p immobilization by phoslock and dwtr fig 3 therefore the redistributions of phoslock and dwtr in the sediment after resuspension can be indicated by hcl la and by alox and feox fig 5 respectively ideally p inactivating materials capped on surface sediment under static conditions would form an isolation layer to immobilize soluble p released from bottom sediment to control p pollution augustyniak et al 2021 wang et al 2017b sediment resuspension could destroy the surface capping layer of materials inducing the resuspension of bottom sediment and promoting the mixing of materials and sediment after resuspension egemose et al 2013 li et al 2018 meis et al 2013 this study also found the promoted material movement from surface to bottom sediments after resuspension as the hcl la contents in sediments with phoslock and the alox and feox contents in sediments with dwtr increased at different depths fig 5 in addition to material redistribution varied p distributions were also observed at different sediment depths figs 3 and 4 moreover the reduction of the potential target p including mobile p and bioavailable p for immobilization increased in deeper sediments pearson correlation analysis suggested that all ratios for the potential target p mobile p nahco3 p and fe paper p in control to both phoslock hcl la and dwtr alox and feox had significant negative correlations with sediment depth p 0 01 and n 78 table s5 indicating that the varied p immobilization in sediments at different depths could be caused by the redistribution of p inactivating materials and target p after resuspension the sediments at surface layer were reasonably the resuspended sediment having relatively long retention times in the overlying water compared to those of the bottom sediments during settlement therefore the redistributions of p inactivating materials could be closely related to the settleability of materials and sediment which were closely related to particle sizes wei et al 2021 accordingly pearson correlation analyses were performed between the particle size distributions and sediment properties at different depths n 78 mobile p naoh ip hcl p nahco3 p fe paper p feox alox and hcl la were used for the correlation analyses because the addition of materials mainly led to variations in these properties figs 2 5 however in the control group mobile p nahco3 p and fe paper p were positively correlated with 16 μm particles and had negative correlations with 16 μm particles especially the 63 and 8 μm fractions which were statistically significant in most cases therefore target p tended to be enriched in relatively small sediment particles at different depths after resuspension in sediments with phoslock although hcl la at different sediment depths showed minor changes fig 5 the material redistributions tended to be regulated by relatively large particles as significant positive correlations were observed for hcl la with 63 μm particles p 0 01 whereas the correlations with different fractions of 32 μm particles were significantly negative p 0 01 such distributions further led to significant negative correlations of 32 μm particles and significant positive correlations of 16 μm particles with mobile p p 0 01 nahco3 p p 0 01 or 0 05 and fe paper p p 0 01 as well as significant positive correlations of 32 μm particles p 0 01 with hcl p similar to phoslock dwtr redistributions tended to be regulated by relatively large particles as significant positive correlations were observed for feox and alox with 32 μm particles p 0 01 whereas the correlations with different fractions of 32 μm particles were significantly negative p 0 01 such distributions further led to significant negative correlations of 32 μm particles and significant positive correlations of 16 μm particles with mobile p p 0 01 nahco3 p p 0 01 and fe paper p p 0 01 as well as positive correlations of 32 μm particles to naoh ip especially 32 63 μm particles p 0 01 as observed in the particle size distributions of ss in overlying water during sediment settlement fig 1 larger particles e g 63 μm tended to have higher settleability which implied that larger particles especially the 63 μm fraction tended to be distributed in deeper sediments with and without materials fig 2 according to these findings and the results of pearson correlation analysis we concluded that particle size distributions regulated the redistribution of p inactivating materials and the potential target p in sediments and then shaped p immobilization at different depths after resuspension verifying our hypothesis made in section 1 such mechanisms could explain the limited effect of incubation time on sediment redistributions as the particle size distributions of sediments under different incubation times changed minimally fig 2 furthermore the importance of particle size distributions is supported by the findings of more apparent sediment depth related mobile p reductions by dwtr than those by phoslock fig 3 which resulted from more prominent movement to bottom sediment after resuspension fig 5 for feox and alox in the relatively large dwtr composed of 52 4 63 μm particles table s1 compared to the hcl la in the relatively small phoslock composed of 43 8 8 μm particles additionally this study found that the phoslock and dwtr redistributions were regulated by relatively large particles e g 63 μm whereas a recent study by the authors suggested that phoslock was more likely to immobilize p in relatively small particles e g 8 μm wang et al 2022 these differences may be caused by the fact that the relatively small fractions of phoslock tended to be uniformly distributed in sediment just as the finding of the minor variations in hcl la at different depths fig 5 resulting from the fact that the relatively small particles 8 μm were the dominant fractions in sediments with and without materials at different depths fig 2 4 2 the differences in the variations of mobile p and bioavailable p notably this study also found that the substantially weak reduction of bioavailable p in surface sediment by both phoslock and dwtr were observed compared to those in bottom sediments and bioavailable p reductions were less effective than mobile p immobilization by materials in sediments figs 3 and 4 commonly mobile p defined herein is the p in sediment that has a relatively high release potential under various physicochemical conditions typically under anoxic conditions however to determine the changes in sediment p lability involved in biological effects this study comprehensively investigated the potential bioavailable p pool variations in sediments at different depths after resuspension nahco3 p and fe paper p were adopted for sediment bioavailable p pool assessment as they are closely related to phytoplankton growth boström et al 1988 sharpley 1993 wang et al 2017a this study generally indicated the different reduction mechanisms for sediment mobile and bioavailable p by materials after resuspension accordingly to better understand the relationships between bioavailable and mobile p reduction pearson correlation analysis n 78 was performed table 2 the results showed that in sediments with phoslock nahco3 p and fe paper p showed significant p 0 01 positive correlations with mobile p with cc of 0 580 and 0 412 and naoh ip with cc of 0 431 and 0 328 and had a significant negative correlation with hcl p with cc of 0 536 and 0 527 considering that phoslock mainly transformed mobile p to hcl p the bioavailable p pool could be involved in mobile p and naoh ip in fact similar to the distribution of mobile p naoh ip also tended to be distributed at surface sediment with phoslock because in the sediment naoh ip had significant negative correlations p 0 01 or 0 05 with sediment depth under different conditions table s4 and exhibited significant positive correlations with 32 μm sediment table 1 these findings could explain the varied reductions of bioavailable p by phoslock at different sediment depths and the less bioavailable p reduction by phoslock compared to those for mobile p reduction previous studies have demonstrated that sediment bioavailable p tended to be distributed in various forms of p such as mobile p hcl p and naoh ip wang et al 2017a in sediments with dwtr nahco3 p and fe paper p only showed significant p 0 01 positive correlations with mobile p with cc of 0 573 and 0 676 indicating that the mechanisms for bioavailable p variations were mainly similar to those of mobile p 4 3 perspectives for future works as described in section 1 practical applications have shown that p inactivating material distributions in sediment induced by resuspension may interfere with in situ p immobilization to control lake internal p pollution egemose et al 2013 james et al 2011 welch and cooke 1999 this study further indicated that redistribution tended to weaken p immobilization in the surface sediment figs 3 and 4 accordingly the sediment resuspension characteristics of potential target lakes ready for remediation can be adopted as an essential background for designing specific strategies this study also demonstrated that the potential interference of sediment redistribution to p immobilization tended to vary between dwtr and phoslock mainly due to the different particle size distributions which indicated that before practical application the potential sediment redistribution effect on the selected specific materials should be carefully considered in combination with the background sediment resuspension characteristics to eliminate potential sediment redistribution interferences application of in situ p immobilization with other methods for example microbial technology yallop et al 2000 which can enhance sediment stability and reduce the sediment resuspension effect may be a feasible strategy to improve the feasibility of the p immobilization method for lake internal p pollution control however to improve the immobilization method further studies should focus on developing appropriate p inactivating materials for lake geoengineering design to develop p inactivating materials particle size distribution can be applied as a key property for consideration according to the determined sediment redistribution effect we inferred that the post resuspension materials that still tended to distribute in the surface layer of the sediment would weaken the interference of material redistribution materials with size 63 μm fractions were found to have more likely been buried in the bottom sediment after resuspension fig 2 suggesting that the particle sizes of the potentially developed materials should be 63 μm since 8 μm particles tended to be retained in the overlying water fig 1 and distributed in the surface sediment fig 2 8 μm particles could be referred to as a preliminary basis for material development naturally particle sizes of lake sediments were predominately higher than 0 3 μm darricau et al 2021 wei et al 2021 just as the sediments used herein figure s6 nano materials have also been developed for sediment p immobilization li et al 2019a the response of the vertical redistribution of relatively small materials 8 μm to sediment resuspension requires further investigation special attention should also be paid to the development of p inactivating materials with a high capability to reduce the sediment bioavailable p pool aside from mobile p the main objective of the immobilization method so far has been to reduce the release potential of soluble p from sediment lürling et al 2016 the results of less effective bioavailable p reductions by materials herein suggest that the current p immobilization method does not meet the p pollution control demand involving biological effects figs 3 and 4 importantly after resuspension the redistribution of both dwtr and phoslock clearly weakened the bioavailable p pool reduction in surface sediment it is easy to understand that p in surface sediment has a higher potential to attend lake biological cycles this demonstrates the necessity to adopt sediment bioavailable p pool as the target p for immobilization especially in lakes with frequent sediment resuspension notably applying higher doses of materials compared to those for mobile p reduction has been found to substantially reduce the sediment bioavailable p pool li et al 2019b wang et al 2017a which implies the high feasibility for bioavailable p pool reduction by immobilization using materials sediment resuspension characteristics often changed with different sediment properties wei et al 2021 disturbance characteristics wei et al 2021 and other background conditions e g water depth li et al 2018 all of which varied in different lakes or seasons moreover this study mainly focused on the vertical redistribution of materials in sediment induced by resuspension however the resuspension may also induce plane redistributions especially for fine particles wang et al 2020 suggesting that although disturbance intensities did not have a substantial effect on sediment redistributions herein the potential effect of sediment resuspension on material redistribution may be more complex and vary in different lakes however this study comprehensively demonstrates that resuspension induced material redistribution should be given close attention during lake restoration and our results are essential for designing appropriate lake geoengineering strategies 5 conclusions this study found that sediment resuspension promotes the material movement from the surface capping layer to the bottom layer in sediment such movement varied the distributions of materials and potential target p for immobilization at different sediment depths typically resulting in relatively low mobile p and bioavailable p reduction in the surface sediment moreover bioavailable p reductions were less effective than mobile p immobilization by materials in sediments further analysis suggested that target p redistributions were regulated by relatively small sediments especially the 8 μm fraction which tended to be retained in surface sediment while relatively large materials especially the 63 μm fraction regulated their redistributions and were more likely to be buried in bottom sediments the results suggest that the vertical redistribution of p inactivating materials in the sediment profile induced by resuspension shaped lake internal p pollution control accordingly specific recommendations such as developing relatively small e g 8 μm materials and using sediment bioavailable p and mobile p as target p for immobilization were finally provided for appropriate lake geoengineering applications declaration of competing

16223,ammonia inhibition is one of the most common causes of instability during the operation of commercial biogas plants here the sensitivity of different functional bacteria to ammonia stress the ability of functional bacteria to adapt to ammonia stress and the key phylotypes affecting anaerobic digestion ad performance were studied by evaluating the process performance active microbiome and protein expression patterns during endogenous ammonia accumulation using integrated metagenomics and metaproteomics analyses acetate metabolism was most sensitive to ammonia stress and the expression activity of methyl com reductase of methanothrix was inhibited at relatively low ammonia concentrations which resulted in the accumulation of acetate and other short chain volatile fatty acids vfas through feedback effects as the ad process progressed the abundance of active methanosarcina with high ammonia tolerance increased and the activity of their enzymes related to acetoclastic methanation was significantly up regulated which resulted in the complete restoration of acetate metabolism and ad performance thus microbial communities can cope with acetate metabolic repression through self optimization in contrast when the total ammonia nitrogen tan and free ammonia nitrogen fan increased to 4846 95 mg n l and 337 46 mg n l respectively propionate and no other vfas accumulated in the digester which was accompanied by a decrease in methane yield by more than 65 at this time the abundance of active syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria spob decreased by 52 and the expression of key enzymes related to propionate degradation was significantly down regulated the proportion of down regulated differentially expressed proteins in the dominant pelotomaculum was as high as 94 indicating the severe suppression of the growth of these functional bacteria as well as their inability to easily acclimate to ammonia stress thus spob appeared to be the key microbial phylotypes affecting ad performance under ammonia stress ammonia inhibited the methylmalonyl coa pathway of pelotomaculum by inhibiting the expression of succinyl coa synthase which resulted in the suppression of syntrophic propionate oxidation the results of this study provide new insights into the microbial mechanism of ammonia inhibition and identify the key phylotypes affecting ad performance under ammonia stress our findings also shed light on the microbial regulatory targets of nitrogen rich waste anaerobic digesters graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion ammonia inhibition metagenomics metaproteomics 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad plays an important role in sustainable energy development and is widely considered beneficial for achieving carbon neutrality capson tojo et al 2020 however abundant nitrogenous substances in organic waste release ammonia during the ad process which makes the ad process prone to ammonia stress ammonia has thus become the primary cause of digester disruption ruiz sánchez et al 2018 given that ad is a microbial mediated biochemical process exploration of the microbial mechanism of ammonia stress could provide insights that could be used to counteract ammonia inhibition and improve the ad process many researchers have introduced ammonia disturbances into ad systems and characterized the response of microorganisms to ammonia stress bonk et al 2018 peng et al 2018 yan et al 2020 acetotrophic methanogens i e methanothrix formerly methanosaeta are generally thought to be the dominant methanogens in ad reactors as they are extremely sensitive to ammonia acetate metabolism can be inhibited in the presence of excessive ammonia which results in the massive accumulation of acetate and subsequent deterioration of the ad process lv et al 2019 ruiz sanchez et al 2019 however process performance can be restored by a shift in the dominant acetate metabolizing microorganisms from methanothrix to methanosarcina and the dominant methanogenesis pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis am to syntrophic acetate oxidation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm buhlmann et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a this information has led to the development of bioaugmentation techniques targeting acetate metabolism tian et al 2019 however toxic inhibitory effects have still been observed in some reactors dominated by methanosarcina peng et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 and commercial biogas digesters have also been frequently reported to experience ammonia inhibition for example many full scale ad plants in denmark operate under an inhibited state triggered by ammonia which results in a decrease in biogas yield up to 30 li et al 2018 there is thus still much to be learned regarding the mechanism of process instability induced by ammonia jiang et al 2019 our understanding of the aforementioned mechanism remains incomplete for two reasons first the extreme sensitivity of acetate metabolism to ammonia may mask the response of other metabolic processes to ammonia in ad such as propionate metabolism using propionate as the only carbon source li et al 2017 found that propionate degradation was inhibited by ammonia but acetate an intermediate metabolite was completely converted to methane our previous study showed that acetate metabolism is inhibited by ammonia at 3000 mg n l total ammonia nitrogen tan but can fully recover under long term operation and still maintain high activity at 6000 mg n l tan however propionate metabolism is severely inhibited by ammonia at 6000 mg n l tan and did not recover zhang et al 2020 second microbial information of ad systems is mainly obtained by amplicon sequencing these studies only permit rough descriptions of the function of microorganisms based on the ecophysiology of those known species of similar phylotypes ruiz sánchez et al 2018 however the metabolic functions of most microorganisms are unknown and the diversity and functional redundancy of microbial communities may lead to misunderstandings of community functions for example buhlmann et al 2019 detected no acetoclastic methanogens in ad samples by amplicon sequencing but picrust phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states analysis revealed that am related genes were more abundant than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm related genes therefore technical limitations may be one of the contributors to our incomplete understanding of the ammonia inhibition mechanism in ad systems integrated multi omics techniques can overcome the above obstacles to a certain extent as metagenomics involves the sequencing of whole genomes from environmental samples to obtain information on the functional potentials of the microbial community zhu et al 2019 whereas metaproteomics analysis can be used to identify proteins from the microbiome in complex environments as well as annotate proteins from the reference database through metagenomic sequencing to obtain information on specific active enzymes and provide direct evidence of active microbial functions jing et al 2017 here metagenomics and metaproteomics were used to analyze the response of active functional microorganisms and their protein expression patterns to endogenous ammonia accumulation derived from the in situ biodegradation of food waste during ad the aims of this study were to analyze the sensitivity and acclimation of different functional bacteria to ammonia stress identify the key phylotypes affecting ad performance and elucidate the mechanism underlying the metabolic repression of active functional microorganisms 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum food waste fw was used as the substrate in this study to avoid the possibility of ammonia inhibition and ensure the stable operation of the reactor in the start up stage bones chopsticks and other coarse impurities as well as large pieces of meat were removed from the fw collected from a cafeteria at chongqing university and the fw was washed with water to reduce the fat content finally the processed low protein fw was crushed to pieces 5 mm or less in size placed into ziplock bags and used as the substrate in the start up phase to avoid high fat inhibition as well as ensure that ammonia was the only disturbance factor synthetic high protein fw was used during the ammonia stress stage to ensure the uniformity of the substrate and the reliability of the experimental results all synthetic fw wet based mass ratio vegetable meat rice vegetable oil 39 16 44 1 was prepared in a single batch according to the properties of the actual fw the meat and rice were cooked first the raw materials were then fully crushed and mixed with a crusher and placed into ziplock bags all substrates were stored at 20 c inoculum was obtained from a rural biogas digester in chongqing the sludge was first passed through a 2 mm screen to remove coarse impurities and then was pre incubated to consume residual organic matter until biogas production stopped the physicochemical properties of the substrate and inoculum are shown in table s1 2 2 experimental equipment and operation a continuously stirred anaerobic reactor with an effective volume of 10 l was operated at 37 1 c there was a stirring motor with a stirring speed of 100 r min and an interval of 2 h every 4 h at the top of the reactor the reactor operated in semi continuous mode was fed and discharged once a day and the digestate was discharged before feeding the discharge volume was controlled according to the 10 l scale line on the reactor the organic loading rate was maintained at 2 5 gvs l d according to the characteristics of substrates in the different phases start up or ammonia stress the specific weight of fw was weighed and then diluted to 250 ml for feeding to maintain a hydraulic retention time hrt of 40 days the specific feeding regime is shown in fig s1 to induce the ad process of stability instability recovery complete failure biogas generation ceased the reactor was started with low protein fw and operated for one hrt high protein fw was then fed to induce endogenous ammonia accumulation until biogas generation ceased however the lab was shut down due to covid 19 and the experiment ended on day 158 at that point biogas yield had decreased by 68 2 3 chemical analysis the biogas volume was measured by a wet gas flowmeter and normalized to 273 15 k and 101 325 kpa and the biogas composition was measured by a portable methane meter total alkalinity ta ph total solids ts volatile solids vs tan and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were determined using standard methods volatile fatty acids vfas were determined by gas chromatography 7890a agilent usa scod with vfas deducted was defined as modified scod scodm free ammonia nitrogen fan was calculated using the modified davies equation suggested by capson tojo et al 2020 1 fan f k a tan f k a 10 ph 2 lg f 0 5 i 1 i 0 1276 i where ka is the acid base equilibrium constant with a value of 1 27 10 9 at 37 c f is the activity coefficient and i is the ionic strength which was calculated by considering only nh4 and its monovalent counter ion 2 4 metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis were conducted at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china all the measurements were performed in triplicate the procedures are detailed in the supplementary material 1 sequence data have been deposited in the ncbi short read archive database accession number srp299489 the gene abundance was evaluated using reads per kilobase million rpkm method the proteomic data have been uploaded to the proteomexchange consortium database accession number pxd023329 the thresholds of fold change fc 2 or 0 5 and p 0 05 were used to identify differentially expressed proteins deps 2 5 statistical analysis statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the statistical analysis was performed using statistical package for social sciences 24 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ammonia on reactor performance fig 1 shows the evolution of ammonia and various process parameters in the digester during the start up phase 1 40 d tan ph and fan were maintained at 736 31 56 57 mg n l 7 03 0 01 and 8 12 0 77 mg n l respectively and the methane yield my was maintained at 0 46 0 02 nl gvs which was within the normal my range 0 4 0 5 nl gvs previously reported for fw digesters li et al 2018 the vfa concentration was also maintained at an extremely low level this indicated the success of sludge domestication and high efficiency of reactor performance following the introduction of high protein waste on day 41 tan fan and ph increased by day 81 tan and fan reached 2276 60 mg n l and 78 36 mg n l respectively but there was no obvious accumulation of intermediate metabolites scodm and vfas furthermore my 0 48 0 03 nl gvs was even slightly higher than that observed during the start up phase which may be related to the higher biochemical methane potential of the substrate used in this phase table s1 thus this phase was regarded as the steady phase s from days 82 to 113 tan gradually increased from 2337 25 mg n l to 2956 35 mg n l fan increased from 78 48 mg n l at day 82 to 100 80 mg n l at day 96 then decreased and reached its lowest value of 36 99 mg n l at day 109 during this period an increase in scodm of 57 was observed and the concentrations of various vfas sharply increased starting on day 87 which was accompanied by a gradual decline in my until day 105 my decreased by 58 indicating severe inhibition of process performance this phase was defined as instability phase ⅰ i1 many previous researchers have observed performance deterioration under similar ammonia concentrations capson tojo et al 2020 however a continuous decline in my was not observed as it remained at 0 24 0 01 nl gvs since day 106 fig 1 this may stem from the fact that the rapid accumulation of vfa reduced the ph which led to a decrease in fan and alleviated ammonia inhibition in the digester astals et al 2018 noted that both fan and nh4 contribute to inhibition under typical ad conditions thus the decrease in one of them promotes performance restoration in addition some researchers have suggested that toxicity in aqueous solutions is mainly due to nh3 rather than nh4 in the ad process capson tojo et al 2020 although the tan concentration increased continuously the reactor performance began to recover starting on day 114 without any recovery measures being taken which is consistent with the above observations from days 114 to 144 my recovered to 0 51 nl gvs although a slight decline occurred at day 120 my was still within its range for the stable phase various vfas were rapidly consumed simultaneously and this period was defined as the recovery phase r the levels of tan 4511 10 mg n l and fan 254 17 mg n l at this time exceeded most previously reported inhibition thresholds capson tojo et al 2020 peng et al 2018 and their concentrations at phase i1 thus the efficient ad performance may be caused by the domestication and adaptation of microorganisms to ammonia stress domestication and optimization of operating conditions such as the addition of trace elements or biochar have been shown to be effective strategies for improving the ammonia tolerance of the ad process and tan levels can even reach 10 g n l capson tojo et al 2018 although both biogas yield and the vfa concentration recovered during phase r the scodm concentration was much higher during this phase than at phase s and even phase i1 shi et al 2017 noted that microorganisms accumulate organic matter in the form of extracellular polymeric substances eps under adverse environmental conditions thus the increased scodm may be the soluble eps throughout phases i1 and r acetate was the dominant vfa and it began to accumulate at day 82 which was 1 5 days earlier compared with the other vfas the accumulated acetate then began to be consumed two days earlier than the other vfas this indicated that acetate metabolism would be inhibited by the ammonia level at phase i1 but that it could recover under continuous ammonia stress however metabolic inhibition of other vfas may be related to feedback inhibition caused by acetate accumulation peng et al 2018 thus after acetate metabolism recovered the feedback effect was removed and the concentrations of other vfas decreased on day 145 tan and fan increased to 4846 95 mg n l and 337 46 mg n l respectively then scodm and propionate increased sharply and my decreased again although the concentrations of tan and fan decreased starting on day 148 and 146 and finally stabilized at 4130 02 218 57 mg n l and 224 11 14 34 mg n l respectively my continued to decline until day 158 when the experiment was terminated compared with the steady phase my decreased by 68 indicating that the reactor was severely inhibited this phase was defined as instability phase ⅱ i2 the decrease in the tan and fan concentrations at this stage was unexpected the tan concentration in the reactor was mainly related to the substrate composition the volume ratio of feeding substrate to discharged digestate gaseous emissions and microbial biomass fixation peng et al 2018 in our study the substrate was prepared in a single batch with high uniformity and the volume of the feed and discharge was constant thus the input of ammonia was constant in addition although fan is volatile and could evaporate to the gas phase according to henry s law this gas liquid equilibrium does not appear to be sufficient for resulting in sudden changes in the fan concentration thus the decrease in ammonia may be caused by the decrease in the microbial mineralization of organic nitrogen the significant increase in scodm during this phase supported this hypothesis as this reflected the accumulation of a large amount of dissolved organic matter in the system however the continuous decrease in scodm during phase i2 was inconsistent with the deterioration in biogas generation indicating that scodm may not be the cause of reactor instability the increase in propionate was consistent with the decrease in biogas generation indicating that propionate accumulation may be responsible for the deterioration of ad performance the concentration of propionate at phase i2 was not as high as that in phase i1 peak concentration 633 38 vs 894 46 mg l with the exception of propionate no other vfa accumulated indicating that the cause of instability in this phase was different from that during phase i1 and propionate metabolism appeared to be directly inhibited by ammonia previous studies indicated that propionate metabolism is less sensitive than acetate metabolism to ammonia stress however once it is inhibited the reactor performance irreversibly deteriorates li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020 the limited data stemming from the unexpected termination of the experiment due to covid 19 precluded us from making any conclusions regarding whether the deteriorated performance could be restored to further analyze the original cause of process instability under ammonia stress microbial samples from different phases were selected for omics analysis 3 2 multi omics analysis revealed the effect of endogenous ammonia stress on microorganisms and their metabolic functions based on the variation in the state indicators in response to ammonia inhibition the whole experiment was divided into five different operational phases the start up days 1 40 steady days 41 81 s instability ⅰ days 82 113 i1 recovery days 114 144 r and instability ⅱ days 145 158 i2 fig 1 to provide insight into the original cause of ammonia inhibition and reveal the underlying mechanism samples at day 79 108 129 and 158 were collected for multi omics analysis fig 1 and they were labeled as s i1 r and i2 respectively 3 2 1 overview of the microbiome information regarding data quality control of the metagenomics and metaproteomics analyses is shown in table s2 and fig s2 changes in the potential functions based on level 3 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathways and active proteins of the microbial community were evaluated using principal component analysis pca the results are presented in fig 2 a and 2b a high percentage of the variance was explained 98 74 and 91 11 respectively changes in both gene and protein levels were observed as the reaction progressed indicating that the potential functions and expression of active proteins were gradually affected by the long term accumulation of endogenous ammonia metagenomic analysis involves the sequencing of the whole genome in the environment which can be used to obtain functional potential information of the microbial community however given that some genes might not be expressed the results of the metagenomic analysis cannot be used to infer the actual functions of microorganisms metaproteomic analysis can be used to determine the proteins present in the microbiome and the functions of the proteins can be annotated using a reference database through metagenomic sequencing which provides direct evidence for active microbial functions jing et al 2017 thus the mechanism underlying the response of the microbial community to ammonia inhibition was mainly analyzed at the protein level the number of deps increased as the ad process progressed fig 2c specifically more up regulated proteins than down regulated proteins were observed for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s or in phases r and i1 by contrast more down regulated proteins were observed for the comparisons of samples in phases i2 and r or in phases i2 and s thus a sharp decrease in the metabolic activity of the microbial community occurred during phase i2 which probably stemmed from the failure of microbes to adapt to high ammonia conditions 3 2 2 potential key functional flora contributing to instability the distribution of the dominant active microorganisms sampled in different phases is shown in fig 3 various hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria responsible for carbohydrate degradation were observed and no obvious decrease in abundance was observed through comparison of samples in instability phases to those in stable or recovery phases fig 3a a slight decrease in protein degrading bacteria was observed in phase i2 but the abundance of these bacteria was still higher in phase i2 than in phase s fig 3b the relative abundance of lipid degrading bacteria fig 3c and syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob fig 3e increased throughout the experiment no significant decrease in methanogens occurred in phase i1 and a gradual increase was observed in phase r and i2 fig 3f these metabolic pathways might not be the key to process instability however the relative abundance of amino acid degrading bacteria gradually decreased and a sharp decrease by 31 86 in phase i2 was observed fig 3b in addition there was no significant variation in syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria spob in phase i1 followed by a significant increase in phase r however a significant decrease by 51 79 occurred in phase i2 fig 3d and the abundance of spob was lower in phase i2 than in phases s and i1 these observations suggest that amino acid degrading bacteria and spob might be the key functional microorganisms underlying ammonia inhibition considering the severe accumulation of acetate butyrate and valerate in the reactor further analysis of the active microbiome namely amino acid degrading bacteria syntrophs and methanogens including changes in their relative abundance and protein expression in response to the gradual accumulation of ammonia concentration was conducted 3 2 3 amino acid degrading bacteria and their functional protein expression profile a total of 1 231 functional proteins related to amino acid metabolism were identified table s3 which were widely distributed in various functional microorganisms due to the functional diversity of these proteins among the amino acid degrading bacteria there were 46 functional proteins related to amino acid metabolism in tissierella 44 proteins in aminivibrio 30 proteins in lutispora and 11 proteins in aminobacterium the abundance of the highly metabolically active aminivibrio gradually decreased during the experiment and a decrease of 67 was observed in phase i2 fig 3b in contrast the abundance of lutispora decreased significantly p 0 05 only in phase i2 and other functional bacteria were continuously enriched during the experiment fig 4 a and table s4 show the deps of four types of functional bacteria which were determined through comparison of samples from the targeted phase with the previous phase for samples in phases i1 and s or in phases r and i1 more up regulated proteins than down regulated proteins were observed and the proportion of up regulated proteins was 67 and 70 respectively fig 4a by contrast a large number of down regulated proteins 22 of aminivibrio were observed for the comparison of samples in phases i2 and r and the expression of deps of all amino acid degrading bacteria was down regulated by approximately 62 which was consistent with the variation in microbial abundance at the genus level indicating that amino acid metabolism was impaired in phase i2 down regulated proteins of aminivibrio in phase i2 were mainly involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites map 01110 9 and glycine serine and threonine metabolism map 00260 7 table s4 the expression of deps involved in glycine serine and threonine metabolism in amino acid degrading bacteria was down regulated by approximately 67 suggesting that amino acid metabolism was severely inhibited impaired amino acid metabolism leads to the accumulation of amino acids and reduction in the release of ammonia nitrogen which corroborates the hypothesis in section 3 1 predicting that the dramatic increase in scodm in phase i2 may be related to amino acid accumulation caused by the decreased activity of amino acid degrading bacteria the unexpected decrease in ammonia nitrogen may also be related to the weakened microbial mineralization of nitrogenous substances the number of up regulated proteins of tissierella and lutispora in phase i2 was roughly similar to the number of down regulated proteins indicating that their metabolic activities were not severely inhibited by ammonia fig 4a all deps of aminobacterium in phase i2 were up regulated indicating that they were highly tolerant of ammonia stress these up regulated deps were derived from aminobacterium colombiensegen and were all related to glycine serine and threonine metabolism suggesting that the enrichment of this bacterium contributed to the recovery of glycine serine and threonine metabolism this might also be the reason for the gradual decline in scodm that occurred in the later stage of phase i2 although the degradation of amino acids was impaired in phase i2 overall amino acid metabolism was expected to recover after long term acclimation due to the functional redundancy of microorganisms that are highly tolerant of ammonia in other words the toxicity to these microorganisms is likely reversible and amino acid metabolism may not be the cause of ammonia inhibition 3 2 4 butyrate and valerate degrading bacteria and their functional protein expression profiles the degradation of butyrate and valerate was mainly through the β oxidation process fig s3 and a total of 164 proteins were identified in this experiment the dominant genera included syntrophomonas 33 tissierella 11 syntrophorhabdus 9 and thermosyntropha 7 table s5 syntrophomonas and thermosyntropha are syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing bacteria that can degrade fatty acids with c4 c18 by β oxidation stams et al 2012 the reason why aromatic acid degrading syntrophorhabdus expressed related proteins was that the degradation of aromatic compounds typically first involves the conversion of aromatic acids to benzoic acid and the anaerobic degradation of benzoic acid is carried out through a pathway similar to fatty acid β oxidation sieber et al 2012 tissierella which are typically protein degrading bacteria expressed all the enzymes required for β oxidation pathway but these enzymes were only involved in the β oxidation of fatty acids with c4 c6 in addition tissierella also expressed butyrate kinase ec 2 7 2 7 buk phosphate butyryltransferase ec 2 3 1 19 ptb and acetate coa transferase ec 2 8 3 8 ato which can convert butyrate to butyryl coa for further degradation through the β oxidation pathway however they do not express long chain acyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 3 which can convert lcfas to long chain fatty acyl coa thus tissierella might be c4 c6 fatty acid degradation bacteria the overall abundance of butyrate and valerate degrading bacteria including syntrophomonas thermosyntropha and tissierella gradually increased during the experiment fig 3b c the numbers of up regulated proteins 7 and down regulated proteins 8 were roughly equivalent for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s indicating that butyrate and valerate degradation was not severely inhibited in phase i1 fig 4b this confirmed the hypothesis of the physicochemical analysis in section 3 1 positing that the accumulation of butyrate and valerate in phase i1 mainly stems from the feedback inhibition from acetate accumulation approximately 90 of the 21 deps were up regulated proteins for the comparisons of samples in phases r and i1 thus enhanced performance was observed however most of the 22 deps were down regulated proteins approximately 68 for the comparisons of samples in phases i2 and r indicating that their metabolic performance weakened given that microbial community activity can also be affected by substrate availability such as the concentration of butyrate and valerate the butyrate and valerate concentration in phase i2 was comparable to that in phase s and the deps for the phase i2 and phase s comparison were investigated table s6 a large number of deps 28 were detected by comparing phases i2 and s and most of them were up regulated 61 this finding combined with the greater abundances of butyrate and valerate degrading bacteria at phase i2 than at phase s indicated that the metabolism of butyrate and valerate was not inhibited at phase i2 compared with phase s therefore butyrate and valerate metabolism was not the cause of ammonia inhibition 3 2 5 spob and their functional protein expression profile a total of 309 proteins were annotated to the propionate metabolism pathway map 00640 which mainly included the propionate activation process 64 and the methylmalonyl coa pathway mmc pathway 88 table s7 fig s4 few propionate activation related proteins were derived from propionate degrading bacteria which mainly stemmed from the functional diversity of these proteins mmc related proteins were mainly derived from pelotomaculum and syntrophobacter pelotomaculum was the most dominant propionate degrading microorganism fig 3d and its abundance decreased significantly in phase i1 p 0 05 followed by complete recovery in phase r and then a significant decrease by 49 in phase i2 p 0 05 fig 4c shows the deps of pelotomaculum for comparisons of the targeted phase with the previous phase the number of deps of pelotomaculum increased from phase i1 to r but the numbers of up regulated proteins and down regulated proteins were almost the same there were a large number of deps for the comparisons of samples in phases i2 and r and approximately 94 15 16 of them were down regulated confirming that the propionate metabolic activity of this genus was severely inhibited among the down regulated proteins of pelotomaculum in phase i2 seven of them were succinyl coa synthase ec 6 2 1 5 succ d table s8 this was also the enzyme that led to the enrichment of most down regulated deps in phase i2 indicating that the impaired propionate metabolism of this genus was mainly related to succinyl coa synthase moreover a total of eight succinyl coa synthases from pelotomaculum were detected and seven of them were significantly down regulated fc 0 5 p 0 05 fig 4f indicating that the expression of all succinyl coa synthetases of this genus sharply decreased in the i2 phase in the syntrophic propionate oxidation spo process the oxidation of succinate to fumarate is directly controlled by hm because the succinate dehydrogenase ec 1 3 5 4 frd that catalyzes this process requires quinone as an electron acceptor and quinone is oxidized by hydrogenase to produce h2 thus these reactions require hm to maintain h2 at a low level sieber et al 2012 the expression of most succinate dehydrogenases did not decrease in phase i2 which confirmed that the activity of pelotomaculum decreased because its succinyl coa synthase was deactivated by ammonia and this was not related to methanogenesis syntrophobacter was not the dominant propionate degrading microorganism and its relative abundance decreased during the experiment a significant decrease was observed in both phase r and i2 p 0 05 the deps related to the propionate degradation of syntrophobacter which were identified through comparison of samples from the targeted phase with the previous phase were generally down regulated at all phases the number of down regulated deps increased starting in phase r and included various functional enzymes confirming that the propionate degradation function of syntrophobacter was severely inhibited starting in phase r fig 4c candidatus syntrophosphaera was another dominant spob detected in the reactor and its abundance continued to increase from phase s to r followed by a significant decrease in phase i2 p 0 05 indicating that it was tolerant of ammonia fig 3d however functional proteins related to propionate metabolism were not detected and this probably stems from their low expression levels therefore the activity of all spob was severely inhibited in phase i2 and they might be the key to explaining process instability because of the lack of the functional redundancy of microorganisms with high ammonia tolerance 3 2 6 saob and their functional protein expression profile syntrophic acetate oxidation sao is a special link in the acetogenesis stage as it can convert acetate into h2 and co2 when acetate metabolism is blocked and then be consumed by hm sao is mainly carried out through the wood ljungdahl pathway wl pathway or the glycine cleavage system pathway gcs pathway fig s5 wei et al 2020 although a large number of sao related proteins were detected most of them were derived from acetogens and methanogens which is related to the functional diversity of enzymes involved in glycine cleavage and acetate activation for saob only clostridium ultunense which degrades acetate through the gcs pathway wei et al 2020 was detected in this study and five gcs related proteins were expressed table s9 fig 4d and table s9 show the deps of clostridium ultunense through comparison of samples from the targeted phase with the previous phase the expression of five functional proteins of clostridium ultunense did not change significantly for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s or in phases r and i1 but the expression of four of them was up regulated significantly p 0 05 for the comparisons of samples in phases i2 and r which is consistent with changes in the relative abundance of clostridium ultunense in fig 3e this indicates that the sao pathway plays an important role in acetate metabolism during phase i2 and can benefit ad performance the negative effect of the sao pathway on process stability can thus be excluded 3 2 7 methanogens and their functional protein expression maps methanogenesis is the last stage of ad which includes am hm and methyltrophic methanogenesis fig s6 a total of 325 functional proteins related to three methanogenesis pathways were detected and they were mainly expressed by five dominant methanogens 199 fig 3f table s10 acetotrophic methanothrix expressed 24 am related proteins and hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum methanoculleus and methanosphaerula expressed 30 60 and 17 hm related proteins respectively methanosarcina expressed 90 methanogenesis related proteins which were abundant in all three methanogenesis pathways both methanothrix and methanosarcina can use acetate to produce methane methanothrix was the most abundant methanogen in phase s but it continued to decrease as the ad process progressed fig 3f which is consistent with its low tolerance of ammonia capson tojo et al 2020 the abundance of methanosarcina gradually increased during the experiment and eventually replaced methanothrix as the most dominant methanogen 15 fig 3f the high ammonia tolerance of this genus is reported to be related to its ability to form a niche environment with a low ammonia concentration in the center of the cell cluster yan et al 2019 deps of methanothrix increased gradually during the experiment fig 4e the number of up regulated and down regulated proteins was almost the same for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s and the number of down regulated proteins in deps was as high as 91 for the comparisons of samples in phases r and i1 as well as phases i2 and r 10 11 and 29 32 respectively indicating that methanothrix experienced increasing ammonia stress although only three down regulated proteins were observed for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s all of them were methyl com reductases ec 2 8 4 1 mcra b which are responsible for the last step of methanogenesis the abundance of all methyl com reductases 8 of methanothrix decreased fc 0 72 indicating that the am pathway was impaired table s11 and fig 4f therefore ammonia mainly inhibited the expression of methyl com reductase of methanothrix which impaired its am function and reduced the acetate metabolic activity of the system however since the beginning of phase r the expression of the enzymes acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetyl coa decarbonylase acds involved in am in methanosarcina was significantly up regulated in the targeted phase compared with the previous phase and the fc values were as high as 148 38 91 32 and 39 69 respectively table s11 and fig 4f acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase are functional enzymes that convert acetate to acetyl coa acds continued to convert acetyl coa to 5 methyl thm s pt and then entered the common pathway of methanogenesis compared with the previous phase the deps related to the common pathway of methanogenesis such as methyl com reductase of methanosarcina were also up regulated in phases r and i2 and methyl com reductase had the highest fc value of 250 49 in phase r table s11 thus although methanosarcina was not the most dominant in phase r acetate degradation activity appeared to be strengthened due to the significantly up regulated proteins hanreich et al 2013 also found that methanogens with abundances lower than 4 contributed 20 30 of the total identified proteins indicating the existence of some metabolically hyperactive methanogens in the ad system the abundance of methanosphaerula decreased during the experiment the abundance of methanospirillum first increased and then decreased to a level significantly lower than that of phase s in phase i2 p 0 05 the abundance of methanoculleus increased gradually fig 3f with the contribution of methanosarcina the total abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased as the ad process progressed the dynamics of their hm related deps were consistent with the variation in the abundances of different microorganisms in the microbial community fig 4e and table s11 functional proteins of hydrogenotrophic methanogens were generally up regulated in phases i1 and r compared with the previous phase at phase i2 the expression of down regulated proteins from methanospirillum greatly increased due to their limited ammonia tolerance however a large number of proteins originating from methanosarcina and methanoculleus which are tolerant of high ammonia levels were up regulated as a consequence the total number of down regulated and up regulated proteins was almost the same this finding combined with the high abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in phase i2 indicated that the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were sufficiently redundant to cope with ammonia stress and hm activity was not severely inhibited by ammonia proteins related to methyltrophic methanogenesis were mainly derived from methanosarcina the related deps identified through comparison of samples from the targeted phase with the previous phase are shown in table s11 the number of deps was relatively small for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s and there were slightly more down regulated proteins than up regulated proteins however the number of deps increased substantially and all deps were up regulated for the comparisons of samples in phases r and i1 as well as phases i2 and r the abundance of some proteins increased sharply in phase r with fc values as high as 122 24 the methyltrophic methanogenesis function of methanosarcina was also greatly strengthened in phase r in conclusion three types of functional proteins of methanosarcina showed high expression activity under high ammonia stress this finding combined with the absolute dominance of methanosarcina in phase i2 indicates that it carries out various methanogenesis functions at a high metabolic level under long term ammonia stress confirming that the methanogenesis process is not the source of reactor instability 3 3 microbial mechanism of process instability induced by ammonia stress as shown in fig 5 methanothrix was most sensitive to ammonia during endogenous ammonia accumulation when tan 2337 25 mg n l and fan 78 48 mg n l the expression activity of methyl com reductase of methanothrix decreased significantly which reduced the bioconversion of acetate to methane subsequently acetate accumulated and feedback inhibition of other vfas occurred as well finally a significant decrease in my was observed and the ad process was inhibited however the total abundance of active methanogens only decreased by approximately 4 in this phase and the number of up regulated proteins was greater than the number of down regulated proteins in microbial consortia indicating high robustness of the microbial communities as the process progressed the abundance of active methanosarcina with high ammonia tolerance increased and the activity of their am related enzymes was significantly up regulated which resulted in the complete restoration of acetate metabolism and ad performance confirming that microbial communities could cope with acetate metabolic repression through self optimization acetate metabolism was not the key to ammonia inhibition when tan and fan increased to 4846 95 mg n l and 337 46 mg n l respectively propionate and no other vfas accumulated and the my decreased by more than 65 at this stage the proportion of down regulated proteins in microbial consortia was much higher than that of up regulated proteins 35 00 vs 22 31 indicating the severe deterioration of community activity moreover the abundance of active spob decreased by 52 the expression of key enzymes related to propionate degradation was generally down regulated and the proportion of down regulated deps in the dominant pelotomaculum was as high as 94 indicating significant suppression spob are usually minority community members with extremely specialized functions carballa et al 2015 spob have never been observed to achieve functional resilience under ammonia stress through shifts in the dominant microorganisms from sensitive to resistant ones or through shifts in metabolic pathways moreover the significant decrease in their abundance and down regulated deps suggested that the recovery of propionate metabolism through self optimization and reorganization might be difficult or even impossible to achieve thus spob may be the key microbial phylotypes affecting ad performance under ammonia stress in addition ammonia inhibited the mmc pathway of pelotomaculum by inhibiting the expression of succinyl coa synthase which resulted in the suppression of syntrophic propionate oxidation 4 conclusion acetate metabolism was most sensitive to ammonia in ad ammonia inhibits the expression of methyl com reductase of methanothrix and restrains acetate metabolism however continuous ammonia stress can induce a shift in the dominant acetate degrading microorganisms from methanothrix to methanosarcina the latter have high ammonia tolerance and can promote the recovery of acetate metabolism through an am pathway mediated by acetate kinase phosphate acetyltransferase and acds by comparison propionate metabolism was less sensitive to ammonia stress however under high ammonia stress the abundance of active spob decreased by 52 and the expression of key enzymes related to propionate degradation was generally down regulated indicating the severe suppression of the growth of these functional bacteria as well as their inability to easily acclimate to ammonia stress thus spob are the key microbial phylotypes affecting ad performance under ammonia stress ammonia inhibited the expression of succinyl coa synthase of pelotomaculum which blocked the mmc pathway and propionate accumulation increased focus on the spo process is needed for the development of microbial regulation strategies effective for alleviating ammonia inhibition credit authorship contribution statement hong zhang

16223,ammonia inhibition is one of the most common causes of instability during the operation of commercial biogas plants here the sensitivity of different functional bacteria to ammonia stress the ability of functional bacteria to adapt to ammonia stress and the key phylotypes affecting anaerobic digestion ad performance were studied by evaluating the process performance active microbiome and protein expression patterns during endogenous ammonia accumulation using integrated metagenomics and metaproteomics analyses acetate metabolism was most sensitive to ammonia stress and the expression activity of methyl com reductase of methanothrix was inhibited at relatively low ammonia concentrations which resulted in the accumulation of acetate and other short chain volatile fatty acids vfas through feedback effects as the ad process progressed the abundance of active methanosarcina with high ammonia tolerance increased and the activity of their enzymes related to acetoclastic methanation was significantly up regulated which resulted in the complete restoration of acetate metabolism and ad performance thus microbial communities can cope with acetate metabolic repression through self optimization in contrast when the total ammonia nitrogen tan and free ammonia nitrogen fan increased to 4846 95 mg n l and 337 46 mg n l respectively propionate and no other vfas accumulated in the digester which was accompanied by a decrease in methane yield by more than 65 at this time the abundance of active syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria spob decreased by 52 and the expression of key enzymes related to propionate degradation was significantly down regulated the proportion of down regulated differentially expressed proteins in the dominant pelotomaculum was as high as 94 indicating the severe suppression of the growth of these functional bacteria as well as their inability to easily acclimate to ammonia stress thus spob appeared to be the key microbial phylotypes affecting ad performance under ammonia stress ammonia inhibited the methylmalonyl coa pathway of pelotomaculum by inhibiting the expression of succinyl coa synthase which resulted in the suppression of syntrophic propionate oxidation the results of this study provide new insights into the microbial mechanism of ammonia inhibition and identify the key phylotypes affecting ad performance under ammonia stress our findings also shed light on the microbial regulatory targets of nitrogen rich waste anaerobic digesters graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion ammonia inhibition metagenomics metaproteomics 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad plays an important role in sustainable energy development and is widely considered beneficial for achieving carbon neutrality capson tojo et al 2020 however abundant nitrogenous substances in organic waste release ammonia during the ad process which makes the ad process prone to ammonia stress ammonia has thus become the primary cause of digester disruption ruiz sánchez et al 2018 given that ad is a microbial mediated biochemical process exploration of the microbial mechanism of ammonia stress could provide insights that could be used to counteract ammonia inhibition and improve the ad process many researchers have introduced ammonia disturbances into ad systems and characterized the response of microorganisms to ammonia stress bonk et al 2018 peng et al 2018 yan et al 2020 acetotrophic methanogens i e methanothrix formerly methanosaeta are generally thought to be the dominant methanogens in ad reactors as they are extremely sensitive to ammonia acetate metabolism can be inhibited in the presence of excessive ammonia which results in the massive accumulation of acetate and subsequent deterioration of the ad process lv et al 2019 ruiz sanchez et al 2019 however process performance can be restored by a shift in the dominant acetate metabolizing microorganisms from methanothrix to methanosarcina and the dominant methanogenesis pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis am to syntrophic acetate oxidation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm buhlmann et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a this information has led to the development of bioaugmentation techniques targeting acetate metabolism tian et al 2019 however toxic inhibitory effects have still been observed in some reactors dominated by methanosarcina peng et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 and commercial biogas digesters have also been frequently reported to experience ammonia inhibition for example many full scale ad plants in denmark operate under an inhibited state triggered by ammonia which results in a decrease in biogas yield up to 30 li et al 2018 there is thus still much to be learned regarding the mechanism of process instability induced by ammonia jiang et al 2019 our understanding of the aforementioned mechanism remains incomplete for two reasons first the extreme sensitivity of acetate metabolism to ammonia may mask the response of other metabolic processes to ammonia in ad such as propionate metabolism using propionate as the only carbon source li et al 2017 found that propionate degradation was inhibited by ammonia but acetate an intermediate metabolite was completely converted to methane our previous study showed that acetate metabolism is inhibited by ammonia at 3000 mg n l total ammonia nitrogen tan but can fully recover under long term operation and still maintain high activity at 6000 mg n l tan however propionate metabolism is severely inhibited by ammonia at 6000 mg n l tan and did not recover zhang et al 2020 second microbial information of ad systems is mainly obtained by amplicon sequencing these studies only permit rough descriptions of the function of microorganisms based on the ecophysiology of those known species of similar phylotypes ruiz sánchez et al 2018 however the metabolic functions of most microorganisms are unknown and the diversity and functional redundancy of microbial communities may lead to misunderstandings of community functions for example buhlmann et al 2019 detected no acetoclastic methanogens in ad samples by amplicon sequencing but picrust phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states analysis revealed that am related genes were more abundant than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm related genes therefore technical limitations may be one of the contributors to our incomplete understanding of the ammonia inhibition mechanism in ad systems integrated multi omics techniques can overcome the above obstacles to a certain extent as metagenomics involves the sequencing of whole genomes from environmental samples to obtain information on the functional potentials of the microbial community zhu et al 2019 whereas metaproteomics analysis can be used to identify proteins from the microbiome in complex environments as well as annotate proteins from the reference database through metagenomic sequencing to obtain information on specific active enzymes and provide direct evidence of active microbial functions jing et al 2017 here metagenomics and metaproteomics were used to analyze the response of active functional microorganisms and their protein expression patterns to endogenous ammonia accumulation derived from the in situ biodegradation of food waste during ad the aims of this study were to analyze the sensitivity and acclimation of different functional bacteria to ammonia stress identify the key phylotypes affecting ad performance and elucidate the mechanism underlying the metabolic repression of active functional microorganisms 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum food waste fw was used as the substrate in this study to avoid the possibility of ammonia inhibition and ensure the stable operation of the reactor in the start up stage bones chopsticks and other coarse impurities as well as large pieces of meat were removed from the fw collected from a cafeteria at chongqing university and the fw was washed with water to reduce the fat content finally the processed low protein fw was crushed to pieces 5 mm or less in size placed into ziplock bags and used as the substrate in the start up phase to avoid high fat inhibition as well as ensure that ammonia was the only disturbance factor synthetic high protein fw was used during the ammonia stress stage to ensure the uniformity of the substrate and the reliability of the experimental results all synthetic fw wet based mass ratio vegetable meat rice vegetable oil 39 16 44 1 was prepared in a single batch according to the properties of the actual fw the meat and rice were cooked first the raw materials were then fully crushed and mixed with a crusher and placed into ziplock bags all substrates were stored at 20 c inoculum was obtained from a rural biogas digester in chongqing the sludge was first passed through a 2 mm screen to remove coarse impurities and then was pre incubated to consume residual organic matter until biogas production stopped the physicochemical properties of the substrate and inoculum are shown in table s1 2 2 experimental equipment and operation a continuously stirred anaerobic reactor with an effective volume of 10 l was operated at 37 1 c there was a stirring motor with a stirring speed of 100 r min and an interval of 2 h every 4 h at the top of the reactor the reactor operated in semi continuous mode was fed and discharged once a day and the digestate was discharged before feeding the discharge volume was controlled according to the 10 l scale line on the reactor the organic loading rate was maintained at 2 5 gvs l d according to the characteristics of substrates in the different phases start up or ammonia stress the specific weight of fw was weighed and then diluted to 250 ml for feeding to maintain a hydraulic retention time hrt of 40 days the specific feeding regime is shown in fig s1 to induce the ad process of stability instability recovery complete failure biogas generation ceased the reactor was started with low protein fw and operated for one hrt high protein fw was then fed to induce endogenous ammonia accumulation until biogas generation ceased however the lab was shut down due to covid 19 and the experiment ended on day 158 at that point biogas yield had decreased by 68 2 3 chemical analysis the biogas volume was measured by a wet gas flowmeter and normalized to 273 15 k and 101 325 kpa and the biogas composition was measured by a portable methane meter total alkalinity ta ph total solids ts volatile solids vs tan and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were determined using standard methods volatile fatty acids vfas were determined by gas chromatography 7890a agilent usa scod with vfas deducted was defined as modified scod scodm free ammonia nitrogen fan was calculated using the modified davies equation suggested by capson tojo et al 2020 1 fan f k a tan f k a 10 ph 2 lg f 0 5 i 1 i 0 1276 i where ka is the acid base equilibrium constant with a value of 1 27 10 9 at 37 c f is the activity coefficient and i is the ionic strength which was calculated by considering only nh4 and its monovalent counter ion 2 4 metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis were conducted at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china all the measurements were performed in triplicate the procedures are detailed in the supplementary material 1 sequence data have been deposited in the ncbi short read archive database accession number srp299489 the gene abundance was evaluated using reads per kilobase million rpkm method the proteomic data have been uploaded to the proteomexchange consortium database accession number pxd023329 the thresholds of fold change fc 2 or 0 5 and p 0 05 were used to identify differentially expressed proteins deps 2 5 statistical analysis statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the statistical analysis was performed using statistical package for social sciences 24 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ammonia on reactor performance fig 1 shows the evolution of ammonia and various process parameters in the digester during the start up phase 1 40 d tan ph and fan were maintained at 736 31 56 57 mg n l 7 03 0 01 and 8 12 0 77 mg n l respectively and the methane yield my was maintained at 0 46 0 02 nl gvs which was within the normal my range 0 4 0 5 nl gvs previously reported for fw digesters li et al 2018 the vfa concentration was also maintained at an extremely low level this indicated the success of sludge domestication and high efficiency of reactor performance following the introduction of high protein waste on day 41 tan fan and ph increased by day 81 tan and fan reached 2276 60 mg n l and 78 36 mg n l respectively but there was no obvious accumulation of intermediate metabolites scodm and vfas furthermore my 0 48 0 03 nl gvs was even slightly higher than that observed during the start up phase which may be related to the higher biochemical methane potential of the substrate used in this phase table s1 thus this phase was regarded as the steady phase s from days 82 to 113 tan gradually increased from 2337 25 mg n l to 2956 35 mg n l fan increased from 78 48 mg n l at day 82 to 100 80 mg n l at day 96 then decreased and reached its lowest value of 36 99 mg n l at day 109 during this period an increase in scodm of 57 was observed and the concentrations of various vfas sharply increased starting on day 87 which was accompanied by a gradual decline in my until day 105 my decreased by 58 indicating severe inhibition of process performance this phase was defined as instability phase ⅰ i1 many previous researchers have observed performance deterioration under similar ammonia concentrations capson tojo et al 2020 however a continuous decline in my was not observed as it remained at 0 24 0 01 nl gvs since day 106 fig 1 this may stem from the fact that the rapid accumulation of vfa reduced the ph which led to a decrease in fan and alleviated ammonia inhibition in the digester astals et al 2018 noted that both fan and nh4 contribute to inhibition under typical ad conditions thus the decrease in one of them promotes performance restoration in addition some researchers have suggested that toxicity in aqueous solutions is mainly due to nh3 rather than nh4 in the ad process capson tojo et al 2020 although the tan concentration increased continuously the reactor performance began to recover starting on day 114 without any recovery measures being taken which is consistent with the above observations from days 114 to 144 my recovered to 0 51 nl gvs although a slight decline occurred at day 120 my was still within its range for the stable phase various vfas were rapidly consumed simultaneously and this period was defined as the recovery phase r the levels of tan 4511 10 mg n l and fan 254 17 mg n l at this time exceeded most previously reported inhibition thresholds capson tojo et al 2020 peng et al 2018 and their concentrations at phase i1 thus the efficient ad performance may be caused by the domestication and adaptation of microorganisms to ammonia stress domestication and optimization of operating conditions such as the addition of trace elements or biochar have been shown to be effective strategies for improving the ammonia tolerance of the ad process and tan levels can even reach 10 g n l capson tojo et al 2018 although both biogas yield and the vfa concentration recovered during phase r the scodm concentration was much higher during this phase than at phase s and even phase i1 shi et al 2017 noted that microorganisms accumulate organic matter in the form of extracellular polymeric substances eps under adverse environmental conditions thus the increased scodm may be the soluble eps throughout phases i1 and r acetate was the dominant vfa and it began to accumulate at day 82 which was 1 5 days earlier compared with the other vfas the accumulated acetate then began to be consumed two days earlier than the other vfas this indicated that acetate metabolism would be inhibited by the ammonia level at phase i1 but that it could recover under continuous ammonia stress however metabolic inhibition of other vfas may be related to feedback inhibition caused by acetate accumulation peng et al 2018 thus after acetate metabolism recovered the feedback effect was removed and the concentrations of other vfas decreased on day 145 tan and fan increased to 4846 95 mg n l and 337 46 mg n l respectively then scodm and propionate increased sharply and my decreased again although the concentrations of tan and fan decreased starting on day 148 and 146 and finally stabilized at 4130 02 218 57 mg n l and 224 11 14 34 mg n l respectively my continued to decline until day 158 when the experiment was terminated compared with the steady phase my decreased by 68 indicating that the reactor was severely inhibited this phase was defined as instability phase ⅱ i2 the decrease in the tan and fan concentrations at this stage was unexpected the tan concentration in the reactor was mainly related to the substrate composition the volume ratio of feeding substrate to discharged digestate gaseous emissions and microbial biomass fixation peng et al 2018 in our study the substrate was prepared in a single batch with high uniformity and the volume of the feed and discharge was constant thus the input of ammonia was constant in addition although fan is volatile and could evaporate to the gas phase according to henry s law this gas liquid equilibrium does not appear to be sufficient for resulting in sudden changes in the fan concentration thus the decrease in ammonia may be caused by the decrease in the microbial mineralization of organic nitrogen the significant increase in scodm during this phase supported this hypothesis as this reflected the accumulation of a large amount of dissolved organic matter in the system however the continuous decrease in scodm during phase i2 was inconsistent with the deterioration in biogas generation indicating that scodm may not be the cause of reactor instability the increase in propionate was consistent with the decrease in biogas generation indicating that propionate accumulation may be responsible for the deterioration of ad performance the concentration of propionate at phase i2 was not as high as that in phase i1 peak concentration 633 38 vs 894 46 mg l with the exception of propionate no other vfa accumulated indicating that the cause of instability in this phase was different from that during phase i1 and propionate metabolism appeared to be directly inhibited by ammonia previous studies indicated that propionate metabolism is less sensitive than acetate metabolism to ammonia stress however once it is inhibited the reactor performance irreversibly deteriorates li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020 the limited data stemming from the unexpected termination of the experiment due to covid 19 precluded us from making any conclusions regarding whether the deteriorated performance could be restored to further analyze the original cause of process instability under ammonia stress microbial samples from different phases were selected for omics analysis 3 2 multi omics analysis revealed the effect of endogenous ammonia stress on microorganisms and their metabolic functions based on the variation in the state indicators in response to ammonia inhibition the whole experiment was divided into five different operational phases the start up days 1 40 steady days 41 81 s instability ⅰ days 82 113 i1 recovery days 114 144 r and instability ⅱ days 145 158 i2 fig 1 to provide insight into the original cause of ammonia inhibition and reveal the underlying mechanism samples at day 79 108 129 and 158 were collected for multi omics analysis fig 1 and they were labeled as s i1 r and i2 respectively 3 2 1 overview of the microbiome information regarding data quality control of the metagenomics and metaproteomics analyses is shown in table s2 and fig s2 changes in the potential functions based on level 3 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathways and active proteins of the microbial community were evaluated using principal component analysis pca the results are presented in fig 2 a and 2b a high percentage of the variance was explained 98 74 and 91 11 respectively changes in both gene and protein levels were observed as the reaction progressed indicating that the potential functions and expression of active proteins were gradually affected by the long term accumulation of endogenous ammonia metagenomic analysis involves the sequencing of the whole genome in the environment which can be used to obtain functional potential information of the microbial community however given that some genes might not be expressed the results of the metagenomic analysis cannot be used to infer the actual functions of microorganisms metaproteomic analysis can be used to determine the proteins present in the microbiome and the functions of the proteins can be annotated using a reference database through metagenomic sequencing which provides direct evidence for active microbial functions jing et al 2017 thus the mechanism underlying the response of the microbial community to ammonia inhibition was mainly analyzed at the protein level the number of deps increased as the ad process progressed fig 2c specifically more up regulated proteins than down regulated proteins were observed for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s or in phases r and i1 by contrast more down regulated proteins were observed for the comparisons of samples in phases i2 and r or in phases i2 and s thus a sharp decrease in the metabolic activity of the microbial community occurred during phase i2 which probably stemmed from the failure of microbes to adapt to high ammonia conditions 3 2 2 potential key functional flora contributing to instability the distribution of the dominant active microorganisms sampled in different phases is shown in fig 3 various hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria responsible for carbohydrate degradation were observed and no obvious decrease in abundance was observed through comparison of samples in instability phases to those in stable or recovery phases fig 3a a slight decrease in protein degrading bacteria was observed in phase i2 but the abundance of these bacteria was still higher in phase i2 than in phase s fig 3b the relative abundance of lipid degrading bacteria fig 3c and syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob fig 3e increased throughout the experiment no significant decrease in methanogens occurred in phase i1 and a gradual increase was observed in phase r and i2 fig 3f these metabolic pathways might not be the key to process instability however the relative abundance of amino acid degrading bacteria gradually decreased and a sharp decrease by 31 86 in phase i2 was observed fig 3b in addition there was no significant variation in syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria spob in phase i1 followed by a significant increase in phase r however a significant decrease by 51 79 occurred in phase i2 fig 3d and the abundance of spob was lower in phase i2 than in phases s and i1 these observations suggest that amino acid degrading bacteria and spob might be the key functional microorganisms underlying ammonia inhibition considering the severe accumulation of acetate butyrate and valerate in the reactor further analysis of the active microbiome namely amino acid degrading bacteria syntrophs and methanogens including changes in their relative abundance and protein expression in response to the gradual accumulation of ammonia concentration was conducted 3 2 3 amino acid degrading bacteria and their functional protein expression profile a total of 1 231 functional proteins related to amino acid metabolism were identified table s3 which were widely distributed in various functional microorganisms due to the functional diversity of these proteins among the amino acid degrading bacteria there were 46 functional proteins related to amino acid metabolism in tissierella 44 proteins in aminivibrio 30 proteins in lutispora and 11 proteins in aminobacterium the abundance of the highly metabolically active aminivibrio gradually decreased during the experiment and a decrease of 67 was observed in phase i2 fig 3b in contrast the abundance of lutispora decreased significantly p 0 05 only in phase i2 and other functional bacteria were continuously enriched during the experiment fig 4 a and table s4 show the deps of four types of functional bacteria which were determined through comparison of samples from the targeted phase with the previous phase for samples in phases i1 and s or in phases r and i1 more up regulated proteins than down regulated proteins were observed and the proportion of up regulated proteins was 67 and 70 respectively fig 4a by contrast a large number of down regulated proteins 22 of aminivibrio were observed for the comparison of samples in phases i2 and r and the expression of deps of all amino acid degrading bacteria was down regulated by approximately 62 which was consistent with the variation in microbial abundance at the genus level indicating that amino acid metabolism was impaired in phase i2 down regulated proteins of aminivibrio in phase i2 were mainly involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites map 01110 9 and glycine serine and threonine metabolism map 00260 7 table s4 the expression of deps involved in glycine serine and threonine metabolism in amino acid degrading bacteria was down regulated by approximately 67 suggesting that amino acid metabolism was severely inhibited impaired amino acid metabolism leads to the accumulation of amino acids and reduction in the release of ammonia nitrogen which corroborates the hypothesis in section 3 1 predicting that the dramatic increase in scodm in phase i2 may be related to amino acid accumulation caused by the decreased activity of amino acid degrading bacteria the unexpected decrease in ammonia nitrogen may also be related to the weakened microbial mineralization of nitrogenous substances the number of up regulated proteins of tissierella and lutispora in phase i2 was roughly similar to the number of down regulated proteins indicating that their metabolic activities were not severely inhibited by ammonia fig 4a all deps of aminobacterium in phase i2 were up regulated indicating that they were highly tolerant of ammonia stress these up regulated deps were derived from aminobacterium colombiensegen and were all related to glycine serine and threonine metabolism suggesting that the enrichment of this bacterium contributed to the recovery of glycine serine and threonine metabolism this might also be the reason for the gradual decline in scodm that occurred in the later stage of phase i2 although the degradation of amino acids was impaired in phase i2 overall amino acid metabolism was expected to recover after long term acclimation due to the functional redundancy of microorganisms that are highly tolerant of ammonia in other words the toxicity to these microorganisms is likely reversible and amino acid metabolism may not be the cause of ammonia inhibition 3 2 4 butyrate and valerate degrading bacteria and their functional protein expression profiles the degradation of butyrate and valerate was mainly through the β oxidation process fig s3 and a total of 164 proteins were identified in this experiment the dominant genera included syntrophomonas 33 tissierella 11 syntrophorhabdus 9 and thermosyntropha 7 table s5 syntrophomonas and thermosyntropha are syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing bacteria that can degrade fatty acids with c4 c18 by β oxidation stams et al 2012 the reason why aromatic acid degrading syntrophorhabdus expressed related proteins was that the degradation of aromatic compounds typically first involves the conversion of aromatic acids to benzoic acid and the anaerobic degradation of benzoic acid is carried out through a pathway similar to fatty acid β oxidation sieber et al 2012 tissierella which are typically protein degrading bacteria expressed all the enzymes required for β oxidation pathway but these enzymes were only involved in the β oxidation of fatty acids with c4 c6 in addition tissierella also expressed butyrate kinase ec 2 7 2 7 buk phosphate butyryltransferase ec 2 3 1 19 ptb and acetate coa transferase ec 2 8 3 8 ato which can convert butyrate to butyryl coa for further degradation through the β oxidation pathway however they do not express long chain acyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 3 which can convert lcfas to long chain fatty acyl coa thus tissierella might be c4 c6 fatty acid degradation bacteria the overall abundance of butyrate and valerate degrading bacteria including syntrophomonas thermosyntropha and tissierella gradually increased during the experiment fig 3b c the numbers of up regulated proteins 7 and down regulated proteins 8 were roughly equivalent for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s indicating that butyrate and valerate degradation was not severely inhibited in phase i1 fig 4b this confirmed the hypothesis of the physicochemical analysis in section 3 1 positing that the accumulation of butyrate and valerate in phase i1 mainly stems from the feedback inhibition from acetate accumulation approximately 90 of the 21 deps were up regulated proteins for the comparisons of samples in phases r and i1 thus enhanced performance was observed however most of the 22 deps were down regulated proteins approximately 68 for the comparisons of samples in phases i2 and r indicating that their metabolic performance weakened given that microbial community activity can also be affected by substrate availability such as the concentration of butyrate and valerate the butyrate and valerate concentration in phase i2 was comparable to that in phase s and the deps for the phase i2 and phase s comparison were investigated table s6 a large number of deps 28 were detected by comparing phases i2 and s and most of them were up regulated 61 this finding combined with the greater abundances of butyrate and valerate degrading bacteria at phase i2 than at phase s indicated that the metabolism of butyrate and valerate was not inhibited at phase i2 compared with phase s therefore butyrate and valerate metabolism was not the cause of ammonia inhibition 3 2 5 spob and their functional protein expression profile a total of 309 proteins were annotated to the propionate metabolism pathway map 00640 which mainly included the propionate activation process 64 and the methylmalonyl coa pathway mmc pathway 88 table s7 fig s4 few propionate activation related proteins were derived from propionate degrading bacteria which mainly stemmed from the functional diversity of these proteins mmc related proteins were mainly derived from pelotomaculum and syntrophobacter pelotomaculum was the most dominant propionate degrading microorganism fig 3d and its abundance decreased significantly in phase i1 p 0 05 followed by complete recovery in phase r and then a significant decrease by 49 in phase i2 p 0 05 fig 4c shows the deps of pelotomaculum for comparisons of the targeted phase with the previous phase the number of deps of pelotomaculum increased from phase i1 to r but the numbers of up regulated proteins and down regulated proteins were almost the same there were a large number of deps for the comparisons of samples in phases i2 and r and approximately 94 15 16 of them were down regulated confirming that the propionate metabolic activity of this genus was severely inhibited among the down regulated proteins of pelotomaculum in phase i2 seven of them were succinyl coa synthase ec 6 2 1 5 succ d table s8 this was also the enzyme that led to the enrichment of most down regulated deps in phase i2 indicating that the impaired propionate metabolism of this genus was mainly related to succinyl coa synthase moreover a total of eight succinyl coa synthases from pelotomaculum were detected and seven of them were significantly down regulated fc 0 5 p 0 05 fig 4f indicating that the expression of all succinyl coa synthetases of this genus sharply decreased in the i2 phase in the syntrophic propionate oxidation spo process the oxidation of succinate to fumarate is directly controlled by hm because the succinate dehydrogenase ec 1 3 5 4 frd that catalyzes this process requires quinone as an electron acceptor and quinone is oxidized by hydrogenase to produce h2 thus these reactions require hm to maintain h2 at a low level sieber et al 2012 the expression of most succinate dehydrogenases did not decrease in phase i2 which confirmed that the activity of pelotomaculum decreased because its succinyl coa synthase was deactivated by ammonia and this was not related to methanogenesis syntrophobacter was not the dominant propionate degrading microorganism and its relative abundance decreased during the experiment a significant decrease was observed in both phase r and i2 p 0 05 the deps related to the propionate degradation of syntrophobacter which were identified through comparison of samples from the targeted phase with the previous phase were generally down regulated at all phases the number of down regulated deps increased starting in phase r and included various functional enzymes confirming that the propionate degradation function of syntrophobacter was severely inhibited starting in phase r fig 4c candidatus syntrophosphaera was another dominant spob detected in the reactor and its abundance continued to increase from phase s to r followed by a significant decrease in phase i2 p 0 05 indicating that it was tolerant of ammonia fig 3d however functional proteins related to propionate metabolism were not detected and this probably stems from their low expression levels therefore the activity of all spob was severely inhibited in phase i2 and they might be the key to explaining process instability because of the lack of the functional redundancy of microorganisms with high ammonia tolerance 3 2 6 saob and their functional protein expression profile syntrophic acetate oxidation sao is a special link in the acetogenesis stage as it can convert acetate into h2 and co2 when acetate metabolism is blocked and then be consumed by hm sao is mainly carried out through the wood ljungdahl pathway wl pathway or the glycine cleavage system pathway gcs pathway fig s5 wei et al 2020 although a large number of sao related proteins were detected most of them were derived from acetogens and methanogens which is related to the functional diversity of enzymes involved in glycine cleavage and acetate activation for saob only clostridium ultunense which degrades acetate through the gcs pathway wei et al 2020 was detected in this study and five gcs related proteins were expressed table s9 fig 4d and table s9 show the deps of clostridium ultunense through comparison of samples from the targeted phase with the previous phase the expression of five functional proteins of clostridium ultunense did not change significantly for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s or in phases r and i1 but the expression of four of them was up regulated significantly p 0 05 for the comparisons of samples in phases i2 and r which is consistent with changes in the relative abundance of clostridium ultunense in fig 3e this indicates that the sao pathway plays an important role in acetate metabolism during phase i2 and can benefit ad performance the negative effect of the sao pathway on process stability can thus be excluded 3 2 7 methanogens and their functional protein expression maps methanogenesis is the last stage of ad which includes am hm and methyltrophic methanogenesis fig s6 a total of 325 functional proteins related to three methanogenesis pathways were detected and they were mainly expressed by five dominant methanogens 199 fig 3f table s10 acetotrophic methanothrix expressed 24 am related proteins and hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum methanoculleus and methanosphaerula expressed 30 60 and 17 hm related proteins respectively methanosarcina expressed 90 methanogenesis related proteins which were abundant in all three methanogenesis pathways both methanothrix and methanosarcina can use acetate to produce methane methanothrix was the most abundant methanogen in phase s but it continued to decrease as the ad process progressed fig 3f which is consistent with its low tolerance of ammonia capson tojo et al 2020 the abundance of methanosarcina gradually increased during the experiment and eventually replaced methanothrix as the most dominant methanogen 15 fig 3f the high ammonia tolerance of this genus is reported to be related to its ability to form a niche environment with a low ammonia concentration in the center of the cell cluster yan et al 2019 deps of methanothrix increased gradually during the experiment fig 4e the number of up regulated and down regulated proteins was almost the same for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s and the number of down regulated proteins in deps was as high as 91 for the comparisons of samples in phases r and i1 as well as phases i2 and r 10 11 and 29 32 respectively indicating that methanothrix experienced increasing ammonia stress although only three down regulated proteins were observed for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s all of them were methyl com reductases ec 2 8 4 1 mcra b which are responsible for the last step of methanogenesis the abundance of all methyl com reductases 8 of methanothrix decreased fc 0 72 indicating that the am pathway was impaired table s11 and fig 4f therefore ammonia mainly inhibited the expression of methyl com reductase of methanothrix which impaired its am function and reduced the acetate metabolic activity of the system however since the beginning of phase r the expression of the enzymes acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetyl coa decarbonylase acds involved in am in methanosarcina was significantly up regulated in the targeted phase compared with the previous phase and the fc values were as high as 148 38 91 32 and 39 69 respectively table s11 and fig 4f acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase are functional enzymes that convert acetate to acetyl coa acds continued to convert acetyl coa to 5 methyl thm s pt and then entered the common pathway of methanogenesis compared with the previous phase the deps related to the common pathway of methanogenesis such as methyl com reductase of methanosarcina were also up regulated in phases r and i2 and methyl com reductase had the highest fc value of 250 49 in phase r table s11 thus although methanosarcina was not the most dominant in phase r acetate degradation activity appeared to be strengthened due to the significantly up regulated proteins hanreich et al 2013 also found that methanogens with abundances lower than 4 contributed 20 30 of the total identified proteins indicating the existence of some metabolically hyperactive methanogens in the ad system the abundance of methanosphaerula decreased during the experiment the abundance of methanospirillum first increased and then decreased to a level significantly lower than that of phase s in phase i2 p 0 05 the abundance of methanoculleus increased gradually fig 3f with the contribution of methanosarcina the total abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased as the ad process progressed the dynamics of their hm related deps were consistent with the variation in the abundances of different microorganisms in the microbial community fig 4e and table s11 functional proteins of hydrogenotrophic methanogens were generally up regulated in phases i1 and r compared with the previous phase at phase i2 the expression of down regulated proteins from methanospirillum greatly increased due to their limited ammonia tolerance however a large number of proteins originating from methanosarcina and methanoculleus which are tolerant of high ammonia levels were up regulated as a consequence the total number of down regulated and up regulated proteins was almost the same this finding combined with the high abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in phase i2 indicated that the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were sufficiently redundant to cope with ammonia stress and hm activity was not severely inhibited by ammonia proteins related to methyltrophic methanogenesis were mainly derived from methanosarcina the related deps identified through comparison of samples from the targeted phase with the previous phase are shown in table s11 the number of deps was relatively small for the comparisons of samples in phases i1 and s and there were slightly more down regulated proteins than up regulated proteins however the number of deps increased substantially and all deps were up regulated for the comparisons of samples in phases r and i1 as well as phases i2 and r the abundance of some proteins increased sharply in phase r with fc values as high as 122 24 the methyltrophic methanogenesis function of methanosarcina was also greatly strengthened in phase r in conclusion three types of functional proteins of methanosarcina showed high expression activity under high ammonia stress this finding combined with the absolute dominance of methanosarcina in phase i2 indicates that it carries out various methanogenesis functions at a high metabolic level under long term ammonia stress confirming that the methanogenesis process is not the source of reactor instability 3 3 microbial mechanism of process instability induced by ammonia stress as shown in fig 5 methanothrix was most sensitive to ammonia during endogenous ammonia accumulation when tan 2337 25 mg n l and fan 78 48 mg n l the expression activity of methyl com reductase of methanothrix decreased significantly which reduced the bioconversion of acetate to methane subsequently acetate accumulated and feedback inhibition of other vfas occurred as well finally a significant decrease in my was observed and the ad process was inhibited however the total abundance of active methanogens only decreased by approximately 4 in this phase and the number of up regulated proteins was greater than the number of down regulated proteins in microbial consortia indicating high robustness of the microbial communities as the process progressed the abundance of active methanosarcina with high ammonia tolerance increased and the activity of their am related enzymes was significantly up regulated which resulted in the complete restoration of acetate metabolism and ad performance confirming that microbial communities could cope with acetate metabolic repression through self optimization acetate metabolism was not the key to ammonia inhibition when tan and fan increased to 4846 95 mg n l and 337 46 mg n l respectively propionate and no other vfas accumulated and the my decreased by more than 65 at this stage the proportion of down regulated proteins in microbial consortia was much higher than that of up regulated proteins 35 00 vs 22 31 indicating the severe deterioration of community activity moreover the abundance of active spob decreased by 52 the expression of key enzymes related to propionate degradation was generally down regulated and the proportion of down regulated deps in the dominant pelotomaculum was as high as 94 indicating significant suppression spob are usually minority community members with extremely specialized functions carballa et al 2015 spob have never been observed to achieve functional resilience under ammonia stress through shifts in the dominant microorganisms from sensitive to resistant ones or through shifts in metabolic pathways moreover the significant decrease in their abundance and down regulated deps suggested that the recovery of propionate metabolism through self optimization and reorganization might be difficult or even impossible to achieve thus spob may be the key microbial phylotypes affecting ad performance under ammonia stress in addition ammonia inhibited the mmc pathway of pelotomaculum by inhibiting the expression of succinyl coa synthase which resulted in the suppression of syntrophic propionate oxidation 4 conclusion acetate metabolism was most sensitive to ammonia in ad ammonia inhibits the expression of methyl com reductase of methanothrix and restrains acetate metabolism however continuous ammonia stress can induce a shift in the dominant acetate degrading microorganisms from methanothrix to methanosarcina the latter have high ammonia tolerance and can promote the recovery of acetate metabolism through an am pathway mediated by acetate kinase phosphate acetyltransferase and acds by comparison propionate metabolism was less sensitive to ammonia stress however under high ammonia stress the abundance of active spob decreased by 52 and the expression of key enzymes related to propionate degradation was generally down regulated indicating the severe suppression of the growth of these functional bacteria as well as their inability to easily acclimate to ammonia stress thus spob are the key microbial phylotypes affecting ad performance under ammonia stress ammonia inhibited the expression of succinyl coa synthase of pelotomaculum which blocked the mmc pathway and propionate accumulation increased focus on the spo process is needed for the development of microbial regulation strategies effective for alleviating ammonia inhibition credit authorship contribution statement hong zhang

16224,real time control rtc is an important tool for safe and cost effective operations of sewer systems by for example reducing sewer overflow or enhancing sulfide mitigation due to the long transport time of sewage and the inherent dynamics in sewage flow rates model predictive control is often needed which requires the prediction of sewage hydraulic characteristics across the network the full hydraulic models are often unsuitable for such purposes due to their high computational demands which are not affordable as the models need to be called for numerous times in each optimisation step in this study two swift data driven hydraulic models are developed to predict sewage flow rates in gravity sewers receiving feeds from rising main s and gravity main s respectively the models are shown to be able to predict both the sewage flow rate and the cross sectional flow area in high fidelities with solutions of saint venant equations but reduce the computational time by up to four orders of magnitude the swift hydraulic models were then integrated into an rtc strategy for naoh dosing in a simulated real life sewer network and achieved cost effective control of sulfide these models could potentially be used for other sewer rtc applications graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer network hydraulic models data driven model gravity sewer real time control chemical dosing 1 introduction sewer systems collect and convey wastewater from residential houses and industries to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp for treatment and disposal or recycling real time control rtc strategies are increasingly implemented in sewer systems for minimizing sewer overflow lund et al 2018 in more recent years rtc is also used to control in sewer chemical delivery to mitigate the sulfide induced sewer corrosion and odour problems li et al 2022 liu et al 2016 sewer networks are distributed systems consisting of many interconnected sewage pumping stations spss and sewer pipes because of the delay due to sewage transport the control performance at downstream target locations by manipulating upstream objects generally spss or dosing pumps cannot be accessed immediately therefore model predictive control mpc is employed during rtc which adjust the control actions according to their future performance predicted by models rawlings and mayne 2009 in rtc the predictive models are called for numerous times to recurrently evaluate the future control performance of each solution as in each optimisation step there are commonly hundreds of solutions to evaluate ocampo martinez 2010 to meet real time requirements such predictive models must be efficient in terms of both accuracy and speed sadler et al 2019 hydraulic models are one of the most critical tools for rtc in sewer systems lund et al 2018 ocampo martinez et al 2013 they provide sewage hydraulic characteristics like flow rate cross sectional flow area water depth and hydraulic radius in sewers the model accuracy directly determines the performance of the rtc their design is mainly based on the characteristics of different types of sewer pipes a sewer network generally comprises two types of pipes 1 rising mains also called pressurised or pumped mains which are fully filled pipes with pressurised sewage driven by the spss when a pump is on the sewage flow along the pipeline is pushed forward to the discharge point by the newly injected flow therefore the flow rate in and out of a rising main is equal to the pumped flow rate the cross sectional flow area in rising mains is constant determined by the pipe dimensions 2 gravity sewers which are designed for transporting sewage through gravity these pipes comprise a liquid and a gas phase except in extreme wet weather conditions leading to surcharge of the pipe the hydraulic conditions in gravity sewers are affected by the inflow hydrograph geometric characteristics of the pipe the flow initial conditions initial values of variables in the flow domain and boundary conditions flow distribution at inlets outlets and pipe walls rossman 2010 the flowing wave along the pipeline varies gradually and presents unsteady states due to wave retardation acceleration attenuation and amplification rossman and huber 2017 to compute the dynamic and complex processes of sewage flow in gravity sewers the most theoretically accurate results can be obtained with the saint venant equations vreugdenhil 1994 also known as shallow water equations this is a set of hyperbolic partial differential equations governed by the conservation of mass and momentum accounting for pressurized flow backwater transfer loss coriolis frictional and viscous forces because of its precise interpretation of hydraulic mechanism saint venant equations have been widely applied in a variety of well known hydraulic software such as the storm water management model swmm developed by the united states environmental protection agency epa rossman 2010 infoworks searby et al 1998 and mike havnø et al 1995 however a serious bottleneck of saint venant equations is the high computational cost for solving the hyperbolic partial differential equations lund et al 2018 thus deemed unsuitable for rtc tasks bowes et al 2021 sadler et al 2019 to address this dilemma simplifications of saint venant equations have been widely studied capart et al 1997 duchesne et al 2004 samani and jebelifard 2003 the most commonly used methods are finite difference patankar and baliga 1978 and finite volume schemes godunov 1959 which solved conservation equations with piecewise constant conditions in each pre defined intersection termed as riemann problems leveque 2002 however these solutions are still computational expensive on non rectangular and non prismatic conduits sanders 2001 while most sewer pipes are circular channels furthermore even their efficiency for rectangular or prismatic pipes conduits is still unsatisfactory for the rtc applications for large scale networks getirana et al 2017 another approach to accelerate the solution of sewage characteristics is making assumptions to simplify the in sewer processes in order to reduce the computational load in a sewer process model wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformations in sewers wats model the flow velocity in gravity mains are assumed to be steady and uniform nielsen et al 2008 in swmm rossman 2010 a single sewer pipe is treated as an integrated whole that the flow characteristics rate velocity and water depth at different locations along the pipe are assigned with the same value average as such at the moment a sewage slug enters a pipe there generates a virtual flow with the same rate at the pipe end simultaneously however in reality it takes minutes for a sewage slug to reach the end of a hundreds meter long gravity pipe duchesne et al 2004 the transport delay is one of the most critical features for the sewage flow which should be seriously considered for network nodes pipe junctions manholes and storage tanks to achieve network wide control incorrect estimation of the sewage flow rate and the delay will cause the rtc strategies unable to make the best use of the in sewer free space to reduce sewer overflow or in the case of chemical dosing control lead some sewage slugs to receive inadequate or even no chemicals for sulfide mitigation in addition parallel computing has been employed to speed up rtc tasks by distributing the hydraulic simulations using e g swmm to multiple processors simultaneously bowes et al 2021 sadler et al 2019 the acceleration is however rather limited without improving the simulator hydraulic model such a method treats the symptoms not the cause therefore a hydraulic model that can swiftly provide accurate hydraulic characteristics is the pillar of deploying real time strategies in sewer systems however none of the currently available models is satisfactory this study aims to develop swift hydraulic models for calculating the flow rate and cross sectional flow area in gravity sewers across a sewer network these models should obtain comparable accuracies with the full saint venant equations at a fraction of the computational cost in order to facilitate the rtc in sewer systems first given the nature of flow transport delay in the system the gravity sewer is formulated as a time delay system second based on the behaviour of inflow from different sources rising mains or gravity sewers two types of swift models namely first order plus dead time fopdt models and dynamic shifting impulse response filters dsirf are developed and validated using results of the full saint venant equations finally the swift hydraulic models are integrated into a real time model predictive control algorithm and applied to the online control of chemical dosing in a simulated real life sewer network comprising both rising mains and gravity sewers 2 materials and methods 2 1 system description data collection and governing models to facilitate method development and demonstration a real life sewer network is selected which is located at port pirie a seaport on the east coast of south australia the port pirie wastewater catchment ppwwc covers an area of approximately 12 km2 encompassing 35 spss and approximately 1 650 nodes manholes based on the topographic contour ppwwc can be divided into three sub catchments as shown in fig s1 in supplementary information si in sub catchment 1 and sub catchment 3 the spss comprise only rising mains and only gravity sewers respectively in sub catchment 2 wastewater is pumped to rising mains by 6 spss distributed in the catchment then transported to a trunk sewer via gravity pipes comprising both rising mains and gravity sewers this catchment therefore was selected for developing and verifying the swift hydraulic models of gravity sewers and also for testing the rtc algorithm this selected network has 6 spss rising mains of a total length of 3209 3 m and gravity sewers of a total length of 2173 9 m the rising mains have diameters ranging between 0 089 m and 0 143 m and gravity sewers have diameters from 0 225 m to 0 379 m the total average dry weather flow is 1 610 m3 day fig 1 depicts the schematic of the selected sewer network with the length and dimension of the gravity sewers details of pump properties and average dry weather flow adwf and sewer properties are summarised in tables s1 and s2 respectively in si real time recorded pump switch signals i e pump turned on or off when the water level in the wet well reaches the upper or lower duty level respectively were retrieved from the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system saint venant equations describe the unsteady flow in a conduit and are expressed in the form of conservation of mass and momentum capart et al 1997 in this study they are used as the governing model to provide benchmark hydraulic data flow rates and cross sectional flow areas for gravity mains for the calibration and validation of the swift hydraulic models and also for the full simulation of the network the saint venant equations are discretised then solved for finite volume conduits with the dormand prince method dormand and prince 1980 the whole method is deployed in matlab version 2020a the details of the original and discretised saint venant equations and validation results of the governing functions are presented in si 2 2 integrated real time control of chemical dosing optimisation 2 2 1 problem statement real time control of chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation in sewer networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years to efficiently mitigate sulfide and sulfide induced corrosion and odour problems the sewage is required to contain a desirable amount of chemicals at corrosion and odour hotspots chemicals are generally dosed upstream of the catchment the chemical containing sewage then flows through the network driven by pumps or gravity with the chemical contained often diluted at multiple locations by the chemical free sidestreams from other branches along its transport route such features make it difficult to achieve desired distributions of the dosed chemical when sewage reaches corrosion and odour hotspots a strategy often adopted by the water industry is to heavily overdose so that the sewage still contains an adequate concentration of the dosed chemical even after heavy dilution this is accompanied by large costs still with no guarantee of satisfactory sulfide control performance to conquer this challenge real time optimisation of chemical dosing based on the current and predicted future sewage states has been proposed ganigué et al 2018 li et al 2022 liu et al 2016 in li et al 2022 for example an elephant hearding optimisation eho algorithm was developed to achieve desirable chemical distribution at the network downstream through regulating the spss the hydraulic model would be called for numerous times by the optimisation algorithm to evaluate the chemical distribution so as to find the most cost effective dosing actions therefore any excessive computation time demand would hinder the rtc implementation the algorithm was applied to a sewer network comprising rising mains only for which the hydraulic characteristics of the entire network could be predicted instantly based on mass balance however the method can not be directly applied to networks containing gravity sewers although the full saint venant equations are able to provide precise hydraulic dynamics of gravity sewers its computational demand is not affordable for real time optimisation swift hydraulic models for gravity sewers are essential for such applications which will be developed in this study see section 3 to demonstrate the ability of the swift hydraulic model in supporting real time applications in sewer systems the above described sewer network was used in a case study aimed to optimise chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation in this study sodium hydroxide naoh was dosed at sps12 fig 1 the objective of the rtc is to maintain the naoh concentration at the discharge point of the catchment target location in fig 1 consistently above a pre specified level of 90 mg naoh l by synchronising sps12 the chemical receiving sps with other spss and by dynamically controlling the chemical dosing rate at sps12 2 2 2 methods in every rtc step the sewage flow rate into each of the 6 spss was predicted for the next 6 hours using arx autoregressive with exogenous inputs models previously developed li et al 2019 these predicted flow rates were then used to predict the pump start time when the sewage level in the sps wet well reaches the pre defined upper duty level and calculate the amount of sewage accumulated at the spss the start of an sps triggers the chemical receiving sps sps 12 to ensure new chemicals are injected into the network any other non chemical receiving pumps are also turned on if there is a reasonable amount of sewage i e above a pre defined minimum present in the sps wet well with this pump synchronisation program adequate mixing of chemical containing and non chemical containing sewage in the system can be ensured the program also turns off all spss when any sps is turned off when the sewage level reaches the pre defined lower duty level with the predicted scheduled pumping events at all spss the hydraulics flow rates and cross sectional flow area in the network were predicted for the 6 hour horizon the flow rate out of a rising main was the same as the pumped flow rate for gravity mains the swift hydraulic models developed in section 3 were used finally the predicted hydraulic conditions were fed into an eho algorithm li et al 2022 which searched for the satisfactory dosing rate accompanied with each pumping event at sps12 by optimising an objective function making trade offs between naoh distribution at the target location and chemical consumption details of the collaborative pump scheduling and the optimisation of chemical dosing are described in si the rtc was implemented and evaluated through simulation studies of the network fig 1 the saint venant equations were employed to simulate the true hydraulics in the gravity sewers while the developed swift models were used in the integrated rtc 3 model development and evaluation 3 1 analysis of hydraulic characteristics in gravity sewers the primary aim of this study is to accelerate the computation of sewage hydraulic characteristics at an arbitrary location in the sewer network containing gravity sewers firstly the flow rate at the inlet and outlet of the gravity sewer was analysed to gain a better insight into the hydraulic dynamics in gravity sewers in fig 2 there depicts the inflow obtained from real world scada data and outflow calculated by the full saint venant equations of the gravity sewers in the selected sewer system note that the simulation was conducted excluding extreme storm weather to ensure free surface flows in the sewer pipes and at the junction nodes cases where sewer pipes and or junction nodes are surcharged are out of the scope of this study the six gravity sewers g1 to g6 receive sewage from different types of sources rising mains gravity sewers or a combination of them here we hypothesise that the relationship between the outflow and inflow of a gravity sewer pipe may be characterized as a system with time delays because sewage transport delay is an inherent nature in sewer systems delays of 0 05 h to 0 4 h between the inflow and the corresponding outflow can be observed for gravity pipes used in this study g1 g6 fig 2 such delays only depend on the pipe characteristics and the source flow independent of when the flow enters the pipe in this way the swift hydraulic model can be developed based on these properties of the time delay system the next step is to build proper methods for predicting hydraulic characteristics in a gravity pipe based on the type of source flow the hydraulic flow dynamics in a gravity sewer is classified into two scenarios 1 r2g rising main to gravity sewer flow in a gravity sewer receiving sewage from a rising main after an sps with a fixed pumped flow for example flows in g1 g3 and g5 fig 1 2 g2g gravity sewer to gravity sewer flow in a gravity sewer receiving sewage from a gravity sewer or a combination of gravity sewers and rising mains or rising mains after spss with variable speed drives vsds for example flows in g2 g4 and g6 fig 1 3 2 fopdt model for r2g flows 3 2 1 problem statement in the scenario of r2g flow is discharged from an upstream rising main to a receiving gravity sewer the aim is to predict the flow rate and cross sectional flow area in the gravity sewer using the flow from the rising main notice that for a gravity sewer receives sewage from multiple spss upstream through a rising main each sps is described as an independent source of the receiving gravity sewer for example in the sewer network shown in fig 1 g1 belongs to the scenario of r2g that it receives sewage from sp11 and sp12 through r3 thus each of sps11 and sps12 is a separate source of g1 the hydraulic behaviour in a rising main inherits the characteristics of the flow pumped from the sps which can be formally expressed by the heaviside step function davies 2002 the spss employed here are spss with fixed capacities which are most commonly applied in sewer systems spss with vsds are grouped into the scenario of g2g which is discussed in the next section the inflow ui t of the gravity sewer at time t due to the j th pump cycle of i the sps in the control horizon is described by the following function 1 u i t δ i h i t where δi is the pumped flow l s of the i th sps hi t is the response of heaviside step function that uses 0 and 1 to indicate the events of pump off and pump on respectively 2 h i t 0 t j 1 o f f t t j o n 1 t j o n t t j o f f where t j o n and t j o f f are the time when the i th sps turns on and off in the j the pump cycle respectively in the scenario of r2g the source flow is from sps s then enters a gravity sewer via rising mains an event of g1 is used as an example to illustrate the r2g flow due to a pump cycle fig 2 a the source flow is from sp12 then to r1 r3 and finally enters g1 pump operations i e the inflow over t 0 to t 3 is used as the inputs of the hydraulic model the corresponding flow at a downstream location here use the pipe outlet as a representative location occurs between t 1 to t 5 fig 2 a it can be seen that when the sps turns on at t0 after a time delay t 0 to t 1 the corresponding outflow rate in the gravity sewer in turn experiences a period of rising t 1 to t 2 and dropping t 4 to t 5 sequentially which present different variation pattern due to the source flow change inflow from 0 sharp to qp at t 0 and from qp sharp to 0 at t 3 while the flow rate changes faster when dropping in this way for a given sps each of the on off operations requires a respective function to capture the corresponding flow variation downstream in the gravity sewer 3 2 2 development of first order plus dead time model in the frequency domain of the time delay system the gravity flow due to pump on flow rising or off flow dropping can both be expressed by a transfer function in the form of first order plus dead time fopdt model bi et al 1999 3 g s k e θ s τ s 1 where k is the gain here is 1 based on mass conservation of flow τ is the time constant and θ is the time delay the so called dead time the fopdt model can be reverted to time domain utilizing inverse laplace transform as follows 4 g t 1 g s 1 τ e t θ τ h t θ parameters θ and τ are calibrated by maximizing the fit of the predictions between the fopdt model and the saint venant equations using the least square method lawson and hanson 1995 here the calibration data is the saint venant model predictions of the flows at the end of gravity mains in response to the upstream sps operation over 3 months retrieved from the scada system one θ value and one τ value were calibrated from each rising outflow and the average θ and τ values are assigned as the calibrated parameters for the fopdt model with the corresponding standard error estimated the parameters of the dropping outflow are obtained in the same way in the time delay system the response outflow to an impulse a pump operation is described as the pointwise product of the convolution integral basile and marro 1992 which is formally defined as follows 5 q i t u i t g i t u i s g i t s d s where notation represents convolution ui t is source flow variation l s due to the i th sps operations qi t is the corresponding outflow l s gi t is the impulse responses inverse of the transfer function which is the developed fopdt model the numerical calculation of a fopdt model with convolution is conducted with the method of overlap save frerking 2013 with a time step of 5 seconds details are given in si in summary for the flow directly discharged from a rising main its variation in a gravity pipe is calculated through the following process 1 convert the transfer function from frequency domain to time domain eq 4 2 calibrate the transfer function fopdt model with flow rates generated by saint venant equations a flowchart fig s3 of the implementation of the fopdt model for calculating r2g flow is provided in si 3 2 3 calibration results three month real pump on off data was used to develop fopdt models for gravity sewer g1 g3 and g5 with the calibrated parameters summarized in table 1 as an example fig 3 shows the fit between the fopdt predictions and the training data calculated with saint venant equations over a randomly chosen 5 hours the model performance was evaluated through two statistic criteria namely coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse with the functions given in si the fopdt models for simulating r2g flow in gravity sewers g1 g3 and g5 achieved high agreements with the results of the full saint venant equations with r2 of 0 9966 0 9756 and 0 9825 respectively and rmse of 0 0652 0 1141 and 0 1293 respectively table 2 both r2 and rmse statistics demonstrated the robust performance of fopdt models for r2g flow 3 3 dsirf model for g2g flows 3 3 1 problem statement from hydraulic analysis it is known that the behaviour of the flow in a gravity sewer can be very different depending on the type of source where the sewage is discharged from except for the step flow out of a rising main connected to a fixed speed sps most sewage flow varies continuously when entering a gravity sewer for example the flow from a gravity sewer or a rising main connected to an sps with a vsd we name this type of flow as g2g flow in the selected sewer network g2 g4 and g6 belong to the g2g category with hydraulic characteristics illustrated in fig 2 b d and f respectively there are three key features for the g2g flow feature 1 it can be observed that the outflow presents similar variation trends as the inflow but with delays that are created by the flow transport feature 2 flow in a gravity sewer is continuously dynamic which makes it different from the inflow this is due to the physical process like flow retardation acceleration attenuation and amplification rossman and huber 2017 feature 3 from feature 2 and observation of fig 2 the delays are not constant consequently the similarity of flow trend decays as the transport distance becomes longer considering these features a new approach is proposed to predict the hydraulic characteristics of the g2g flow first according to feature 1 a past time t ϕ is mapped to calculate the sewage flow q t at a downstream location of a gravity sewer at time t where ϕ is the delay due to sewage transport next given feature 2 q t is determined by the cumulative impacts of the flow entering the sewer in a period around t ϕ rather than the flow rate at a single time point moreover corresponding to feature 3 the delay ϕ is dynamic and subject to the value of the cumulative impacts for concise expression hereafter t ϕ is named as the datum time for flow q t the cumulative impacts of the inflow in a period around t ϕ is called the datum flow and denoted as q t ϕ 3 3 2 development of a dsirf dynamic shifting impulse response filter model based on the above discussion the gravity flow is characterized by two factors a datum flow q k representing the cumulative impacts of the source flow and a transport delay ϕk for the flow entering the gravity sewer at time step k given the above the flow q k at a downstream location in the gravity sewer at time step k is captured by a dynamic shifting impulse response filter dsirf 6 q k q k ϕ k where q k is the gravity flow l s calculated for time step k q k ϕ k is the datum flow l s given by the dsirf ϕk is the time delay step for time shifting the datum flow the first key factor q k is introduced because in the gravity sewer the flow depends most heavily on the inflow near a previous time k ϕk and gradually eliminates the dependences on the inflow after k ϕk this feature can be characterized by an infinite impulse response filter with exponentially decreased weighting factors 7 q k i 1 γ u k i 1 ω i w where 8 ω i α γ i i 1 γ 9 w i 1 γ ω i where u k is the inflow at time step k q k l s is the datum flow indicating the cumulative influence of inflow during the period of k k γ 1 γ is the moving window size ωi is the weight of step k i 1 α is the exponential factor w is the sum of weights in the case study reported below the time step is chosen to be 5 seconds to tackle the flow transport delay ϕk the flow q k is obtained by time shifting the datum outflow q k with a delay of ϕk this delay is dynamic and mainly depends on the value of q k which is in inverse proportion to the flow rate as it takes a longer time for the flow with lower rates reaching the downstream locations besides the time step shifted by the moving window should be compensated for the delay therefore the flow delay at step time k is deduced as 10 ϕ k λ q b q k 2 γ where ϕk is the delay of datum flow λ s2 l2 is a calibrated coefficient qb l s is a baseline flow rate γ is the moving window size 3 3 3 calibration results parameters used in the dsirf model are optimised with calibration data inflow and outflow of g2 g4 and g6 produced by the full saint venant equations by feeding 3 month pump scada data here the outflow at the gravity sewer end is studied as the downstream flow impacted by the inflow exponential factor α is chosen following the principles introduced in a previous study natrella 2010 that an α close to 1 accelerates the data smoothing and an α value close to 0 slows down the data smoothing γ can be initially set as tq nδt where n is the number of segmented sections in the gravity sewer determination of n is described in a recent study li et al 2022 tq is the average time for the calibration flow passing through n sections in the gravity sewer λ is calibrated through nonlinear least squares with the calibration data qb is determined by the average dry weather flow in this pipe the calibrated parameters are summarized in table 3 a 5 hour calibration result of the outflow with the corresponding r2 and rmse is shown in fig 4 in the scenarios of g2g the dsirf models achieved high fidelities of flow prediction to the saint venant equations with r2 of 0 9957 0 9970 and 0 9980 for g2 g4 and g6 respectively 3 4 simplified model for cross sectional flow area through the above functions the flow rates across the sewer network can be obtained next a model for predicting cross sectional flow area hereafter called flow area for short is proposed in terms of real time application a simplified model was developed to improve computational efficiency this model can directly obtain the corresponding flow area a using the flow rate q as inputs the simplified model is established as follows 11 a ξ q ψ where ξ and ψ are the calibrated parameters in this study simplified models for flow area were developed for gravity sewer g1 g2 g4 and g6 which conveyed the dosed chemical to the discharge point the calibration data including sewage flow rate and flow area was generated by the saint venant equations parameters ξ and ψ were calibrated through nonlinear least squares and summarized in table 3 3 5 model validation this section presents the validation of the swift hydraulic model for online prediction of sewage hydraulic characteristics it should be noticed that calibration results shown in figs 3 and 4 were separately simulated for each gravity sewer with high quality input data provided by the full saint venant equations however in real applications there is not enough time to collect inputs data from such computational heavy models when the swift models are employed for rtc applications the input for a swift hydraulic model can only be provided by another swift hydraulic model for the upstream section for instance the inputs of the i th section a segment of the sewer pipe are the states of the prior section qi 1 ai 1 xi 1 i e flow rate flow area chemical concentration the new state qi ai xi obtained through the hydraulic model is in turn used as the inputs for the i 1 th section therefore any prediction errors caused by the hydraulic model will accumulate in the predicted outflow at the pipe end to demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed swift models the validation was performed by simulating the real scenario here only pump operations and chemical dosing rates were used all of which are accessible in real time from real sewer systems it can be noticed from the network layout fig 1 that the chemical dosed at sp12 is transported through a route of r1 r3 g1 g2 g4 and g6 red pipeline the disturbance is the chemical free side streams from r2 r4 r5 r6 r6 g3 and g5 green pipeline which dilute the dosed chemical at different locations along the route one month real pump operations data were used as the inputs for model validation results given by the saint venant equations are compared with the swift hydraulic model predictions fig 5 depicts validation results of the sewage flow rates for g1 to g6 at the gravity sewer outlet during a representative 2 hour period fig 6 shows validation results of flow areas for g1 g2 g4 and g6 outlets in the same period as fig 5 notice that in the rtc of chemical dosing information of flow area and chemical concentration of g3 and g5 are not required as they do not carry the dosed chemicals to quantitively assess the overall validation performance for g1 to g6 in two weeks the swift hydraulic models achieved high r2 values of 0 9911 0 9905 0 9387 0 9860 0 9659 and 0 9820 respectively in terms of flow rate and r2 values of 0 9996 0 9997 0 9998 and 0 9998 respectively for the flow areas for g1 g2 g4 and g6 low rmse for all scenarios were obtained as well table 4 accordingly chemical distribution across the sewer network was calculated based on the flow rates and flow areas predicted by the swift models and compared with the predictions supported by the full sait venant equations the chemical dosing rates at sps12 were uniformly distributed random integers ranging from 0 to 72 kg naoh d equivalent to common concentrations of 0 to 100 mg naoh l as shown with diamond symbols in fig 7 a the chemical concentration predictions supported by the swift and full models were very close with r2 values of 0 9999 0 9988 0 9980 and 0 9987 for g1 g2 g4 and g6 respectively the dosed chemical did not reach g3 or g5 in combination the flow rate flow area and chemical distribution results are presented in figs 5 7 along with figs s4 s7 in si for the longer term data clearly illustrate the excellent model performance the good agreements with the full model in terms of flow rate flow area and chemical distribution revealed the great ability of the swift hydraulic model in predicting sewage hydraulic characteristics and sewage compositions the execution time of the swift models was on average 0 04 seconds on a cpu with a clock speed of 2 1 ghz which was more than four orders of magnitude lower than the time cost of the full saint venant equations on average 2250 seconds this makes the swift hydraulic models suitable for rtc in sewer systems it is noted that the simulation time for solving the saint venant equations depends on the temporal and spatial resolutions required for the solutions in the control case studies reported below the equations needed to be solved with small time and space steps fewer savings may be achieved in applications that coarser steps can be applied 3 6 simulation study online control of chemical dosing in this section real time control of naoh dosing with the support of the swift hydraulic models was performed the control objective was to maintain the naoh concentration above a pre selected level of 90 mg l at the target location network discharge point in fig 1 in order to keep sewage ph at 9 0 sharma et al 2008 considering the dosed chemical was diluted by all the side stream inputs without chemicals in the real time control chemical dosing rates were determined through an online eho based optimisation algorithm as previously developed in li et al 2022 to realize cost effective sulfide control during the optimisation the swift hydraulic model was employed for fitness evaluation in order to help the optimisation to converge to better solutions specifically the swift hydraulic model conducted real time prediction of flow rate and flow area based on a given pump operation sequence the chemical distribution was further predicted based on the predicted hydraulics and the proposed dosing rate as an example fig 8 a depicts the collaborative pump operations and the total sewage flow discharged at the sewer network end the target location over a period of 24 hours the longer term simulation performance is shown in fig s8 the dosing rates optimised with the support of the swift hydraulic model and the controlled naoh concentration at the target location is illustrated in fig 8 b the rtc dosing strategy achieved robust control of naoh at the target location the naoh concentration was maintained close to the target of 90 mg l without significant over dose or under dose the average concentration was 99 5 mg l and the standard deviation was 9 8 mg l the total chemical consumption was only 10 higher than the theoretically minimum cost total discharge objective chemical concentration while the current industrial practice generally doubles the chemical consumption communication with the industry partner the results demonstrated that the integration of real time dosing control and the swift hydraulic models was capable of realizing network wide sulfide control in sewer networks comprising rising mains and gravity sewers 4 discussion 4 1 fast yet accurate flow prediction for sewer networks in this study two simple swift hydraulic models namely the fopdt model and the dsirf model were developed for accelerating the solution of hydraulic characteristics in gravity sewers their design was inspired by characterizing a gravity sewer as a time delay system the flow rate of the sewage downstream in a gravity pipe is determined by the pipe dimension and inflow behaviour prior to the current time thus the flow in a gravity pipe complies with causality in temporal span while presents transport delay between the inflow and outflow this is unlike the entire flow in the rising main that moves together at a constant rate in practice it is important to take into consideration such transport delays otherwise fresh side stream enters the trunks may miss the chance to mix with the sewage carrying the dosed chemical consequently receives inadequate amount or even no chemicals no matter how much chemical is dosed upstream characterizing gravity sewers as a time delay system provides a series of guidelines to develop swift solutions for sewage hydraulic characteristics based on the time delay system properties some efficient mathematical operations are applied to improve the solution of hydraulic conditions in sewers for instance in the scenario of r2g that computes flow dynamics in a gravity sewer with inflow discharged from rising mains convolution is used based on the principle of convolution any value in the output vector can depend on every value of the input vector hirschman and widder 2012 therefore convolution is an adequate operator for quickly collecting the cumulative impacts of the inflow in a period here the overlap save method is employed for discrete convolution in the time delay system mathematical details are described in si which is adaptive for the gravity sewer receiving sewage through discrete pump operations in the concept of overlap save the discrete step in terms of time is arbitrary thus allowing the user to specify the computational step size to adapt to the precision requirement of the control scenario moreover the integration of the fopdt model and convolution is feasible for both single input single output system e g g3 receives water from sp7 and multiple input single output system e g g5 receives water from sp9 and sp30 as illustrated in fig 2 another swift model dsirf is developed given the fact that in a gravity sewer the outflow q t at time t time step k is an accumulated effect of the inflow prior to time t and depends most heavily on the inflow near a previous time t ϕ while the delay ϕ mainly depends on inflow flow travel distance and pipe dimensions rossman and huber 2017 therefore for the prediction of sewage discharged from gravity sewer s or rising main s after spss with vsds dsirf is applied which is mathematically also a type of convolution at a first sight of the relation between the input and output in such cases g2g the outflow presents similar but smoother variation to the inflow after time delays fig 2 b d and f which can be expressed by the dsirf model that computes a sliding weighted sum of the inflow in the period k ϕk γ k ϕk where ϕk is the time delay γ is the sliding window size in a further analysis for a gravity sewer with certain dimensions the time delay ϕk which is the time for a flow passing through a sewer section should also be dynamic that is mainly determined by the flow velocity v q a in this study we find that there is a power function relationship eq 11 between q and a in a circular gravity sewer thus v ξ 1 q 1 ψ where ξ and ψ are constants moreover the outflow is descendingly affected by the inflow thereafter in γ steps consequently the time delay of outflow is approximated by a function of a moving averaged flow rate at time step k ϕk γ thus by considering the dynamic delays impacted by gradually varying inflow the dsirf achieved accurate predictions of the sewage flow rate from the above discussion it can be recognised that the governing functions and the solution process in the swift hydraulic model are developed in strong accordances with the physical realities of sps operations sewer pipe structures and sewage flow characteristics these bases empower the swift hydraulic models with great interpretability recent advances in deep learning have led to a proliferation of black box models farid et al 2020 which greatly accelerate the computing process using an intricate network structure with a tremendous number of internal parameters however it is usually difficult to explain how they work thus reduces the credibility and acceptability of their results especially for practical applications the performance of sewer systems directly relates to the resident health and city functioning making decisions in real time for sewage system operations through methods with excellent interpretability will significantly reduce the potential uncertainties and enhance operational security moreover the swift hydraulic models have not only a clear physical interpretation but also an execution speed faster than those deep learning models because they have much fewer parameters 2 and 4 parameters for a fopdt model and a dsirf model respectively and fewer computing processes overall the swift hydraulic model is an efficient and robust tool for real time tasks in sewer systems 4 2 implications and future work in this study the developed swift hydraulic models can compute the flow rate and flow area at any arbitrary location across the sewer network comprising both rising mains and gravity sewers real time tasks in sewer systems generally utilise a control horizon of hours ocampo martinez 2010 while the models apply a precise time step of 5 seconds therefore they can provide high resolution hydraulic information in the control horizon moreover they reduced the computational time by tens of thousands of times thus are suitable for real time applications the hydraulic model was then integrated to the rtc of naoh dosing to a sewer network for sulfide control this rtc strategy is not limited to naoh dosing and can be easily adapted to the dosing of other chemicals for example iron salts or magnesium hydroxide ganigué et al 2018 li et al 2022 liu et al 2016 furthermore with the help of the swift hydraulic models a single dosing location can manage the sulfide in a large scale network comprising different types of sewers in addition the hydraulic radius and water depth of the flow along a gravity sewer can also be derived based on pipe geometry as detailed in si the swift hydraulic models can also be applied to other management tasks including the control minimization of combined sewer overflows cso real time predictive control is recognised as the best approach for cso minimization which schedules the sewage pump operations to make the best use of the sewer inline storage capacity based on future flow dynamics in the sewer system darsono and labadie 2007 however real time optimisation has rarely been implemented in large scale networks in practice largely due to the excessive computational demand when the full hydraulic model is used for the hydraulic prediction the developed swift hydraulic models are able to conduct hydraulic prediction for the entire sewer system in real time meanwhile fulfil the stringent requirements on computational accuracy for sewer overflow management moreover the real time control method for chemical dosing presented here can be adapted for cso control by changing the controlled variable in the objective function to water volume or depth at pre specified locations across the sewer network in this study we assumed that gravity sewers under consideration and the junction nodes manholes between them have free surface flows however in extreme wet weather the flow may exceed the capacity of the pipe leading to surcharge of pipes and manholes backwater and reversal flow irwin et al 2018 the development of swift hydraulic models for such flow regimes is not addressed here and requires investigations in the future in addition the in sewer flow was assumed to be purely induced by the influent at the inlet of the pipe in practice a pipe could be subject to inflow infiltration exfiltration which is typically unknown this lack of inflow infiltration exfiltration information is expected to cause difficulties in hydraulic predictions with mechanistic models e g with the saint venant equations while not studied in this work data driven models established from the real sewer data may potentially offer a solution as the patterns in inflow infiltration exfiltration may be captured in the data driven model if real sewer data are used to train the model the development of swift models from real sewer data will be studied in the future 5 conclusions in this study we developed swift hydraulic models for computing the hydraulic characteristics in gravity sewers and applied them to support the rtc of chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation in a sewer network the main conclusions are a gravity sewer can be characterized as a system with time delays the system transfer function can be calibrated based on pipe dimension and capacities of sewage pumps for a gravity sewer that receives water from rising main s the flow in this pipe can be computed through a first order plus dead time model for a gravity sewer that receives water from gravity sewer s the flow in this pipe is solved through a dynamic shifting impulse response filter the developed method can compute sewage flow rate flow area and water depth at any location and any time for the entire sewer network the models have high fidelities to the full saint venant equations on solutions and accelerate the computing speed by up to four orders of magnitude the integration of the swift hydraulic models and real time optimisation enables network wide sulfide control through cost effective chemical dosing these hydraulic models could potentially be used

16224,real time control rtc is an important tool for safe and cost effective operations of sewer systems by for example reducing sewer overflow or enhancing sulfide mitigation due to the long transport time of sewage and the inherent dynamics in sewage flow rates model predictive control is often needed which requires the prediction of sewage hydraulic characteristics across the network the full hydraulic models are often unsuitable for such purposes due to their high computational demands which are not affordable as the models need to be called for numerous times in each optimisation step in this study two swift data driven hydraulic models are developed to predict sewage flow rates in gravity sewers receiving feeds from rising main s and gravity main s respectively the models are shown to be able to predict both the sewage flow rate and the cross sectional flow area in high fidelities with solutions of saint venant equations but reduce the computational time by up to four orders of magnitude the swift hydraulic models were then integrated into an rtc strategy for naoh dosing in a simulated real life sewer network and achieved cost effective control of sulfide these models could potentially be used for other sewer rtc applications graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer network hydraulic models data driven model gravity sewer real time control chemical dosing 1 introduction sewer systems collect and convey wastewater from residential houses and industries to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp for treatment and disposal or recycling real time control rtc strategies are increasingly implemented in sewer systems for minimizing sewer overflow lund et al 2018 in more recent years rtc is also used to control in sewer chemical delivery to mitigate the sulfide induced sewer corrosion and odour problems li et al 2022 liu et al 2016 sewer networks are distributed systems consisting of many interconnected sewage pumping stations spss and sewer pipes because of the delay due to sewage transport the control performance at downstream target locations by manipulating upstream objects generally spss or dosing pumps cannot be accessed immediately therefore model predictive control mpc is employed during rtc which adjust the control actions according to their future performance predicted by models rawlings and mayne 2009 in rtc the predictive models are called for numerous times to recurrently evaluate the future control performance of each solution as in each optimisation step there are commonly hundreds of solutions to evaluate ocampo martinez 2010 to meet real time requirements such predictive models must be efficient in terms of both accuracy and speed sadler et al 2019 hydraulic models are one of the most critical tools for rtc in sewer systems lund et al 2018 ocampo martinez et al 2013 they provide sewage hydraulic characteristics like flow rate cross sectional flow area water depth and hydraulic radius in sewers the model accuracy directly determines the performance of the rtc their design is mainly based on the characteristics of different types of sewer pipes a sewer network generally comprises two types of pipes 1 rising mains also called pressurised or pumped mains which are fully filled pipes with pressurised sewage driven by the spss when a pump is on the sewage flow along the pipeline is pushed forward to the discharge point by the newly injected flow therefore the flow rate in and out of a rising main is equal to the pumped flow rate the cross sectional flow area in rising mains is constant determined by the pipe dimensions 2 gravity sewers which are designed for transporting sewage through gravity these pipes comprise a liquid and a gas phase except in extreme wet weather conditions leading to surcharge of the pipe the hydraulic conditions in gravity sewers are affected by the inflow hydrograph geometric characteristics of the pipe the flow initial conditions initial values of variables in the flow domain and boundary conditions flow distribution at inlets outlets and pipe walls rossman 2010 the flowing wave along the pipeline varies gradually and presents unsteady states due to wave retardation acceleration attenuation and amplification rossman and huber 2017 to compute the dynamic and complex processes of sewage flow in gravity sewers the most theoretically accurate results can be obtained with the saint venant equations vreugdenhil 1994 also known as shallow water equations this is a set of hyperbolic partial differential equations governed by the conservation of mass and momentum accounting for pressurized flow backwater transfer loss coriolis frictional and viscous forces because of its precise interpretation of hydraulic mechanism saint venant equations have been widely applied in a variety of well known hydraulic software such as the storm water management model swmm developed by the united states environmental protection agency epa rossman 2010 infoworks searby et al 1998 and mike havnø et al 1995 however a serious bottleneck of saint venant equations is the high computational cost for solving the hyperbolic partial differential equations lund et al 2018 thus deemed unsuitable for rtc tasks bowes et al 2021 sadler et al 2019 to address this dilemma simplifications of saint venant equations have been widely studied capart et al 1997 duchesne et al 2004 samani and jebelifard 2003 the most commonly used methods are finite difference patankar and baliga 1978 and finite volume schemes godunov 1959 which solved conservation equations with piecewise constant conditions in each pre defined intersection termed as riemann problems leveque 2002 however these solutions are still computational expensive on non rectangular and non prismatic conduits sanders 2001 while most sewer pipes are circular channels furthermore even their efficiency for rectangular or prismatic pipes conduits is still unsatisfactory for the rtc applications for large scale networks getirana et al 2017 another approach to accelerate the solution of sewage characteristics is making assumptions

mains are assumed to be steady and uniform nielsen et al 2008 in swmm rossman 2010 a single sewer pipe is treated as an integrated whole that the flow characteristics rate velocity and water depth at different locations along the pipe are assigned with the same value average as such at the moment a sewage slug enters a pipe there generates a virtual flow with the same rate at the pipe end simultaneously however in reality it takes minutes for a sewage slug to reach the end of a hundreds meter long gravity pipe duchesne et al 2004 the transport delay is one of the most critical features for the sewage flow which should be seriously considered for network nodes pipe junctions manholes and storage tanks to achieve network wide control incorrect estimation of the sewage flow rate and the delay will cause the rtc strategies unable to make the best use of the in sewer free space to reduce sewer overflow or in the case of chemical dosing control lead some sewage slugs to receive inadequate or even no chemicals for sulfide mitigation in addition parallel computing has been employed to speed up rtc tasks by distributing the hydraulic simulations using e g swmm to multiple processors simultaneously bowes et al 2021 sadler et al 2019 the acceleration is however rather limited without improving the simulator hydraulic model such a method treats the symptoms not the cause therefore a hydraulic model that can swiftly provide accurate hydraulic characteristics is the pillar of deploying real time strategies in sewer systems however none of the currently available models is satisfactory this study aims to develop swift hydraulic models for calculating the flow rate and cross sectional flow area in gravity sewers across a sewer network these models should obtain comparable accuracies with the full saint venant equations at a fraction of the computational cost in order to facilitate the rtc in sewer systems first given the nature of flow transport delay in the system the gravity sewer is formulated as a time delay system second based on the behaviour of inflow from different sources rising mains or gravity sewers two types of swift models namely first order plus dead time fopdt models and dynamic shifting impulse response filters dsirf are developed and validated using results of the full saint venant equations finally the swift hydraulic models are integrated into a real time model predictive control algorithm and applied to the online control of chemical dosing in a simulated real life sewer network comprising both rising mains and gravity sewers 2 materials and methods 2 1 system description data collection and governing models to facilitate method development and demonstration a real life sewer network is selected which is located at port pirie a seaport on the east coast of south australia the port pirie wastewater catchment ppwwc covers an area of approximately 12 km2 encompassing 35 spss and approximately 1 650 nodes manholes based on the topographic contour ppwwc can be divided into three sub catchments as shown in fig s1 in supplementary information si in sub catchment 1 and sub catchment 3 the spss comprise only rising mains and only gravity sewers respectively in sub catchment 2 wastewater is pumped to rising mains by 6 spss distributed in the catchment then transported to a trunk sewer via gravity pipes comprising both rising mains and gravity sewers this catchment therefore was selected for developing and verifying the swift hydraulic models of gravity sewers and also for testing the rtc algorithm this selected network has 6 spss rising mains of a total length of 3209 3 m and gravity sewers of a total length of 2173 9 m the rising mains have diameters ranging between 0 089 m and 0 143 m and gravity sewers have diameters from 0 225 m to 0 379 m the total average dry weather flow is 1 610 m3 day fig 1 depicts the schematic of the selected sewer network with the length and dimension of the gravity sewers details of pump properties and average dry weather flow adwf and sewer properties are summarised in tables s1 and s2 respectively in si real time recorded pump switch signals i e pump turned on or off when the water level in the wet well reaches the upper or lower duty level respectively were retrieved from the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system saint venant equations describe the unsteady flow in a conduit and are expressed in the form of conservation of mass and momentum capart et al 1997 in this study they are used as the governing model to provide benchmark hydraulic data flow rates and cross sectional flow areas for gravity mains for the calibration and validation of the swift hydraulic models and also for the full simulation of the network the saint venant equations are discretised then solved for finite volume conduits with the dormand prince method dormand and prince 1980 the whole method is deployed in matlab version 2020a the details of the original and discretised saint venant equations and validation results of the governing functions are presented in si 2 2 integrated real time control of chemical dosing optimisation 2 2 1 problem statement real time control of chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation in sewer networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years to efficiently mitigate sulfide and sulfide induced corrosion and odour problems the sewage is required to contain a desirable amount of chemicals at corrosion and odour hotspots chemicals are generally dosed upstream of the catchment the chemical containing sewage then flows through the network driven by pumps or gravity with the chemical contained often diluted at multiple locations by the chemical free sidestreams from other branches along its transport route such features make it difficult to achieve desired distributions of the dosed chemical when sewage reaches corrosion and odour hotspots a strategy often adopted by the water industry is to heavily overdose so that the sewage still contains an adequate concentration of the dosed chemical even after heavy dilution this is accompanied by large costs still with no guarantee of satisfactory sulfide control performance to conquer this challenge real time optimisation of chemical dosing based on the current and predicted future sewage states has been proposed ganigué et al 2018 li et al 2022 liu et al 2016 in li et al 2022 for example an elephant hearding optimisation eho algorithm was developed to achieve desirable chemical distribution at the network downstream through regulating the spss the hydraulic model would be called for numerous times by the optimisation algorithm to evaluate the chemical distribution so as to find the most cost effective dosing actions therefore any excessive computation time demand would hinder the rtc implementation the algorithm was applied to a sewer network comprising rising mains only for which the hydraulic characteristics of the entire network could be predicted instantly based on mass balance however the method can not be directly applied to networks containing gravity sewers although the full saint venant equations are able to provide precise hydraulic dynamics of gravity sewers its computational demand is not affordable for real time optimisation swift hydraulic models for gravity sewers are essential for such applications which will be developed in this study see section 3 to demonstrate the ability of the swift hydraulic model in supporting real time applications in sewer systems the above described sewer network was used in a case study aimed to optimise chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation in this study sodium hydroxide naoh was dosed at sps12 fig 1 the objective of the rtc is to maintain the naoh concentration at the discharge point of the catchment target location in fig 1 consistently above a pre specified level of 90 mg naoh l by synchronising sps12 the chemical receiving sps with other spss and by dynamically controlling the chemical dosing rate at sps12 2 2 2 methods in every rtc step the sewage flow rate into each of the 6 spss was predicted for the next 6 hours using arx autoregressive with exogenous inputs models previously developed li et al 2019 these predicted flow rates were then used to predict the pump start time when the sewage level in the sps wet well reaches the pre defined upper duty level and calculate the amount of sewage accumulated at the spss the start of an sps triggers the chemical receiving sps sps 12 to ensure new chemicals are injected into the network any other non chemical receiving pumps are also turned on if there is a reasonable amount of sewage i e above a pre defined minimum present in the sps wet well with this pump synchronisation program adequate mixing of chemical containing and non chemical containing sewage in the system can be ensured the program also turns off all spss when any sps is turned off when the sewage level reaches the pre defined lower duty level with the predicted scheduled pumping events at all spss the hydraulics flow rates and cross sectional flow area in the network were predicted for the 6 hour horizon the flow rate out of a rising main was the same as the pumped flow rate for gravity mains the swift hydraulic models developed in section 3 were used finally the predicted hydraulic conditions were fed into an eho algorithm li et al 2022 which searched for the satisfactory dosing rate accompanied with each pumping event at sps12 by optimising an objective function making trade offs between naoh distribution at the target location and chemical consumption details of the collaborative pump scheduling and the optimisation of chemical dosing are described in si the rtc was implemented and evaluated through simulation studies of the network fig 1 the saint venant equations were employed to simulate the true hydraulics in the gravity sewers while the developed swift models were used in the integrated rtc 3 model development and evaluation 3 1 analysis of hydraulic characteristics in gravity sewers the primary aim of this study is to accelerate the computation of sewage hydraulic characteristics at an arbitrary location in the sewer network containing gravity sewers firstly the flow rate at the inlet and outlet of the gravity sewer was analysed to gain a better insight into the hydraulic dynamics in gravity sewers in fig 2 there depicts the inflow obtained from real world scada data and outflow calculated by the full saint venant equations of the gravity sewers in the selected sewer system note that the simulation was conducted excluding extreme storm weather to ensure free surface flows in the sewer pipes and at the junction nodes cases where sewer pipes and or junction nodes are surcharged are out of the scope of this study the six gravity sewers g1 to g6 receive sewage from different types of sources rising mains gravity sewers or a combination of them here we hypothesise that the relationship between the outflow and inflow of a gravity sewer pipe may be characterized as a system with time delays because sewage transport delay is an inherent nature in sewer systems delays of 0 05 h to 0 4 h between the inflow and the corresponding outflow can be observed for gravity pipes used in this study g1 g6 fig 2 such delays only depend on the pipe characteristics and the source flow independent of when the flow enters the pipe in this way the swift hydraulic model can be developed based on these properties of the time delay system the next step is to build proper methods for predicting hydraulic characteristics in a gravity pipe based on the type of source flow the hydraulic flow dynamics in a gravity sewer is classified into two scenarios 1 r2g rising main to gravity sewer flow in a gravity sewer receiving sewage from a rising main after an sps with a fixed pumped flow for example flows in g1 g3 and g5 fig 1 2 g2g gravity sewer to gravity sewer flow in a gravity sewer receiving sewage from a gravity sewer or a combination of gravity sewers and rising mains or rising mains after spss with variable speed drives vsds for example flows in g2 g4 and g6 fig 1 3 2 fopdt model for r2g flows 3 2 1 problem statement in the scenario of r2g flow is discharged from an upstream rising main to a receiving gravity sewer the aim is to predict the flow rate and cross sectional flow area in the gravity sewer using the flow from the rising main notice that for a gravity sewer receives sewage from multiple spss upstream through a rising main each sps is described as an independent source of the receiving gravity sewer for example in the sewer network shown in fig 1 g1 belongs to the scenario of r2g that it receives sewage from sp11 and sp12 through r3 thus each of sps11 and sps12 is a separate source of g1 the hydraulic behaviour in a rising main inherits the characteristics of the flow pumped from the sps which can be formally expressed by the heaviside step function davies 2002 the spss employed here are spss with fixed capacities which are most commonly applied in sewer systems spss with vsds are grouped into the scenario of g2g which is discussed in the next section the inflow ui t of the gravity sewer at time t due to the j th pump cycle of i the sps in the control horizon is described by the following function 1 u i t δ i h i t where δi is the pumped flow l s of the i th sps hi t is the response of heaviside step function that uses 0 and 1 to indicate the events of pump off and pump on respectively 2 h i t 0 t j 1 o f f t t j o n 1 t j o n t t j o f f where t j o n and t j o f f are the time when the i th sps turns on and off in the j the pump cycle respectively in the scenario of r2g the source flow is from sps s then enters a gravity sewer via rising mains an event of g1 is used as an example to illustrate the r2g flow due to a pump cycle fig 2 a the source flow is from sp12 then to r1 r3 and finally enters g1 pump operations i e the inflow over t 0 to t 3 is used as the inputs of the hydraulic model the corresponding flow at a downstream location here use the pipe outlet as a representative location occurs between t 1 to t 5 fig 2 a it can be seen that when the sps turns on at t0 after a time delay t 0 to t 1 the corresponding outflow rate in the gravity sewer in turn experiences a period of rising t 1 to t 2 and dropping t 4 to t 5 sequentially which present different variation pattern due to the source flow change inflow from 0 sharp to qp at t 0 and from qp sharp to 0 at t 3 while the flow rate changes faster when dropping in this way for a given sps each of the on off operations requires a respective function to capture the corresponding flow variation downstream in the gravity sewer 3 2 2 development of first order plus dead time model in the frequency domain of the time delay system the gravity flow due to pump on flow rising or off flow dropping can both be expressed by a transfer function in the form of first order plus dead time fopdt model bi et al 1999 3 g s k e θ s τ s 1 where k is the gain here is 1 based on mass conservation of flow τ is the time constant and θ is the time delay the so called dead time the fopdt model can be reverted to time domain utilizing inverse laplace transform as follows 4 g t 1 g s 1 τ e t θ τ h t θ parameters θ and τ are calibrated by maximizing the fit of the predictions between the fopdt model and the saint venant equations using the least square method lawson and hanson 1995 here the calibration data is the saint venant model predictions of the flows at the end of gravity mains in response to the upstream sps operation over 3 months retrieved from the scada system one θ value and one τ value were calibrated from each rising outflow and the average θ and τ values are assigned as the calibrated parameters for the fopdt model with the corresponding standard error estimated the parameters of the dropping outflow are obtained in the same way in the time delay system the response outflow to an impulse a pump operation is described as the pointwise product of the convolution integral basile and marro 1992 which is formally defined as follows 5 q i t u i t g i t u i s g i t s d s where notation represents convolution ui t is source flow variation l s due to the i th sps operations qi t is the corresponding outflow l s gi t is the impulse responses inverse of the transfer function which is the developed fopdt model the numerical calculation of a fopdt model with convolution is conducted with the method of overlap save frerking 2013 with a time step of 5 seconds details are given in si in summary for the flow directly discharged from a rising main its variation in a gravity pipe is calculated through the following process 1 convert the transfer function from frequency domain to time domain eq 4 2 calibrate the transfer function fopdt model with flow rates generated by saint venant equations a flowchart fig s3 of the implementation of the fopdt model for calculating r2g flow is provided in si 3 2 3 calibration results three month real pump on off data was used to develop fopdt models for gravity sewer g1 g3 and g5 with the calibrated parameters summarized in table 1 as an example fig 3 shows the fit between the fopdt predictions and the training data calculated with saint venant equations over a randomly chosen 5 hours the model performance was evaluated through two statistic criteria namely coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse with the functions given in si the fopdt models for simulating r2g flow in gravity sewers g1 g3 and g5 achieved high agreements with the results of the full saint venant equations with r2 of 0 9966 0 9756 and 0 9825 respectively and rmse of 0 0652 0 1141 and 0 1293 respectively table 2 both r2 and rmse statistics demonstrated the robust performance of fopdt models for r2g flow 3 3 dsirf model for g2g flows 3 3 1 problem statement from hydraulic analysis it is known that the behaviour of the flow in a gravity sewer can be very different depending on the type of source where the sewage is discharged from except for the step flow out of a rising main connected to a fixed speed sps most sewage flow varies continuously when entering a gravity sewer for example the flow from a gravity sewer or a rising main connected to an sps with a vsd we name this type of flow as g2g flow in the selected sewer network g2 g4 and g6 belong to the g2g category with hydraulic characteristics illustrated in fig 2 b d and f respectively there are three key features for the g2g flow feature 1 it can be observed that the outflow presents similar variation trends as the inflow but with delays that are created by the flow transport feature 2 flow in a gravity sewer is continuously dynamic which makes it different from the inflow this is due to the physical process like flow retardation acceleration attenuation and amplification rossman and huber 2017 feature 3 from feature 2 and observation of fig 2 the delays are not constant consequently the similarity of flow trend decays as the transport distance becomes longer considering these features a new approach is proposed to predict the hydraulic characteristics of the g2g flow first according to feature 1 a past time t ϕ is mapped to calculate the sewage flow q t at a downstream location of a gravity sewer at time t where ϕ is the delay due to sewage transport next given feature 2 q t is determined by the cumulative impacts of the flow entering the sewer in a period around t ϕ rather than the flow rate at a single time point moreover corresponding to feature 3 the delay ϕ is dynamic and subject to the value of the cumulative impacts for concise expression hereafter t ϕ is named as the datum time for flow q t the cumulative impacts of the inflow in a period around t ϕ is called the datum flow and denoted as q t ϕ 3 3 2 development of a dsirf dynamic shifting impulse response filter model based on the above discussion the gravity flow is characterized by two factors a datum flow q k representing the cumulative impacts of the source flow and a transport delay ϕk for the flow entering the gravity sewer at time step k given the above the flow q k at a downstream location in the gravity sewer at time step k is captured by a dynamic shifting impulse response filter dsirf 6 q k q k ϕ k where q k is the gravity flow l s calculated for time step k q k ϕ k is the datum flow l s given by the dsirf ϕk is the time delay step for time shifting the datum flow the first key factor q k is introduced because in the gravity sewer the flow depends most heavily on the inflow near a previous time k ϕk and gradually eliminates the dependences on the inflow after k ϕk this feature can be characterized by an infinite impulse response filter with exponentially decreased weighting factors 7 q k i 1 γ u k i 1 ω i w where 8 ω i α γ i i 1 γ 9 w i 1 γ ω i where u k is the inflow at time step k q k l s is the datum flow indicating the cumulative influence of inflow during the period of k k γ 1 γ is the moving window size ωi is the weight of step k i 1 α is the exponential factor w is the sum of weights in the case study reported below the time step is chosen to be 5 seconds to tackle the flow transport delay ϕk the flow q k is obtained by time shifting the datum outflow q k with a delay of ϕk this delay is dynamic and mainly depends on the value of q k which is in inverse proportion to the flow rate as it takes a longer time for the flow with lower rates reaching the downstream locations besides the time step shifted by the moving window should be compensated for the delay therefore the flow delay at step time k is deduced as 10 ϕ k λ q b q k 2 γ where ϕk is the delay of datum flow λ s2 l2 is a calibrated coefficient qb l s is a baseline flow rate γ is the moving window size 3 3 3 calibration results parameters used in the dsirf model are optimised with calibration data inflow and outflow of g2 g4 and g6 produced by the full saint venant equations by feeding 3 month pump scada data here the outflow at the gravity sewer end is studied as the downstream flow impacted by the inflow exponential factor α is chosen following the principles introduced in a previous study natrella 2010 that an α close to 1 accelerates the data smoothing and an α value close to 0 slows down the data smoothing γ can be initially set as tq nδt where n is the number of segmented sections in the gravity sewer determination of n is described in a recent study li et al 2022 tq is the average time for the calibration flow passing through n sections in the gravity sewer λ is calibrated through nonlinear least squares with the calibration data qb is determined by the average dry weather flow in this pipe the calibrated parameters are summarized in table 3 a 5 hour calibration result of the outflow with the corresponding r2 and rmse is shown in fig 4 in the scenarios of g2g the dsirf models achieved high fidelities of flow prediction to the saint venant equations with r2 of 0 9957 0 9970 and 0 9980 for g2 g4 and g6 respectively 3 4 simplified model for cross sectional flow area through the above functions the flow rates across the sewer network can be obtained next a model for predicting cross sectional flow area hereafter called flow area for short is proposed in terms of real time application a simplified model was developed to improve computational efficiency this model can directly obtain the corresponding flow area a using the flow rate q as inputs the simplified model is established as follows 11 a ξ q ψ where ξ and ψ are the calibrated parameters in this study simplified models for flow area were developed for gravity sewer g1 g2 g4 and g6 which conveyed the dosed chemical to the discharge point the calibration data including sewage flow rate and flow area was generated by the saint venant equations parameters ξ and ψ were calibrated through nonlinear least squares and summarized in table 3 3 5 model validation this section presents the validation of the swift hydraulic model for online prediction of sewage hydraulic characteristics it should be noticed that calibration results shown in figs 3 and 4 were separately simulated for each gravity sewer with high quality input data provided by the full saint venant equations however in real applications there is not enough time to collect inputs data from such computational heavy models when the swift models are employed for rtc applications the input for a swift hydraulic model can only be provided by another swift hydraulic model for the upstream section for instance the inputs of the i th section a segment of the sewer pipe are the states of the prior section qi 1 ai 1 xi 1 i e flow rate flow area chemical concentration the new state qi ai xi obtained through the hydraulic model is in turn used as the inputs for the i 1 th section therefore any prediction errors caused by the hydraulic model will accumulate in the predicted outflow at the pipe end to demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed swift models the validation was performed by simulating the real scenario here only pump operations and chemical dosing rates were used all of which are accessible in real time from real sewer systems it can be noticed from the network layout fig 1 that the chemical dosed at sp12 is transported through a route of r1 r3 g1 g2 g4 and g6 red pipeline the disturbance is the chemical free side streams from r2 r4 r5 r6 r6 g3 and g5 green pipeline which dilute the dosed chemical at different locations along the route one month real pump operations data were used as the inputs for model validation results given by the saint venant equations are compared with the swift hydraulic model predictions fig 5 depicts validation results of the sewage flow rates for g1 to g6 at the gravity sewer outlet during a representative 2 hour period fig 6 shows validation results of flow areas for g1 g2 g4 and g6 outlets in the same period as fig 5 notice that in the rtc of chemical dosing information of flow area and chemical concentration of g3 and g5 are not required as they do not carry the dosed chemicals to quantitively assess the overall validation performance for g1 to g6 in two weeks the swift hydraulic models achieved high r2 values of 0 9911 0 9905 0 9387 0 9860 0 9659 and 0 9820 respectively in terms of flow rate and r2 values of 0 9996 0 9997 0 9998 and 0 9998 respectively for the flow areas for g1 g2 g4 and g6 low rmse for all scenarios were obtained as well table 4 accordingly chemical distribution across the sewer network was calculated based on the flow rates and flow areas predicted by the swift models and compared with the predictions supported by the full sait venant equations the chemical dosing rates at sps12 were uniformly distributed random integers ranging from 0 to 72 kg naoh d equivalent to common concentrations of 0 to 100 mg naoh l as shown with diamond symbols in fig 7 a the chemical concentration predictions supported by the swift and full models were very close with r2 values of 0 9999 0 9988 0 9980 and 0 9987 for g1 g2 g4 and g6 respectively the dosed chemical did not reach g3 or g5 in combination the flow rate flow area and chemical distribution results are presented in figs 5 7 along with figs s4 s7 in si for the longer term data clearly illustrate the excellent model performance the good agreements with the full model in terms of flow rate flow area and chemical distribution revealed the great ability of the swift hydraulic model in predicting sewage hydraulic characteristics and sewage compositions the execution time of the swift models was on average 0 04 seconds on a cpu with a clock speed of 2 1 ghz which was more than four orders of magnitude lower than the time cost of the full saint venant equations on average 2250 seconds this makes the swift hydraulic models suitable for rtc in sewer systems it is noted that the simulation time for solving the saint venant equations depends on the temporal and spatial resolutions required for the solutions in the control case studies reported below the equations needed to be solved with small time and space steps fewer savings may be achieved in applications that coarser steps can be applied 3 6 simulation study online control of chemical dosing in this section real time control of naoh dosing with the support of the swift hydraulic models was performed the control objective was to maintain the naoh concentration above a pre selected level of 90 mg l at the target location network discharge point in fig 1 in order to keep sewage ph at 9 0 sharma et al 2008 considering the dosed chemical was diluted by all the side stream inputs without chemicals in the real time control chemical dosing rates were determined through an online eho based optimisation algorithm as previously developed in li et al 2022 to realize cost effective sulfide control during the optimisation the swift hydraulic model was employed for fitness evaluation in order to help the optimisation to converge to better solutions specifically the swift hydraulic model conducted real time prediction of flow rate and flow area based on a given pump operation sequence the chemical distribution was further predicted based on the predicted hydraulics and the proposed dosing rate as an example fig 8 a depicts the collaborative pump operations and the total sewage flow discharged at the sewer network end the target location over a period of 24 hours the longer term simulation performance is shown in fig s8 the dosing rates optimised with the support of the swift hydraulic model and the controlled naoh concentration at the target location is illustrated in fig 8 b the rtc dosing strategy achieved robust control of naoh at the target location the naoh concentration was maintained close to the target of 90 mg l without significant over dose or under dose the average concentration was 99 5 mg l and the standard deviation was 9 8 mg l the total chemical consumption was only 10 higher than the theoretically minimum cost total discharge objective chemical concentration while the current industrial practice generally doubles the chemical consumption communication with the industry partner the results demonstrated that the integration of real time dosing control and the swift hydraulic models was capable of realizing network wide sulfide control in sewer networks comprising rising mains and gravity sewers 4 discussion 4 1 fast yet accurate flow prediction for sewer networks in this study two simple swift hydraulic models namely the fopdt model and the dsirf model were developed for accelerating the solution of hydraulic characteristics in gravity sewers their design was inspired by characterizing a gravity sewer as a time delay system the flow rate of the sewage downstream in a gravity pipe is determined by the pipe dimension and inflow behaviour prior to the current time thus the flow in a gravity pipe complies with causality in temporal span while presents transport delay between the inflow and outflow this is unlike the entire flow in the rising main that moves together at a constant rate in practice it is important to take into consideration such transport delays otherwise fresh side stream enters the trunks may miss the chance to mix with the sewage carrying the dosed chemical consequently receives inadequate amount or even no chemicals no matter how much chemical is dosed upstream characterizing gravity sewers as a time delay system provides a series of guidelines to develop swift solutions for sewage hydraulic characteristics based on the time delay system properties some efficient mathematical operations are applied to improve the solution of hydraulic conditions in sewers for instance in the scenario of r2g that computes flow dynamics in a gravity sewer with inflow discharged from rising mains convolution is used based on the principle of convolution any value in the output vector can depend on every value of the input vector hirschman and widder 2012 therefore convolution is an adequate operator for quickly collecting the cumulative impacts of the inflow in a period here the overlap save method is employed for discrete convolution in the time delay system mathematical details are described in si which is adaptive for the gravity sewer receiving sewage through discrete pump operations in the concept of overlap save the discrete step in terms of time is arbitrary thus allowing the user to specify the computational step size to adapt to the precision requirement of the control scenario moreover the integration of the fopdt model and convolution is feasible for both single input single output system e g g3 receives water from sp7 and multiple input single output system e g g5 receives water from sp9 and sp30 as illustrated in fig 2 another swift model dsirf is developed given the fact that in a gravity sewer the outflow q t at time t time step k is an accumulated effect of the inflow prior to time t and depends most heavily on the inflow near a previous time t ϕ while the delay ϕ mainly depends on inflow flow travel distance and pipe dimensions rossman and huber 2017 therefore for the prediction of sewage discharged from gravity sewer s or rising main s after spss with vsds dsirf is applied which is mathematically also a type of convolution at a first sight of the relation between the input and output in such cases g2g the outflow presents similar but smoother variation to the inflow after time delays fig 2 b d and f which can be expressed by the dsirf model that computes a sliding weighted sum of the inflow in the period k ϕk γ k ϕk where ϕk is the time delay γ is the sliding window size in a further analysis for a gravity sewer with certain dimensions the time delay ϕk which is the time for a flow passing through a sewer section should also be dynamic that is mainly determined by the flow velocity v q a in this study we find that there is a power function relationship eq 11 between q and a in a circular gravity sewer thus v ξ 1 q 1 ψ where ξ and ψ are constants moreover the outflow is descendingly affected by the inflow thereafter in γ steps consequently the time delay of outflow is approximated by a function of a moving averaged flow rate at time step k ϕk γ thus by considering the dynamic delays impacted by gradually varying inflow the dsirf achieved accurate predictions of the sewage flow rate from the above discussion it can be recognised that the governing functions and the solution process in the swift hydraulic model are developed in strong accordances with the physical realities of sps operations sewer pipe structures and sewage flow characteristics these bases empower the swift hydraulic models with great interpretability recent advances in deep learning have led to a proliferation of black box models farid et al 2020 which greatly accelerate the computing process using an intricate network structure with a tremendous number of internal parameters however it is usually difficult to explain how they work thus reduces the credibility and acceptability of their results especially for practical applications the performance of sewer systems directly relates to the resident health and city functioning making decisions in real time for sewage system operations through methods with excellent interpretability will significantly reduce the potential uncertainties and enhance operational security moreover the swift hydraulic models have not only a clear physical interpretation but also an execution speed faster than those deep learning models because they have much fewer parameters 2 and 4 parameters for a fopdt model and a dsirf model respectively and fewer computing processes overall the swift hydraulic model is an efficient and robust tool for real time tasks in sewer systems 4 2 implications and future work in this study the developed swift hydraulic models can compute the flow rate and flow area at any arbitrary location across the sewer network comprising both rising mains and gravity sewers real time tasks in sewer systems generally utilise a control horizon of hours ocampo martinez 2010 while the models apply a precise time step of 5 seconds therefore they can provide high resolution hydraulic information in the control horizon moreover they reduced the computational time by tens of thousands of times thus are suitable for real time applications the hydraulic model was then integrated to the rtc of naoh dosing to a sewer network for sulfide control this rtc strategy is not limited to naoh dosing and can be easily adapted to the dosing of other chemicals for example iron salts or magnesium hydroxide ganigué et al 2018 li et al 2022 liu et al 2016 furthermore with the help of the swift hydraulic models a single dosing location can manage the sulfide in a large scale network comprising different types of sewers in addition the hydraulic radius and water depth of the flow along a gravity sewer can also be derived based on pipe geometry as detailed in si the swift hydraulic models can also be applied to other management tasks including the control minimization of combined sewer overflows cso real time predictive control is recognised as the best approach for cso minimization which schedules the sewage pump operations to make the best use of the sewer inline storage capacity based on future flow dynamics in the sewer system darsono and labadie 2007 however real time optimisation has rarely been implemented in large scale networks in practice largely due to the excessive computational demand when the full hydraulic model is used for the hydraulic prediction the developed swift hydraulic models are able to conduct hydraulic prediction for the entire sewer system in real time meanwhile fulfil the stringent requirements on computational accuracy for sewer overflow management moreover the real time control method for chemical dosing presented here can be adapted for cso control by changing the controlled variable in the objective function to water volume or depth at pre specified locations across the sewer network in this study we assumed that gravity sewers under consideration and the junction nodes manholes between them have free surface flows however in extreme wet weather the flow may exceed the capacity of the pipe leading to surcharge of pipes and manholes backwater and reversal flow irwin et al 2018 the development of swift hydraulic models for such flow regimes is not addressed here and requires investigations in the future in addition the in sewer flow was assumed to be purely induced by the influent at the inlet of the pipe in practice a pipe could be subject to inflow infiltration exfiltration which is typically unknown this lack of inflow infiltration exfiltration information is expected to cause difficulties in hydraulic predictions with mechanistic models e g with the saint venant equations while not studied in this work data driven models established from the real sewer data may potentially offer a solution as the patterns in inflow infiltration exfiltration may be captured in the data driven model if real sewer data are used to train the model the development of swift models from real sewer data will be studied in the future 5 conclusions in this study we developed swift hydraulic models for computing the hydraulic characteristics in gravity sewers and applied them to support the rtc of chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation in a sewer network the main conclusions are a gravity sewer can be characterized as a system with time delays the system transfer function can be calibrated based on pipe dimension and capacities of sewage pumps for a gravity sewer that receives water from rising main s the flow in this pipe can be computed through a first order plus dead time model for a gravity sewer that receives water from gravity sewer s the flow in this pipe is solved through a dynamic shifting impulse response filter the developed method can compute sewage flow rate flow area and water depth at any location and any time for the entire sewer network the models have high fidelities to the full saint venant equations on solutions and accelerate the computing speed by up to four orders of magnitude the integration of the swift hydraulic models and real time optimisation enables network wide sulfide control through cost effective chemical dosing these hydraulic models could potentially be used for other sewer rtc applications supporting information figs s1 s8 tables s1 and s2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
