6495,among several components of the hydrology cycle streamflow is one of the essential process necessarily needed to be studied the establishment of an accurate and reliable forecasting soft computing model for this process is highly vital for water resource planning and management the influence of the climatological environment on streamflow is central and studying its influence is very significant from the hydrology perspective it has been noticed that the application of machine learning models considerably become predominant in solving and capturing the complexity of hydrological applications this research presents the implementation of a novel hybrid model called multivariate adaptive regression spline integrated with differential evolution mars de to forecast streamflow pattern in semi arid region to achieve this monthly time series streamflow data at baghdad station coordinated at tigris river iraq is inspected for the model validation least square support vector regression lssvr and standalone mars models are conducted to demonstrate the analysis of the undertaken models several statistical indicators are computed to verify the modeling accuracies based on the achieved results the mars de model exhibited an excellent hybrid predictive modeling capability for monthly time scale streamflow in semi arid region quantitatively mars de lssvr and mars models achieved the minimum root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae values of 46 64 35 25 m3 s 57 50 49 20 m3 s and 78 01 62 65 m3 s respectively in conclusion several perspectives are suggested for further studies to enhance the forecasting capability of the model keywords mars de streamflow simulation semi arid environment antecedent values 1 introduction 1 1 streamflow forecasting background streamflow forecasting is one of the challenging problems in the field of hydrological engineering due to its association with several non stationary variability chaotic distribution and non linearity phenomena yaseen et al 2015 with respect to the sophisticated hydrological implementation reliable and robust predictive models are highly needed for real time streamflow forecasting up to date the progress on exploring newly developed intelligent models is the motivation of hydrologist and soft computing developers this is because every watershed is characterized differently and also because of the existence of randomness natural stochasticity and periodicity in streamflow patterns kember et al 1993 tilmant et al 2007 additionally there is no identical model that can be demonstrated as a general model for all the diverse watershed conditions in practice streamflow is characterised by complex phenomena and very challenging to be comprehended perfectly with regard to forecasting the future pattern due to its dynamical non linear and non stationarity behaviour villarini et al 2011 the understanding of the complexity of the streamflow pattern and its phenomenon is highly essential for hydrological processes to achieve an appropriate water resources management several studies have been conducted on streamflow phenomenon simulation over the past three decades the major area of interest has been to comprehend the pattern of the influence of global and regional climatic changes on the hydrology cycle for instance studying the flood and drought trends over a specific region chua and holz 2005 condon et al 2014 das gupta 2008 1 2 literature review based on the existing literature there are two main categories of streamflow modeling methods including i physical based models and ii soft computing models the first category requires a deeper analysis and massive watershed hydrological parameters information such as boundary conditions and several others yaseen et al 2018c whereas the soft computing models presented in the form of artificial intelligence ai models require less efforts and pre knowledge of the watershed characteristic ai models are conceptual based models that use historical information to capture the non linear relationship between the input and output variables maier et al 2014 in addition ai based models involve the inspection of optimal modeling solution identifying the associated variables and validating the final proposed model araghinejad et al 2011 one of the major concerns of ai models is the identification of the appropriate modeling procedure hence at this stage the learning and feature extraction processes from the input data are implemented while the optimal model is approximated by minimizing the training error between the predicted and the target matrix the optimal model is selected from the set of trained models based on an independent validation set which is usually judged by the lowest mean square error various factors that influence real hydrological conditions can affect the approximation accuracy of ai models such factors include the time scale or forecast horizon the input data determination and the configuration of ai models several intelligent models such as fuzzy logic neural network support vector machine and genetic programming models have recently been used for modeling streamflow pattern yaseen et al 2015 this is owing to their feasibility in detecting the non linearity redundancy and dynamic pattern of the time series yaseen et al 2018a additionally these models need no pre knowledge of the studied problem i e hydrology or climatology processes ghorbani et al 2018 however there are many problems with the ai models in terms of their modeling architecture they are required to be in harmony with a learning mechanism to extract the valuable information from the historical data set of the streamflow also ai models require an appropriate modeling procedure for the optimization process which needed to be introduced in order to re adjust the bias and weight usually encountered in the model structure keshtegar et al 2016 labat 2005 above all the ai models need numerous trial and error processes during the estimation of several parameters such as the number of hidden layers the type of the transfer function and the number of neurons in the hidden layers during the training phase in order to achieve an optimal architecture 1 3 research inspiration the enthusiasm of the hydrologists is always to address the end results of the rainfall water with a particular watershed various research efforts have been devoted to this matter where watershed management is highly significant nowadays tongal and booij 2018 the main challenge with the quantification of streamflow is the interaction of several hydrological components with this regard such as groundwater seepage evaporation evapotranspiration sub water flow and many other water losses owing to the forgoing hydrological and climatological processes streamflow pattern is characterised by high non linearity non stationarity and random distribution hence the probability of achieving an accurate streamflow forecasting model is highly challenging due to the existing high stochasticity problem with this regard hydrologists have been focusing on the elucidation of the hydrological processes for these components based on the theory of developing hydrological mathematical models based on the established state of the art research hydrological mathematical models are grouped into mechanistic models and data driven or machine learning models yaseen et al 2016a b the significance of streamflow forecasting can be beneficial for multiple purposes in water resources engineering diop et al 2018 ghorbani et al 2018 yaseen et al 2018b in more descriptive manners accurate long term streamflow forecasting monthly or yearly is very necessary for the planning and operation of water storage river sediment transport agricultural and irrigation usage and others on the other hand an accurate short term streamflow real time forecast such as hourly or daily is important in the areas affected by flooding for flood prediction purposes kagoda et al 2010 kisi 2010 shiri and kisi 2010 however forecasting of this nature is a valuable tool in the provision of advanced warnings of likely flooding to minimize and mitigate their effects on infrastructure and human health recently there have been new explorations for reliable machine learning models keshtegar et al 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2017 yaseen et al 2016a b multivariate adaptive regression spline model has demonstrated its capability in solving regression engineering problems kayadelen et al 1992 tong et al 2016 wang et al 2015 zhang and goh 2016 zhou and leung 2007 the main advantage of mars model as a non parametric regression procedure is its potential to solve non linear problems and their variables interaction lall et al 1996 sephton 2001 the viability of the mars model demonstrated a massive progress in the field of hydrology especially in the areas of drought prediction deo et al 2017 air quality modeling garcía nieto and álvarez antón 2014 pan evaporation prediction kisi 2015 river water pollution kisi and parmar 2016 susceptibility to earth flow landslide modeling conoscenti et al 2015 ground water level forecasting rezaie balf et al 2017 soil cation exchange capacity estimation emamgolizadeh et al 2015 dissolved oxygen concentration prediction heddam and kisi 2018 and longitudinal dispersion coefficient prediction haghiabi 2016 the construction of mars model requires internal parameters optimization as a robust machine learning model hybrid models have shown a remarkable predictability feasibility the current study is devoted to the integration of mars model with a new nature inspired algorithm called differential evolution de the de algorithm was used to optimize the internal parameters as a hyperparameters tuning tool during the training stage the de is one of the well developed meta heuristic algorithms that is based on evolutionary global method piotrowski and napiorkowski 2011 it was derived from the genetic algorithms ga and essentially used to solve multi dimensional optimization problems that involve continuous variables hence to our knowledge mars de is proposed in this study as a hybrid predictive model for streamflow forecasting in semi arid region 1 4 research objectives the application of hybridized multivariate adaptive regression spline model with differential evolution algorithm is examined to forecast streamflow in semi arid region at baghdad meteorological station tigris river iraq the capability of the proposed model is validated against one of the popular regression models i e lssvr model in addition to standalone mars model and couple models established over the literature on the same case study various input combinations are constructed to build the predictive models based on the correlated previous months streamflow the results achieved are comprehensively discussed and comparatively analysed the rest of this article was structured as follows section 2 covered the case study description and data collection while section 3 covered the methodological overview section 4 reported the application and analysis of the findings while section 5 presented the conclusion drawn from the study 2 case study and data description tigris river is considered as one of the largest rivers in the middle eastern region with a total length of approximately 1718 km tigris river also called nahar degla flows from its source in turkey then to iraq and about 85 of the total basin area 253 000 km resides in the iraqi region macklin and lewin 2015 see fig 1 tigris river and euphrates river provide the main source of fresh water for all the cities from the northern to the southern part of the region the water usage is for many purposes such as domestic usage agriculture irrigation and industrial consumption the interesting part of this region particularly in the capital city of baghdad is that it has a massive population growth and technological industrial developments hence to satisfy these critical elements an accurate vision of the magnitude of the streamflow is highly essential the climate of this river is semi arid it has been reported by several scientific studies that the mean rainfall of the area is approximately 216 mm with seasonal characteristics december to february yaseen et al 2018a the mean monthly streamflow of tigris river at the investigated meteorological station is 411 35 m3 s and the standard deviation is 234 52 m3 s the weather temperature varies between summer and winter during the summer period the temperature might exceed 45 c but may drop to below 10 c during the winter period the current research is established using 20 years 1991 2010 monthly scale streamflow see fig 2 the statistical characteristics of the complete training 90 and testing 10 are tabulated in table 1 3 methodology overview in this section the frameworks of the multivariate adaptive regression spline mars the differential evolution de algorithm the hybridized mars de and the benchmark model lssvr was explained mathematically 3 1 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars model mars model is one of the well established recent models for module regression and classification engineering applications friedman 1991 as the main problem solved in this research is regression a detailed methodological explanation is presented here the main goal of the mars model to solve regression problem and to estimate the continuous variable defined as y n x 1 based on a set of variables x n x p here the defined regression model consisted of a linear function f x and a magnitude of error e the formula is expressed as follows 1 y f x e the mars model is a mathematical model whose internal function is based on the piecewise polynomials of degree called the basis function t or splines the internal connections are fitted over different intervals of the input attributes the intervals are bounded by knots k the mars spline function can be defined as friedman and roosen 1995a b 2 x k q k x q ifx k 0 otherwise 3 x k q k x q ifx k 0 otherwise where q 0 is the power that determines the degree of the polynomial piece wise function if q 1 then the splines are linear as in this study if y is to be estimated with m basis functions the mars model would be 4 y f m x c 0 m 1 m c m b m x where y is the forecasted outcome given by this model c 0 is the intercept b m x is the m th basis function and c m is the corresponding coefficient during the training procedure the model both variables and the node position are optimized for instance consider a given dataset x with n samples and p independent variables then n n p pairs of spline basis functions where x ij i 1 2 n and j 1 2 p are the node locations at the first stage the mars model is constructed in the forward process two pairs of the basis functions are embedded to the first step of the forward process friedman 1991 friedman and roosen 1995a b the model is usually trapped with overfitting and its capability in solving regression process is limited hence the model must be pruned to enhance its forecasting accuracy and this is usually done by the backward process using the generalized cross validation gcv parameter wang et al 2010 the mathematical form of the gcv can be expressed as 5 g c v m 1 n i 0 n y i f m x i 2 1 c m n 2 where c m is the parameter that penalizes complexity and increases its value with the number of basis functions which can be obtained through friedman and roosen 1995a b sekulic and kowalski 1992 6 c m m 1 d m where m is the number of basis functions present in formula 4 and d is the penalty factor once the modeling procedure has been initiated it is possible to launch the correlated attributes of the input variables that should be used in the basis functions not all the input variables will end up in the final model based on different criteria such as the number of subsets where a variable appears the increment of gcv or the residual sum of squares rss when the variable is removed from the model cheng and cao 2014a b zhang et al 2015 3 2 optimization algorithm differential evolution de in the field of optimization the de algorithm is one of the robust bio nature inspired algorithms zafar et al 2017 whose major concept depends on the optimization of the optimal solution based on the iterative mechanism where the optimum candidate is selected zhang et al 2012 the main advantage of the de algorithm is that there is no requirement for any optimization function to deliver the best solution however the algorithm tunes any assigned problem by sustaining a population of candidate solutions and initiating new candidate solutions in parallel to the existing ones the best fitness criteria is the deterministic function for the optimum population candidates mandal et al 2011 the main concept of the de algorithm is based on assuming that the optimized variables are encoded vectors the span of the vectors n is equivalent to the attribute variables of the prediction problem the population is decomposed into number of parents np a vector x p g is defined p 1 np as the index of the individual population and the corresponding generation g the defined problem x p m g contains the composed vectors here m is the individual index variable the domain of the problem variables is subjected to x m min and x m max the mechanism of the de algorithm is performed through four stages including azimi et al 2017 i initialization the first generation i e population is initialized randomly by considering the minimum and maximum magnitude variables ii mutation the construction of the number partners random vector noise is performed in this stage iii recombination the recombination is randomly generated after the number partner is computed and the results validate with x p g iv selection the final stage is to compare the test vector with the original ones the best value is achieved through the fitness function the algorithm of the proposed mars de model is presented in the following sub section 3 3 the hybridized mars de model in this paper a hybrid forecasting model based on multivariate adaptive regression spline mars differential evolution de was proposed the main motivation of integrating the de algorithm to mars is to determine the optimal values of the hyper parameters of the mars model these hyper parameters have an essential influence on the mars models performance cheng and cao 2014a b and these parameters are i the maximum number of basis function maxfun ii the penalty parameter d smooth parameter and iii the maximum interaction between variable imax the are several optimization methods used to compute the optimal hyper parameters including random search nelder mead search grid search heuristic search genetic algorithms pattern search and several others al musaylh et al 2018 chou et al 2004 crino and brown 2007 friedman and roosen 1995a b garcía nieto and álvarez antón 2014 zhang and goh 2016 in the current study a robust bio inspired nature optimization algorithm based on the differential evolution concept hybridized with mars model was used for the internal parameters tuning the proposed mars de was used to forecast one month ahead streamflow value based on several correlated lag times determined based on the correlation statistics the determination coefficient was used to determine the optimization process the flowchart of the proposed mars de model was demonstrated in fig 3 the determination coefficient is the statistical metric used to evaluate the regression curve that approximates the actual observations data in addition it is a descriptive metric ranged between 0 1 where the optimal scoring is 1 representing an accurate prediction cross validation is the standard technique used here to find the real coefficient of determination r2 for the analysed dataset the main steps of the proposed mars de model were given as follows step 1 the original dataset is normalized between 0 1 to harmonize the scale of the data and avoid the large numeric range the normalization function is given as follows 7 x i n x i x min x max x min where x i is the input value x min is the minimum value x max is the maximum value and x i n is the normalized value of the dataset step 2 define the fitness function as the mean absolute percentage error mape which is established as 8 mape i 1 n sf o sf f sf o n where sf o is the actual value at period t sf f is the predicted value at period t and n is the number of periods used in the calculation step 3 initialize the values of the parameters m max i max d of mars randomly based on a uniform distribution as given in eq 9 the initial values of these parameters are generated in the predefined ranges the upper bound and lower bound based on the case study are as follows m max in the rage 3 100 i max in range 1 4 d in range 1 4 9 x ij u b l b r a n d l b therefore the representation of each solution consists of three main components as given in fig 4 step 4 execute the mutation operator for each individual x the standard de algorithm generates a corresponding mutated individual which is expressed by the following equation 10 v i g 1 x r 1 g f x r 2 g x r 3 g where x r 1 x r 2 and x r 3 are generated randomly none of these individuals is identical to the objective generated serial number i hence the population size is greater than the four individuals f represents the scaling factor that governs the mutation degree and within the range of 0 2 as reported in the literature step 5 execute the crossover operator and generate an experimental individual as follows 11 u ij g 1 f x v ij g 1 i f r j c r o r j r n i x ij g otherwise where r j represents a randomly generated number in the range 0 1 and j denotes the j th gene of an individual cr represents the crossover rate which is in the range 0 1 and determined by the user the gene index rn i is generated randomly in the range 1 d and applied to ensure that at least one dimension of the experimental individual is from the mutated individual the global search of the proposed algorithm is enhanced when the value of cr gets smaller step 6 perform the selection operator each objective individual x i g must compete with its associated experimental individual u i g 1 which is generated after the crossover and mutation operations when the experimental individual u i g 1 has a better fitness value than the objective individual x i g u i g 1 will become the offspring otherwise x i g will automatically become the offspring using the minimum problem as a case study the selection method is represented in eq 12 where f is the fitness function 12 x i g 1 u i g 1 i f f u i g 1 f x i g x i g otherwise step 7 the proposed mars de is stopped when the stop criterion is met if the stop criterion is not met the model will proceed to the next generation the number of function evaluation nfe is used to stop the de while searching for the optimal parameters of mars 3 4 least square support vector regression lssvr model due to the advancement of the machine learning model there have been several model improvements and lssvr model is one of the newly extended versions suykens and vandewalle 1999 lssvr is the newly modified version of support vector regression svr that was originally developed by vapnik 1995 lssvr model was selected as a benchmark model due to its potential for solving several hydrological processes deo et al 2016 deo and samui 2017 kumar et al 2016 mouatadid et al 2018 it has been acknowledged that the main drawback of the svr model is the convergence learning process which has been solved by the lssvr model through eliminating the quadratic programming solution issue this improvement could exclude several limitations such as overfitting problem and trapping in the local minima further it may produce a stable solution to crack the quadratic programming problems ji et al 2014 xie et al 2013 3 5 input variables modeling procedure the applied forecasting models were constructed based on the correlated lag times of previous months to forecast one month ahead in the present research the auto correlation function and its partial statistics were computed see fig 5 it can be noticed that the correlated antecedent streamflow values were up to five months hence five input combinations were constructed based on the lags of the previous months the input combinations were presented as follows 13 m 1 sf t sf t 1 14 m 2 sf t sf t 1 sf t 2 15 m 3 sf t sf t 1 sf t 2 sf t 3 16 m 4 sf t sf t 1 sf t 2 sf t 3 sf t 4 17 m 5 sf t sf t 1 sf t 2 sf t 3 sf t 4 sf t 5 where sf t denotes the current forecasted value of streamflow sf t 1 sf t 2 sf t 3 sf t 4 a n d sf t 5 are the lag times of the previous months up to five months the current research was designed based on 20 years of monthly scale streamflow data 1991 2010 ten percent 10 of the dataset 2009 2010 was used for the model validation testing phase whereas the rest of the data was used for the training phase 3 6 forecasting skill performance indicators various statistical performance indicators were computed including mean absolute percentage error mape scatter index si root mean square error rmse root mean square relative error rmsre mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre bias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative error re tao et al 2018 the mathematical expressions can be described as follows 18 si i 1 n s f o s f f 2 n s f o 19 mape 100 1 n i 1 n sf o sf f sf o 20 rmse i 1 n s f o s f f 2 n 21 rmsre 1 n i 1 n sf o sf f sf o 2 22 mre 1 n

sf o and sf f are the actual and forecasted streamflow values and sf o is the mean value of the actual streamflow 4 application results and analysis the effectiveness of the proposed mars de and the comparable lssvr models was inspected on real historical streamflow sourced from an official organization authorized for monitoring such streamflows at baghdad station located on tigris river this section provides a comprehensive detail of the applied predictive model predictability in forecasting one step ahead streamflow it is worth stating that the applied dataset is continuous and does not experience any missing monitoring events data during the period under study in this section the robustness of the models was evaluated and assessed using multiple statistical indicators such as absolute error measurements and best fit goodness e g si mape rmse mae rmsre mre bias and nse based on tables 2 and 3 five input combinations and their forecasting skills were reported based on the antecedent streamflow records according to table 2 two months lead time performed the best prediction matrix it can be observed that this is the case for the proposed model and the comparable model in quantitative terms mars de model achieved the best performance indicators rmse 46 64 m3 s mae 35 25 m3 s and nse 0 89 while lssvr model performed the best modeling forecasting rmse 57 50 m3 s mae 49 20 m3 s and nse 0 83 see tables 2 and 3 both models achieved good forecasting performances based on the statistical research established by moriasi et al 2007 however the sophistication of the advanced level of accuracy is always the motivation based on the tabulated results three months lead time and onward up to five month lead time demonstrated low forecasting skills this can best be explained by the decrease in the correlated lead time of the streamflow as clearly illustrated in fig 5 note the established forecasting procedure is based on univariate modeling in which only streamflow information is used to build the proposed predictive model practically this is more challenging for the watersheds lack of meteorological data figs 6 and 7 displayed the variance between the actual and forecasted i e mars de and lssvr streamflow pattern presented in the form of scatter plots over the testing phase for each designed input combination the scatter plots indicated the least square regression formula y a x b and the coefficient of determination between the actual and forecasted values based on the graphical presentation m2 input combination showed an ideal variation around the best fit line mars de achieved a maximum r2 0 90 whereas lssvr model achieved the best r2 0 83 by comparing the investigated models mars de and lssvr with a detailed comprehensive analysis the computation of the relative error re indicator using eq 26 was examined during the testing period for the best input combination the results of the two models are illustrated in fig 8 for each single observation over the testing phase in general the performance of mars de model demonstrated less percentage error and limited between 14 and 18 whereas the performance of the lssvr model demonstrated a slightly higher re 22 and 15 it can be concluded that the residual error for the testing phase was improved when using the proposed mars de model compared to the lssvr model some observations were also observed to be common to both models with a high percentage of error this could be due to the sudden increment in the streamflow due to occasionally heavy rainfall events or other source of water flow through the upstream attributes descriptively the interception between several statistical indicators including the correlation standard deviation and root mean square was generated in the form of a taylor diagram fig 9 showed the taylor diagram visualization over the testing phase of the proposed mars de and the comparable forecasting model mars de demonstrated the closest coordinate using m2 input combination to the actual streamflow benchmark value the test modeling phase presented a far distance between mars de model and the actual data point indeed this is normal due to the lower magnitude achieved for the rmse and the highest correlation coefficient as depicted in the scatter plot presentation 5 mars de modeling validation the authors also observed that the proposed hybrid mars de forecasting model can provide an accurate outcome for the investigated case study it is worth to validate the current modeling performance with the standalone mars model and the literature studies performed on the same case study table 4 reported the statistical performance of the standalone mars model the best input combination for the streamflow forecasting was m1 incorporating one month lead time this is on the contrary with the mars de and lssvr models where the optimal input combination was two month lead time indeed this is best can be explained due to the fact machine learning based forecasting models behave differently from one case to another in accordance to complexity of the simulated problem the forecasting was attained with minimum absolute error measures rmse 78 01 m3 s and mae 62 65 m3 s this is evidencing a remarkable predictability performance augmentation through the integration of the differential evolution evolutionary optimization algorithm with mars model with respect to the validation against the literature zaher and his co authors developed an extreme learning machine elm classical support vector regression svr and generalized regression neural network grnn for streamflow forecasting of the same case study using 80 20 training and testing division yaseen et al 2016a b elm exhibited the best predictability potential over svr and grnn models nevertheless mars de model of the present study produced an enhanced forecasting accuracy 51 1 57 9 through the rmse and mae indicators over elm model respectively the high level of accuracy enhancement could be explained through the increment in the training dataset where the current study was established using 90 of the historical data in addition the integration of the nature inspired algorithm as hyperparameters tuning algorithm for mars model could contribute to this enhanced prediction accuracy 6 modeling assessment and possible future research deceptively the obtained modeling results evidenced the shortcoming of the length of the dataset span implemented in the current study in general the length of data used 20 years monthly basis has a considerable effect on the accuracy of the overall performance hence it is highly recommended to put more efforts in the future research on incorporating longer dataset span where more streamflow patterns can be included in the training phase this is due to the fact that the training stage should experience the majority of the streamflow patterns to allow the models in the testing session to forecast with an acceptable level of accuracy in this context it seems that 20 years streamflow is not perfectly sufficient and this can affect the level of the forecasting accuracy furthermore it might be essential to incorporate other casual hydrological variables as external attributes for the streamflow simulation the main intuition is that weather conditions mainly rainfalls are the main influencer of streamflow patterns thus there could be an enhancement in forecasting procedure if other related climate variables are associated with historical datasets of streamflow to develop a good and successful prediction model adding climatological information such as rainfall temperature or even humidity as an input attribute might enhance the learning mechanism and a better performing forecasting model can be achieved on other aspect monthly scale streamflow pattern is associated with seasonality trend and thus eliminating or incorporating those trends might beneficial proposition to give an informative knowledge for the intelligence predictive models 7 conclusion the current study explored a newly developed machine learning predictive model called mars de for monthly streamflow forecasting in semi arid environments at baghdad meteorological station tigris river the historical data of the streamflow over 20 years was obtained for the model construction the architecture of the proposed model was established based on several antecedent values of streamflow patterns among several machine learning introduced in the literature support vector machine model showed as a reliable model for forecasting streamflow and thus was selected for the model authentication lssvr model was developed using the same input combinations the results of the performed models were examined using several statistical indicators and graphical presentation prediction skill metrics in general the results demonstrated the potential of the developed mars de model for monthly streamflow forecasting in semi arid environments with a remarkable forecasting accuracy based on the statistical metrics rmse and mae mars de model improved the streamflow predictability by 18 8 28 3 and 40 2 43 7 over lssvr and standalone mars models as a future research proposition the forecasting possibility can be enhanced through the incorporation of some related climate parameters such as rainfall humidity and temperature to provide more information on the streamflow phenomenon declaration of interest the authors state that there is no conflict of interest in publishing the current

6495,among several components of the hydrology cycle streamflow is one of the essential process necessarily needed to be studied the establishment of an accurate and reliable forecasting soft computing model for this process is highly vital for water resource planning and management the influence of the climatological environment on streamflow is central and studying its influence is very significant from the hydrology perspective it has been noticed that the application of machine learning models considerably become predominant in solving and capturing the complexity of hydrological applications this research presents the implementation of a novel hybrid model called multivariate adaptive regression spline integrated with differential evolution mars de to forecast streamflow

suggested for further studies to enhance the forecasting capability of the model keywords mars de streamflow simulation semi arid environment antecedent values 1 introduction 1 1 streamflow forecasting background streamflow forecasting is one of the challenging problems in the field of hydrological engineering due to its association with several non stationary variability chaotic distribution and non linearity phenomena yaseen et al 2015 with respect to the sophisticated hydrological implementation reliable and robust predictive models are highly needed for real time streamflow forecasting up to date the progress on exploring newly developed intelligent models is the motivation of hydrologist and soft computing developers this is because every watershed is characterized differently and also because of the existence of randomness natural stochasticity and periodicity in streamflow patterns kember et al 1993 tilmant et al 2007 additionally there is no identical model that can be demonstrated as a general model for all the diverse watershed conditions in practice streamflow is characterised by complex phenomena and very challenging to be comprehended perfectly with regard to forecasting the future pattern due to its dynamical non linear and non stationarity behaviour villarini et al 2011 the understanding of the complexity of the streamflow pattern and its phenomenon is highly essential for hydrological processes to achieve an appropriate water resources management several studies have been conducted on streamflow phenomenon simulation over the past three decades the major area of interest has been to comprehend the pattern of the influence of global and regional climatic changes on the hydrology cycle for instance studying the flood and drought trends over a specific region chua and holz 2005 condon et al 2014 das gupta 2008 1 2 literature review based on the existing literature there are two main categories of streamflow modeling methods including i physical based models and ii soft computing models the first category requires a deeper analysis and massive watershed hydrological parameters information such as boundary conditions and several others yaseen et al 2018c whereas the soft computing models presented in the form of artificial intelligence ai models require less efforts and pre knowledge of the watershed characteristic ai models are conceptual based models that use historical information to capture the non linear relationship between the input and output variables maier et al 2014 in addition ai based models involve the inspection of optimal modeling solution identifying the associated variables and validating the final proposed model araghinejad et al 2011 one of the major concerns of ai models is the identification of the appropriate modeling procedure hence at this stage the learning and feature extraction processes from the input data are implemented while the optimal model is approximated by minimizing the training error between the predicted and the target matrix the optimal model is selected from the set of trained models based on an independent validation set which is usually judged by the lowest mean square error various factors that influence real hydrological conditions can affect the approximation accuracy of ai models such factors include the time scale or forecast horizon the input data determination and the configuration of ai models several intelligent models such as fuzzy logic neural network support vector machine and genetic programming models have recently been used for modeling streamflow pattern yaseen et al 2015 this is owing to their feasibility in detecting the non linearity redundancy and dynamic pattern of the time series yaseen et al 2018a additionally these models need no pre knowledge of the studied problem i e hydrology or climatology processes ghorbani et al 2018 however there are many problems with the ai models in terms of their modeling architecture they are required to be in harmony with a learning mechanism to extract the valuable information from the historical data set of the streamflow also ai models require an appropriate modeling procedure for the optimization process which needed to be introduced in order to re adjust the bias and weight usually encountered in the model structure keshtegar et al 2016 labat 2005 above all the ai models need numerous trial and error processes during the estimation of several parameters such as the number of hidden layers the type of the transfer function and the number of neurons in the hidden layers during the training phase in order to achieve an optimal architecture 1 3 research inspiration the enthusiasm of the hydrologists is always to address the end results of the rainfall water with a particular watershed various research efforts have been devoted to this matter where watershed management is highly significant nowadays tongal and booij 2018 the main challenge with the quantification of streamflow is the interaction of several hydrological components with this regard such as groundwater seepage evaporation evapotranspiration sub water flow and many other water losses owing to the forgoing hydrological and climatological processes streamflow pattern is characterised by high non linearity non stationarity and random distribution hence the probability of achieving an accurate streamflow forecasting model is highly challenging due to the existing high stochasticity problem with this regard hydrologists have been focusing on the elucidation of the hydrological processes for these components based on the theory of developing hydrological mathematical models based on the established state of the art research hydrological mathematical models are grouped into mechanistic models and data driven or machine learning models yaseen et al 2016a b the significance of streamflow forecasting can be beneficial for multiple purposes in water resources engineering diop et al 2018 ghorbani et al 2018 yaseen et al 2018b in more descriptive manners accurate long term streamflow forecasting monthly or yearly is very necessary for the planning and operation of water storage river sediment transport agricultural and irrigation usage and others on the other hand an accurate short term streamflow real time forecast such as hourly or daily is important in the areas affected by flooding for flood prediction purposes kagoda et al 2010 kisi 2010 shiri and kisi 2010 however forecasting of this nature is a valuable tool in the provision of advanced warnings of likely flooding to minimize and mitigate their effects on infrastructure and human health recently there have been new explorations for reliable machine learning models keshtegar et al 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2017 yaseen et al 2016a b multivariate adaptive regression spline model has demonstrated its capability in solving regression engineering problems kayadelen et al 1992 tong et al 2016 wang et al 2015 zhang and goh 2016 zhou and leung 2007 the main advantage of mars model as a non parametric regression procedure is its potential to solve non linear problems and their variables interaction lall et al 1996 sephton 2001 the viability of the mars model demonstrated a massive progress in the field of hydrology especially in the areas of drought prediction deo et al 2017 air quality modeling garcía nieto and álvarez antón 2014 pan evaporation prediction kisi 2015 river water pollution kisi and parmar 2016 susceptibility to earth flow landslide modeling conoscenti et al 2015 ground water level forecasting rezaie balf et al 2017 soil cation exchange capacity estimation emamgolizadeh et al 2015 dissolved oxygen concentration prediction heddam and kisi 2018 and longitudinal dispersion coefficient prediction haghiabi 2016 the construction of mars model requires internal parameters optimization as a robust machine learning model hybrid models have shown a remarkable predictability feasibility the current study is devoted to the integration of mars model with a new nature inspired algorithm called differential evolution de the de algorithm was used to optimize the internal parameters as a hyperparameters tuning tool during the training stage the de is one of the well developed meta heuristic algorithms that is based on evolutionary global method piotrowski and napiorkowski 2011 it was derived from the genetic algorithms ga and essentially used to solve multi dimensional optimization problems that involve continuous variables hence to our knowledge mars de is proposed in this study as a hybrid predictive model for streamflow forecasting in semi arid region 1 4 research objectives the application of hybridized multivariate adaptive regression spline model with differential evolution algorithm is examined to forecast streamflow in semi arid region at baghdad meteorological station tigris river iraq the capability of the proposed model is validated against one of the popular regression models i e lssvr model in addition to standalone mars model and couple models established over the literature on the same case study various input combinations are constructed to build the predictive models based on the correlated previous months streamflow the results achieved are comprehensively discussed and comparatively analysed the rest of this article was structured as follows section 2 covered the case study description and data collection while section 3 covered the methodological overview section 4 reported the application and analysis of the findings while section 5 presented the conclusion drawn from the study 2 case study and data description tigris river is considered as one of the largest rivers in the middle eastern region with a total length of approximately 1718 km tigris river also called nahar degla flows from its source in turkey then to iraq and about 85 of the total basin area 253 000 km resides in the iraqi region macklin and lewin 2015 see fig 1 tigris river and euphrates river provide the main source of fresh water for all the cities from the northern to the southern part of the region the water usage is for many purposes such as domestic usage agriculture irrigation and industrial consumption the interesting part of this region particularly in the capital city of baghdad is that it has a massive population growth and technological industrial developments hence to satisfy these critical elements an accurate vision of the magnitude of the streamflow is highly essential the climate of this river is semi arid it has been reported by several scientific studies that the mean rainfall of the area is approximately 216 mm with seasonal characteristics december to february yaseen et al 2018a the mean monthly streamflow of tigris river at the investigated meteorological station is 411 35 m3 s and the standard deviation is 234 52 m3 s the weather temperature varies between summer and winter during the summer period the temperature might exceed 45 c but may drop to below 10 c during the winter period the current research is established using 20 years 1991 2010 monthly scale streamflow see fig 2 the statistical characteristics of the complete training 90 and testing 10 are tabulated in table 1 3 methodology overview in this section the frameworks of the multivariate adaptive regression spline mars the differential evolution de algorithm the hybridized mars de and the benchmark model lssvr was explained mathematically 3 1 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars model mars model is one of the well established recent models for module regression and classification engineering applications friedman 1991 as the main problem solved in this research is regression a detailed methodological explanation is presented here the main goal of the mars model to solve regression problem and to estimate the continuous variable defined as y n x 1 based on a set of variables x n x p here the defined regression model consisted of a linear function f x and a magnitude of error e the formula is expressed as follows 1 y f x e the mars model is a mathematical model whose internal function is based on the piecewise polynomials of degree called the basis function t or splines the internal connections are fitted over different intervals of the input attributes the intervals are bounded by knots k the mars spline function can be defined as friedman and roosen 1995a b 2 x k q k x q ifx k 0 otherwise 3 x k q k x q ifx k 0 otherwise where q 0 is the power that determines the degree of the polynomial piece wise function if q 1 then the splines are linear as in this study if y is to be estimated with m basis functions the mars model would be 4 y f m x c 0 m 1 m c m b m x where y is the forecasted outcome given by this model c 0 is the intercept b m x is the m th basis function and c m is the corresponding coefficient during the training procedure the model both variables and the node position are optimized for instance consider a given dataset x with n samples and p independent variables then n n p pairs of spline basis functions where x ij i 1 2 n and j 1 2 p are the node locations at the first stage the mars model is constructed in the forward process two pairs of the basis functions are embedded to the first step of the forward process friedman 1991 friedman and roosen 1995a b the model is usually trapped with overfitting and its capability in solving regression process is limited hence the model must be pruned to enhance its forecasting accuracy and this is usually done by the backward process using the generalized cross validation gcv parameter wang et al 2010 the mathematical form of the gcv can be expressed as 5 g c v m 1 n i 0 n y i f m x i 2 1 c m n 2 where c m is the parameter that penalizes complexity and increases its value with the number of basis functions which can be obtained through friedman and roosen 1995a b sekulic and kowalski 1992 6 c m m 1 d m where m is the number of basis functions present in formula 4 and d is the penalty factor once the modeling procedure has been initiated it is possible to launch the correlated attributes of the input variables that should be used in the basis functions not all the input variables will end up in the final model based on different criteria such as the number of subsets where a variable appears the increment of gcv or the residual sum of squares rss when the variable is removed from the model cheng and cao 2014a b zhang et al 2015 3 2 optimization algorithm differential evolution de in the field of optimization the de algorithm is one of the robust bio nature inspired algorithms zafar et al 2017 whose major concept depends on the optimization of the optimal solution based on the iterative mechanism where the optimum candidate is selected zhang et al 2012 the main advantage of the de algorithm is that there is no requirement for any optimization function to deliver the best solution however the algorithm tunes any assigned problem by sustaining a population of candidate solutions and initiating new candidate solutions in parallel to the existing ones the best fitness criteria is the deterministic function for the optimum population candidates mandal et al 2011 the main concept of the de algorithm is based on assuming that the optimized variables are encoded vectors the span of the vectors n is equivalent to the attribute variables of the prediction problem the population is decomposed into number of parents np a vector x p g is defined p 1 np as the index of the individual population and the corresponding generation g the defined problem x p m g contains the composed vectors here m is the individual index variable the domain of the problem variables is subjected to x m min and x m max the mechanism of the de algorithm is performed through four stages including azimi et al 2017 i initialization the first generation i e population is initialized randomly by considering the minimum and maximum magnitude variables ii mutation the construction of the number partners random vector noise is performed in this stage iii recombination the recombination is randomly generated after the number partner is computed and the results validate with x p g iv selection the final stage is to compare the test vector with the original ones the best value is achieved through the fitness function the algorithm of the proposed mars de model is presented in the following sub section 3 3 the hybridized mars de model in this paper a hybrid forecasting model based on multivariate adaptive regression spline mars differential evolution de was proposed the main motivation of integrating the de algorithm to mars is to determine the optimal values of the hyper parameters of the mars model these hyper parameters have an essential influence on the mars models performance cheng and cao 2014a b and these parameters are i the maximum number of basis function maxfun ii the penalty parameter d smooth parameter and iii the maximum interaction between variable imax the are several optimization methods used to compute the optimal hyper parameters including random search nelder mead search grid search heuristic search genetic algorithms pattern search and several others al musaylh et al 2018 chou et al 2004 crino and brown 2007 friedman and roosen 1995a b garcía nieto and álvarez antón 2014 zhang and goh 2016 in the current study a robust bio inspired nature optimization algorithm based on the differential evolution concept hybridized with mars model was used for the internal parameters tuning the proposed mars de was used to forecast one month ahead streamflow value based on several correlated lag times determined based on the correlation statistics the determination coefficient was used to determine the optimization process the flowchart of the proposed mars de model was demonstrated in fig 3 the determination coefficient is the statistical metric used to evaluate the regression curve that approximates the actual observations data in addition it is a descriptive metric ranged between 0 1 where the optimal scoring is 1 representing an accurate prediction cross validation is the standard technique used here to find the real coefficient of determination r2 for the analysed dataset the main steps of the proposed mars de model were given as follows step 1 the original dataset is normalized between 0 1 to harmonize the scale of the data and avoid the large numeric range the normalization function is given as follows 7 x i n x i x min x max x min where x i is the input value x min is the minimum value x max is the maximum value and x i n is the normalized value of the dataset step 2 define the fitness function as the mean absolute percentage error mape which is established as 8 mape i 1 n sf o sf f sf o n where sf o is the actual value at period t sf f is the predicted value at period t and n is the number of periods used in the calculation step 3 initialize the values of the parameters m max i max d of mars randomly based on a uniform distribution as given in eq 9 the initial values of these parameters are generated in the predefined ranges the upper bound and lower bound based on the case study are as follows m max in the rage 3 100 i max in range 1 4 d in range 1 4 9 x ij u b l b r a n d l b therefore the representation of each solution consists of three main components as given in fig 4 step 4 execute the mutation operator for each individual x the standard de algorithm generates a corresponding mutated individual which is expressed by the following equation 10 v i g 1 x r 1 g f x r 2 g x r 3 g where x r 1 x r 2 and x r 3 are generated randomly none of these individuals is identical to the objective generated serial number i hence the population size is greater than the four individuals f represents the scaling factor that governs the mutation degree and within the range of 0 2 as reported in the literature step 5 execute the crossover operator and generate an experimental individual as follows 11 u ij g 1 f x v ij g 1 i f r j c r o r j r n i x ij g otherwise where r j represents a randomly generated number in the range 0 1 and j denotes the j th gene of an individual cr represents the crossover rate which is in the range 0 1 and determined by the user the gene index rn i is generated randomly in the range 1 d and applied to ensure that at least one dimension of the experimental individual is from the mutated individual the global search of the proposed algorithm is enhanced when the value of cr gets smaller step 6 perform the selection operator each objective individual x i g must compete with its associated experimental individual u i g 1 which is generated after the crossover and mutation operations when the experimental individual u i g 1 has a better fitness value than the objective individual x i g u i g 1 will become the offspring otherwise x i g will automatically become the offspring using the minimum problem as a case study the selection method is represented in eq 12 where f is the fitness function 12 x i g 1 u i g 1 i f f u i g 1 f x i g x i g otherwise step 7 the proposed mars de is stopped when the stop criterion is met if the stop criterion is not met the model will proceed to the next generation the number of function evaluation nfe is used to stop the de while searching for the optimal parameters of mars 3 4 least square support vector regression lssvr model due to the advancement of the machine learning model there have been several model improvements and lssvr model is one of the newly extended versions suykens and vandewalle 1999 lssvr is the newly modified version of support vector regression svr that was originally developed by vapnik 1995 lssvr model was selected as a benchmark model due to its potential for solving several hydrological processes deo et al 2016 deo and samui 2017 kumar et al 2016 mouatadid et al 2018 it has been acknowledged that the main drawback of the svr model is the convergence learning process which has been solved by the lssvr model through eliminating the quadratic programming solution issue this improvement could exclude several limitations such as overfitting problem and trapping in the local minima further it may produce a stable solution to crack the quadratic programming problems ji et al 2014 xie et al 2013 3 5 input variables modeling procedure the applied forecasting models were constructed based on the correlated lag times of previous months to forecast one month ahead in the present research the auto correlation function and its partial statistics were computed see fig 5 it can be noticed that the correlated antecedent streamflow values were up to five months hence five input combinations were constructed based on the lags of the previous months the input combinations were presented as follows 13 m 1 sf t sf t 1 14 m 2 sf t sf t 1 sf t 2 15 m 3 sf t sf t 1 sf t 2 sf t 3 16 m 4 sf t sf t 1 sf t 2 sf t 3 sf t 4 17 m 5 sf t sf t 1 sf t 2 sf t 3 sf t 4 sf t 5 where sf t denotes the current forecasted value of streamflow sf t 1 sf t 2 sf t 3 sf t 4 a n d sf t 5 are the lag times of the previous months up to five months the current research was designed based on 20 years of monthly scale streamflow data 1991 2010 ten percent 10 of the dataset 2009 2010 was used for the model validation testing phase whereas the rest of the data was used for the training phase 3 6 forecasting skill performance indicators various statistical performance indicators were computed including mean absolute percentage error mape scatter index si root mean square error rmse root mean square relative error rmsre mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre bias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative error re tao et al 2018 the mathematical expressions can be described as follows 18 si i 1 n s f o s f f 2 n s f o 19 mape 100 1 n i 1 n sf o sf f sf o 20 rmse i 1 n s f o s f f 2 n 21 rmsre 1 n i 1 n sf o sf f sf o 2 22 mre 1 n

sf o and sf f are the actual and forecasted streamflow values and sf o is the mean value of the actual streamflow 4 application results and analysis the effectiveness of the proposed mars de and the comparable lssvr models was inspected on real historical streamflow sourced from an official organization authorized for monitoring such streamflows at baghdad station located on tigris river this section provides a comprehensive detail of the applied predictive model predictability in forecasting one step ahead streamflow it is worth stating that the applied dataset is continuous and does not experience any missing monitoring events data during the period under study in this section the robustness of the models was evaluated and assessed using multiple statistical indicators such as absolute error measurements and best fit goodness e g si mape rmse mae rmsre mre bias and nse based on tables 2 and 3 five input combinations and their forecasting skills were reported based on the antecedent streamflow records according to table 2 two months lead time performed the best prediction matrix it can be observed that this is the case for the proposed model and the comparable model in quantitative terms mars de model achieved the best performance indicators rmse 46 64 m3 s mae 35 25 m3 s and nse 0 89 while lssvr model performed the best modeling forecasting rmse 57 50 m3 s mae 49 20 m3 s and nse 0 83 see tables 2 and 3 both models achieved good forecasting performances based on the statistical research established by moriasi et al 2007 however the sophistication of the advanced level of accuracy is always the motivation based on the tabulated results three months lead time and onward up to five month lead time demonstrated low forecasting skills this can best be explained by the decrease in the correlated lead time of the streamflow as clearly illustrated in fig 5 note the established forecasting procedure is based on univariate modeling in which only streamflow information is used to build the proposed predictive model practically this is more challenging for the watersheds lack of meteorological data figs 6 and 7 displayed the variance between the actual and forecasted i e mars de and lssvr streamflow pattern presented in the form of scatter plots over the testing phase for each designed input combination the scatter plots indicated the least square regression formula y a x b and the coefficient of determination between the actual and forecasted values based on the graphical presentation m2 input combination showed an ideal variation around the best fit line mars de achieved a maximum r2 0 90 whereas lssvr model achieved the best r2 0 83 by comparing the investigated models mars de and lssvr with a detailed comprehensive analysis the computation of the relative error re indicator using eq 26 was examined during the testing period for the best input combination the results of the two models are illustrated in fig 8 for each single observation over the testing phase in general the performance of mars de model demonstrated less percentage error and limited between 14 and 18 whereas the performance of the lssvr model demonstrated a slightly higher re 22 and 15 it can be concluded that the residual error for the testing phase was improved when using the proposed mars de model compared to the lssvr model some observations were also observed to be common to both models with a high percentage of error this could be due to the sudden increment in the streamflow due to occasionally heavy rainfall events or other source of water flow through the upstream attributes descriptively the interception between several statistical indicators including the correlation standard deviation and root mean square was generated in the form of a taylor diagram fig 9 showed the taylor diagram visualization over the testing phase of the proposed mars de and the comparable forecasting model mars de demonstrated the closest coordinate using m2 input combination to the actual streamflow benchmark value the test modeling phase presented a far distance between mars de model and the actual data point indeed this is normal due to the lower magnitude achieved for the rmse and the highest correlation coefficient as depicted in the scatter plot presentation 5 mars de modeling validation the authors also observed that the proposed hybrid mars de forecasting model can provide an accurate outcome for the investigated case study it is worth to validate the current modeling performance with the standalone mars model and the literature studies performed on the same case study table 4 reported the statistical performance of the standalone mars model the best input combination for the streamflow forecasting was m1 incorporating one month lead time this is on the contrary with the mars de and lssvr models where the optimal input combination was two month lead time indeed this is best can be explained due to the fact machine learning based forecasting models behave differently from one case to another in accordance to complexity of the simulated problem the forecasting was attained with minimum absolute error measures rmse 78 01 m3 s and mae 62 65 m3 s this is evidencing a remarkable predictability performance augmentation through the integration of the differential evolution evolutionary optimization algorithm with mars model with respect to the validation against the literature zaher and his co authors developed an extreme learning machine elm classical support vector regression svr and generalized regression neural network grnn for streamflow forecasting of the same case study using 80 20 training and testing division yaseen et al 2016a b elm exhibited the best predictability potential over svr and grnn models nevertheless mars de model of the present study produced an enhanced forecasting accuracy 51 1 57 9 through the rmse and mae indicators over elm model respectively the high level of accuracy enhancement could be explained through the increment in the training dataset where the current study was established using 90 of the historical data in addition the integration of the nature inspired algorithm as hyperparameters tuning algorithm for mars model could contribute to this enhanced prediction accuracy 6 modeling assessment and possible future research deceptively the obtained modeling results evidenced the shortcoming of the length of the dataset span implemented in the current study in general the length of data used 20 years monthly basis has a considerable effect on the accuracy of the overall performance hence it is highly recommended to put more efforts in the future research on incorporating longer dataset span where more streamflow patterns can be included in the training phase this is due to the fact that the training stage should experience the majority of the streamflow patterns to allow the models in the testing session to forecast with an acceptable level of accuracy in this context it seems that 20 years streamflow is not perfectly sufficient and this can affect the level of the forecasting accuracy furthermore it might be essential to incorporate other casual hydrological variables as external attributes for the streamflow simulation the main intuition is that weather conditions mainly rainfalls are the main influencer of streamflow patterns thus there could be an enhancement in forecasting procedure if other related climate variables are associated with historical datasets of streamflow to develop a good and successful prediction model adding climatological information such as rainfall temperature or even humidity as an input attribute might enhance the learning mechanism and a better performing forecasting model can be achieved on other aspect monthly scale streamflow pattern is associated with seasonality trend and thus eliminating or incorporating those trends might beneficial proposition to give an informative knowledge for the intelligence predictive models 7 conclusion the current study explored a newly developed machine learning predictive model called mars de for monthly streamflow forecasting in semi arid environments at baghdad meteorological station tigris river the historical data of the streamflow over 20 years was obtained for the model construction the architecture of the proposed model was established based on several antecedent values of streamflow patterns among several machine learning introduced in the literature support vector machine model showed as a reliable model for forecasting streamflow and thus was selected for the model authentication lssvr model was developed using the same input combinations the results of the performed models were examined using several statistical indicators and graphical presentation prediction skill metrics in general the results demonstrated the potential of the developed mars de model for monthly streamflow forecasting in semi arid environments with a remarkable forecasting accuracy based on the statistical metrics rmse and mae mars de model improved the streamflow predictability by 18 8 28 3 and 40 2 43 7 over lssvr and standalone mars models as a future research proposition the forecasting possibility can be enhanced through the incorporation of some related climate parameters such as rainfall humidity and temperature to provide more information on the streamflow phenomenon declaration of interest the authors state that there is no conflict of interest in publishing the current

6496,a riverine and overland flow model based on the dynamically adapting galerkin least squares finite element method is developed and presented the method utilizes the diffusive wave equations within a dynamically adaptive mesh and second order accurate implicit time stepping scheme to efficiently and accurately simulate problems involving flows such as those that occur during overland flooding and urban inundation the developed method and the utility of dynamic mesh adaption is presented through the simulation of common problems that occur in urban and overland flow conditions these are shallow flooding rapid flooding and flow propagation in an urban area the application of the method to the flooding of the morganza floodway illustrates the capabilities of the model in simulating large scale flooding and the application to a large dam break illustrates the limitations of the diffusive wave equations and the flow regimes where the numerical assumptions for the method break down to the author s knowledge the unique combination of fem wet dry scheme and dynamic mesh adaption for the solution of diffusive wave equation dwe has not been presented in literature prior to this study keywords finite element method diffusive wave equation adaptive meshing true wetting and drying urban flooding dam break 1 introduction the shallow water equation swe and its variants based hydrodynamic numerical models have been an integral part of water resources management since the advent of modern computing when large scale numerical modeling became possible without undue run time constraints historically and overwhelmingly the simulation of riverine and overland flow has been performed using 1 one dimensional 1d solvers such as hec ras brunner 2016 2 with the advent of modern computing through two dimensional 2d swe solvers such as those presented in savant et al 2011 george 2010 churuksaeva and starchenko 2015 borthwick and barber 1992 bagheri and das 2013 liang et al 2008 etc 3 2d diffusive wave equation dwe solvers such as those presented in liu et al 2012 moussa and bocquillon 1996 cappelaere 1997 gasiorowski 2013 etc and 4 1d 2d swe and or dwe models such as those presented in arico at al 2016 fan et al 2017 chen et al 2007 etc ignoring viscous and coriolis terms swe in 2d swe 2d can be expressed as 1 continuity h t i h u x ii h v y iii s o u r c e s s i n k s 0 2 x momentum u h t iv h u u x v h u v y vi g 2 h 2 x vii gh s fx s x viii 0 3 y momentum v h t ix h u v x x h v v y xi g 2 h 2 y xii gh s fy s y xiii 0 where h is the depth of flow u and v are the x and y direction velocities respectively g is the gravitational acceleration sfx and sfy are the and y direction friction slopes respectively and sx and sy are the and y direction bed slopes respectively however the solution of 2d swe can impose run time constraints because of the computational intensity required prestininzi 2008 and the solution of swe can increase the computational cost by 50 or more when compared to the solution cost for dwe hromadka et al 1985 therefore in general 2d swe are of reduced use for problems where hydrodynamic results are required in a time sensitive manner for problems where time is not the primary constraint the 2d swe should be the primary computation strategy this is essential because the locations in a simulation domain where the dwe might provide erroneous results is not known apriori guinot and cappallaere 2009 and arico et al 2011 have shown that dwe is less sensitive to errors in parameters such as topography the manning coefficient and bed slope when compared to the swe in such instances the computational efficiency and stability afforded by a simplification while maintaining accuracy of the swe equations to diffusive wave equation dwe are of benefit dwe are obtained from the swe under the assumptions that the inertial iv v vi ix x and xi terms are much smaller than the gravity pressure vii and xii and friction viii and xiii terms under these assumptions the swe degenerate to a single parabolic continuity of mass equation in cases where the pressure gravity can be ignored the swe degenerates to the kinematic wave equation kwe the omission of the inertial terms to generate the dwe is not problematic for riverine flooding and overland flow simulations as these terms are in general small compared to the other terms fan and li 2006 moussa and bocquillon 1996 and the flow is predominantly governed by the gravity and frictional forces therefore for most riverine and overland flow problems the dwe provides a robust alternative to the full swe massive parallelization of numerical codes on shared as well as distributed memory has allowed the utilization of swe to problems of large spatial as well as temporal extents jiang et al 2005 song et al 1994 rao 2004 vacondio et al 2017 savant et al 2011 tate et al 2012 applied the massively parallel model presented in savant et al 2011 to the simulation of countrywide flooding in pakistan and illustrated that the absolute cost of swe is of reduced concern therefore the relative cost of swe versus dwe computations is of primary concern for problems where time is of the essence in section 6 of this manuscript the authors will attempt to demonstrate that the cost of swe is prohibitive relative to the dwe through application to a real world problem ponce et al 1977 and moussa and bocquillon 1996 have clearly demarcated analytical conditions under which the dwe approximation is valid however this demarcation does not exist for the physical world and therefore care must be exercised in the usage of the dwe over swe when bed slopes are not mild hromadka et al 1985 literature indicates that the dwe approximation can successfully simulate inundation processes caused by slowly varying flood wave moussa and bocquillon 1996 these conditions include the spreading of a flood wave and the flooding caused by slow erosion of a levee dike some success has been reported in the literature hromadka et al 1985 prestininzi 2008 in the simulation of inundation caused by dam breaks dam breaks in general involve rapidly varying flow and large inertial components and dwe are therefore unsuitable for the simulation of dam break flows hromadka et al 1985 and prestininzi 2008 showed that under certain flow conditions the dwe can be used to simulate dam break flows in spite of these successes the use of dwe to simulate the inundation caused by dam break type flows is discouraged by the authors because the use is not supported mathematically mizumura 2012 by the underlying assumptions of the dwe mizumura 2012 mathematically illustrated that the dwe is applicable to flood routing when the change in water depth caused by the flood is small but it is not applicable when the change in water depth caused by the flood is large as is the case with a majority of large dam breaks arico et al 2011 found that dwe was applicable when flows from catastrophic events such as those from a dam break can be modeled using dwe when the water is no longer contained in the main channel and spills onto adjacent floodplains under the assumptions previously listed the dwe can mathematically be expressed as 4 continuity h t h k ξ x x h k ξ y y s o u r c e s s i n k s 0 where ξ is the water surface elevation and 5 u k ξ x v k ξ y k c 2 h 4 3 n 2 v where c is the conversion factor n is the manning s coefficient and v is the velocity magnitude eqs 4 and 5 have the depth of flow h as the only unknown compared to the swe which has three unknowns h u and v and is therefore an easier as well as faster solve eq 4 the continuity equation can include additional sources or sinks of mass in the presented paper these include rainfall evaporation infiltration using the green ampt method green and ampt 1911 and using the horton method horton 1933 other sources and sinks such as stage discharge etc are specified by the boundary integrals to determine the contribution of rainfall evaporation to each element the spatially varying user specified rainfall evaporation intensity length time is multiplied by the area of the element and then equally distributed amongst the three nodes comprising the element the contribution of infiltration determined using either of the 2 available methods is partitioned in a similar way one of the fundamental pillars of numerical modeling of a continuum is the principle of the grid or mesh convergence savant 2010 and is defined as the process of removing grid or mesh resolution introduced bias such that further refinement of the mesh or grid does not substantially change the quantity of interest this process can be extremely cumbersome for the swe because every refinement of the mesh grid results in a larger number of cell or elements and consequently increases the degrees of freedom that require a solution the dwe again have an advantage here as a refinement to the same resolution as an swe simulation will only add one third of the number of degrees of freedom of the swe simulation in this paper the authors will present the development and the application of a dynamically adaptive numerical model that maximizes the aforementioned advantages of the dwe over the swe to obtain efficient and accurate solutions to the hydrodynamic phenomenon where the dwe is applicable to the authors knowledge the unique combination of fem wet dry scheme and dynamic mesh adaption for the solution of dwe has not been presented in literature prior to this study 2 numerical basis the fem discretization is performed over a triangular element mapped to a computational parent whose vertices lie at 0 0 0 1 1 0 the 2d linear basis functions denoted as ϕi used for trial function discretization are defined nodally on the parent element as 6 ϕ 1 1 χ η ϕ 2 χ ϕ 3 η where χ and η are locally defined variables whose values vary linearly from 0 to 1 in finite element fashion the linear trial functions are used to expand all solution variables so that for 3 node triangles the continuous fields discretize to 7 x 1 3 x i ϕ i χ η x 1 ϕ 1 χ η x 2 ϕ 2 χ η x 3 ϕ 3 χ η 8

written as 10 h x y t 1 3 h i x y t ϕ i x y where h x y t is time varying depth hereafter h will be used to refer to the time varying quantities in these equations ϕ is the basis function in the physical space the transformation from the computational element to the physical element utilizes the jacobian j defined as 11 j χ η x χ x η y χ y η the relationship between the physical element area denoted as λ and j is 12 λ 1 2 j χ η all finite element integrations are performed on the computational element the following equations for example are typical mass and stiffness transformations from the physical to parent domain physical element 13 m ω e 2 d ϕ i x y ϕ j x y d ω χ 0 1 η 0 1 χ ϕ i χ η ϕ j χ η 2 λ d χ d η and 14 k ω e 2 d ϕ i x ϕ j y d ω 1 2 λ χ 0 1 η 0 1 χ ϕ i x ϕ j y d χ d η where ω e 2 d 2d elemental domain hereafter referred to as ω e the numerical model is developed using a linear triangular element based fem framework based on continuous galerkin least squares gls in which unknowns are represented as linear lagrange polynomials as 15 h a x y t i ϕ i x y h i t where the subscript a indicates the approximate or discrete value of the variable and all other variables are as previously defined hereafter the subscript a will be dropped and all unknowns will be understood to represent discrete values it is well known that for an advection dominated problem the galerkin finite element solution will exhibit spurious oscillations in such advection dominated flow solutions the fe solution is stabilized by the addition of artificial diffusion that vanishes for all sufficiently smooth solutions the gls method works by adding least squares terms to the galerkin terms to provide artificial diffusion and enhance the stability of the galerkin method without unduly degrading the accuracy hughes et al 1989 gls does not alter the order of the galerkin approximation and therefore belongs to the consistent class of stabilization schemes bochev et al 2004 in general gls is an addition that stabilizes simple interpolations which would otherwise be unstable within a purely galerkin framework gls methods have been successfully applied to several problems where stability of the solution is of importance these include the solution of the helmholtz equation thompson and pinsky 1994 stokes flow xia and yao 2007 becker and braack 2001 incompressible flow sistek 2004 and others the presented work extends the application of gls to the solution of dwe defining the gls weight function as ψ ϕ φ trial gls function and integrating equation 4 by parts over the

indicates an elemental average the gls weight function takes the following form 18 φ u e ϕ i x v e ϕ i y τ is a weighing function governing the amount of gls contribution for advective systems the value of τ is usually dependent on the advective scales and velocities it is natural that τ be a function of the advective distance and the velocity in the presented model τ takes the following form 19 τ l e u e 2 v e 2 the exact form of the τ can be determined apriori for steady state problems for all other transient problems the form of τ is determined posteriori though trial and error zienkiewicz et al 2005 the parameter le is the spectral radius and can be thought of as equivalent to the scale of motion discretization in the presented model le is represented as follows 20 l e λ where λ is the element area notice that the discontinuous portion φ is composed of gradients of the continuous trial function and is only integrated against the discrete equation over the interior of the element this implies that essential boundary conditions are addressed by the continuous portion ϕ of the test weight function the temporal terms are expressed using an implicit finite difference

html 3 wetting and drying wetting and drying of the simulation domain is a natural part of any hydrodynamic simulation involving inundation of initially dry land and therefore is essential for accurate reproduction of the hydrodynamics in the system wetting and drying in the presented model relies on front tracking such that only the wet part of the domain is included in computations front tracking algorithms simulate the wet dry boundary by tracking the free surface across a partially wet element examples of this technique are presented in hervouet and janin 1994 bates and hervouet 1999 defina 2000 and horritt 2002 fig 1 illustrates a generic element e this element has four wetting drying possibilities 1 completely wet fig 1a in this case the entire element is integrated 2 one node dry fig 1b in this case the entire element is integrated as if it was completely wet subsequently the dry portion of the element is integrated and this contribution is subtracted from the contribution of the entire element 3 two nodes dry fig 1c in this case a new completely wet element is formed and this element is integrated the location of the wet dry line is determined by linearly interpolating the depths to zero 4 completely dry fig 1d in this case no integration is performed on the element 4 mesh adaption numerical simulation of riverine and overland flows oftentimes requires that the spatial resolution of the mesh be fine enough to capture the phenomenon of interest this is problematic in the case of transient events such as a flood wave in such cases static meshes meshes that do not change their resolution with time necessitate that the resolution required for these transient events be maintained for the duration of the simulation this increased resolution can add unnecessary computational burden to the solution procedure here a mesh that adapts spatially and temporally with changing hydrodynamic conditions might be of use several techniques to dynamically adapt a mesh exist such as the ones presented in 1 babuska et al 1995 based on the norm of classical energy 2 prudhomme 1999 based on differences between the gradients of independent variables 3 tate et al 2006 and 4 savant et al 2018 based on the norm of the continuity equation in swe the application of these dynamic mesh adaption techniques to real world simulations are infrequent because the computation of an adaption indicator is usually a global solve global solutions are computationally expensive and any advantage gained by adapting the mesh is lost through the computation of the adaption indicator therefore the adaption strategy adopted must rely on locally computed variables to determine any refinement indicators the refinement indicators presented by tate et al 2006 and savant et al 2018 are computed locally on the elements using variables computed through the primary computing strategy gls fem in the presented paper and is therefore computationally inexpensive the procedure presented by tate et al 2006 for 2d swe and savant et al 2018 for 3d swe is mathematically presented as follows 22 e e a e h t u x v y w z 2 d a e 1 2 a e here ae 1 local integration ee l3 t elemental refinement indicator for element e and ae area of the e th 2d element or volume of the i th 3d element in the presented paper the z components vanish the indicator presented in 22 relies on local mass conservation in the numerical framework into which it is implemented berger and howington 2002 and hughes et al 2000 have demonstrated that the general fem statement presented in this paper is locally as well as globally mass conservative when the conservative form of the continuity equation is used therefore the indicator presented in 22 is appropriate for use within the presented numerical model this indicator has been shown to perform well when used with 2d and 3d swe in correctly indicating areas of the mesh requiring refinement or coarsening savant et al 2011 mcalpin et al 2013 martin et al 2012 savant et al 2018 and is therefore chosen as the refinement indicator for implementation in this paper once an element has been flagged for refinement or adaption ee a user specified refinement limit the refinement procedure advances as below 1 the longest edge is split 2 the next longest edge is split and 3 the oldest edge is then split this process is repeated until the adaption reaches the maximum levels of refinement specified by the user when the indicator falls below the user specified error the unrefinement process progresses in the reverse order of how the adapted edges were formed this process is illustrated below in fig 2 for an element that is allowed to adapt twice using dynamic refinement un refinement assures that the model is utilizing the resolution required to accurately capture the hydrodynamics as they occur without having to unduly carry a high resolution for all times due to a singular event the authors note that generally adaption improves element aspect ratios but can infrequently cause the creation of badly shaped elements or bad nodal connectivity this is an area of active research arico et al 2011 present a delaunay condition based mesh adjustment that attempts to create well shaped elements the application of this approach to the presented adaption scheme is an area of ongoing research the efficacy of the implemented mesh adaption scheme will be demonstrated in the morganza control structure presented in the testing section 5 testing the testing procedure for the adaptive mesh dwe solver attempts to ascertain that 1 the dwe are implemented correctly 2 the adaption procedure is accurately capturing areas that require transient adaption and 3 the dwe solution is valid in cases where the application of dwe is suitable the authors present six test cases each designed to test the listed goals of the testing the first test case is a simple case that attempts to mimic the mass conservation and time of arrival properties listed in neelz and pender 2010 the second test case mimics the flooding of an extended floodplain hunter et al 2005 the third to compare model computed velocities with those reported the fourth test case mimics the flooding of an area due to rainfall and a point source of flow neelz and pender 2010 the fifth test case is the large scale riverine flooding and finally the sixth test case simulates a dam break all the presented test cases utilized dynamic mesh adaption and the adapted mesh is presented for test 2 the dam break test also presents the deviation of the dwe results from those computed using the swe the dwe is a degeneration of the swe by assuming that the friction and pressure terms in the momentum equations are the dominant terms driving flow if this assumption is true for a particular application the calculation of the full swe momentum using the velocity and depth results from the dwe should show that the swe momentum does indeed sum to zero or an extremely small error if this error is not zero any deviation is the error in the dwe assumptions the acceptability of the amount of variance from the dwe assumptions is dependent on the application and the intent of the simulation the deviation from swe is mathematically expressed as 23 u dwe h dwe t h dwe u dwe u dwe x h dwe u dwe v dwe y g 2 h dwe 2 x g h dwe s fx s x e r r o r x 24 v dwe h dwe t h dwe u dwe v dwe x h dwe v dwe v dwe y g 2 h dwe 2 y g h dwe s fy s y e r r o r y where udwe vdwe and hdwe are the variables computed through dwe since the dwe is obtained under the assumption that the pressure gravity terms are in balance with the friction terms the last two terms on the left hand side of eqs 23 and 24 eliminate each other and the error in the dwe assumption is written as 25 u dwe h dwe t h dwe u dwe u dwe x h dwe u dwe v dwe y e r r o r x 26 v dwe h dwe t h dwe u dwe v dwe x h dwe v dwe v dwe y e r r o r y 5 1 test case i the first test is adapted from neelz and pender 2010 to ascertain model capability to determine inundation extents and final infill depths the momentum of flow propagation in this test case is low and therefore this test is an appropriate test for the application of dwe because the contribution of inertial terms is extremely small and flow is governed through a balance between the friction and gravity terms the test domain consists of a series of depressions fig 3 into which water flows sequentially the inflow hydrograph fig 4 is applied as a line source of flow across a 100 m distance fig 3 the test was run for a period of 48 h and the flow behavior into the depressions analyzed fig 5 the numerical mesh consisted of 10 201 nodes forming 20 000 elements with a uniform size of approximately 199 m2 this resolution was just enough to capture the undulating bathymetry mesh adaption was utilized to capture the hydrodynamics in the domain as the depressions were filled and water spilled over into adjacent depressions neelz and pender 2010 provide an ensemble of results from several models for the sake of space we provide results from the 4th fig 5a and the 6th fig 5b depressions and suffice to say that the other depressions show similar behavior the model results compare very favorably to the published results the model captures the flow arrival time as well as the depth of inundation the inundation depths computed by the model had an average error of less than 0 05 m when compared to the published results fig 6 illustrates the error maximum of errorx and errory at all times for the simulation as is expected for an overland flooding problem the error or deviation from swe is extremely small and therefore the dwe is a good choice for this simulation 5 2 test case ii the second test is adapted from the widely used bates et al 2010 boonrawd and jothityangkoon 2015 li et al 2014 solution presented in hunter et al 2005 and is useful in evaluating the model capability to simulate the wetting of an initially dry region the analytical solution presented by hunter et al 2005 consists of the propagation of a shape preserving wetting front and can be written as 27 h 7 3 c n 2 u 3 x u t 3 7 where h is the depth of flow c is the constant of integration 0 for this test n is the mannings coefficient 0 01sec m1 3 for the presented test u is the velocity magnitude 1 m sec for the presented test and t is the time the simulation domain consisted of 272 nodes comprising 462 elements the average size of the elements was approximately 10800 m2 this base resolution was allowed to dynamically adapt as required to capture the hydrodynamics of the propagating flood wave it is reasonable to assume that as the flood wave propagates over the modeled domain 5000 m 1000 m the model should require additional resolution to not only capture the front but to capture the shape of the wave behind the front as well fig 7 illustrates three meshes 1 a coarse mesh 2 the fine mesh and 3 an adapted mesh at time 1300 sec the fine mesh consisted of 16 000 nodes forming 8241 elements the fine mesh elements had a uniform size of approximately 312 m2 fig 8 illustrates the state of inundation at 1300 s note that the adapted area matches the inundation fig 9 a and b presents a comparison of the coarse and adapted mesh generated results to the analytic solution the coarse mesh numerically diffuses the flood wave such that the wave propagates much farther than the analytic solution however the results from the adapted mesh closely match the analytic solution table 1 presents the root mean square error rmse comparisons for the coarse and adapted meshes when compared to the analytic solution 5 3 test case iii this test case adopted from neelz and pender 2010 is designed to determine the model capability to accurately compute flow velocities during the breach or overtopping of a protection feature the test domain fig 10 consists of a flat 2000 m 1000 m flat flood plain the domain receives a flow of 20 m3 sec over a 20 m segment of the domain for a period of 6 h representing the breach or the overtopping of a protection feature velocity observations were available at three locations shown in fig 12 model computed velocities will be compared with those reported at these locations a manning s n value of 0 05 was specified throughout the domain the numerical mesh consisted of 3714 nodes forming 18 561 elements the smallest element had a size of approximately 12 m2 and the largest element was approximately 42 m2 the finer resolution was targeted at locations where velocity observations were available to enable exact comparisons fig 11 illustrates the comparison between the model simulated and those reported in neelz and pender 2010 it is observed that the model computes velocities compare favorably to those reported this favorable comparison includes the velocity magnitude time of peak velocity as well as the general behavior of the velocity profile table 2 4 provide additional details on the behavior of model computed velocities and those reported the greatest errors occur at point 1 this location is close to the inflow boundary and the error in all likelihood is a consequence of boundary effects imparted by the numerical treatment 5 4 test case iv this test case adapted from neelz and pender 2010 is designed to determine model capability to correctly simulated flooding due to rainfall and from a point inflow source the test attempts to mimic a common urban flooding scenario where a rainfall event overwhelms the drainage system and consequently causes flooding due to a surcharging pipe or stormwater drain the domain fig 12 for this test case consists of a 400 m by 960 m block with two different kinds of land cover pavement and any other land cover type hence the roughness values were variable throughout the domain manning s n of 0 02 for pavements and 0 05 for other areas due to variable roughness the rainfall and the point source will preferentially travel through areas of lower roughness fig 12 illustrates the bathymetry of the domain as well as the location of pavement regions solid black lines in addition the figure also shows the location of the surcharging pipe marked by inflow and of 9 observation locations locations where the comparisons are shown in this paper are marked by black ovals the numerical simulation domain consisted of 110 346 nodes forming 219 330 elements the smallest element had a size of approximately 1 5 m2 and the largest element was approximately 10 m2 this level of resolution was required to accurately capture various features of the domain such as pavements and other varied areas the model was allowed to dynamically adapt to capture the hydrodynamics of the system the water forcing is provided by two distinct events 1 consisting of a uniform rainfall and 2 a surcharging point source of flow fig 13 the model was run for a total duration of 5 h and model results compared to those reported in neelz and pender 2010 again the simulation was executed with dynamic mesh adaption on the base or the initial mesh was created to capture the bathymetry and the delineation between the paved unpaved regions non adaptive simulations were not attempted for this test case as the previous test demonstrated that coarse static meshes do not accurately capture pertinent flow phenomenon fig 14 provides a comparison of the model simulated flows and those reported in neelz and pender 2010 the model accurately computes the inundation water level as well as the flood wave arrival times at all location for the sake for conserving space the authors present these comparisons at 4 representative locations this test case is a typical application of the dwe to an urban flooding scenario and therefore the errors introduced into the solution from the dwe assumption should be small a maximum deviation from swe of 10 3 m2 s2 was using eqs 25 26 this computed error is indeed extremely small hence the utilization of dwe is appropriate for this test 5 5 test case v this test case simulates the flooding in the morganza floodway as a consequence of the mississippi river floods in 2011 and the opening of the morganza control structure mcs fig 15 the operation of mcs caused the morganza floodway to be inundated as the flood wave progressed this flooding was previously simulated using the full swe model presented in savant et al 2011 and results presented in bell et al 2017 this simulation is conducive to the application of dwe as the regional bathymetry is not steep and the land is vegetated causing frictional forces to be dominant over inertial forces the swe simulations presented in bell et al 2017 utilize land classification dependent roughness characteristics fig 15 and table 5 and therefore the dwe simulation utilized the same land classification based roughness characterization fig 16 presents the inflow hydrograph applied at the mcs the hydrograph has a stepped appearance because flow through the mcs is governed by upstream flow criteria and flow is modified when certain conditions such as stage and discharge are achieved bell et al 2017 the numerical mesh for this simulation consisted of 175 000 nodes comprising a total of 337 591 elements the smallest element was approximately 300 m2 and the largest was approximately 5000 m2 the model was allowed to dynamically adapt to capture system hydrodynamics fig 17 presents the results of the dwe simulation and the validated swe simulation bell et al 2017 at the four observation locations presented in fig 15 the dwe simulated flooding closely follows the flooding simulated by swe while consuming significantly less computing time 3 h compared to 21 h on 1 processor with an average error of less than 0 1 m this test illustrates that when appropriately applied the dwe provides results with the same accuracy as a full swe simulation the dwe deviation from swe for this application is extremely small and of the order of 10 3 m2 s2 to ascertain the computational efficiency gained by the adaptive meshing the performance of a converged fine static mesh 500 000 million nodes was compared to that of the dynamically adapting mesh adapted to a maximum of 260 000 nodes for 6 9 of simulation time these simulations were performed on 800 processors and the comparison is shown in table 6 it is observed that the dynamically adapting mesh incurred a cost approximately 35 less than that incurred by the fine static mesh 5 6 test case vi this test case is presented to illustrate the limits of the dwe and the consequences of its application to simulations that may violate dwe assumptions this test simulated the explosive failure of the malpasset dam france in 1959 the resulting flood wave was approximately 40 m high and resulted in 433 casualties and destroyed infrastructure including three transformers the time of failure of these transformers are known and will be utilized along with other observed data to validate model performance the flooding caused due to the failure of malpasset dam has been successfully simulated using swe without morphologic change considerations by valiani et al 2002 schwanenberg 2004 erpicum et al 2004 and savant et al 2011 therefore this modeling exercise will not consider morphologic change either the failure of the dam and the wave propagation has been widely studied to determine the maximum water surface elevations reached due to the flood wave these maximum water surface elevations are numbered p1 to p17 fig 18 in addition experimental data is available from a scaled physical model built at laboratoire national d hydraulique in 1964 the scale factor of the undistorted model is 1 400 the observations from this model are numbered s6 s14 with s1 s5 located in the reservoir the valley below the dam is considered completely dry and the water surface elevation behind the dam is assumed to be 100 m these conditions have been utilized by several researchers and have provided accurate results of the flood wave and the water surface elevations valiani et al 2002 schwanenberg 2004 a constant manning s n value of 0 033 s m1 3 for the entire domain is utilized the simulation was executed using the presented dwe model and the full swe model presented in savant et al 2011 to illustrate the errors in the dwe results the numerical domain for this problem consisted of 29 391 nodes comprising 56 698 elements the smallest element was approximately 250 m2 and the largest approximately 1130 m2 the model was allowed to dynamically adapt to capture the dam break wave and other hydrodynamic phenomenon tables 7 9 list the comparison of model simulated values to those observed surveyed in the field the dwe model does not accurately simulate the depth of inundation or the time of arrival this is due to the fact that for most large dam break problems the flood wave controls inundation behavior and the vicinity of the flood wave is where the dwe assumptions break down a simple scaling analysis at a single time t using average values for depth over the location shown in fig 19 shows that the pressure and slope terms are 0 5 m2 s2 and therefore the inertial terms for a valid dwe application must be small compared to 0 5 m2 s2 fig 19 shows the bottom elevation depth and water surface profiles used however an analysis fig 19 using eqs 25 26 show that the deviation from swe due to the dwe assumption are several order of magnitude greater than the gravity pressure and friction terms this test case though inappropriate for the usage of the dwe for the simulation of such a dam break provides a robust test case to analyze the capability of the adaptive mesh algorithms in the model to capture the propagating flood wave fig 20 shows the initial coarse mesh and the state of the hydrodynamics at 100 s into the dam break for the fine and the dynamically adapting coarse mesh the dynamically adapting coarse mesh provides inundation and location of wave results that are similar to those obtained using the converged fine scale static mesh while reducing the computational time by a factor of 6 5 125 s for the dynamically adapting coarse mesh compared to 821 s for the converged static mesh the initial dynamically adapting mesh was created with 6600 nodes to capture the bathymetry of the domain whereas the static fine mesh created to capture the entirety of the physics at all times had a total of 29 400 nodes at the peak node count the dynamically adapting coarse mesh had a maximum count of 12 456 nodes the wide disparity in the static fine mesh and the dynamically adapting mesh while simulating similar hydrodynamics illustrates the benefit of a dynamically adapting mesh in terms of reduced computational burden the dynamic mesh adaption algorithms are designed to optimize the equation being solved the dwe in the presented paper and not to ascertain the appropriateness of the equation being used to solve a particular problem therefore even though the adaptive mesh provides results similar to the static fine mesh it does not accurately solve the hydrodynamics because the swe is the appropriate equation to be used for this particular simulation 6 comparison of dwe and swe performance and multi processor behavior as previously mentioned in the introductory notes massively parallel swe based numerical codes are available and efficiently simulate large scale hydrodynamics jiang et al 2005 song et al 1994 rao 2004 vacondio et al 2017 savant et al 2011 tate et al 2012 the efficiency and utility of swe based numerical codes is well established and not in question what is of interest is the relative efficiency of swe and dwe based numerical codes for problems where dwe based numerical codes are applicable the authors ascertain this relative efficiency through the application of a full swe based numerical code presented in savant et al 2011 and the dwe model presented here to the simulation of the flooding caused by the operation of the morganza floodway test case presented previously the simulations were executed on 240 300 360 420 480 540 600 660 720 800 900 1080 1400 and 1800 processors using the sgi ice x supercomputing system topaz located at the engineer research and development center erdc of the us army corps of engineers usace topaz has a peak capacity of 4 66 pflops on 3 456 compute nodes with each compute node consisting of 36 processors the dwe based numerical code shows increasing model efficiency till 800 processors at processor counts larger than 800 the model efficiency decreases fig 21 this decrease in efficiency is because at higher processor counts the processors incur excessive expenditure in inter processor communications compared to the solution procedure the swe based numerical code shows increasing efficiency till 1400 processors this behavior for the dwe as well as swe numerical codes is presented in fig 21 it is observed that the fastest dwe simulation is 2360 s while the fastest swe simulation requires 4560 s for completion it must be noted that the slowest dwe simulation took 4700 s this is comparable to the fastest swe simulation this is a direct consequence of the non linearity imparted by the swe to the solution procedure as well as the increase in the dof it must be understood that timing emerges from implementation and that the exact behavior might vary from model to model but the general behavior should be the same across models the serial as well as the parallel versions of the code both for dwe and swe are written in the c programming language and utilize the same data structures the code can be compiled in serial or in parallel parallel builds of the code require an additional data structure consisting of all the necessary variables and communication protocols message passing within the parallel build is implemented through the industry standard message passing interface mpi mpi calls for parallel execution are bound within preprocessor definitions statements ifdef to enable computational and memory efficiency for parallel execution the mesh grid is broken down and processors read the data pertinent to their own sub domain sub grid sub mesh the code utilizes the parallel graph partitioning and fill reducing matrix ordering parmeteis karypis 2013 software to dynamically redistribute nodes during run time for adaptive model execution this redistribution repartitioning balances the nodal load each processor bears during run time the authors again emphasize that dwe should be used for a limited set of hydrodynamic simulations where the dwe is valid the presented model provides error output indicating variance from the swe an example is presented in fig 20 if the computed variance is large and or in the area of interest the simulation must discard the dwe and utilize the swe to avoid erroneous results and subsequent erroneous engineering scientific management decisions irrespective of the efficiency imparted by the utilization of dwe 7 conclusions the authors present the development and application of a diffusive wave equation model based implicit and mesh adaptive tool for urban and overland flow the model based on the galerkin least squares gls finite element method accurately and efficiently simulated several flow conditions such as the flooding of a flood plain and flooding in an urban area the dynamically adapting mesh technique presented reduced the time required for simulations by as much as 5 6 times compared to a converged fine resolution static mesh dynamic mesh adaption though extremely beneficial brought to light some infrequent shortcomings of the adaption procedure wherein bad nodal connectivity and poorly shaped adapted elements are formed these bad nodal connectivity and poorly formed elements can cause unstable and inaccurate simulations the error introduced in the simulations due to the dwe assumptions was analyzed and found to be extremely small compared to the friction and pressure terms for all test cases except for the malpasset dam break simulation the malpasset dam break simulation with dwe computed erroneous flood depths and time of arrival when compared to the observed as well as the results from swe simulations this is due to the fact that for a large dam break the dwe assumptions are invalid and inertial terms are several orders of magnitude larger compared to the friction terms an analysis of the exact source of error in terms of which inertial terms was not undertaken and presents an area of future research and can hold the promise of possibly extending or modifying the dwe to include other terms to account for the errors from dwe assumptions the inaccuracy of the dwe to the solution of the flooding caused by the malpasset dam failure does not indicate that the dwe cannot be used for the simulation of all dam breaks however it does serve as caution towards the affinity to use the dwe due to its stability and efficiency for all hydrodynamic flooding simulations the simulation of malpasset dam break test case abundantly indicates that care must be exercised when interpreting dwe based numerical model results in simulations where inertial terms are significant in addition viscosity terms are neglected in the dwe therefore for simulations that include significant energy transfer through the formation of eddies dwe results will be inaccurate acknowledgements and funding source the authors gratefully acknowledge all reviewers for their

6496,a riverine and overland flow model based on the dynamically adapting galerkin least squares finite element method is developed and presented the method utilizes the diffusive wave equations within a dynamically adaptive mesh and second order accurate implicit time stepping scheme to efficiently and accurately simulate problems involving flows such as those that occur during overland flooding and urban inundation the developed method and the utility of dynamic mesh adaption is presented through the simulation of common problems that occur in urban and overland flow conditions these are shallow flooding rapid flooding and flow propagation in an urban area the application of the method to the flooding of the morganza floodway illustrates the capabilities of the model in simulating large scale flooding and the application to a large dam break illustrates the limitations of the diffusive wave equations and the flow regimes where the numerical assumptions for the method break down to the author s knowledge the unique combination of fem wet dry scheme and dynamic mesh adaption for the solution of diffusive wave equation dwe has not been presented in literature prior to this study keywords finite element method diffusive wave equation adaptive meshing true wetting and drying urban flooding dam break 1 introduction the shallow water equation swe and its variants based hydrodynamic numerical models have been an integral part of water resources management since the advent of modern computing when large scale numerical modeling became possible without undue run time constraints historically and overwhelmingly the simulation of riverine and overland flow has been performed using 1 one dimensional 1d solvers such as hec ras brunner 2016 2 with the advent of modern computing through two dimensional 2d swe solvers such as those presented in savant et al 2011 george 2010 churuksaeva and starchenko 2015 borthwick and barber 1992 bagheri and das 2013 liang et al 2008 etc 3 2d diffusive wave equation dwe solvers such as those presented in liu et al 2012 moussa and bocquillon 1996 cappelaere 1997 gasiorowski 2013 etc and 4 1d 2d swe and or dwe models such as those presented in arico at al 2016 fan et al 2017 chen et al 2007 etc ignoring viscous and coriolis terms swe in 2d swe 2d can be expressed as 1 continuity h t i h u x ii h v y iii s o u r c e s s i n k s 0 2 x momentum u h t iv h u u x v h u v y vi g 2 h 2 x vii gh s fx s x viii 0 3 y momentum v h t ix h u v x x h v v y xi g 2 h 2 y xii gh s fy s y xiii 0 where h is the depth of flow u and v are the x and y direction velocities respectively g is the gravitational acceleration sfx and sfy are the and y direction friction slopes respectively and sx and sy are the and y direction bed slopes respectively however the solution of 2d swe can impose run time constraints because of the computational intensity required prestininzi 2008 and the solution of swe can increase the computational cost by 50 or more when compared to the solution cost for dwe hromadka et al 1985 therefore in general 2d swe are of reduced use for problems where hydrodynamic results are required in a time sensitive manner for problems where time is not the primary constraint the 2d swe should be the primary computation strategy this is essential because the locations in a simulation domain where the dwe might provide erroneous results is not known apriori guinot and cappallaere 2009 and arico et al 2011 have shown that dwe is less sensitive to errors in parameters such as topography the manning coefficient and bed slope when compared to the swe in such instances the computational efficiency and stability afforded by a simplification while maintaining accuracy of the swe equations to diffusive wave equation dwe are of benefit dwe are obtained from the swe under the assumptions that the inertial iv v vi ix x and xi terms are much smaller than the gravity pressure vii and xii and friction viii and xiii terms under these assumptions the swe degenerate to a single parabolic continuity of mass equation in cases where the pressure gravity can be ignored the swe degenerates to the kinematic wave equation kwe the omission of the inertial terms to generate the dwe is not problematic for riverine flooding and overland flow simulations as these terms are in general small compared to the other terms fan and li 2006 moussa and bocquillon 1996 and the flow is predominantly governed by the gravity and frictional forces therefore for most riverine and overland flow problems the dwe provides a robust alternative to the full swe massive parallelization of numerical codes on shared as well as distributed memory has allowed the utilization of swe to problems of large spatial as well as temporal extents jiang et al 2005 song et al 1994 rao 2004 vacondio et al 2017 savant et al 2011 tate et al 2012 applied the massively parallel model presented in savant et al 2011 to the simulation of countrywide flooding in pakistan and illustrated that the absolute cost of swe is of reduced concern therefore the relative cost of swe versus dwe computations is of primary concern for problems where time is of the essence in section 6 of this manuscript the authors will attempt to demonstrate that the cost of swe is prohibitive relative to the dwe through application to a real world problem ponce et al 1977 and moussa and bocquillon 1996 have clearly demarcated analytical conditions under which the dwe approximation is valid however this demarcation does not exist for the physical world and therefore care must be exercised in the usage of the dwe over swe when bed slopes are not mild hromadka et al 1985 literature indicates that the dwe approximation can successfully simulate inundation processes caused by slowly varying flood wave moussa and bocquillon 1996 these conditions include the spreading of a flood wave and the flooding caused by slow erosion of a levee dike some success has been reported in the literature hromadka et al 1985 prestininzi 2008 in the simulation of inundation caused by dam breaks dam breaks in general involve rapidly varying flow and large inertial components and dwe are therefore unsuitable for the simulation of dam break flows hromadka et al 1985 and prestininzi 2008 showed that under certain flow conditions the dwe can be used to simulate dam break flows in spite of these successes the use of dwe to simulate the inundation caused by dam break type flows is discouraged by the authors because the use is not supported mathematically mizumura 2012 by the underlying assumptions of the dwe mizumura 2012 mathematically illustrated that the dwe is applicable to flood routing when the change in water depth caused by the flood is small but it is not applicable when the change in water depth caused by the flood is large as is the case with a majority of large dam breaks arico et al 2011 found that dwe was applicable when flows from catastrophic events such as those from a dam break can be modeled using dwe when the water is no longer contained in the main channel and spills onto adjacent floodplains under the assumptions previously listed the dwe can mathematically be expressed as 4 continuity h t h k ξ x x h k ξ y y s o u r c e s s i n k s 0 where ξ is the water surface elevation and 5 u k ξ x v k ξ y k c 2 h 4 3 n 2 v where c is the conversion factor n is the manning s coefficient and v is the velocity magnitude eqs 4 and 5 have the depth of flow h as the only unknown compared to the swe which has three unknowns h u and v and is therefore an easier as well as faster solve eq 4 the continuity equation can include additional sources or sinks of mass in the presented paper these include rainfall evaporation infiltration using the green ampt method green and ampt 1911 and using the horton method horton 1933 other sources and sinks such as stage discharge etc are specified by the boundary integrals to determine the contribution of rainfall evaporation to each element the spatially varying user specified rainfall evaporation intensity length time is multiplied by the area of the element and then equally distributed amongst the three nodes comprising the element the contribution of infiltration determined using either of the 2 available methods is partitioned in a similar way one of the fundamental pillars of numerical modeling of a continuum is the principle of the grid or mesh convergence savant 2010 and is defined as the process of removing grid or mesh resolution introduced bias such that further refinement of the mesh or grid does not substantially change the quantity of interest this process can be extremely cumbersome for the swe because every refinement of the mesh grid results in a larger number of cell or elements and consequently increases the degrees of freedom that require a solution the dwe again have an advantage here as a refinement to the same resolution as an swe simulation will only add one third of the number of degrees of freedom of the swe simulation in this paper the authors will present the development and the application of a dynamically adaptive numerical model that maximizes the aforementioned advantages of the dwe over the swe to obtain efficient and accurate solutions to the hydrodynamic phenomenon where the dwe is applicable to the authors knowledge the unique combination of fem wet dry scheme and dynamic mesh adaption for the solution of dwe has not been presented in literature prior to this study 2 numerical basis the fem discretization is performed over a triangular element mapped to a computational parent whose vertices lie at 0 0 0 1 1 0 the 2d linear basis functions denoted as ϕi used for trial function discretization are defined nodally on the parent element as 6 ϕ 1 1 χ η ϕ 2 χ ϕ 3 η where χ and η are locally defined variables whose values vary linearly from 0 to 1 in finite element fashion the linear trial functions are used to expand all solution variables so that for 3 node triangles the continuous fields discretize to 7 x 1 3 x i ϕ i χ η x 1 ϕ 1 χ η x 2 ϕ 2 χ η x 3 ϕ 3 χ η 8

written as 10 h x y t 1 3 h i x y t ϕ i x y where h x y t is time varying depth hereafter h will be used to refer to the time varying quantities in these equations ϕ is the basis function in the physical space the transformation from the computational element to the physical element utilizes the jacobian j defined as 11 j χ η x χ x η y χ y η the relationship between the physical element area denoted as λ and j is 12 λ 1 2 j χ η all finite element integrations are performed on the computational element the following equations for example are typical mass and stiffness transformations from the physical to parent domain physical element 13 m ω e 2 d ϕ i x y ϕ j x y d ω χ 0 1 η 0 1 χ ϕ i χ η ϕ j χ η 2 λ d χ d η and 14 k ω e 2 d ϕ i x ϕ j y d ω 1 2 λ χ 0 1 η 0 1 χ ϕ i x ϕ j y d χ d η where ω e 2 d 2d elemental domain hereafter referred to as ω e the numerical model is developed using a linear triangular element based fem framework based on continuous galerkin least squares gls in which unknowns are represented as linear lagrange polynomials as 15 h a x y t i ϕ i x y h i t where the subscript a indicates the approximate or discrete value of the variable and all other variables are as previously defined hereafter the subscript a will be dropped and all unknowns will be understood to represent discrete values it is well known that for an advection dominated problem the galerkin finite element solution will exhibit spurious oscillations in such advection dominated flow solutions the fe solution is stabilized by the addition of artificial diffusion that vanishes for all sufficiently smooth solutions the gls method works by adding least squares terms to the galerkin terms to provide artificial diffusion and enhance the stability of the galerkin method without unduly degrading the accuracy hughes et al 1989 gls does not alter the order of the galerkin approximation and therefore belongs to the consistent class of stabilization schemes bochev et al 2004 in general gls is an addition that stabilizes simple interpolations which would otherwise be unstable within a purely galerkin framework gls methods have been successfully applied to several problems where stability of the solution is of importance these include the solution of the helmholtz equation thompson and pinsky 1994 stokes flow xia and yao 2007 becker and braack 2001 incompressible flow sistek 2004 and others the presented work extends the application of gls to the solution of dwe defining the gls weight function as ψ ϕ φ trial gls function and integrating equation 4 by parts over the

indicates an elemental average the gls weight function takes the following form 18 φ u e ϕ i x v e ϕ i y τ is a weighing function governing the amount of gls contribution for advective systems the value of τ is usually dependent on the advective scales and velocities it is natural that τ be a function of the advective distance and the velocity in the presented model τ takes the following form 19 τ l e u e 2 v e 2 the exact form of the τ can be determined apriori for steady state problems for all other transient problems the form of τ is determined posteriori though trial and error zienkiewicz et al 2005 the parameter le is the spectral radius and can be thought of as equivalent to the scale of motion discretization in the presented model le is represented as follows 20 l e λ where λ is the element area notice that the discontinuous portion φ is composed of gradients of the continuous trial function and is only integrated against the discrete equation over the interior of the element this implies that essential boundary conditions are addressed by the continuous portion ϕ of the test weight function the temporal terms are expressed using an implicit finite difference

html 3 wetting and drying wetting and drying of the simulation domain is a natural part of any hydrodynamic simulation involving inundation of initially dry land and therefore is essential for accurate reproduction of the hydrodynamics in the system wetting and drying in the presented model relies on front tracking such that only the wet part of the domain is included in computations front tracking algorithms simulate the wet dry boundary by tracking the free surface across a partially wet element examples of this technique are presented in hervouet and janin 1994 bates and hervouet 1999 defina 2000 and horritt 2002 fig 1 illustrates a generic element e this element has four wetting drying possibilities 1 completely wet fig 1a in this case the entire element is integrated 2 one node dry fig 1b in this case the entire element is integrated as if it was completely wet subsequently the dry portion of the element is integrated and this contribution is subtracted from the contribution of the entire element 3 two nodes dry fig 1c in this case a new completely wet element is formed and this element is integrated the location of the wet dry line is determined by linearly interpolating the depths to zero 4 completely dry fig 1d in this case no integration is performed on the element 4 mesh adaption numerical simulation of riverine and overland flows oftentimes requires that the spatial resolution of the mesh be fine enough to capture the phenomenon of interest this is problematic in the case of transient events such as a flood wave in such cases static meshes meshes that do not change their resolution with time necessitate that the resolution required for these transient events be maintained for the duration of the simulation this increased resolution can add unnecessary computational burden to the solution procedure here a mesh that adapts spatially and temporally with changing hydrodynamic conditions might be of use several techniques to dynamically adapt a mesh exist such as the ones presented in 1 babuska et al 1995 based on the norm of classical energy 2 prudhomme 1999 based on differences between the gradients of independent variables 3 tate et al 2006 and 4 savant et al 2018 based on the norm of the continuity equation in swe the application of these dynamic mesh adaption techniques to real world simulations are infrequent because the computation of an adaption indicator is usually a global solve global solutions are computationally expensive and any advantage gained by adapting the mesh is lost through the computation of the adaption indicator therefore the adaption strategy adopted must rely on locally computed variables to determine any refinement indicators the refinement indicators presented by tate et al 2006 and savant et al 2018 are computed locally on the elements using variables computed through the primary computing strategy gls fem in the presented paper and is therefore computationally inexpensive the procedure presented by tate et al 2006 for 2d swe and savant et al 2018 for 3d swe is mathematically presented as follows 22 e e a e h t u x v y w z 2 d a e 1 2 a e here ae 1 local integration ee l3 t elemental refinement indicator for element e and ae area of the e th 2d element or volume of the i th 3d element in the presented paper the z components vanish the indicator presented in 22 relies on local mass conservation in the numerical framework into which it is implemented berger and howington 2002 and hughes et al 2000 have demonstrated that the general fem statement presented in this paper is locally as well as globally mass conservative when the conservative form of the continuity equation is used therefore the indicator presented in 22 is appropriate for use within the presented numerical model this indicator has been shown to perform well when used with 2d and 3d swe in correctly indicating areas of the mesh requiring refinement or coarsening savant et al 2011 mcalpin et al 2013 martin et al 2012 savant et al 2018 and is therefore chosen as the refinement indicator for implementation in this paper once an element has been flagged for refinement or adaption ee a user specified refinement limit the refinement procedure advances as below 1 the longest edge is split 2 the next longest edge is split and 3 the oldest edge is then split this process is repeated until the adaption reaches the maximum levels of refinement specified by the user when the indicator falls below the user specified error the unrefinement process progresses in the reverse order of how the adapted edges were formed this process is illustrated below in fig 2 for an element that is allowed to adapt twice using dynamic refinement un refinement assures that the model is utilizing the resolution required to accurately capture the hydrodynamics as they occur without having to unduly carry a high resolution for all times due to a singular event the authors note that generally adaption improves element aspect ratios but can infrequently cause the creation of badly shaped elements or bad nodal connectivity this is an area of active research arico et al 2011 present a delaunay condition based mesh adjustment that attempts to create well shaped elements the application of this approach to the presented adaption scheme is an area of ongoing research the efficacy of the implemented mesh adaption scheme will be demonstrated in the morganza control structure presented in the testing section 5 testing the testing procedure for the adaptive mesh dwe solver attempts to ascertain that 1 the dwe are implemented correctly 2 the adaption procedure is accurately capturing areas that require transient adaption and 3 the dwe solution is valid in cases where the application of dwe is suitable the authors present six test cases each designed to test the listed goals of the testing the first test case is a simple case that attempts to mimic the mass conservation and time of arrival properties listed in neelz and pender 2010 the second test case mimics the flooding of an extended floodplain hunter et al 2005 the third to compare model computed velocities with those reported the fourth test case mimics the flooding of an area due to rainfall and a point source of flow neelz and pender 2010 the fifth test case is the large scale riverine flooding and finally the sixth test case simulates a dam break all the presented test cases utilized dynamic mesh adaption and the adapted mesh is presented for test 2 the dam break test also presents the deviation of the dwe results from those computed using the swe the dwe is a degeneration of the swe by assuming that the friction and pressure terms in the momentum equations are the dominant terms driving flow if this assumption is true for a particular application the calculation of the full swe momentum using the velocity and depth results from the dwe should show that the swe momentum does indeed sum to zero or an extremely small error if this error is not zero any deviation is the error in the dwe assumptions the acceptability of the amount of variance from the dwe assumptions is dependent on the application and the intent of the simulation the deviation from swe is mathematically expressed as 23 u dwe h dwe t h dwe u dwe u dwe x h dwe u dwe v dwe y g 2 h dwe 2 x g h dwe s fx s x e r r o r x 24 v dwe h dwe t h dwe u dwe v dwe x h dwe v dwe v dwe y g 2 h dwe 2 y g h dwe s fy s y e r r o r y where udwe vdwe and hdwe are the variables computed through dwe since the dwe is obtained under the assumption that the pressure gravity terms are in balance with the friction terms the last two terms on the left hand side of eqs 23 and 24 eliminate each other and the error in the dwe assumption is written as 25 u dwe h dwe t h dwe u dwe u dwe x h dwe u dwe v dwe y e r r o r x 26 v dwe h dwe t h dwe u dwe v dwe x h dwe v dwe v dwe y e r r o r y 5 1 test case i the first test is adapted from neelz and pender 2010 to ascertain model capability to determine inundation extents and final infill depths the momentum of flow propagation in this test case is low and therefore this test is an appropriate test for the application of dwe because the contribution of inertial terms is extremely small and flow is governed through a balance between the friction and gravity terms the test domain consists of a series of depressions fig 3 into which water flows sequentially the inflow hydrograph fig 4 is applied as a line source of flow across a 100 m distance fig 3 the test was run for a period of 48 h and the flow behavior into the depressions analyzed fig 5 the numerical mesh consisted of 10 201 nodes forming 20 000 elements with a uniform size of approximately 199 m2 this resolution was just enough to capture the undulating bathymetry mesh adaption was utilized to capture the hydrodynamics in the domain as the depressions were filled and water spilled over into adjacent depressions neelz and pender 2010 provide an ensemble of results from several models for the sake of space we provide results from the 4th fig 5a and the 6th fig 5b depressions and suffice to say that the other depressions show similar behavior the model results compare very favorably to the published results the model captures the flow arrival time as well as the depth of inundation the inundation depths computed by the model had an average error of less than 0 05 m when compared to the published results fig 6 illustrates the error maximum of errorx and errory at all times for the simulation as is expected for an overland flooding problem the error or deviation from swe is extremely small and therefore the dwe is a good choice for this simulation 5 2 test case ii the second test is adapted from the widely used bates et al 2010 boonrawd and jothityangkoon 2015 li et al 2014 solution presented in hunter et al 2005 and is useful in evaluating the model capability to simulate the wetting of an initially dry region the analytical solution presented by hunter et al 2005 consists of the propagation of a shape preserving wetting front and can be written as 27 h 7 3 c n 2 u 3 x u t 3 7 where h is the depth of flow c is the constant of integration 0 for this test n is the mannings coefficient 0 01sec m1 3 for the presented test u is the velocity magnitude 1 m sec for the presented test and t is the time the simulation domain consisted of 272 nodes comprising 462 elements the average size of the elements was approximately 10800 m2 this base resolution was allowed to dynamically adapt as required to capture the hydrodynamics of the propagating flood wave it is reasonable to assume that as the flood wave propagates over the modeled domain 5000 m 1000 m the model should require additional resolution to not only capture the front but to capture the shape of the wave behind the front as well fig 7 illustrates three meshes 1 a coarse mesh 2 the fine mesh and 3 an adapted mesh at time 1300 sec the fine mesh consisted of 16 000 nodes forming 8241 elements the fine mesh elements had a uniform size of approximately 312 m2 fig 8 illustrates the state of inundation at 1300 s note that the adapted area matches the inundation fig 9 a and b presents a comparison of the coarse and adapted mesh generated results to the analytic solution the coarse mesh numerically diffuses the flood wave such that the wave propagates much farther than the analytic solution however the results from the adapted mesh closely match the analytic solution table 1 presents the root mean square error rmse comparisons for the coarse and adapted meshes when compared to the analytic solution 5 3 test case iii this test case adopted from neelz and pender 2010 is designed to determine the model capability to accurately compute flow velocities during the breach or overtopping of a protection feature the test domain fig 10 consists of a flat 2000 m 1000 m flat flood plain the domain receives a flow of 20 m3 sec over a 20 m segment of the domain for a period of 6 h representing the breach or the overtopping of a protection feature velocity observations were available at three locations shown in fig 12 model computed velocities will be compared with those reported at these locations a manning s n value of 0 05 was specified throughout the domain the numerical mesh consisted of 3714 nodes forming 18 561 elements the smallest element had a size of approximately 12 m2 and the largest element was approximately 42 m2 the finer resolution was targeted at locations where velocity observations were available to enable exact comparisons fig 11 illustrates the comparison between the model simulated and those reported in neelz and pender 2010 it is observed that the model computes velocities compare favorably to those reported this favorable comparison includes the velocity magnitude time of peak velocity as well as the general behavior of the velocity profile table 2 4 provide additional details on the behavior of model computed velocities and those reported the greatest errors occur at point 1 this location is close to the inflow boundary and the error in all likelihood is a consequence of boundary effects imparted by the numerical treatment 5 4 test case iv this test case adapted from neelz and pender 2010 is designed to determine model capability to correctly simulated flooding due to rainfall and from a point inflow source the test attempts to mimic a common urban flooding scenario where a rainfall event overwhelms the drainage system and consequently causes flooding due to a surcharging pipe or stormwater drain the domain fig 12 for this test case consists of a 400 m by 960 m block with two different kinds of land cover pavement and any other land cover type hence the roughness values were variable throughout the domain manning s n of 0 02 for pavements and 0 05 for other areas due to variable roughness the rainfall and the point source will preferentially travel through areas of lower roughness fig 12 illustrates the bathymetry of the domain as well as the location of pavement regions solid black lines in addition the figure also shows the location of the surcharging pipe marked by inflow and of 9 observation locations locations where the comparisons are shown in this paper are marked by black ovals the numerical simulation domain consisted of 110 346 nodes forming 219 330 elements the smallest element had a size of approximately 1 5 m2 and the largest element was approximately 10 m2 this level of resolution was required to accurately capture various features of the domain such as pavements and other varied areas the model was allowed to dynamically adapt to capture the hydrodynamics of the system the water forcing is provided by two distinct events 1 consisting of a uniform rainfall and 2 a surcharging point source of flow fig 13 the model was run for a total duration of 5 h and model results compared to those reported in neelz and pender 2010 again the simulation was executed with dynamic mesh adaption on the base or the initial mesh was created to capture the bathymetry and the delineation between the paved unpaved regions non adaptive simulations were not attempted for this test case as the previous test demonstrated that coarse static meshes do not accurately capture pertinent flow phenomenon fig 14 provides a comparison of the model simulated flows and those reported in neelz and pender 2010 the model accurately computes the inundation water level as well as the flood wave arrival times at all location for the sake for conserving space the authors present these comparisons at 4 representative locations this test case is a typical application of the dwe to an urban flooding scenario and therefore the errors introduced into the solution from the dwe assumption should be small a maximum deviation from swe of 10 3 m2 s2 was using eqs 25 26 this computed error is indeed extremely small hence the utilization of dwe is appropriate for this test 5 5 test case v this test case simulates the flooding in the morganza floodway as a consequence of the mississippi river floods in 2011 and the opening of the morganza control structure mcs fig 15 the operation of mcs caused the morganza floodway to be inundated as the flood wave progressed this flooding was previously simulated using the full swe model presented in savant et al 2011 and results presented in bell et al 2017 this simulation is conducive to the application of dwe as the regional bathymetry is not steep and the land is vegetated causing frictional forces to be dominant over inertial forces the swe simulations presented in bell et al 2017 utilize land classification dependent roughness characteristics fig 15 and table 5 and therefore the dwe simulation utilized the same land classification based roughness characterization fig 16 presents the inflow hydrograph applied at the mcs the hydrograph has a stepped appearance because flow through the mcs is governed by upstream flow criteria and flow is modified when certain conditions such as stage and discharge are achieved bell et al 2017 the numerical mesh for this simulation consisted of 175 000 nodes comprising a total of 337 591 elements the smallest element was approximately 300 m2 and the largest was approximately 5000 m2 the model was allowed to dynamically adapt to capture system hydrodynamics fig 17 presents the results of the dwe simulation and the validated swe simulation bell et al 2017 at the four observation locations presented in fig 15 the dwe simulated flooding closely follows the flooding simulated by swe while consuming significantly less computing time 3 h compared to 21 h on 1 processor with an average error of less than 0 1 m this test illustrates that when appropriately applied the dwe provides results with the same accuracy as a full swe simulation the dwe deviation from swe for this application is extremely small and of the order of 10 3 m2 s2 to ascertain the computational efficiency gained by the adaptive meshing the performance of a converged fine static mesh 500 000 million nodes was compared to that of the dynamically adapting mesh adapted to a maximum of 260 000 nodes for 6 9 of simulation time these simulations were performed on 800 processors and the comparison is shown in table 6 it is observed that the dynamically adapting mesh incurred a cost approximately 35 less than that incurred by the fine static mesh 5 6 test case vi this test case is presented to illustrate the limits of the dwe and the consequences of its application to simulations that may violate dwe assumptions this test simulated the explosive failure of the malpasset dam france in 1959 the resulting flood wave was approximately 40 m high and resulted in 433 casualties and destroyed infrastructure including three transformers the time of failure of these transformers are known and will be utilized along with other observed data to validate model performance the flooding caused due to the failure of malpasset dam has been successfully simulated using swe without morphologic change considerations by valiani et al 2002 schwanenberg 2004 erpicum et al 2004 and savant et al 2011 therefore this modeling exercise will not consider morphologic change either the failure of the dam and the wave propagation has been widely studied to determine the maximum water surface elevations reached due to the flood wave these maximum water surface elevations are numbered p1 to p17 fig 18 in addition experimental data is available from a scaled physical model built at laboratoire national d hydraulique in 1964 the scale factor of the undistorted model is 1 400 the observations from this model are numbered s6 s14 with s1 s5 located in the reservoir the valley below the dam is considered completely dry and the water surface elevation behind the dam is assumed to be 100 m these conditions have been utilized by several researchers and have provided accurate results of the flood wave and the water surface elevations valiani et al 2002 schwanenberg 2004 a constant manning s n value of 0 033 s m1 3 for the entire domain is utilized the simulation was executed using the presented dwe model and the full swe model presented in savant et al 2011 to illustrate the errors in the dwe results the numerical domain for this problem consisted of 29 391 nodes comprising 56 698 elements the smallest element was approximately 250 m2 and the largest approximately 1130 m2 the model was allowed to dynamically adapt to capture the dam break wave and other hydrodynamic phenomenon tables 7 9 list the comparison of model simulated values to those observed surveyed in the field the dwe model does not accurately simulate the depth of inundation or the time of arrival this is due to the fact that for most large dam break problems the flood wave controls inundation behavior and the vicinity of the flood wave is where the dwe assumptions break down a simple scaling analysis at a single time t using average values for depth over the location shown in fig 19 shows that the pressure and slope terms are 0 5 m2 s2 and therefore the inertial terms for a valid dwe application must be small compared to 0 5 m2 s2 fig 19 shows the bottom elevation depth and water surface profiles used however an analysis fig 19 using eqs 25 26 show that the deviation from swe due to the dwe assumption are several order of magnitude greater than the gravity pressure and friction terms this test case though inappropriate for the usage of the dwe for the simulation of such a dam break provides a robust test case to analyze the capability of the adaptive mesh algorithms in the model to capture the propagating flood wave fig 20 shows the initial coarse mesh and the state of the hydrodynamics at 100 s into the dam break for the fine and the dynamically adapting coarse mesh the dynamically adapting coarse mesh provides inundation and location of wave results that are similar to those obtained using the converged fine scale static mesh while reducing the computational time by a factor of 6 5 125 s for the dynamically adapting coarse mesh compared to 821 s for the converged static mesh the initial dynamically adapting mesh was created with 6600 nodes to capture the bathymetry of the domain whereas the static fine mesh created to capture the entirety of the physics at all times had a total of 29 400 nodes at the peak node count the dynamically adapting coarse mesh had a maximum count of 12 456 nodes the wide disparity in the static fine mesh and the dynamically adapting mesh while simulating similar hydrodynamics illustrates the benefit of a dynamically adapting mesh in terms of reduced computational burden the dynamic mesh adaption algorithms are designed to optimize the equation being solved the dwe in the presented paper and not to ascertain the appropriateness of the equation being used to solve a particular problem therefore even though the adaptive mesh provides results similar to the static fine mesh it does not accurately solve the hydrodynamics because the swe is the appropriate equation to be used for this particular simulation 6 comparison of dwe and swe performance and multi processor behavior as previously mentioned in the introductory notes massively parallel swe based numerical codes are available and efficiently simulate large scale hydrodynamics jiang et al 2005 song et al 1994 rao 2004 vacondio et al 2017 savant et al 2011 tate et al 2012 the efficiency and utility of swe based numerical codes is well established and not in question what is of interest is the relative efficiency of swe and dwe based numerical codes for problems where dwe based numerical codes are applicable the authors ascertain this relative efficiency through the application of a full swe based numerical code presented in savant et al 2011 and the dwe model presented here to the simulation of the flooding caused by the operation of the morganza floodway test case presented previously the simulations were executed on 240 300 360 420 480 540 600 660 720 800 900 1080 1400 and 1800 processors using the sgi ice x supercomputing system topaz located at the engineer research and development center erdc of the us army corps of engineers usace topaz has a peak capacity of 4 66 pflops on 3 456 compute nodes with each compute node consisting of 36 processors the dwe based numerical code shows increasing model efficiency till 800 processors at processor counts larger than 800 the model efficiency decreases fig 21 this decrease in efficiency is because at higher processor counts the processors incur excessive expenditure in inter processor communications compared to the solution procedure the swe based numerical code shows increasing efficiency till 1400 processors this behavior for the dwe as well as swe numerical codes is presented in fig 21 it is observed that the fastest dwe simulation is 2360 s while the fastest swe simulation requires 4560 s for completion it must be noted that the slowest dwe simulation took 4700 s this is comparable to the fastest swe simulation this is a direct consequence of the non linearity imparted by the swe to the solution procedure as well as the increase in the dof it must be understood that timing emerges from implementation and that the exact behavior might vary from model to model but the general behavior should be the same across models the serial as well as the parallel versions of the code both for dwe and swe are written in the c programming language and utilize the same data structures the code can be compiled in serial or in parallel parallel builds of the code require an additional data structure consisting of all the necessary variables and communication protocols message passing within the parallel build is implemented through the industry standard message passing interface mpi mpi calls for parallel execution are bound within preprocessor definitions statements ifdef to enable computational and memory efficiency for parallel execution the mesh grid is broken down and processors read the data pertinent to their own sub domain sub grid sub mesh the code utilizes the parallel graph partitioning and fill reducing matrix ordering parmeteis karypis 2013 software to dynamically redistribute nodes during run time for adaptive model execution this redistribution repartitioning balances the nodal load each processor bears during run time the authors again emphasize that dwe should be used for a limited set of hydrodynamic simulations where the dwe is valid the presented model provides error output indicating variance from the swe an example is presented in fig 20 if the computed variance is large and or in the area of interest the simulation must discard the dwe and utilize the swe to avoid erroneous results and subsequent erroneous engineering scientific management decisions irrespective of the efficiency imparted by the utilization of dwe 7 conclusions the authors present the development and application of a diffusive wave equation model based implicit and mesh adaptive tool for urban and overland flow the model based on the galerkin least squares gls finite element method accurately and efficiently simulated several flow conditions such as the flooding of a flood plain and flooding in an urban area the dynamically adapting mesh technique presented reduced the time required for simulations by as much as 5 6 times compared to a converged fine resolution static mesh dynamic mesh adaption though extremely beneficial brought to light some infrequent shortcomings of the adaption procedure wherein bad nodal connectivity and poorly shaped adapted elements are formed these bad nodal connectivity and poorly formed elements can cause unstable and inaccurate simulations the error introduced in the simulations due to the dwe assumptions was analyzed and found to be extremely small compared to the friction and pressure terms for all test cases except for the malpasset dam break simulation the malpasset dam break simulation with dwe computed erroneous flood depths and time of arrival when compared to the observed as well as the results from swe simulations this is due to the fact that for a large dam break the dwe assumptions are invalid and inertial terms are several orders of magnitude larger compared to the friction terms an analysis of the exact source of error in terms of which inertial terms was not undertaken and presents an area of future research and can hold the promise of possibly extending or modifying the dwe to include other terms to account for the errors from dwe assumptions the inaccuracy of the dwe to the solution of the flooding caused by the malpasset dam failure does not indicate that the dwe cannot be used for the simulation of all dam breaks however it does serve as caution towards the affinity to use the dwe due to its stability and efficiency for all hydrodynamic flooding simulations the simulation of malpasset dam break test case abundantly indicates that care must be exercised when interpreting dwe based numerical model results in simulations where inertial terms are significant in addition viscosity terms are neglected in the dwe therefore for simulations that include significant energy transfer through the formation of eddies dwe results will be inaccurate acknowledgements and funding source the authors gratefully acknowledge all reviewers for their

6497,intertidal flats are shallow water environments that undergo cyclical variations in water depth leading to a frequent occurrence of extremely shallow water stages esws water depths 0 2 m however relatively little is known about the hydrodynamic conditions and erosion accretion processes during esws because the water depth is too shallow to measure in situ sediment dynamic processes using traditional methods to address this gap based on in situ measurements with four advanced instruments we quantified the hydrodynamic conditions erosion and accretion during esws in calm weather conditions on a highly turbid intertidal flat in jiangsu coast china our results revealed that marked erosion and accretion occurred during esws at the flood and ebb tidal stages respectively the resulting bed level changes were three times greater during esws than relatively deep water stages rdws water depths 0 2 m and the rate of change was an order of magnitude faster than during rdws this larger and faster bed level change occurred even though the esws duration only accounted for 10 of the entire tidal cycle this result occurred because the bed shear stress due to combined current wave action during esws was on average two times higher than during rdws at the flood stage causing more extensive erosion whereas during the ebb stage this shear stress during esws was only half of that during rdws resulting in greater accretion the main implications of these results are that because esws occur frequently twice every tide and are associated with large bed shear stress and bed level changes these conditions are likely to play an important role in morphological changes of intertidal flats our study shows that esws have a key influence on intertidal flat hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics thus our results are the basis for an improved understanding of the coastal morphodynamic processes on intertidal flats keywords extremely shallow water stages bed level changes hydrodynamics sediment transport 1 introduction intertidal flats are generally broad shallowly sloping intertidal zones with fine grained sedimentary deposits eisma 1998 these flats are highly productive components of shelf ecosystems le hir et al 2000 ysebaert et al 2003 balke et al 2011 suykerbuyk et al 2016 supporting large numbers of invertebrates and fish barbier 2013 bouma et al 2016 and playing a key role in recycling organic matter and nutrients from both terrestrial and marine sources kautsky and evans 1987 meziane and tsuchiya 2000 li et al 2012 thus developing an in depth understanding of the processes that drive the dynamics of intertidal flats is important for management strategies and engineer design one particular area that requires further investigation is the hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes that occur during extremely shallow water stages esws defined in this study as stages of water depth h 0 2 m previous studies have focused primarily on relatively deep water stages rdws defined here as h 0 2 m revealing that the non linear interactions between waves and currents on intertidal flats are responsible for strong turbulent mixing in the bottom boundary layer e g dyer 1989 le hir et al 2000 macvean and lacy 2014 yang et al 2016 yu et al 2017 sediment transport in the tidal water column e g janssen stelder 2000 wang et al 2012 shi et al 2016 and morphological evolution e g andersen et al 2006 shi et al 2014 hu et al 2015 however intertidal flats worldwide are predominately shallow water environments flats experience regular temporal spatial variations in water depth due to cycles of emergence and submergence leading to the frequent occurrence of extremely shallow water conditions gao 2010 fagherazzi and mariotti 2012 zhang et al 2016 in general every tide has two esws which are the initial stage of the flood tide and the following ebb tide in comparison with rdws the maximum or minimum suspended sediment concentration ssc and current velocity within an entire tidal cycle may occur during esws gao 2010 zhang et al 2016 although this stage can be very short typically several minutes but sometimes only several seconds with an entire tidal cycle gao 2010 there is considerable potential for sediment transport and erosion accretion during esws downing et al 1981 wang et al 2012 shi et al 2017 therefore esws might play a significant role in controlling the overall topography of intertidal flats fagherazzi and mariotti 2012 for example esws may promote the formation and destruction of micro topography such as sand ripples and grooves zhang et al 2016 further resulting in the formation and modification of larger geomorphic units zhou et al 2014 our understanding of the potentially important role of esws in the dynamics of intertidal flats is limited because field investigations of hydrodynamic and erosion accretion processes during esws are rare e g gao 2010 zhang et al 2016 the main reasons for this are twofold first the extensive field instrumentation needed to gain integrated measurements of hydrodynamics erosion accretion and sediment transport processes during esws is technologically challenging williams et al 2008 fagherazzi and mariotti 2012 macvean and lacy 2014 secondly there are few reliable numerical models for modeling sediment dynamic processes during esws due to difficulties in obtaining solvable equations for the complex sediment exchange and strong turbulent mixing processes in these conditions therefore this paper examines how hydrodynamic conditions sscs and bed erosion accretion processes differ between esws and rdws on a highly turbid intertidal flat off the jiangsu coast china we present time series field measurements of current velocities waves sscs and bed level changes throughout a number of tidal cycles under calm weather conditions these continuous measurements form the basis for evaluating the link between hydrodynamics and bed level changes during esws our data provide new insights into the importance of esws in controlling bed erosion accretion processes and highlight that esws are critical in driving morphological change on intertidal flats 2 study area our study site is located on the rudong intertidal flat jiangsu coast china this area comprises the largest radial shaped tidal sand ridge system on the chinese continental shelf in the southwestern yellow sea fig 1 a the study area is a well developed intertidal flat with a gentle slope 0 018 0 022 and width of several kilometers in the seaward direction zhu et al 1986 wang and ke 1997 the intertidal flat is a macrotidal area with a semi diurnal tide and mean tidal range of 3 9 5 5 m ren et al 1985 wang and ke 1997 xing et al 2012 the flat is highly turbid due to the abundant sediment supply from the yangtze river and abandoned yellow river fig 1a the study area experiences frequent variations in water depth and esws occurs twice every tide and approximately four times each day a small wave height of 1 m generally characterizes the study area during normal weather and the annual average wind speed is 4 5 m s ren 1986 the intertidal area is generally flat and has no obvious tidal creek near the study site fig 1b the surface sediments are mainly silt 8 63 µm on the upper tidal flat and fine sand 63 125 µm on the middle tidal flat wang and ke 1997 3 materials and methods 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 data collection the field campaigns were conducted from november 28 to december 2 2016 all instruments were installed firmly on a custom made frame with an open structure and two stainless steel legs fig 2 the relative height above the bed and setup of the instruments are detailed in fig 2 and table 1 respectively near bed turbulent boundary velocities were measured using a downward looking 6 mhz nortek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv measurement accuracy of 1 mm s data output rate of 1 64 hz at a sampling frequency of 16 hz in 5 min bursts 4096 points per 5 min time series the adv was fastened to the custom made frame with the probe head positioned 0 2 m above the bed table 1 and measured the 3d turbulent velocity at a standoff distance of just 0 15 m from the probe head fig 2 thus the turbulent velocities were measured at a height of 0 05 m above the bed surface to measure the turbulent velocity the probe must be submerged meaning that measurements of current velocities could only be undertaken when the water depth was 0 2 m i e not during esws in addition to measuring the turbulent velocity the adv probe recorded a time series of distance with an accuracy of 1 mm between the probe head and the local bed surface at 1 hz as such actual bed elevation changes could be extracted from the time series andersen et al 2007 salehi and strom 2012 the accuracy of the adv measurements is robust and has been tested extensively in the laboratory salehi and strom 2012 and in the field andersen et al 2007 wang et al 2014 shi et al 2015 to capture the current velocity during esws an electromagnetic current meter emcm was used because this instrument is not affected by blind measurement areas has a very small measurement volume and a small probe diameter 3 cm to measure the 2d current velocity as close to the bed as possible the emcm was deployed at a height of only 0 05 m above the bed and operated at a burst period of 30 s and sampling frequency of 2 hz fig 2 table 1 wave height was measured at a sampling frequency of 4 hz over a 256 s period using a sbe 26plus seagauge wave and tide recorder accuracy of 0 01 of the full scale table 1 the sbe 26plus was installed horizontally on the bed and its pressure sensor was located 0 05 cm above the bed i e as close to the bed as possible to record waves during esws fig 2 the sbe 26plus collected 1024 measurements per burst and the mean water level was obtained every 10 min table 1 on the intertidal flat the wave period was generally 2 5 s and thus each burst recorded 100 waves for estimation of wave height and period an optical backscattering sensor obs 3a self recording turbidity temperature monitoring instrument was used to make in situ measurements of turbidity at a sampling frequency of 1 hz with its sensor facing outward at a height of 0 05 m above the bed table 1 fig 2 to calibrate the in situ turbidity measurements in the laboratory in situ water samples were collected at the same height as the obs 3a measurements on a small boat near the observation site 3 1 2 determination of esws duration and bed level changes the adv probes were exposed to air and stopped working when the water depth was 0 2 m thus the adv instrument could not record the time at which the water attained a zero depth or the distance between the adv probe and bed surface at this time therefore a boat anchored near the observation site recorded this time using a watch and the distance using a ruler for the initial stage of flood tide the duration δtf i and bed level change δdf i of esws for each tide were estimated as follows 1 δ t f i t f i t f b i 2 δ d f i d f i d f b i where tf i and df i are the time and distance respectively recorded when the water attained a zero depth at the initial stage of flood tide i and tf b i and df b i are the time and distance respectively recorded by the adv at the first effective burst when h 0 2 m during the flood tide stage for the post ebb tide stage the duration δte i and bed level change δde i of esws for each tide were estimated as follows 3 δ t e i t e b i t e i 4 δ d e i d e b i d e i where te b i and de b i are the time and distance respectively recorded by the adv in the last effective burst during the ebb stage during tide i i e when h 0 2 m and te i and de i are the time and distance respectively recorded when the water attained a zero depth at the post ebb tide stage during tide i 3 2 estimation of bed shear stress the variation in bed shear stress within an entire tidal cycle was estimated using a current wave interaction model specifically the bed shear stress due to waves τw was calculated using the theory of wave orbital velocity a1 in appendix a and wave friction a3 and a4 in appendix a and the bed shear stress due to currents τc was calculated using the theory of bottom boundary layers a5 and a6 in appendix a and friction velocity u the bed shear stress due to combined current wave action τcw was calculated using the grant and madsen 1979 model a classic current wave interaction model a7 in appendix a which has been widely used in the estimation of τcw e g lyne et al 1990 mellor 2002 feddersen et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 the bottom sediments were mainly very fine sand at study site a the median grain size d 50 was 113 μm during the field measurements thus we determined the critical shear stress for erosion τcr using the shields 1936 equation b3 b4 and b5 in appendix b which has been applied by miller et al 1977 soulsby 1997 and yang et al 2016 in this study we used a value of 0 1 n m2 based on this median grain size 4 results 4 1 wind wave and current data during field measurements offshore winds ranged in speed from 0 6 to 7 5 m s with a mean of 3 5 m s fig 3 a which was weaker than the annual mean wind speed of 4 5 m s relatively weak winds generated small waves during the field measurements thus the maximum wave height was just 0 39 m fig 3b wave height within an entire tidal cycle tended to be largest at the high water level and smallest at the low water level fig 3b the wave height was at its minimum during esws fig 3b perhaps due to the positive relationship between wave height and water depth wave period and water depth showed the same temporal pattern the maximum wave period was only 4 3 s which tended to occur at high water levels and the minimum 1 s occurred at esws during each tide fig 3b c current velocity was rotational for the entire tidal cycle fig 3d the maximum current velocity occurred during esws in the initial flood stage 0 1 0 59 m s in an onshore direction towards the south and was greater than the current velocity during esws in the post flood stage when the current direction switched to offshore fig 3d the current during rdws tended to have an onshore direction in the flood stage offshore direction in the ebb stage and a smaller velocity than during esws in the initial flood stage fig 3d 4 2 bed shear stresses 4 2 1 shear stress due to waves τw and currents τc the τw values varied little within a tidal cycle 0 01 0 15 n m2 fig 4 b table 2 as a result of weak winds and small wave heights fig 3b under the calm weather conditions the τw values during esws were comparable with those during rdws table 2 the maximum τc value occurred during esws in the flood stage fig 4b the average τc during esws in the flood stage 0 30 0 64 n m2 was several times greater than during esws at the corresponding ebb stage 0 07 0 16 n m2 and was also greater than the average value during a rdws in a corresponding tide 0 11 0 13 n m2 table 2 4 2 2 shear stress due to combined current wave action τcw the maximum τ cw value within a tidal cycle occurred during esws in the flood stage fig 4b and the average τcw during these stages ranged from 0 36 to 0 70 n m2 and was greater than τcr 0 1 n m2 in contrast the average τcw during esws at the corresponding ebb stage ranged from 0 03 to 0 09 n m2 and was less than the average τcr fig 4b for rdws the average τcw varied little ranging from 0 12 to 0 14 n m2 and was slightly greater than the average τcr 4 3 suspended sediment concentration the average ssc during esws at the flooding stage 0 69 kg m3 was two times higher than at the ebb stage 0 33 kg m3 table 2 fig 4c in contrast the average ssc during rdws was lower than during esws at the corresponding flood stage and was higher than at the corresponding ebb stage table 2 fig 4c 4 4 duration of esws and rdws the duration of esws at the ebb stage 30 min was 1 5 times longer than that at the corresponding flood stage 22 min and the duration of esws only accounted for 10 of the entire tidal cycle table 3 in contrast the duration of rdws was 457 min on average which was almost nine times longer than the average total duration 52 min of esws thus rdws accounted for 90 of the entire tidal cycle table 3 4 5 bed level changes during the entire field campaign the distance from the adv probe to the bed surface ranged from 280 to 285 mm indicating that the overall bed level change was just 5 mm negative denoting erosion fig 4d the bed level change during esws was much greater than that during rdws table 3 fig 4d erosion occurred during esws at the flooding stage of the tide with an average magnitude of 7 4 mm 4 2 to 10 3 mm per tide at an average rate of 0 4 mm min 0 2 to 0 5 mm min table 3 in contrast accretion occurred during esws in the ebb stage and the rate of this accretion was comparable to that of erosion with the average amount being 9 2 mm 4 4 to 14 5 mm positive denoting accretion per tide at an average rate of 0 3 mm min 0 1 to 0 5 mm min table 3 however the rate of bed level change for rdws was much lower with an average amount of 2 5 mm 3 5 to 7 0 mm per tide at an average rate of 0 6 10 2 mm min 1 10 2 to 2 10 2 mm min table 3 therefore the magnitude of bed level change during esws was three times greater than that during rdws and its rate was an order of magnitude higher despite esws making up just 10 of the tidal cycle table 3 5 discussion our results reveal that strong erosion and weak accretion occurred during esws at the flood and ebb stages of a tide respectively and relatively weak erosion occurred during rdws in almost all tidal cycles table 3 fig 4d this difference can be explained by the theory of sediment erosion accretion appendix b winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 and the contrast in bed shear stress between esws and rdws the average erosion flux fe during esws in the flood stage was greater than that during rdws because the average τcw during esws in the flood stage was two times higher than during rdws in a corresponding tidal cycle table 2 fig 4b and greater than τcr in contrast in the ebb stage the average fe during esws was zero due to τcw τcr and the average depositional flux fd was much greater than during rdws because the average τcw during esws was only half of the average τcw during rdws table 2 fig 4b the τcw values were much lower than τcr values during esws resulting in greater accretion this accretion occurred during periods of much higher near bed sscs than were observed during rdws table 2 reflecting relatively weak hydrodynamic conditions a detailed comparison of the bed level changes and durations of esws and rdws showed that esws were characterized by much shorter duration 10 of the entire tidal cycle and larger and faster bed level changes table 3 morphological changes are generally related to not only the magnitude of extreme events but also the frequency of their occurrence wolman and miller 1960 thus when considering the effects of esws on geomorphic processes on the studied intertidal flat we should note that although short in duration esws occur twice every tidal cycle and there are two daily tidal cycles at this site e g wang et al 2012 xing et al 2012 therefore esws occurs frequently on the intertidal flat given this high frequency and that esws are marked by large values of bed shear stress these conditions have an important influence on the morphological development of intertidal flats to illustrate this we estimated the annual net cumulative bed level change induced by esws to be about 66 cm whereas this is about 182 cm during rdws therefore esws play a significant role in the annual replenishment of sediments given that our field investigations were undertaken in calm weather conditions we can infer that in rough or stormy weather conditions the magnitude of bed level changes during esws could be even larger it is important to consider whether our results are site specific or are applicable to other intertidal environments based on a limited number of previous studies we suggest the latter is the case for the following reason surges or pulses in tidal velocity have been identified in association with high sscs in esws in different types of intertidal flats such as i sandy and muddy coasts e g postma 1967 bayliss smith et al 1979 gao 2010 nowacki and ogston 2013 zhang et al 2016 ii different geomorphic units within intertidal systems such as tidal creeks and runnels fagherazzi et al 2008 fagherazzi and mariotti 2012 hughes 2012 iii in a range of intertidal systems such as channel flat and salt marsh systems pethick 1980 wang et al 1999 nowacki and ogston 2013 and iv under a range of meteorological conditions including calm and stormy weather wang et al 1999 zhang et al 2016 these observations suggest that this velocity surging pulsing is common during esws in almost all tidal cycles in intertidal environments worldwide furthermore based on the results of zhang et al 2016 these surges can produce large bed shear stress up to 1 5 n m2 at the beginning of the flood tide which is an order of magnitude higher than the critical shear stress of sediments commonly found on intertidal flats therefore it is reasonable to expect that this surge could re suspend and transport a large amount of bottom sediment resulting in erosion at the beginning of the flood tide this inference is in agreement with the strong erosion observed during esws in our study previous studies have been conducted on field measurement of esws zhang et al 2016 shi et al 2017 for example shi et al 2017 have estimated the bed level changes of esws during windy weather conditions on the same intertidal flat as this study but on a different section their results have showed that bed level changes due to erosion under calm conditions were six times lower than those reported in shi et al 2017 14 7 mm in shi et al 2017 vs 2 3 mm this study while bed level changes due to accretion was slightly higher under our calm conditions 6 8 mm this study vs 5 1 mm in shi et al 2017 the reason is that this study was made under calm conditions which representing a rather weak intertidal sediment dynamics while the results in shi et al 2017 represented relative stronger hydrodynamics since the wind speed could reached up to 13 6 m s shi et al 2017 showing that weather conditions can be an important factor in determining the importance of esws in morphological changes the limitations of this study are that we lacked the field data needed to measure in big detail time series of bed level change to study processes and mechanism of sediment erosion accretion transport biogeochemical cycle and micro topography formation during esws therefore the further avenues of research on sedimentary processes and hydrodynamics during esws should focus on the following 1 spatial comparisons of sediment transport processes during esws in the subtidal middle and high intertidal zones hydrodynamics in these zones may differ greatly during esws compared with other periods driving morphological change 2 a comparison of sedimentary processes during esws in microtidal mesotidal and macrotidal intertidal flats sheltered and exposed intertidal flats and under calm and stormy weather conditions for example our study was performed under weak wind conditions and there will likely be a difference in sedimentary processes under rough or storm weather conditions 3 investigation of the interactions between hydrodynamics and micro topography e g ripples micro topography formation and destruction are common during esws zhang et al 2016 this micro topography can greatly increase bottom friction ke et al 1994 which can slow current velocities and tidal wave propagation friedrichs and madsen 1992 le hir et al 2000 thus this enhanced bottom friction could increase turbulence within the near bed region nezu and nakagawa 1993 and possibly bed level change therefore there is a need to undertake integrated and high resolution measurements of currents waves sscs bed level changes and micro topography during esws to better understand their interactions 4 smaller instrument measurement volumes and standoff distances are required to facilitate in situ measurements in extremely shallow water environments to allow improved parameterization of turbulence and sediment transport 5 examination of the effects of sediment transport processes during esws on biogeochemical cycling esws are usually characterized by high sscs gao 2010 which are rich in trace metals nutrients organic carbon and anthropogenic contaminants dyer et al 2000 grabowski et al 2011 thus such large and frequent erosion and accretion during esws are likely to play an important role in biogeochemical cycling 6 conclusions integrated field measurements of current velocities waves sscs and bed level changes on an intertidal flat have quantified the hydrodynamic and sediment erosion accretion processes during esws close to the seabed our major findings and their implications are as follows 1 the τcw values during esws in the initial flood stage were greater than the τcr values and the τcw values during esws in the post ebb stage were less than the τcr values these differences in hydrodynamics led to strong erosion and accretion during esws in the flood and ebb stage of a tide respectively relatively weak erosion occurred during rdws in almost all tidal cycles this indicated a large difference in sediment dynamics between esws and rdws 2 bed level changes during esws were three times greater than during rdws in a corresponding tide and the rate of change was an order of magnitude higher than during rdws these larger and more rapid changes occurred because τcw values during esws were on average two times higher than during rdws at the flood stage and at the ebb stage τcw values were just half of the average τcw value during rdws these bed level changes occurred even though esws made up only 10 of the entire tidal cycle 3 esws occur twice in every tide given that large bed shear stresses and bed level changes were associated with esws this indicated that esws has an important influence on morphological changes on intertidal flats 4 our results demonstrated that esws have an important control on near bed hydrodynamics that influence sediment dynamics and morphological changes thus further investigations into the relationships between hydrodynamics micro topography and

6497,intertidal flats are shallow water environments that undergo cyclical variations in water depth leading to a frequent occurrence of extremely shallow water stages esws water depths 0 2 m however relatively little is known about the hydrodynamic conditions and erosion accretion processes during esws because the water depth is too shallow to measure in situ sediment dynamic processes using traditional methods to address this gap based on in situ measurements with four advanced instruments we quantified the hydrodynamic conditions erosion and accretion during esws in calm weather conditions on a highly turbid intertidal flat in jiangsu coast china our results revealed that marked erosion and accretion occurred during esws at the flood and ebb tidal stages respectively the resulting bed level changes were three times greater during esws than relatively deep water stages rdws water depths 0 2 m and the rate of change was an order of magnitude faster than during rdws this larger and faster bed level change occurred even though the esws duration only accounted for 10 of the entire tidal cycle this result occurred because the bed shear stress due to combined current wave action during esws was on average two times higher than during rdws at the flood stage causing more extensive erosion whereas during the ebb stage this shear stress during esws was only half of that during rdws resulting in greater accretion the main implications of these results are that because esws occur frequently twice every tide and are associated with large bed shear stress and bed level changes these conditions are likely to play an important role in morphological changes of intertidal flats our study shows that esws have a key influence on intertidal flat hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics thus our results are the basis for an improved understanding of the coastal morphodynamic processes on intertidal flats keywords extremely shallow water stages bed level changes hydrodynamics sediment transport 1 introduction intertidal flats are generally broad shallowly sloping intertidal zones with fine grained sedimentary deposits eisma 1998 these flats are highly productive components of shelf ecosystems le hir et al 2000 ysebaert et al 2003 balke et al 2011 suykerbuyk et al 2016 supporting large numbers of invertebrates and fish barbier 2013 bouma et al 2016 and playing a key role in recycling organic matter and nutrients from both terrestrial and marine sources kautsky and evans 1987 meziane and tsuchiya 2000 li et al 2012 thus developing an in depth understanding of the processes that drive the dynamics of intertidal flats is important for management strategies and engineer design one particular area that requires further investigation is the hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes that occur during extremely shallow water stages esws defined in this study as stages of water depth h 0 2 m previous studies have focused primarily on relatively deep water stages rdws defined here as h 0 2 m revealing that the non linear interactions between waves and currents on intertidal flats are responsible for strong turbulent mixing in the bottom boundary layer e g dyer 1989 le hir et al 2000 macvean and lacy 2014 yang et al 2016 yu et al 2017 sediment transport in the tidal water column e g janssen stelder 2000 wang et al 2012 shi et al 2016 and morphological evolution e g andersen et al 2006 shi et al 2014 hu et al 2015 however intertidal flats worldwide are predominately shallow water environments flats experience regular temporal spatial variations in water depth due to cycles of emergence and submergence leading to the frequent occurrence of extremely shallow water conditions gao 2010 fagherazzi and mariotti 2012 zhang et al 2016 in general every tide has two esws which are the initial stage of the flood tide and the following ebb tide in comparison with rdws the maximum or minimum suspended sediment concentration ssc and current velocity within an entire tidal cycle may occur during esws gao 2010 zhang et al 2016 although this stage can be very short typically several minutes but sometimes only several seconds with an entire tidal cycle gao 2010 there is considerable potential for sediment transport and erosion accretion during esws downing et al 1981 wang et al 2012 shi et al 2017 therefore esws might play a significant role in controlling the overall topography of intertidal flats fagherazzi and mariotti 2012 for example esws may promote the formation and destruction of micro topography such as sand ripples and grooves zhang et al 2016 further resulting in the formation and modification of larger geomorphic units zhou et al 2014 our understanding of the potentially important role of esws in the dynamics of intertidal flats is limited because field investigations of hydrodynamic and erosion accretion processes during esws are rare e g gao 2010 zhang et al 2016 the main reasons for this are twofold first the extensive field instrumentation needed to gain integrated measurements of hydrodynamics erosion accretion and sediment transport processes during esws is technologically challenging williams et al 2008 fagherazzi and mariotti 2012 macvean and lacy 2014 secondly there are few reliable numerical models for modeling sediment dynamic processes during esws due to difficulties in obtaining solvable equations for the complex sediment exchange and strong turbulent mixing processes in these conditions therefore this paper examines how hydrodynamic conditions sscs and bed erosion accretion processes differ between esws and rdws on a highly turbid intertidal flat off the jiangsu coast china we present time series field measurements of current velocities waves sscs and bed level changes throughout a number of tidal cycles under calm weather conditions these continuous measurements form the basis for evaluating the link between hydrodynamics and bed level changes during esws our data provide new insights into the importance of esws in controlling bed erosion accretion processes and highlight that esws are critical in driving morphological change on intertidal flats 2 study area our study site is located on the rudong intertidal flat jiangsu coast china this area comprises the largest radial shaped tidal sand ridge system on the chinese continental shelf in the southwestern yellow sea fig 1 a the study area is a well developed intertidal flat with a gentle slope 0 018 0 022 and width of several kilometers in the seaward direction zhu et al 1986 wang and ke 1997 the intertidal flat is a macrotidal area with a semi diurnal tide and mean tidal range of 3 9 5 5 m ren et al 1985 wang and ke 1997 xing et al 2012 the flat is highly turbid due to the abundant sediment supply from the yangtze river and abandoned yellow river fig 1a the study area experiences frequent variations in water depth and esws occurs twice every tide and approximately four times each day a small wave height of 1 m generally characterizes the study area during normal weather and the annual average wind speed is 4 5 m s ren 1986 the intertidal area is generally flat and has no obvious tidal creek near the study site fig 1b the surface sediments are mainly silt 8 63 µm on the upper tidal flat and fine sand 63 125 µm on the middle tidal flat wang and ke 1997 3 materials and methods 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 data collection the field campaigns were conducted from november 28 to december 2 2016 all instruments were installed firmly on a custom made frame with an open structure and two stainless steel legs fig 2 the relative height above the bed and setup of the instruments are detailed in fig 2 and table 1 respectively near bed turbulent boundary velocities were measured using a downward looking 6 mhz nortek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv measurement accuracy of 1 mm s data output rate of 1 64 hz at a sampling frequency of 16 hz in 5 min bursts 4096 points per 5 min time series the adv was fastened to the custom made frame with the probe head positioned 0 2 m above the bed table 1 and measured the 3d turbulent velocity at a standoff distance of just 0 15 m from the probe head fig 2 thus the turbulent velocities were measured at a height of 0 05 m above the bed surface to measure the turbulent velocity the probe must be submerged meaning that measurements of current velocities could only be undertaken when the water depth was 0 2 m i e not during esws in addition to measuring the turbulent velocity the adv probe recorded a time series of distance with an accuracy of 1 mm between the probe head and the local bed surface at 1 hz as such actual bed elevation changes could be extracted from the time series andersen et al 2007 salehi and strom 2012 the accuracy of the adv measurements is robust and has been tested extensively in the laboratory salehi and strom 2012 and in the field andersen et al 2007 wang et al 2014 shi et al 2015 to capture the current velocity during esws an electromagnetic current meter emcm was used because this instrument is not affected by blind measurement areas has a very small measurement volume and a small probe diameter 3 cm to measure the 2d current velocity as close to the bed as possible the emcm was deployed at a height of only 0 05 m above the bed and operated at a burst period of 30 s and sampling frequency of 2 hz fig 2 table 1 wave height was measured at a sampling frequency of 4 hz over a 256 s period using a sbe 26plus seagauge wave and tide recorder accuracy of 0 01 of the full scale table 1 the sbe 26plus was installed horizontally on the bed and its pressure sensor was located 0 05 cm above the bed i e as close to the bed as possible to record waves during esws fig 2 the sbe 26plus collected 1024 measurements per burst and the mean water level was obtained every 10 min table 1 on the intertidal flat the wave period was generally 2 5 s and thus each burst recorded 100 waves for estimation of wave height and period an optical backscattering sensor obs 3a self recording turbidity temperature monitoring instrument was used to make in situ measurements of turbidity at a sampling frequency of 1 hz with its sensor facing outward at a height of 0 05 m above the bed table 1 fig 2 to calibrate the in situ turbidity measurements in the laboratory in situ water samples were collected at the same height as the obs 3a measurements on a small boat near the observation site 3 1 2 determination of esws duration and bed level changes the adv probes were exposed to air and stopped working when the water depth was 0 2 m thus the adv instrument could not record the time at which the water attained a zero depth or the distance between the adv probe and bed surface at this time therefore a boat anchored near the observation site recorded this time using a watch and the distance using a ruler for the initial stage of flood tide the duration δtf i and bed level change δdf i of esws for each tide were estimated as follows 1 δ t f i t f i t f b i 2 δ d f i d f i d f b i where tf i and df i are the time and distance respectively recorded when the water attained a zero depth at the initial stage of flood tide i and tf b i and df b i are the time and distance respectively recorded by the adv at the first effective burst when h 0 2 m during the flood tide stage for the post ebb tide stage the duration δte i and bed level change δde i of esws for each tide were estimated as follows 3 δ t e i t e b i t e i 4 δ d e i d e b i d e i where te b i and de b i are the time and distance respectively recorded by the adv in the last effective burst during the ebb stage during tide i i e when h 0 2 m and te i and de i are the time and distance respectively recorded when the water attained a zero depth at the post ebb tide stage during tide i 3 2 estimation of bed shear stress the variation in bed shear stress within an entire tidal cycle was estimated using a current wave interaction model specifically the bed shear stress due to waves τw was calculated using the theory of wave orbital velocity a1 in appendix a and wave friction a3 and a4 in appendix a and the bed shear stress due to currents τc was calculated using the theory of bottom boundary layers a5 and a6 in appendix a and friction velocity u the bed shear stress due to combined current wave action τcw was calculated using the grant and madsen 1979 model a classic current wave interaction model a7 in appendix a which has been widely used in the estimation of τcw e g lyne et al 1990 mellor 2002 feddersen et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 the bottom sediments were mainly very fine sand at study site a the median grain size d 50 was 113 μm during the field measurements thus we determined the critical shear stress for erosion τcr using the shields 1936 equation b3 b4 and b5 in appendix b which has been applied by miller et al 1977 soulsby 1997 and yang et al 2016 in this study we used a value of 0 1 n m2 based on this median grain size 4 results 4 1 wind wave and current data during field measurements offshore winds ranged in speed from 0 6 to 7 5 m s with a mean of 3 5 m s fig 3 a which was weaker than the annual mean wind speed of 4 5 m s relatively weak winds generated small waves during the field measurements thus the maximum wave height was just 0 39 m fig 3b wave height within an entire tidal cycle tended to be largest at the high water level and smallest at the low water level fig 3b the wave height was at its minimum during esws fig 3b perhaps due to the positive relationship between wave height and water depth wave period and water depth showed the same temporal pattern the maximum wave period was only 4 3 s which tended to occur at high water levels and the minimum 1 s occurred at esws during each tide fig 3b c current velocity was rotational for the entire tidal cycle fig 3d the maximum current velocity occurred during esws in the initial flood stage 0 1 0 59 m s in an onshore direction towards the south and was greater than the current velocity during esws in the post flood stage when the current direction switched to offshore fig 3d the current during rdws tended to have an onshore direction in the flood stage offshore direction in the ebb stage and a smaller velocity than during esws in the initial flood stage fig 3d 4 2 bed shear stresses 4 2 1 shear stress due to waves τw and currents τc the τw values varied little within a tidal cycle 0 01 0 15 n m2 fig 4 b table 2 as a result of weak winds and small wave heights fig 3b under the calm weather conditions the τw values during esws were comparable with those during rdws table 2 the maximum τc value occurred during esws in the flood stage fig 4b the average τc during esws in the flood stage 0 30 0 64 n m2 was several times greater than during esws at the corresponding ebb stage 0 07 0 16 n m2 and was also greater than the average value during a rdws in a corresponding tide 0 11 0 13 n m2 table 2 4 2 2 shear stress due to combined current wave action τcw the maximum τ cw value within a tidal cycle occurred during esws in the flood stage fig 4b and the average τcw during these stages ranged from 0 36 to 0 70 n m2 and was greater than τcr 0 1 n m2 in contrast the average τcw during esws at the corresponding ebb stage ranged from 0 03 to 0 09 n m2 and was less than the average τcr fig 4b for rdws the average τcw varied little ranging from 0 12 to 0 14 n m2 and was slightly greater than the average τcr 4 3 suspended sediment concentration the average ssc during esws at the flooding stage 0 69 kg m3 was two times higher than at the ebb stage 0 33 kg m3 table 2 fig 4c in contrast the average ssc during rdws was lower than during esws at the corresponding flood stage and was higher than at the corresponding ebb stage table 2 fig 4c 4 4 duration of esws and rdws the duration of esws at the ebb stage 30 min was 1 5 times longer than that at the corresponding flood stage 22 min and the duration of esws only accounted for 10 of the entire tidal cycle table 3 in contrast the duration of rdws was 457 min on average which was almost nine times longer than the average total duration 52 min of esws thus rdws accounted for 90 of the entire tidal cycle table 3 4 5 bed level changes during the entire field campaign the distance from the adv probe to the bed surface ranged from 280 to 285 mm indicating that the overall bed level change was just 5 mm negative denoting erosion fig 4d the bed level change during esws was much greater than that during rdws table 3 fig 4d erosion occurred during esws at the flooding stage of the tide with an average magnitude of 7 4 mm 4 2 to 10 3 mm per tide at an average rate of 0 4 mm min 0 2 to 0 5 mm min table 3 in contrast accretion occurred during esws in the ebb stage and the rate of this accretion was comparable to that of erosion with the average amount being 9 2 mm 4 4 to 14 5 mm positive denoting accretion per tide at an average rate of 0 3 mm min 0 1 to 0 5 mm min table 3 however the rate of bed level change for rdws was much lower with an average amount of 2 5 mm 3 5 to 7 0 mm per tide at an average rate of 0 6 10 2 mm min 1 10 2 to 2 10 2 mm min table 3 therefore the magnitude of bed level change during esws was three times greater than that during rdws and its rate was an order of magnitude higher despite esws making up just 10 of the tidal cycle table 3 5 discussion our results reveal that strong erosion and weak accretion occurred during esws at the flood and ebb stages of a tide respectively and relatively weak erosion occurred during rdws in almost all tidal cycles table 3 fig 4d this difference can be explained by the theory of sediment erosion accretion appendix b winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 and the contrast in bed shear stress between esws and rdws the average erosion flux fe during esws in the flood stage was greater than that during rdws because the average τcw during esws in the flood stage was two times higher than during rdws in a corresponding tidal cycle table 2 fig 4b and greater than τcr in contrast in the ebb stage the average fe during esws was zero due to τcw τcr and the average depositional flux fd was much greater than during rdws because the average τcw during esws was only half of the average τcw during rdws table 2 fig 4b the τcw values were much lower than τcr values during esws resulting in greater accretion this accretion occurred during periods of much higher near bed sscs than were observed during rdws table 2 reflecting relatively weak hydrodynamic conditions a detailed comparison of the bed level changes and durations of esws and rdws showed that esws were characterized by much shorter duration 10 of the entire tidal cycle and larger and faster bed level changes table 3 morphological changes are generally related to not only the magnitude of extreme events but also the frequency of their occurrence wolman and miller 1960 thus when considering the effects of esws on geomorphic processes on the studied intertidal flat we should note that although short in duration esws occur twice every tidal cycle and there are two daily tidal cycles at this site e g wang et al 2012 xing et al 2012 therefore esws occurs frequently on the intertidal flat given this high frequency and that esws are marked by large values of bed shear stress these conditions have an important influence on the morphological development of intertidal flats to illustrate this we estimated the annual net cumulative bed level change induced by esws to be about 66 cm whereas this is about 182 cm during rdws therefore esws play a significant role in the annual replenishment of sediments given that our field investigations were undertaken in calm weather conditions we can infer that in rough or stormy weather conditions the magnitude of bed level changes during esws could be even larger it is important to consider whether our results are site specific or are applicable to other intertidal environments based on a limited number of previous studies we suggest the latter is the case for the following reason surges or pulses in tidal velocity have been identified in association with high sscs in esws in different types of intertidal flats such as i sandy and muddy coasts e g postma 1967 bayliss smith et al 1979 gao 2010 nowacki and ogston 2013 zhang et al 2016 ii different geomorphic units within intertidal systems such as tidal creeks and runnels fagherazzi et al 2008 fagherazzi and mariotti 2012 hughes 2012 iii in a range of intertidal systems such as channel flat and salt marsh systems pethick 1980 wang et al 1999 nowacki and ogston 2013 and iv under a range of meteorological conditions including calm and stormy weather wang et al 1999 zhang et al 2016 these observations suggest that this velocity surging pulsing is common during esws in almost all tidal cycles in intertidal environments worldwide furthermore based on the results of zhang et al 2016 these surges can produce large bed shear stress up to 1 5 n m2 at the beginning of the flood tide which is an order of magnitude higher than the critical shear stress of sediments commonly found on intertidal flats therefore it is reasonable to expect that this surge could re suspend and transport a large amount of bottom sediment resulting in erosion at the beginning of the flood tide this inference is in agreement with the strong erosion observed during esws in our study previous studies have been conducted on field measurement of esws zhang et al 2016 shi et al 2017 for example shi et al 2017 have estimated the bed level changes of esws during windy weather conditions on the same intertidal flat as this study but on a different section their results have showed that bed level changes due to erosion under calm conditions were six times lower than those reported in shi et al 2017 14 7 mm in shi et al 2017 vs 2 3 mm this study while bed level changes due to accretion was slightly higher under our calm conditions 6 8 mm this study vs 5 1 mm in shi et al 2017 the reason is that this study was made under calm conditions which representing a rather weak intertidal sediment dynamics while the results in shi et al 2017 represented relative stronger hydrodynamics since the wind speed could reached up to 13 6 m s shi et al 2017 showing that weather conditions can be an important factor in determining the importance of esws in morphological changes the limitations of this study are that we lacked the field data needed to measure in big detail time series of bed level change to study processes and mechanism of sediment erosion accretion transport biogeochemical cycle and micro topography formation during esws therefore the further avenues of research on sedimentary processes and hydrodynamics during esws should focus on the following 1 spatial comparisons of sediment transport processes during esws in the subtidal middle and high intertidal zones hydrodynamics in these zones may differ greatly during esws compared with other periods driving morphological change 2 a comparison of sedimentary processes during esws in microtidal mesotidal and macrotidal intertidal flats sheltered and exposed intertidal flats and under calm and stormy weather conditions for example our study was performed under weak wind conditions and there will likely be a difference in sedimentary processes under rough or storm weather conditions 3 investigation of the interactions between hydrodynamics and micro topography e g ripples micro topography formation and destruction are common during esws zhang et al 2016 this micro topography can greatly increase bottom friction ke et al 1994 which can slow current velocities and tidal wave propagation friedrichs and madsen 1992 le hir et al 2000 thus this enhanced bottom friction could increase turbulence within the near bed region nezu and nakagawa 1993 and possibly bed level change therefore there is a need to undertake integrated and high resolution measurements of currents waves sscs bed level changes and micro topography during esws to better understand their interactions 4 smaller instrument measurement volumes and standoff distances are required to facilitate in situ measurements in extremely shallow water environments to allow improved parameterization of turbulence and sediment transport 5 examination of the effects of sediment transport processes during esws on biogeochemical cycling esws are usually characterized by high sscs gao 2010 which are rich in trace metals nutrients organic carbon and anthropogenic contaminants dyer et al 2000 grabowski et al 2011 thus such large and frequent erosion and accretion during esws are likely to play an important role in biogeochemical cycling 6 conclusions integrated field measurements of current velocities waves sscs and bed level changes on an intertidal flat have quantified the hydrodynamic and sediment erosion accretion processes during esws close to the seabed our major findings and their implications are as follows 1 the τcw values during esws in the initial flood stage were greater than the τcr values and the τcw values during esws in the post ebb stage were less than the τcr values these differences in hydrodynamics led to strong erosion and accretion during esws in the flood and ebb stage of a tide respectively relatively weak erosion occurred during rdws in almost all tidal cycles this indicated a large difference in sediment dynamics between esws and rdws 2 bed level changes during esws were three times greater than during rdws in a corresponding tide and the rate of change was an order of magnitude higher than during rdws these larger and more rapid changes occurred because τcw values during esws were on average two times higher than during rdws at the flood stage and at the ebb stage τcw values were just half of the average τcw value during rdws these bed level changes occurred even though esws made up only 10 of the entire tidal cycle 3 esws occur twice in every tide given that large bed shear stresses and bed level changes were associated with esws this indicated that esws has an important influence on morphological changes on intertidal flats 4 our results demonstrated that esws have an important control on near bed hydrodynamics that influence sediment dynamics and morphological changes thus further investigations into the relationships between hydrodynamics micro topography and sediment transport processes during esws under a range of conditions will be an important area of future research for estuarine scientists acknowledgements we thank dezhi chen and qingguang zhu for

6498,the conventional geo accumulation index gi cannot deal with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of pollutants or conduct a synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution in sediments to solve these problems a geo accumulation vector gv model is designed based on uncertainty analysis theory gv uses the probability vector to quantify the possibility for the pollution condition of a heavy metal to belong to a certain grade and then uses the first order moment principle to determine its category the gv model is applied in this study to evaluate heavy metal pollution in the sediments of western dongting lake the results show that i compared with the conventional gi model the gv model has better capacity in evaluating synthetic pollution and in dealing with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of sediments ii the sediments of li river estuary yuan river estuary songzi river estuary and the central part of western dongting lake are moderately to heavily contaminated moderately to heavily contaminated moderately contaminated and uncontaminated to moderately contaminated by heavy metals respectively these sediments also have 0 19 0 36 0 48 and 0 15 possibilities to deteriorate to the next category respectively and iii all deterioration risks are introduced by cadmium keywords geo accumulation vector uncertainty analysis heavy metal pollution western dongting lake 1 introduction in water resource management heavy metals are key pollutants that need to be controlled arojojoye et al 2018 the heavy metals discharged into natural waterbodies are easily absorbed by silt and then deposited into sediments maanan et al 2015 when the physical and chemical conditions in the sediment water interface are changed the deposited heavy metals may be rereleased into the overlying water and pose an ecological risk to aquatic organisms chen et al 2015 patel et al 2017 therefore evaluating heavy metal pollution in sediments is crucial in aquatic environment assessment the geo accumulation index gi is an important model for assessing heavy metal pollution in sediments szuszkiewicz et al 2016 by integrating the information of anthropogenic pollution geochemical background and influence of natural fluctuations gi generates an intuitive score that indicates the degree of heavy metal pollution in sediments yuan et al 2015 karak et al 2017 gi has been widely applied in previous studies since its introduction in 1969 for example samas et al 2016 used gi to quantify the human lead exposure in pakistan men et al 2018 applied gi to evaluate the heavy metal pollution in beijing china and yan et al 2019 used the gi model to study the spatial variations of the sediment pollution in poyang lake china however the conventional gi model has two disadvantages that restrict its promotion and application first given the inhomogeneous geological conditions of sediments in most cases geochemical background information is often represented in the form of uncertain intervals instead of concrete values matschullat et al 2000 snežana et al 2018 and the current gi model cannot deal with such uncertainty second sediments often contain multiple heavy metal species ma et al 2016 gloaguen and passe 2017 ke et al 2017 however the conventional gi quantifies only the pollution degree of a single heavy metal and cannot perform a comprehensive pollution evaluation of multiple heavy metals the objective of this research is to design a new geo accumulation vector gv model for evaluating heavy metal pollution in sediments this vector is designed in the following steps i deduce the density function of the geochemical background based on the maximum entropy principle to quantify the uncertainties in the background information ii design the gv of each pollutant based on uncertainty analysis theory to assess the pollution condition of each heavy metal and iii establish the synthetic gv model to comprehensively evaluate the pollution of multiple heavy metals given that the derivation process may be too theoretical this study applies gv and gi to evaluate heavy metal pollution in the sediments of western dongting lake and to intuitively illustrate the differences between these two models 2 methods and materials 2 1 conventional gi in the conventional gi model the gi of the mth heavy metal im is defined as pathak et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 1 i m log 2 c m 1 5 b m where cm and bm are the monitoring and geochemical background values of the mth heavy metal respectively gagneten et al 2007 pathak et al 2013 while 1 5 is set as the coefficient to neutralize the variations resulting from lithogenic actions yuan et al 2015 yan et al 2019 based on the score of im the pollution condition of heavy metals is classified into uncontaminated im 0 uncontaminated to moderately contaminated 0 im 1 moderately contaminated 1 im 2 moderately to heavily contaminated 2 im 3 heavily contaminated 3 im 4 heavily to extremely contaminated 4 im 5 and extremely contaminated im 5 pathak et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 given that the effectiveness of this category classification has been verified in many studies the same standard has been used for this work as mentioned in the introduction given that the geological conditions of sediments are inhomogeneous in most cases the geochemical background levels of heavy models are often represented in the form of uncertain intervals instead of concrete values the interval of the background level of the mth heavy metal is denoted as lm sm obviously bm has a possibility to be equal to any value in the interval lm sm therefore eq 1 is invalid in this condition meanwhile the conventional gi quantifies only the pollution degree of a single heavy metal but cannot comprehensively evaluate the pollution of multiple heavy metals 2 2 gv model 2 2 1 density function of the geochemical background as mentioned in section 2 1 given the heterogeneity of the mineral composition in sediments bm is a continuous random variable instead of a determined value based on probability theory the statistical characteristics of bm can be described by its probability density function fm bm the core issue here is to deduce the analytic formula of fm bm we used the maximum entropy principle to solve this problem in probability theory entropy measures the uncertainty of the random variable the entropy of bm is denoted as hm according to the information entropy defined by shannon hm can be generated by papalexiou et al 2012 2 h m f m b m ln f m b m d b m given that bm lies in the interval lm sm eq 2 can be further simplified to 3 h m b m l m s m f m b m ln f m b m d b m the maximum entropy principle sets the probability distributions based on partial knowledge gay et al 2010 yan et al 2019 according to this principle the maximum entropy estimate is the least biased estimate possible for the information at hand gay and estrada 2010 yan et al 2019 in other words the most possible density function is fm bm which corresponds to the largest hm therefore the most probable fm bm can be generated by solving the following optimization problem 4 max h m b m l m s m f m b m ln f m b m d b m s t b m l m s m f m b m d b m 1 eq 4 is a single objective optimization instead of a multi objective optimization in other words the probability density functions of different heavy metals are considered independent because no universal relationship suitable for all pollutants can be found in the literature as a result we cannot determine the joint entropy of multiple pollutants given that hm is a function of fm bm eq 4 is a functional extremum problem that can be solved by using the lagrange multiplier method rathnayake and tanyimboh 2012a b rathnayake 2015 the objective function l λ fm bm is designed as 5 l λ f m b m b m l m s m f m b m ln f m b m d b m λ b m l m s m f m b m d b m 1 where λ is the lagrange multiplier eq 5 can be further simplified to 6 l λ f m b m b m l m s m l λ f m b m d b m where 7 l λ f m b m λ f m b m 1 s m l m f m b m ln f m b m obviously l λ fm bm is the kernel function of l λ fm bm that has no relation to the derivatives of λ or fm bm as a result according to the euler equation liu et al 2015 yan et al 2019 the extremum of l λ fm bm exists when 8 l λ f m b m λ f m b m 1 s m l m 0 l λ f m b m f m b m λ 1 ln f m b m 0 therefore 9 λ ln 1 s m l m 1 and 10 f m b m 1 s m l m l m b m s m 0 otherwise the environmental meaning of eq 10 is that when the geochemical background lies in an uncertain interval its most probable statistical distribution is uniform 2 2 2 gv of each pollutant as mentioned in section 2 1 the pollution of each heavy metal is classified into seven categories on the one hand the standard interval of the jth grade can be defined as i m a mj where 11 a mj 0 j 1 j 2 j 1 j 2 3 6 5 j 7 on the other hand given that i m log 2 c m 1 5 b m can be transformed to b m 2 i m c m 1 5 this criterion can be replaced by b m b mj where 12 b mj c m 1 5 j 1 c m 1 5 2 j 1 c m 1 5 2 j 2 j 2 3 6 c m 1 5 2 5 j 7 when the geochemical background of the heavy metal is represented in the form of an uncertain interval instead of a concrete value its pollution condition may belong to multiple categories therefore the pollution grade of the mth heavy metal can be regarded as a discrete random variable jm 1 2 j 7 whereas the statistical characteristics of jm can be described by its probability distribution law pm 1 pm 2 pmj pm 7 the vector pm pm 1 pm 2 pmj pm 7 is defined as the gv of the mth heavy metal the environmental meaning of pmj is the possibility that the pollution condition of the mth heavy metal belongs to the jth grade based on probability theory pmj can be generated by 13 p mj b mj b mj f m b m d b m by integrating eq 10 into eq 13 pm 1 can be calculated as 14 p m 1 0 s m c m 1 5 s m 2 c m 3 s m l m l m c m 1 5 s m 1 c m 1 5 l m when j 2 3 6 pmj is calculated as 15 p mj 1 c m 2 2 j 3 l m s m c m 2 3 j 3 s m c m 2 2 j 3 s m l m l m c m 2 2 j 3 s m c m 2 3 j 3 c m 2 3 j 3 l m s m l m c m 2 2 j 3 l m c m 2 3 j 3 s m c m 2 3 j 3 c m 2 2 j 3 s m l m l m c m 2 2 j 3 c m 2 3 j 3 s m 0 otherwise for the last category we have 16 p m 7 0 l m c m 48 c m 48 l m s m l m l m c m 48 s m 1 s m c m 48 in statistics the first order moment of vector pm is defined as chang et al 2016 yan et al 2018 17 e m j 1 7 p mj j em can be regarded as the mathematical expectation of the discrete random variable jm according to the first order moment principle pm belongs to the jth category when em satisfies chang et al 2016 yan et al 2018 18 j 0 5 e m j 0 5 2 2 3 synthetic gv we design the synthetic gv q q 1 q 2 qj q 7 to comprehensively represent the heavy metal pollution of sediments the environmental meaning of qj is the probability that the comprehensive heavy metal pollution condition belongs to the jth grade qj can be defined as 19 q j m 1 m w j p mj where m is the amount of heavy metals to be evaluated and wj is the weight of the mth heavy metal that can be generated by using the analytic hierarchy process ahp weighting model sun et al 2016 awasthi et al 2018 ilbahar et al 2018 the entropy weighting model chang et al 2016 xu et al 2018 xie et al 2018 or the combined weighting model xu et al 2015 jenifer et al 2017 the first order moment of q is calculated by 20 e j 1 7 q j j while its grade can also be recognized by eq 18 2 2 4 novelties of gv compared with the conventional gi model the novelties of gv lie in the following aspects i gi regards the geochemical background of the heavy metal as an unambiguous value nevertheless gv takes gi as a continuous random variable and uses the probability density function to quantify its uncertainty as a result gv has better capacity in dealing with the geochemical background that is represented in the form of ambiguous intervals ii gi evaluates only the pollution degree of each heavy metal whereas gv further assesses the synthetic pollution condition of multiple indices iii in the conventional gi model the pollution grade of the heavy metal is considered unambiguous and exclusive however in the gv model the pollution condition may belong to multiple categories and these uncertainties are quantified by their respective probability distribution laws in sum gv can be regarded as the entry of the conventional gi into the uncertainty analysis and comprehensive evaluation field to test the effectiveness of gv we use this model to evaluate the heavy metal pollution in the sediments of western dongting lake 2 3 study area the study area was located in the western part of dongting lake 111 55 e 112 17 e 28 47 n 09 07 n which is the second largest freshwater lake in china he et al 2016 lu et al 2018 the western dongting lake has a surface area of 365 2 km2 and an average volume of 9 108 m3 cai et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 1 three major inflow rivers are situated around the western dongting lake namely the li river yuan river and songzi river the western dongting lake is an important habitat of migratory birds and anadromous fish guan et al 2016 he et al 2016 however with the rapid development of the economy and society an increasing amount of heavy metals is being discharged into this lake via the inflow rivers and is deposited into its sediment thereby posing a high risk to aquatic organisms chen et al 2016 he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the basin of the western dongting lake serves as an important mercury hg production base in china many associated chromium cr and cadmium cd minerals can also be found in these mercury mines as a result the key heavy metals in the sediments of western dongting lake include hg cr and cd we use these three metals for the environment evaluation given the inhomogeneous geological condition of the sediments in the western dongting lake the geochemical backgrounds of heavy metals are represented as uncertain intervals instead of concrete values wan et al 2011 according to wan et al 2011 the geochemical backgrounds of hg cr and cd are 0 02 mg kg 0 04 mg kg 37 5 mg kg 54 4 mg kg and 0 21 mg kg 0 47 mg kg respectively as illustrated in fig 1 we set 4 sediment monitoring sites in the central part of the western dongting lake and the estuaries of the li river yuan river and songzi river meanwhile to further investigate the sources of pollutants we set 17 water quality monitoring sites in the basins of these three rivers these sites can be classified into i source water monitoring sites ii surface water monitoring sites in the urban area iii groundwater monitoring sites in the urban area iv surface water monitoring sites in the agricultural area v groundwater monitoring sites in the agricultural area vi surface water monitoring sites in the mining area and vii groundwater monitoring sites in the mining area the sampling pretreating digesting and measuring procedures performed in this study were in line with the chinese soil environmental quality risk control standard for soil contamination of agricultural land ministry of ecological and environment of the people s republic of china 2018 the environmental quality standards for surface water ministry of ecological and environment of the people s republic of china 2002 the standard for groundwater quality ministry of ecological and environment of the people s republic of china 2017 and the specifications for surface meteorological observation china meteorological administration 2017 three parallel samples were collected from each monitoring site between august 20 and september 20 2017 these samples were placed in clean polyethylene bags under 4 c and were sent to the bureau of hydrology of changjiang water resources commission the sediment samples were initially screened through a 1 mm sieve and naturally air dried afterward these samples were ground in an agate mortar sp 40 shanghai shupei corporation china homogenized and sieved through a 100 μm mesh after pretreatment 0 5 g of samples were digested in a microwave oven cem mars pynn corporation usa with an acid mixture 9 ml of 14 0 mhno3 3 ml of 11 7 mhcl 2 ml of 23 0 mhf and 2 5 ml of 8 8h2o2 before they were condensed to 1 ml 2 ml for total metal analysis the surface water and groundwater samples were initially filtered through a 0 45 μmmembrane afterward 100 ml of samples were digested in a microwave oven cem mars pynn corporation usa with an acid mixture 5 ml of 14 2 g mlhno3 2 ml of 1 67 g mlhclo4 before they were condensed to 5 ml 10 ml for total metal analysis cd was measured via graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry ice3500 thermo fisher corporation usa whereas cr and hg were measured via flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry sk 2003 persee corporation china the gss 7 reference material from the chinese environmental monitoring center was used to ensure quality the parallel errors were controlled within 10 and the average value of the three parallel samples was selected as the heavy metal concentration data the daily average air temperature air pressure and wind speed in each sampling site were measured by using the multiparameter meteor meter fws600 fuaotong corporation china 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of pollutants the detailed experimental data of the sediment samples water samples and meteorological elements are presented in tables 1 3 respectively for clarity the sediment samples in the first to fourth sampling sites are denoted by 1 2 3 and 4 respectively as shown in table 1 1 has the highest concentration of hg whereas 2 has the highest concentrations of cr and cd the concentration of each heavy metal in 3 is less than that in 1 and 2 but higher than that in 4 this observation may be explained by the fact that 4 lies in the central part of western dongting lake whereas 1 2 and 3 lie in the estuary area after discharging into the lake the heavy metals contained in the inflow water are deposited into the sediments because of the rapid decrease in flow rate thereby causing the heavy metals to accumulate in the estuary areas table 2 shows that the resources area of heavy metals can be determined intuitively moreover the pollutant concentrations in the water source area of each basin are much less than those in the other areas whereas the heavy metal concentrations in the surface water and groundwater of the mining area are much higher than those in the surface water of the other areas thereby suggesting that the pollution loads primarily come from mine wastewater fig 1 shows the three major mines in the li river and yuan river basins including wanshan mine fenghuang mine and shimen mine most mines in these two basins have been exploited for hundreds of years fu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 given that the ancient workers lacked environmental protection consciousness a large amount of slag piled up in the open air fu et al 2017 as a result the heavy metal in these slags was easily dissolved by precipitation and discharged into the surface water and groundwater of these two basins the pollution degrees of hg and cr in the urban area are less than those in the mining area but higher than those in the agricultural area moreover the concentrations of these two pollutants in the surface water of the urban area are much higher than those in the groundwater which may be explained by three factors first the industrial and domestic wastewater are primarily discharged into the water through the surface sewage outlet in changde city and zhangjiajie city second a large proportion of the land surface in the metropolitan area of these two cities is covered by pavements and structures that obstruct the exchange between surface water and groundwater third compared with the non urban area the urban area releases more heat and releases less specific heat capacity thereby producing a heat island effect moreover the high buildings in the urban area block the air circulation as shown in table 3 compared with those in the non urban area the air temperatures in the urban area of changde city and zhangjiajie city are higher whereas their air pressures and wind speeds are lower as a result the near ground wind blows the atmospheric pollutants from the suburban domain to the center of the urban area the heavy metals contained in the air are then deposited onto the ground surface because of the rapid decrease in wind speed these pollutants from the atmospheric deposition are then discharged into the surface water through the overland flow fig 1 shows that compared with the li river and yuan river the basin of the songzi river lacks mining and urban areas therefore the pollution load in the basin of songzi river is much less than that in the basins of the other two rivers as a result the concentration of each pollutant in the sediment of 3 is less than that in 1 and 2 the pollution characteristic of cd slightly differs from those of hg and cr table 2 shows that the pollution degrees of cd in the agricultural area is almost the same as those in the urban area furthermore the difference in the cd between the surface water and groundwater of the agricultural area is not as significant as that in the other areas because of several factors first many acid fertilizers such as calcium superphosphate and ammonium chloride are applied to the farmland around western dongting lake ji et al 2017 however these fertilizers reduce the ph of the soil which is conducive to the activation and loss of cd from minerals wang et al 2018 second the major crop around western dongting lake is oryza sativa and farmers are accustomed to returning the rice stem to the farmland after harvest to maintain soil fertility wan et al 2018 oryza sativa is easily enriched with cd from the soil lei et al 2017 as a result after the returned rice stem is decomposed the cd contained in the plant is easily leached into the suspended water and shallow groundwater 3 2 pollution evaluation of each heavy metal based on the gv model introduced in section 2 3 the pollution condition of each heavy metal is evaluated and the results are presented in table 4 table 4 shows that the worst heavy metal in the sediment of western dongting lake is cd according to the results for e 3 and p 3 the pollution grade of cd in the sediment of yuan river estuary 2 is heavily contaminated meanwhile the pollution situations of cd in the sediments of the li river estuary 1 and songzi river estuary 3 are moderately to heavily contaminated and have 0 36 and 0 19 probabilities to deteriorate to heavily contaminated respectively the pollution condition of cd in the sediments of the central part of western dongting lake 4 is uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and has a probability of 0 29 to deteriorate to moderately contaminated the heavy metal with the second highest concentration in the sediments of the estuary region is hg according to the results for e 1 and p 1 the pollution grade of hg in the sediments of yuan river estuary 2 is moderately to heavily contaminated while those in the sediments of li river estuary 1 and songzi river estuary 3 are moderately to heavily contaminated and moderately contaminated and have probabilities of 0 05 and 0 30 to deteriorate to the next category respectively cr is the cleanest pollutant in the sediments of the river estuaries according to the results for e 2 and p 2 all pollution grades of cr in the sediments of these three estuaries are uncontaminated to moderately contaminated without any uncertainty the second and third heaviest contaminated pollutants in the central part of western dongtiung lake are cr and hg this result somewhat differs from those obtained in the estuary region these pollutants have pollution grades of uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and uncontaminated respectively furthermore the pollution of hg has a 0 22 possibility to deteriorate to the next category 3 3 comprehensive evaluation the weight vector w 0 25 0 25 0 50 was generated based on the ahp model in accordance to eq 19 the comprehensive pollution condition is evaluated and the results are presented in table 5 for clarity the synthetic gv of the ith sampling site is denoted by qi while the first order moment of qi is denoted by ei in table 5 e2 e 1 e 3 e 4 indicates that the sediments in the yuan river estuary have the highest comprehensive heavy metal pollution followed by those in the li river estuary songzi river estuary and the central part of western dongting lake in accordance to the results for e 1 e 2 q 1 and q 2 both synthetic heavy metal pollution categories in the sediments of the li river and yuan river estuaries are moderately to heavily contaminated and have 0 19 and 0 36 possibilities to deteriorate to the heavily contaminated category respectively based on the results for e 3 and q 3 the sediments of the songzi river estuary are moderately contaminated and have 0 48 and 0 10 possibilities to deteriorate to the moderately to heavily contaminated and heavily contaminated categories respectively according to the results for e 4 and q 4 the sediments in the central part of western dongting lake are uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and have a 0 15 possibility to deteriorate to the moderately contaminated category according to table 4 all deterioration risks in the sampling sites are introduced by cd as mentioned in section 3 1 these cd loads mostly come from i the slag leachate in wanshan mine shimen mine and fenghuang mine ii the atmospheric deposition and wastewater discharged in changde city and zhangjiajie city iii the acid fertilizers applied to the farmland around western dongting lake and iv the rotten stem of the oryza sativa returned to the farmland around western dongting lake therefore four measures must be adopted to maintain the environmental quality and ecological health of western dongting lake first waterproof and anti seepage projects must be launched in the slag stacking area introduced above to prevent the leachate from polluting the surface water and groundwater second the waste gas and water must be centrally treated before they are discharged in urban areas to retrieve heavy metals third the application of neutral and alkaline fertilizers must be promoted to control the soil acidification and reduce the leaching of minerals fourth the planting of low cd enrichment crops and the harmless disposal of straws must be promoted to prevent cd from returning to the farmland 3 4 differences between gi and gv the heavy metal pollution in the sediments of the study area was evaluated based on the conventional gi model and the results are presented in table 6 the results in table 6 are then compared with those in table 5 to highlight the following differences between the evaluation results of gi and gv i the conventional gi model determines only a rough range of the gi score for each heavy metal by contrast the gv model can further quantify the possibility for each pollution condition to belong to a certain grade thereby providing a highly accurate and detailed representation of uncertainties in the natural environment ii the absence of an algorithm for calculating intervals in the previous environmental assessment literature means that the conventional gi model cannot perform a synthetic evaluation for heavy metal pollution in sediments by contrast the gv model uses the probability vector to represent the pollution condition of each heavy metal therefore gv can perform a synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution by using the matrix vector operation algorithm 4 conclusions the gv model has two advantages over the conventional gi model first by introducing probability theory gv can efficiently deal with the uncertainty in geochemical background information second by using the matrix vector operation algorithm gv can perform a comprehensive synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution in sediments the heavy metal pollution conditions in the sediments of the li river estuary yuan rive estuary songzi river estuary and the central part of western dongting lake are moderately to heavily contaminated moderately to heavily contaminated moderately contaminated and uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and have 0 19 0 36 0 48 and 0 15 possibilities to deteriorate to the next category respectively all deterioration risks in these sites are introduced by cd to maintain the environmental quality and ecological health of western dongting lake the following measures should be adopted i control the slag leachate ii treat urban industrial and domestic wastewater iii promote the use of neutral and alkaline fertilizers and iv improve the crop structure and agricultural customs 5 declarations of interest none acknowledgment this work is supported by the national

in sediments this vector is designed in the following steps i deduce the density function of the geochemical background based on the maximum entropy principle to quantify the uncertainties in the background information ii design the gv of each pollutant based on uncertainty analysis theory to assess the pollution condition of each heavy metal and iii establish the synthetic gv model to comprehensively evaluate the pollution of multiple heavy metals given that the derivation process may be too theoretical this study applies gv and gi to evaluate heavy metal pollution in the sediments of western dongting lake and to intuitively illustrate the differences between these two models 2 methods and materials 2 1 conventional gi in the conventional gi model the gi of the mth heavy metal im is defined as pathak et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 1 i m log 2 c m 1 5 b m where cm and bm are the monitoring and geochemical background values of the mth heavy metal respectively gagneten et al 2007 pathak et al 2013 while 1 5 is set as the coefficient to neutralize the variations resulting from lithogenic actions yuan et al 2015 yan et al 2019 based on the score of im the pollution condition of heavy metals is classified into uncontaminated im 0 uncontaminated to moderately contaminated 0 im 1 moderately contaminated 1 im 2 moderately to heavily contaminated 2 im 3 heavily contaminated 3 im 4 heavily to extremely contaminated 4 im 5 and extremely contaminated im 5 pathak et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 given that the effectiveness of this category classification has been verified in many studies the same standard has been used for this work as mentioned in the introduction given that the geological conditions of sediments are inhomogeneous in most cases the geochemical background levels of heavy models are often represented in the form of uncertain intervals instead of concrete values the interval of the background level of the mth heavy metal is denoted as lm sm obviously bm has a possibility to be equal to any value in the interval lm sm therefore eq 1 is invalid in this condition meanwhile the conventional gi quantifies only the pollution degree of a single heavy metal but cannot comprehensively evaluate the pollution of multiple heavy metals 2 2 gv model 2 2 1 density function of the geochemical background as mentioned in section 2 1 given the heterogeneity of the mineral composition in sediments bm is a continuous random variable instead of a determined value based on probability theory the statistical characteristics of bm can be described by its probability density function fm bm the core issue here is to deduce the analytic formula of fm bm we used the maximum entropy principle to solve this problem in probability theory entropy measures the uncertainty of the random variable the entropy of bm is denoted as hm according to the information entropy defined by shannon hm can be generated by papalexiou et al 2012 2 h m f m b m ln f m b m d b m given that bm lies in the interval lm sm eq 2 can be further simplified to 3 h m b m l m s m f m b m ln f m b m d b m the maximum entropy principle sets the probability distributions based on partial knowledge gay et al 2010 yan et al 2019 according to this principle the maximum entropy estimate is the least biased estimate possible for the information at hand gay and estrada 2010 yan et al 2019 in other words the most possible density function is fm bm which corresponds to the largest hm therefore the most probable fm bm can be generated by solving the following optimization problem 4 max h m b m l m s m f m b m ln f m b m d b m s t b m l m s m f m b m d b m 1 eq 4 is a single objective optimization instead of a multi objective optimization in other words the probability density functions of different heavy metals are considered independent because no universal relationship suitable for all pollutants can be found in the literature as a result we cannot determine the joint entropy of multiple pollutants given that hm is a function of fm bm eq 4 is a functional extremum problem that can be solved by using the lagrange multiplier method rathnayake and tanyimboh 2012a b rathnayake 2015 the objective function l λ fm bm is designed as 5 l λ f m b m b m l m s m f m b m ln f m b m d b m λ b m l m s m f m b m d b m 1 where λ is the lagrange multiplier eq 5 can be further simplified to 6 l λ f m b m b m l m s m l λ f m b m d b m where 7 l λ f m b m λ f m b m 1 s m l m f m b m ln f m b m obviously l λ fm bm is the kernel function of l λ fm bm that has no relation to the derivatives of λ or fm bm as a result according to the euler equation liu et al 2015 yan et al 2019 the extremum of l λ fm bm exists when 8 l λ f m b m λ f m b m 1 s m l m 0 l λ f m b m f m b m λ 1 ln f m b m 0 therefore 9 λ ln 1 s m l m 1 and 10 f m b m 1 s m l m l m b m s m 0 otherwise the environmental meaning of eq 10 is that when the geochemical background lies in an uncertain interval its most probable statistical distribution is uniform 2 2 2 gv of each pollutant as mentioned in section 2 1 the pollution of each heavy metal is classified into seven categories on the one hand the standard interval of the jth grade can be defined as i m a mj where 11 a mj 0 j 1 j 2 j 1 j 2 3 6 5 j 7 on the other hand given that i m log 2 c m 1 5 b m can be transformed to b m 2 i m c m 1 5 this criterion can be replaced by b m b mj where 12 b mj c m 1 5 j 1 c m 1 5 2 j 1 c m 1 5 2 j 2 j 2 3 6 c m 1 5 2 5 j 7 when the geochemical background of the heavy metal is represented in the form of an uncertain interval instead of a concrete value its pollution condition may belong to multiple categories therefore the pollution grade of the mth heavy metal can be regarded as a discrete random variable jm 1 2 j 7 whereas the statistical characteristics of jm can be described by its probability distribution law pm 1 pm 2 pmj pm 7 the vector pm pm 1 pm 2 pmj pm 7 is defined as the gv of the mth heavy metal the environmental meaning of pmj is the possibility that the pollution condition of the mth heavy metal belongs to the jth grade based on probability theory pmj can be generated by 13 p mj b mj b mj f m b m d b m by integrating eq 10 into eq 13 pm 1 can be calculated as 14 p m 1 0 s m c m 1 5 s m 2 c m 3 s m l m l m c m 1 5 s m 1 c m 1 5 l m when j 2 3 6 pmj is calculated as 15 p mj 1 c m 2 2 j 3 l m s m c m 2 3 j 3 s m c m 2 2 j 3 s m l m l m c m 2 2 j 3 s m c m 2 3 j 3 c m 2 3 j 3 l m s m l m c m 2 2 j 3 l m c m 2 3 j 3 s m c m 2 3 j 3 c m 2 2 j 3 s m l m l m c m 2 2 j 3 c m 2 3 j 3 s m 0 otherwise for the last category we have 16 p m 7 0 l m c m 48 c m 48 l m s m l m l m c m 48 s m 1 s m c m 48 in statistics the first order moment of vector pm is defined as chang et al 2016 yan et al 2018 17 e m j 1 7 p mj j em can be regarded as the mathematical expectation of the discrete random variable jm according to the first order moment principle pm belongs to the jth category when em satisfies chang et al 2016 yan et al 2018 18 j 0 5 e m j 0 5 2 2 3 synthetic gv we design the synthetic gv q q 1 q 2 qj q 7 to comprehensively represent the heavy metal pollution of sediments the environmental meaning of qj is the probability that the comprehensive heavy metal pollution condition belongs to the jth grade qj can be defined as 19 q j m 1 m w j p mj where m is the amount of heavy metals to be evaluated and wj is the weight of the mth heavy metal that can be generated by using the analytic hierarchy process ahp weighting model sun et al 2016 awasthi et al 2018 ilbahar et al 2018 the entropy weighting model chang et al 2016 xu et al 2018 xie et al 2018 or the combined weighting model xu et al 2015 jenifer et al 2017 the first order moment of q is calculated by 20 e j 1 7 q j j while its grade can also be recognized by eq 18 2 2 4 novelties of gv compared with the conventional gi model the novelties of gv lie in the following aspects i gi regards the geochemical background of the heavy metal as an unambiguous value nevertheless gv takes gi as a continuous random variable and uses the probability density function to quantify its uncertainty as a result gv has better capacity in dealing with the geochemical background that is represented in the form of ambiguous intervals ii gi evaluates only the pollution degree of each heavy metal whereas gv further assesses the synthetic pollution condition of multiple indices iii in the conventional gi model the pollution grade of the heavy metal is considered unambiguous and exclusive however in the gv model the pollution condition may belong to multiple categories and these uncertainties are quantified by their respective probability distribution laws in sum gv can be regarded as the entry of the conventional gi into the uncertainty analysis and comprehensive evaluation field to test the effectiveness of gv we use this model to evaluate the heavy metal pollution in the sediments of western dongting lake 2 3 study area the study area was located in the western part of dongting lake 111 55 e 112 17 e 28 47 n 09 07 n which is the second largest freshwater lake in china he et al 2016 lu et al 2018 the western dongting lake has a surface area of 365 2 km2 and an average volume of 9 108 m3 cai et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 1 three major inflow rivers are situated around the western dongting lake namely the li river yuan river and songzi river the western dongting lake is an important habitat of migratory birds and anadromous fish guan et al 2016 he et al 2016 however with the rapid development of the economy and society an increasing amount of heavy metals is being discharged into this lake via the inflow rivers and is deposited into its sediment thereby posing a high risk to aquatic organisms chen et al 2016 he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the basin of the western dongting lake serves as an important mercury hg production base in china many associated chromium cr and cadmium cd minerals can also be found in these mercury mines as a result the key heavy metals in the sediments of western dongting lake include hg cr and cd we use these three metals for the environment evaluation given the inhomogeneous geological condition of the sediments in the western dongting lake the geochemical backgrounds of heavy metals are represented as uncertain intervals instead of concrete values wan et al 2011 according to wan et al 2011 the geochemical backgrounds of hg cr and cd are 0 02 mg kg 0 04 mg kg 37 5 mg kg 54 4 mg kg and 0 21 mg kg 0 47 mg kg respectively as illustrated in fig 1 we set 4 sediment monitoring sites in the central part of the western dongting lake and the estuaries of the li river yuan river and songzi river meanwhile to further investigate the sources of pollutants we set 17 water quality monitoring sites in the basins of these three rivers these sites can be classified into i source water monitoring sites ii surface water monitoring sites in the urban area iii groundwater monitoring sites in the urban area iv surface water monitoring sites in the agricultural area v groundwater monitoring sites in the agricultural area vi surface water monitoring sites in the mining area and vii groundwater monitoring sites in the mining area the sampling pretreating digesting and measuring procedures performed in this study were in line with the chinese soil environmental quality risk control standard for soil contamination of agricultural land ministry of ecological and environment of the people s republic of china 2018 the environmental quality standards for surface water ministry of ecological and environment of the people s republic of china 2002 the standard for groundwater quality ministry of ecological and environment of the people s republic of china 2017 and the specifications for surface meteorological observation china meteorological administration 2017 three parallel samples were collected from each monitoring site between august 20 and september 20 2017 these samples were placed in clean polyethylene bags under 4 c and were sent to the bureau of hydrology of changjiang water resources commission the sediment samples were initially screened through a 1 mm sieve and naturally air dried afterward these samples were ground in an agate mortar sp 40 shanghai shupei corporation china homogenized and sieved through a 100 μm mesh after pretreatment 0 5 g of samples were digested in a microwave oven cem mars pynn corporation usa with an acid mixture 9 ml of 14 0 mhno3 3 ml of 11 7 mhcl 2 ml of 23 0 mhf and 2 5 ml of 8 8h2o2 before they were condensed to 1 ml 2 ml for total metal analysis the surface water and groundwater samples were initially filtered through a 0 45 μmmembrane afterward 100 ml of samples were digested in a microwave oven cem mars pynn corporation usa with an acid mixture 5 ml of 14 2 g mlhno3 2 ml of 1 67 g mlhclo4 before they were condensed to 5 ml 10 ml for total metal analysis cd was measured via graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry ice3500 thermo fisher corporation usa whereas cr and hg were measured via flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry sk 2003 persee corporation china the gss 7 reference material from the chinese environmental monitoring center was used to ensure quality the parallel errors were controlled within 10 and the average value of the three parallel samples was selected as the heavy metal concentration data the daily average air temperature air pressure and wind speed in each sampling site were measured by using the multiparameter meteor meter fws600 fuaotong corporation china 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of pollutants the detailed experimental data of the sediment samples water samples and meteorological elements are presented in tables 1 3 respectively for clarity the sediment samples in the first to fourth sampling sites are denoted by 1 2 3 and 4 respectively as shown in table 1 1 has the highest concentration of hg whereas 2 has the highest concentrations of cr and cd the concentration of each heavy metal in 3 is less than that in 1 and 2 but higher than that in 4 this observation may be explained by the fact that 4 lies in the central part of western dongting lake whereas 1 2 and 3 lie in the estuary area after discharging into the lake the heavy metals contained in the inflow water are deposited into the sediments because of the rapid decrease in flow rate thereby causing the heavy metals to accumulate in the estuary areas table 2 shows that the resources area of heavy metals can be determined intuitively moreover the pollutant concentrations in the water source area of each basin are much less than those in the other areas whereas the heavy metal concentrations in the surface water and groundwater of the mining area are much higher than those in the surface water of the other areas thereby suggesting that the pollution loads primarily come from mine wastewater fig 1 shows the three major mines in the li river and yuan river basins including wanshan mine fenghuang mine and shimen mine most mines in these two basins have been exploited for hundreds of years fu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 given that the ancient workers lacked environmental protection consciousness a large amount of slag piled up in the open air fu et al 2017 as a result the heavy metal in these slags was easily dissolved by precipitation and discharged into the surface water and groundwater of these two basins the pollution degrees of hg and cr in the urban area are less than those in the mining area but higher than those in the agricultural area moreover the concentrations of these two pollutants in the surface water of the urban area are much higher than those in the groundwater which may be explained by three factors first the industrial and domestic wastewater are primarily discharged into the water through the surface sewage outlet in changde city and zhangjiajie city second a large proportion of the land surface in the metropolitan area of these two cities is covered by pavements and structures that obstruct the exchange between surface water and groundwater third compared with the non urban area the urban area releases more heat and releases less specific heat capacity thereby producing a heat island effect moreover the high buildings in the urban area block the air circulation as shown in table 3 compared with those in the non urban area the air temperatures in the urban area of changde city and zhangjiajie city are higher whereas their air pressures and wind speeds are lower as a result the near ground wind blows the atmospheric pollutants from the suburban domain to the center of the urban area the heavy metals contained in the air are then deposited onto the ground surface because of the rapid decrease in wind speed these pollutants from the atmospheric deposition are then discharged into the surface water through the overland flow fig 1 shows that compared with the li river and yuan river the basin of the songzi river lacks mining and urban areas therefore the pollution load in the basin of songzi river is much less than that in the basins of the other two rivers as a result the concentration of each pollutant in the sediment of 3 is less than that in 1 and 2 the pollution characteristic of cd slightly differs from those of hg and cr table 2 shows that the pollution degrees of cd in the agricultural area is almost the same as those in the urban area furthermore the difference in the cd between the surface water and groundwater of the agricultural area is not as significant as that in the other areas because of several factors first many acid fertilizers such as calcium superphosphate and ammonium chloride are applied to the farmland around western dongting lake ji et al 2017 however these fertilizers reduce the ph of the soil which is conducive to the activation and loss of cd from minerals wang et al 2018 second the major crop around western dongting lake is oryza sativa and farmers are accustomed to returning the rice stem to the farmland after harvest to maintain soil fertility wan et al 2018 oryza sativa is easily enriched with cd from the soil lei et al 2017 as a result after the returned rice stem is decomposed the cd contained in the plant is easily leached into the suspended water and shallow groundwater 3 2 pollution evaluation of each heavy metal based on the gv model introduced in section 2 3 the pollution condition of each heavy metal is evaluated and the results are presented in table 4 table 4 shows that the worst heavy metal in the sediment of western dongting lake is cd according to the results for e 3 and p 3 the pollution grade of cd in the sediment of yuan river estuary 2 is heavily contaminated meanwhile the pollution situations of cd in the sediments of the li river estuary 1 and songzi river estuary 3 are moderately to heavily contaminated and have 0 36 and 0 19 probabilities to deteriorate to heavily contaminated respectively the pollution condition of cd in the sediments of the central part of western dongting lake 4 is uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and has a probability of 0 29 to deteriorate to moderately contaminated the heavy metal with the second highest concentration in the sediments of the estuary region is hg according to the results for e 1 and p 1 the pollution grade of hg in the sediments of yuan river estuary 2 is moderately to heavily contaminated while those in the sediments of li river estuary 1 and songzi river estuary 3 are moderately to heavily contaminated and moderately contaminated and have probabilities of 0 05 and 0 30 to deteriorate to the next category respectively cr is the cleanest pollutant in the sediments of the river estuaries according to the results for e 2 and p 2 all pollution grades of cr in the sediments of these three estuaries are uncontaminated to moderately contaminated without any uncertainty the second and third heaviest contaminated pollutants in the central part of western dongtiung lake are cr and hg this result somewhat differs from those obtained in the estuary region these pollutants have pollution grades of uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and uncontaminated respectively furthermore the pollution of hg has a 0 22 possibility to deteriorate to the next category 3 3 comprehensive evaluation the weight vector w 0 25 0 25 0 50 was generated based on the ahp model in accordance to eq 19 the comprehensive pollution condition is evaluated and the results are presented in table 5 for clarity the synthetic gv of the ith sampling site is denoted by qi while the first order moment of qi is denoted by ei in table 5 e2 e 1 e 3 e 4 indicates that the sediments in the yuan river estuary have the highest comprehensive heavy metal pollution followed by those in the li river estuary songzi river estuary and the central part of western dongting lake in accordance to the results for e 1 e 2 q 1 and q 2 both synthetic heavy metal pollution categories in the sediments of the li river and yuan river estuaries are moderately to heavily contaminated and have 0 19 and 0 36 possibilities to deteriorate to the heavily contaminated category respectively based on the results for e 3 and q 3 the sediments of the songzi river estuary are moderately contaminated and have 0 48 and 0 10 possibilities to deteriorate to the moderately to heavily contaminated and heavily contaminated categories respectively according to the results for e 4 and q 4 the sediments in the central part of western dongting lake are uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and have a 0 15 possibility to deteriorate to the moderately contaminated category according to table 4 all deterioration risks in the sampling sites are introduced by cd as mentioned in section 3 1 these cd loads mostly come from i the slag leachate in wanshan mine shimen mine and fenghuang mine ii the atmospheric deposition and wastewater discharged in changde city and zhangjiajie city iii the acid fertilizers applied to the farmland around western dongting lake and iv the rotten stem of the oryza sativa returned to the farmland around western dongting lake therefore four measures must be adopted to maintain the environmental quality and ecological health of western dongting lake first waterproof and anti seepage projects must be launched in the slag stacking area introduced above to prevent the leachate from polluting the surface water and groundwater second the waste gas and water must be centrally treated before they are discharged in urban areas to retrieve heavy metals third the application of neutral and alkaline fertilizers must be promoted to control the soil acidification and reduce the leaching of minerals fourth the planting of low cd enrichment crops and the harmless disposal of straws must be promoted to prevent cd from returning to the farmland 3 4 differences between gi and gv the heavy metal pollution in the sediments of the study area was evaluated based on the conventional gi model and the results are presented in table 6 the results in table 6 are then compared with those in table 5 to highlight the following differences between the evaluation results of gi and gv i the conventional gi model determines only a rough range of the gi score for each heavy metal by contrast the gv model can further quantify the possibility for each pollution condition to belong to a certain grade thereby providing a highly accurate and detailed representation of uncertainties in the natural environment ii the absence of an algorithm for calculating intervals in the previous environmental assessment literature means that the conventional gi model cannot perform a synthetic evaluation for heavy metal pollution in sediments by contrast the gv model uses the probability vector to represent the pollution condition of each heavy metal therefore gv can perform a synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution by using the matrix vector operation algorithm 4 conclusions the gv model has two advantages over the conventional gi model first by introducing probability theory gv can efficiently deal with the uncertainty in geochemical background information second by using the matrix vector operation algorithm gv can perform a comprehensive synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution in sediments the heavy metal pollution conditions in the sediments of the li river estuary yuan rive estuary songzi river estuary and the central part of western dongting lake are moderately to heavily contaminated moderately to heavily contaminated moderately contaminated and uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and have 0 19 0 36 0 48 and 0 15 possibilities to deteriorate to the next category respectively all deterioration risks in these sites are introduced by cd to maintain the environmental quality and ecological health of western dongting lake the following measures should be adopted i control the slag leachate ii treat urban industrial and domestic wastewater iii promote the use of neutral and alkaline fertilizers and iv improve the crop structure and agricultural customs 5 declarations of interest none acknowledgment this work is supported by the national

6499,hydrological responses of catchments to climate change require detailed examination to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on water resource availability of a catchment in eastern australia i e the manning river catchment and analyzed climate hydrology relationships for this evaluation the xinanjiang xaj model was used and validated to simulate monthly rainfall runoff relationships of the catchment statistically downscaled climate data based on 28 global climate models gcms under rcp8 5 scenarios were used to assess the impacts of climate changes on the manning river catchment our results showed that the xaj model was able to reproduce observed monthly rainfall runoff relationships with an r2 0 94 and a nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 92 the median estimates from the ensemble of downscaled gcm projections showed a slight decrease in annual rainfall and runoff for the period 2021 2060 and an increase for the period 2061 2100 annual actual evapotranspiration was projected to increase slightly while annual soil moisture content was predicted to decrease in the future our results also demonstrated that future changes in seasonal and annual runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are largely dominated by changes in rainfall with a smaller influence arising from changes in temperature an increase in the values of high runoffs and a decrease in the values of low runoffs predicted from the ensemble of the 28 gcms suggest increased variability of water resources at monthly and seasonal time scales in the future a trend of decreasing values in winter runoff and soil moisture content in the future is likely to aggravate possible future reductions in water availability in eastern australia these results contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern australia keywords gcms xinanjiang xaj model climate change eastern australia runoff 1 introduction global increases in atmospheric temperature is intensifying hydrological processes huntington 2006 oki and kanae 2006 for example climate change is associated with changes in rainfall amount timing and distribution increase in rates of evapotranspiration and changes in other climatic variables and these changes will be amplified in runoff chiew et al 2009 reshmidevi et al 2018 as a result hydrological responses to global climate change have been widely studied in recent years thus menzel and bürger 2002 predicted a trend of decreasing mean runoff for a catchment in germany while su et al 2017 reported that annual average runoff would increase in the 21st century in the upper yangtze river basin in china by the end of this century annual runoff is projected to decrease in parts of southern africa the middle east and southern europe while increased annual runoff is projected to occur in high northern latitudes consistent with large increases in spring and winter rainfall under the rcp8 5 scenario ipcc 2013 australia has the world s most variable climate manolas 2010 stokes et al 2010 and climate change has significantly affected australian regional water availability and ecosystem health csiro 2016 eastern australia including the majority ca 80 of the australian population is influenced by large scale drivers of atmospheric circulation including the el niño southern oscillation the indian ocean dipole and the southern annular mode cleverly et al 2016 leading to high variability and the frequent occurrence of extensive droughts and floods for instance eastern australia has been subject to considerable climate variability including the millennium drought and the two wettest years on record for australia 2010 2011 the latter as a result of two strong la niña events while several studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on the hydrology of eastern australia chiew et al 2009 vaze and teng 2011 there have been few detailed studies of impacts of climate change on individual catchments in eastern australia consequently we examined a catchment representative of eastern australia to provide detailed insight for future options for water management in most studies of the impacts of climate change global climate models gcms have been the primary means used for global and regional climate simulations reshmidevi et al 2018 especially with the large improvements in climate modelling in recent decades ipcc 2014 however climatic variables simulated from gcms are often too spatially coarse to be used directly in hydrological models jiang et al 2007 furthermore archived daily sequences simulated by gcms are currently available only for specific periods time slices of a few decades liu and zuo 2012 and for a few gcms therefore downscaling approaches have to be adopted to transform large scale gcms outputs to daily time series at local and regional scales liu and zuo 2012 silberstein et al 2012 over the last few decades a series of downscaling methods have been used for this purpose ahmed et al 2013 diaz nieto and wilby 2005 fowler et al 2007 frei et al 2003 gordon and o farrell 1997 hewitson and crane 2006 dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling are the two basic downscaling methods in the one way coupling of gcms and hydrological models chen et al 2012 fowler et al 2007 dynamical downscaling models involving the use of regional numerical models that include full sets of physics tang et al 2016 are highly computationally demanding and restricted to time slices although they have explicit physical meanings fowler et al 2007 in contrast statistical downscaling models are relatively computationally efficient and have been widely applied in assessments of impacts of regional climate change particularly in hydrological response assessments chen et al 2012 hay and clark 2003 thus in this study daily rainfall and meteorological variables were downscaled from monthly gcm simulations to specific sites with bias correction procedures using a statistical downscaling approach liu and zuo 2012 and this represents the first such application downscaled climatic variables are adopted as the input data for hydrological models to simulate historical and future runoff and to estimate impacts of climate change on runoff chang and jung 2010 ruelland et al 2012 in this way hydrological models are first calibrated using observed runoff data and then the hydrological models are run using downscaled climatic data with the same calibrated parameters and impacts of climate change on runoff are estimated using the modelled historical and future runoffs chiew et al 2009 reshmidevi et al 2018 however many uncertainties which depend on climate modelling downscaling techniques and simulated hydrologic regimes are incorporated along the entire modelling chain chen et al 2012 prudhomme et al 2003 climatic uncertainty is linked to green house gas ghg emission scenarios and especially to gcms minville et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that choosing a single gcm is the main factor contributing to the overall uncertainty in climate change impact modelling jie et al 2011 wilby and harris 2006 due to the enormous uncertainty caused by the choice of a single gcm an ensemble of multiple gcms has been adopted in many recent analyses tebaldi and knutti 2007 zhang and huang 2013 and multi gcms ensembles appear to provide more comprehensive simulations of climatic variables than a single gcm knutti et al 2010 in addition using simulations of a multi gcms ensemble may balance out non stationary biases which is unlikely to be corrected by statistical downscaling approaches liu and zuo 2012 therefore a diversity of gcms 28 from cmip5 under rcp8 5 will be used in the present study to minimize the uncertainty caused by the choice of gcms the xinanjiang xaj model a rainfall runoff basin model has been successfully and widely used in humid and semi humid catchments in china as a standard tool for a number of hydrological simulation purposes jayawardena and zhou 2000 jiang et al 2007 xu and singh 2004 yao et al 2014 for example tian et al 2013 used the xaj model to assess impacts of climate change on river high flows in a basin in china for the near future 2011 2040 it has also been successfully applied in many other countries including the united states canada germany belgium france sweden japan and thailand sahoo 2005 xu and singh 2004 for instance seiller and anctil 2014 examined climate change impacts on the hydrologic regime of a catchment in canada using the xaj model and other lumped conceptual models in addition the xaj model has been used across 210 catchments of southeast australia including the murray darling basin and the south east coast drainage basins that cover the most populated and important agricultural regions of australia with nse values in the calibration periods of greater than 0 6 in 80 percent of these catchments li et al 2009 zhang and chiew 2009 consequently this study will apply the xaj model forced with statistical downscaling of daily climate data based on 28 gcms to study the hydrological response to climate change in an australian catchment we aimed to evaluate hydrological responses to climate change in eastern australia specifically using the manning river catchment as a case study the objectives of this study were to 1 test the performance of the xaj model for simulating rainfall runoff relationship of the manning river catchment 2 project future changes in simulated runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content and 3 identify the importance of different climatic variables in explaining future changes in water availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the manning river catchment is located on the new south wales nsw mid north coast and includes the towns of taree wingham gloucester and walcha and has a temperate climate with summer dominated rainfall chiew and mcmahon 2002 fig 1 the catchment area is approximately 6630 km2 with elevation ranging from 12 m to 1591 m see fig 1 mean annual temperature for the study area is 14 9 c mean annual rainfall is 1052 mm mean annual potential evaporation is 1305 mm and the runoff coefficient is 0 20 zhang et al 2013 the manning river flows for 250 km rising in the great dividing range to the east of the basin and flowing south east through a coastal floodplain to taree where it divides in two the manning river catchment does not have large groundwater storages providing base flow to the river and the narrow floodplain pockets are the only source of base flow hughes et al 2011 in addition most of the rivers and creeks in the manning river catchment are unregulated with no major storages to capture and control flows as in most unregulated rivers flows are most affected during relatively dry times and this has been identified as one of the key water management issues in this catchment when water supply is low and consumptive demand high https www industry nsw gov au water basins catchments snapshots manning in addition significant decreases in river flows resulting from below average rainfall affects the stability of the manning river estuary entrance ruprecht and peirson 2011 however very few studies regarding hydrological response to climate change have been carried out in the manning river catchment thus this study represents an important step toward the assessment of the effects of the changing climate on catchment runoff and can help inform future priorities for regional water management of river basin in the context of global climate change in eastern australia the manning river gauging station at killawarra receives streamflow from the vast majority of water sources within the manning emu entitlement management unit therefore the manning river catchment above killawarra gauging station was selected as the case study area 2 2 observed data daily rainfall and potential evaporation data were used for hydrological simulation to incorporate the large spatial heterogeneity of rainfall across this catchment rainfall data from 30 meteorological stations sites within or close to the catchment were sampled fig 1 the thiessen polygon method was selected to estimate the mean area rainfall of this catchment because this is the most common and effective method for calculating spatial distribution of rainfall jiang et al 2007 the method proposed by abtew 1996 was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration using solar radiation and maximum daily temperature abtew 1996 daily streamflow data of the killawarra hydrological station were collected from the website of the australian government bureau of meteorology http www bom gov au waterdata daily observed hydrological and meteorological data in the period from 1991 to 2016 were used for hydrological model calibration and validation 2 3 statistical downscaling technique monthly gridded rainfall and climate data from gcms were downscaled to the meteorological observation sites at a daily time step using a statistical downscaling model nwai wg developed by liu and zuo 2012 this rapid and reliable statistical downscaling method consists of two steps to perform spatial and temporal downscaling separately this approach relies on empirical relationships between observational data and gcm outputs first the monthly gridded climate projections from gcms were spatially interpolated to specific sites of interest in this case 30 sites within or close to the manning river catchment fig 1 using an inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method followed by a bias correction procedure to correct site based monthly gcm simulations second daily climatic variables e g maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall were then generated for each site from the spatially downscaled projections by using a modified version of the wgen stochastic weather generator richardson and wright 1984 with parameters derived from the bias corrected monthly data see liu and zuo 2012 for details the validation carried out by liu and zuo 2012 has shown that this downscaling method can reproduce the observed climatic variables at daily monthly and annual time scales well unlike other statistical downscaling approaches developed in australia which have only been applied to either specific time periods timbal et al 2009 or small areas mehrotra and sharma 2010 due to data availability or time and cost this approach can be easily applied to any archived monthly gcm data for any site and across multiple time periods as the approach requires only monthly gcm data and daily historical climate records in this research we applied a post downscaling treatment to the nwai wg downscaled data when the downscaled site climate data are applied to catchment the occurrence of inconsistent daily rainfalls between sites can result in a more rainfall days and b smaller daily rainfall over the catchment and potentially poor simulation of the peak flows in the post downscaling treatment we selected the central station as the reference station and re downscaled other 29 sites in the catchment to have the same rainfall events with the amounts of gcm projected rainfalls for respective sites this method is validate based on the hypothesis that the weather stations are close enough so that the rain days are fairly consistent the catchment area is approximately 6630 km2 that is the radius of the study area is around 40 km thus we considered this catchment downscaling method is validate for this study this study was focused on the analyses of three periods of simulations the first examined the period 1977 2016 referred to as immediate past or baseline the second examined the period 2021 2060 referred to as the near future or 2040 s and the third the period 2061 2100 referred to as the far future or 2080 s in addition for baseline and future time periods hydro meteorological variables were downscaled from 28 gcms wang et al 2017 of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 under the rcp8 5 scenario rcp 8 5 a scenario that represents comparatively high greenhouse gas emission riahi et al 2011 and matches the current trajectory of ghgs fuss et al 2015 pagán et al 2016 to present the range in projected future climate monthly seasonal and annual change in maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall for the 28 gcms in the near future and the far future compared to baseline were computed for the catchment in addition monthly seasonal and annual changes in runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the 28 gcms in the 2040 s and 2080 s compared to baseline were estimated to show the range in projected future hydrological variables 2 4 the xaj model the xaj model is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model with physical based parameters zhao et al 1980 the model is widely used in humid and semi humid basins in china hu et al 2005 and was recently adopted and validated in southeast australia li et al 2012 furthermore the xaj model consistently performs better than four other conceptual rainfall runoff models the pitman model of south africa hughes 2013 the sacramento model of usa sorooshian et al 1993 the nam model of denmark nielsen and hansen 1973 and the smar model of ireland kachroo 1992 even in relatively dry catchments gan et al 1997 therefore the xaj model was selected for hydrological simulations in the present study the xaj model which uses rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data to simulate runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content is divided into four layers evapotranspiration runoff production separation of runoff components and flow concentration zhao 1992 its main feature is the concept of runoff formation of repletion of storage which means that runoff is not produced until the soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaches field capacity and thereafter runoff equals the rainfall excess without further loss zhao 1992 the flow chart of the xaj model is shown in fig 2 and the model parameters are listed in table 1 it should be noted that the xaj model used in this study does not consider vegetation and its interaction with the atmosphere however it has the advantage of fewer input data and simpler application it is crucial for water resource managers to be conscious of and prepared for the impacts of climate change on hydrological variables therefore daily hydrological simulations under baseline and future scenarios were obtained using the xaj model driven by downscaled climatic variables from 28 gcms to evaluate the changes in catchment hydrological cycle runoff which represents an integrated response to climatic inputs throughout the whole drainage basin is a very important indicator of the impacts of climate change on water resources in addition climate change will lead to changes in other hydrological variables which can also be simulated by the xaj model therefore changes of actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were also included in this study soil moisture is defined as the areal mean tension water storage w in the xaj model zhao 1992 the xaj model was calibrated and validated against river flow data only we did not calibrate and validate the model simulations in actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content because of a lack of field data for these variables the absolute values of soil moisture content should therefore not be used directly nevertheless it is still reasonable and valuable to compare the relative changes in the simulations because the model mimics the actual hydrological processes 2 5 parameter estimation and performance evaluation there are a lot of missed observed flow data in 1983 1989 and 1990 at killawarra gauging station however observed flow data from 1991 to 2016 26 years are relatively complete and continuous and were selected for model calibration and validation the time period for calibration and validation years was determined by the length of the observed data record for sufficiently long periods of observed data that represent different climate conditions it is possible to split the available data equally for calibration and validation however the observed record 26 years is not sufficient for an equal split the length of the data may be different in such a way that the calibration period is sufficiently long since optimized model parameters during calibration are used for model validation without further adjustment ayele et al 2017 therefore daily observed and simulated runoff in the period 1991 2008 18 years were used for model calibration and data from 2009 to 2016 8 years were used for model validation a global optimization method the sce ua shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona duan et al 2015 is an effective and efficient optimization technique for calibration of watershed models and was used to optimize xaj model parameters it combines the best features of multiple complex shuffling and competitive evolution based on the simplex search method nelder and mead 1965 the xaj model is calibrated by maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of daily flow together with a constraint to ensure that the total modelled flow in the calibration period is within 5 of the total observed flow vaze and teng 2011 nse and coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the performance of the xaj model the nse is one of the most widely used criteria for comparing hydrologic model performance with observed values le and pricope 2017 in addition many studies also used nse and r2 to evaluate the performance of hydrological models le and pricope 2017 vu et al 2012 nse varies from to 1 a value of 1 means the simulations perfectly match the observations so the closer the nse value is to 1 the better the hydrological model is deemed to have performed in general when both nse and r2 exceed 0 50 the hydrological model is deemed to effectively simulate stream flow for a given catchment liu et al 2017 the nse and r2 were calculated as follows 1 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 2 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 where q obs and q sim are the observed and simulated daily flow m3 s respectively q is the mean flow m3 s i is the ith sample and n is the number of samples 2 6 regression analyses prior to the analysis of the simulations we applied a bias correction procedure called secondary bias correction yang et al 2016 to correct the differences of the simulated outputs forced by gcm projected climate over those forced by observed climate a multiple liner regression model mlrm was used to quantify the effects of climate variables maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall on hydrologic variables runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture mlrm is a linear model that describes how y variable relates to two or more x variables dar 2017 the general structure of the model is as given below 3 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 where y is the dependent or response variable x is independent or predictor variable in this study the model is defined as below 4 δ y a δ t max b δ t min c δ r where δy is projected changes in hydrological variables runoff actual evapotranspiration or soil moisture δtmax c δtmin c and δr are changes in maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall respectively from these regression analyses the contribution of the change in specific climate factors to changes in hydrologic variables were quantified in addition rainfall elasticity c defined here as the proportional change in runoff divided by the proportional change in rainfall can also be derived 3 results 3 1 xaj model calibration and validation calibrated parameters for the xaj model in the manning river catchment are shown in table 1 runoff simulations at daily time scale were aggregated to monthly values and were compared with the observed data monthly observed runoff and the xaj model simulated runoff for calibration and validation periods in the manning river catchment were strongly correlated r2 0 94 and nse 0 92 and closely replicated temporal variation figs 3 and 4 with slopes within 25 of the 1 1 regression the slope of the regression during the validation period was much closer to the 1 1 line than that in the calibration period which may be caused by the slight underestimation of the extremely high runoff observed in the calibration period 3 2 projected changes in temperature and rainfall projected maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall in the future were aggregated to monthly and seasonal time scales and compared with baseline values all 28 gcms used in this study agree on a future temperature rise with higher temperature increases in 2080 s than 2040 s at both monthly and seasonal time scales figs 5 and 6 for maximum monthly temperatures fig 5a the largest median increase was 1 6 c 0 9 1 9 c in november by 2040 s and 3 8 c 3 5 4 2 c in september by 2080 s while the lowest median increase was 1 1 c 0 9 1 7 c in march by 2040 s and 2 5 c 1 8 3 0 c in february by 2080 s the range of uncertainty in brackets indicates the 25th and 75th percentiles of the 28 gcms used herein at seasonal time scales fig 6a the maximum temperature was projected to increase most in spring in both future periods the median increase was 1 5 c 1 1 1 8 c in 2040 s and 3 4 c 2 8 3 9 c in 2080 s while increases were lowest in autumn in 2040 s 1 3 c 0 9 1 6 c and in summer in 2080 s 2 9 c 2 4 3 4 c for temperature minima figs 5b and 6b the median estimate demonstrated the largest increase in may 1 9 c 1 6 2 5 c in 2040 s and 4 9 c 3 7 5 5 c in 2080 s autumn 1 7 c 1 4 1 9 c in 2040 s and 4 1 c 3 3 4 7 c in 2080 s and the smallest increase in temperature minima in february 1 0 c 0 8 1 3 c in 2040 s and 2 5 c 1 8 3 1 c in 2080 s summer 1 2 c 0 9 1 3 c in 2040 s and 2 7 c 2 3 3 2 c in 2080 s in the future the median increase for maximum temperature at an annual time scale was 1 4 c 1 2 1 5 c by 2021 2060 and 3 2 c 2 7 3 5 c by 2061 2100 fig 6a while median annual minimum temperatures were predicted to increase by 1 5 c 1 3 1 7 c in 2040 s and 3 5 c 3 1 4 1 c in 2080 s fig 6b changes to future rainfall differ across the different gcms and across seasons with the majority of gcms simulating increases in november march rainfall and the majority of gcms simulating decreases in the period of april to october the largest ensemble median increase in rainfall occurred in december 4 2 7 6 13 4 in 2040 s and 13 4 10 9 31 4 in 2080 s while the largest median decrease occurred in september 10 6 20 7 8 1 in 2040 s and 20 7 34 0 9 7 in 2080 s fig 5c median spring 1 7 13 5 10 0 in 2040 s and 1 4 17 4 13 8 in 2080 s and autumn 1 1 6 0 4 8 in 2040 s and 0 7 9 3 7 5 in 2080 s rainfall was projected to have relatively small changes in the future in contrast median rainfall was projected to have a larger increase in summer 4 2 3 6 11 7 in 2040 s and 9 1 2 9 24 9 in 2080 s but a decline 4 0 13 1 3 1 in 2040 s and 11 7 20 9 3 5 in 2080 s in winter with larger changes in 2080 s than in 2040 s at annual time scales the changes in rainfall as estimated by the 28 ranged from 5 2 25th percentile to 4 2 75th percentile in 2040 s and 9 5 25th percentile to 10 8 75th percentile in 2080 s with ensemble median values of 0 3 and 4 6 respectively 3 3 changes in simulated runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture projected runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were aggregated to monthly and seasonal time scales and were compared with baseline data the largest median monthly increase in runoff was 6 9 23 2 26 7 in november by 2040 s and 31 1 2 6 71 4 in february by 2080 s while the largest median decrease was 16 7 23 9 13 2 in june by 2040 s and 20 5 31 1 4 2 in july by 2080 s fig 7 a thus the largest monthly runoff is projected to shift from march during the baseline period table 2 to february in the far future the lowest runoff in september was simulated to decline 4 3 24 2 14 3 in 2040 s and 16 3 33 2 3 8 in 2080 s in the future the second largest runoff which occurred in the summer in the baseline period was projected to increase 11 6 12 8 24 9 in 2040 s and 23 8 5 3 46 2 in 2080 s in the future whereas the second smallest runoff which currently occurs in winter was projected to decline 6 9 23 0 4 9 in 2040 s and 14 8 28 7 to 0 06 in 2080 s in the future table 2 fig 8 a thus the largest seasonal runoff which currently occurs in the autumn was predicted to change to the summer in 2040 s and 2080 s in addition in 2080 s these monthly and seasonal changes generally became larger than those predicted in the 2040 s figs 7a and 8a there were considerable differences in the runoff projection of different gcms figs 7a 8a thus at annual time scales runoff change estimated by the 28 gcms ranged from 10 6 25th percentile to 8 9 75th percentile in 2040 s and 17 2 25th percentile to 22 0 75th percentile in 2080 s with median values of 2 3 and 7 7 respectively fig 8a furthermore median values in annual runoff in 2080 s showed a slight increase compared to 2040 s fig 8a and this may be related to the increase in rainfall in 2080 s fig 6c there was a wide range in differences among modelled values of actual evapotranspiration responses simulated by the 28 gcms median monthly actual evapotranspiration was projected to decrease only in august 2 2 5 1 5 1 in 2040 s and 4 3 13 7 3 7 in 2080 s september 4 1 11 4 1 3 in 2040 s and 8 9 21 1 to 1 4 in 2080 s and october 5 3 11 7 to 0 4 in 2040 s and 7 4 16 9 3 0 in 2080 s winter spring while median seasonal actual evapotranspiration only showed a trend of decreasing values 2 2 10 3 2 7 in 2040 s and 3 2 15 7 3 7 in 2080 s in spring in the future figs 7 and 8 at annual time scales actual evapotranspiration change estimated by the 28 gcms ranged from 3 0 25th percentile to 3 7 75th percentile in 2040 s and 4 3 25th percentile to 8 6 75th percentile in 2080 s with median values of 0 6 and 1 8 respectively fig 8b however the differences in actual evapotranspiration changes under different gcms are smaller than the modelled changes in runoff figs 7a b and 8a b differences in predicted 40 year mean monthly seasonal and annual soil moisture content resulting from different gcms were also considerable figs 7c 8c furthermore the median estimate indicated that monthly soil moisture content was projected to have a trend of decreasing values except february 1 5 8 8 5 3 in 2040 s and to increase slightly only in december 3 6 16 6 14 1 january 2 0 5 0 9 7 february 4 1 6 2 14 9 and march 0 7 7 0 12 9 in 2080 s while seasonal soil moisture was predicted to decrease in 2040 s and to increase marginally 0 5 7 9 10 7 only in summer in 2080 s finally at annual time scales changes in soil moisture content simulated by the 28 gcms ranged from 8 8 25th percentile to 0 2 75th percentile in 2040 s and 15 5 25th percentile to 1 6 75th percentile in 2080 s with ensemble median values of 4 4 and 5 1 respectively 3 4 relationships among hydrological responses and climate variables relationships among changes in hydrologic variables runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture content and changes in daily maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall are shown in table 3 runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were all largely dominated by rainfall at annual and seasonal time scales at annual time scales change in runoff was only significantly correlated with change in rainfall while change in actual evapotranspiration was significantly correlated with change in rainfall and daily maximum and minimum temperatures while soil moisture content was primarily dominated by rainfall and daily maximum temperature furthermore correlations of changes in hydrological variables to changes in climatic variables were estimated using the multiple regression model for example runoff could change by 5 1 7 2 7 7 and 10 6 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively with an annual change of 4 9 as a result of an increase of maximum temperature of 1 0 c annual rainfall elasticity of runoff was about 2 1 that is a 1 change in mean annual rainfall results in a 2 1 change in mean annual runoff in this catchment finally the effect of changes in rainfall on actual evapotranspiration was smaller than its effect on soil moisture content and much smaller than its impact on runoff at seasonal and annual time scales for instance a 1 change in mean annual rainfall results in a 0 6 and 0 8 change in mean annual actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content respectively in this catchment 4 discussion in this study hydrological responses to climate change in the manning river catchment were simulated using an ensemble of 28 gcms and the xaj model the overall calibration and validation results demonstrated that the xaj model was able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed runoff in this catchment figs 3 and 4 and the calibrated xaj model can be further used to evaluate the impacts of climate change on catchment hydrological variables while the hydrological model was generally able to replicate observed runoff it might have some difficulties in reproducing the extreme high runoff in the calibration period figs 3 and 4 similar results in reproducing peak flow also occur in other hydrological models for example tian et al 2013 used three models gr4j perrin et al 2003 hbv lindström et al 1997 and xaj to simulate daily discharge and their results demonstrated an underestimation of high rates of discharge in all three models eum et al 2017 used the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model to simulate daily runoff and found a poor capacity to simulate both low flows and very high flows thus difficulties in reproducing the highest rates of runoff are common because of the theories of hydrological models and criteria of model calibration this may be attributed to the theory of runoff production hao et al 2015 for example the xaj model assumes that runoff is not generated until soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaches field capacity this assumption may not be valid during heavy rain events because these can produce runoff when soils are not fully filled with water unsaturation runoff due to insufficient infiltration which is not simulated in the xaj model only saturation excess runoff is simulated therefore modification of the model structure by including unsaturation runoff during heavy rainfall events may lead to improved hydrologic simulations during these periods our results indicated that the median annual increase for maximum temperature was 1 4 c 1 2 1 5 c by 2021 2060 and 3 2 c 2 7 3 5 c by 2061 2100 while minimum temperature was predicted to increase by 1 5 c 1 3 1 7 c in 2021 2060 and 3 5 c 3 1 4 1 c in 2061 2100 the projected trend of increasing temperature agrees with previous studies for instance wang et al 2017 reported a 3 7 c increase in temperature for rcp8 5 across the wheat belt in nsw by 2061 2100 moreover an ensemble of 12 rcm simulations 4 gcms 3 rcms performed by the nsw and act regional climate modelling narclim project projects a 0 7 c rise in mean temperature by 2020 2039 and a 2 0 c rise by 2060 2079 in the north coast region of nsw including the manning river catchment www ccrc unsw edu au sites default files narclim index html however it should be noted that future time periods in our research 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 and the narclim project 2020 2039 and 2060 2079 are not exactly the same in addition to temperature our results also showed that median rainfall is projected to have a significant increase in summer and a decrease in winter in the future although the largest rainfall is in the summer and the lowest rainfall is in winter in this catchment table 2 therefore the trend of increasing values in high rainfalls and a trend of decreasing values in low rainfalls are likely to generate a larger degree of inter seasonal variation in the manning river catchment in the future this is generally consistent with previous studies for example narclim also projects an increase in rainfall during summer autumn and spring and a decrease in winter across the north coast region by 2060 2079 in addition liu and zuo 2012 analyzed the changes in summer and winter rainfall and found an increase in summer rainfall whilst winter rainfall has a high probability of decreasing in most areas of new south wales our results showed that multi gcm ensemble median values exhibit a slight decrease 2 3 10 6 8 9 in annual runoff in 2040 s which is similar to the trend of change in previous studies despite the gcms hydrological models downscaling methods and time periods differing across studies for instance chiew and mcmahon 2002 concluded that the annual runoff in catchments on the east coast of australia could change by 15 by 2030 relative to 1990 similarly chiew et al 2003 used the simhyd model and the csiro mark 2 gcm simulations and found a decrease in mean annual runoff of 6 8 in most of eastern australia in 2021 2050 relative to 1961 1990 vaze and teng 2011 used 15 gcms and the median estimate indicates that future mean annual runoff in 2030 relative to 1990 will be no change to a slight reduction in the eastern parts of australia in addition median estimates suggest a trend of increasing values in summer runoff the second largest runoff in the baseline period and a trend of decreasing values in winter runoff the second smallest runoff in the baseline period in the future consequently the trend of increasing values of high runoffs and a trend of decreasing values of low runoffs is likely to generate larger inter seasonal differences in the future this seasonal change in runoff is also consistent with previous studies chiew et al 2009 eisner et al 2017 vaze and teng 2011 moreover median estimates show that seasonal soil moisture content is predicted to decrease significantly in spring and winter the projected decrease in runoff and soil moisture in winter will threaten surface water supplies and have adverse implications for agriculture gardner 2009 which has significant implication for land and water resource management in the future changes in regional temperature and rainfall expected to occur as a result of future climate change may have significant impacts on different components of a catchment water budget nash and gleick 1991 thus changes in runoff are largely related to variations in rainfall reshmidevi et al 2018 in addition changes in temperature are likely to have impacts on runoff production through increasing evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation wang et al 2016 our results suggested that runoff changes are more sensitive to changes in rainfall than changes to temperature table 3 and this agrees with previous studies chiew et al 1995 a case in point is that chiew and mcmahon 2002 carried out climate change impacts modelling on 28 unimpaired australian catchments and found that the impact on runoff was much more dependent on rainfall than temperature rainfall elasticity is a simple estimate of the sensitivity of runoff to changes in rainfall and is particularly useful as an initial estimate of climate change impacts on runoff chiew 2006 thus it should be noted from table 3 coefficient c for annual runoff is 2 08 that the percentage change in average annual rainfall is generally amplified two fold in average annual runoff change which is also in commonly observed in previous research chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 for example jones et al 2006 estimated the sensitivity of mean annual runoff to climate change using 3 models across 22 australian catchments and results show mean sensitivities of 2 4 2 5 and 2 1 change in mean annual flow for every 1 change in mean annual rainfall respectively in addition table 3 shows that the lowest seasonal rainfall elasticity of runoff was observed in spring and this may be because of the largest et p evapotranspiration rainfall ratio occurring in spring table 2 which means spring is a relatively dry season in this catchment and the increase in rainfall is mainly used to evaporate and replenish soil moisture content table 3 shows that the highest value of coefficient c for seasonal actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture occurs in spring in addition to runoff variation in modelled actual evapotranspiration and modelled soil moisture content were also both largely dominated by variation in rainfall and have a weaker correlation with changes in temperature at annual and seasonal scales table 3 therefore there was a good correlation between the major components of the water budget and rainfall reflecting the fact that rainfall is the ultimate source of water for the land surface water budget fekete et al 2004 however the effect of variation in rainfall on actual evapotranspiration is much smaller than its effect on runoff in agreement with previous findings chiew and mcmahon 2002 assessments of the impacts of climate change on catchment water budgets are affected by the uncertainties in the gcms downscaling methods and ghg emission scenarios as well as the uncertainty in the hydrologic model itself this study used an ensemble of 28 gcms to reduce uncertainties arising from the choice of a single gcm however we only used one hydrological model to simulate water resource availability and therefore this may contribute some uncertainty because of the choice of model parameters and model structure eum et al 2017 jiang et al 2007 applied six monthly water balance models and found large differences in predicted runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content among models consequently using an ensemble of hydrological models a larger array of climate projections different downscaling methods and various bias correction algorithms is recommended to provide a full range and probability of future hydrologic simulations eum et al 2017 teutschbein and seibert 2012 in addition the present study was focused on the manning river catchment which although deemed to be representative of such catchments lacks replication at the catchment scale consequently more catchments will be selected in a following study to represent the large range of climate physical and flow characteristics throughout australia and to provide insights for future water management 5 summary and conclusions this study analysed the hydrologic sensitivity of the manning river catchment under projected climate change scenarios using the xaj hydrological model driven by statistically downscaled climate data from 28 gcms for the xaj model calibration and validation periods the daily nse were 0 89 and 0 93 and daily r2 were 0 93 and 0 93 respectively with monthly nse 0 92 and monthly r2 0 94 therefore the xaj model performed satisfactorily in this catchment nse and r2 were much larger than 0 50 this study explored the impacts of climate change on the water balance of the manning river catchment for 2040 s and 2080 s runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were all largely dominated by rainfall at annual and seasonal time scales maximum temperature was predicted to increase 1 4 c 1 2 1 5 c and 3 2 c 2 7 3 5 c in 2040 s and 2080 s while minimum temperature was predicted to increase 1 5 c 1 3 1 7 c and 3 5 c 3 1 4 1 c in 2040 s and 2080 s respectively as estimated from the median of the 28 gcms at an annual time scale rainfall runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were projected to change 0 3 5 2 4 2 and 4 6 9 5 10 8 2 3 10 6 8 9

increasing values in high rainfall and runoff and the trend of decreasing values in low rainfall and runoff estimated from the ensemble of the 28 gcms a larger degree of inter seasonal variation in the manning river catchment are likely to be generated in the future in addition reductions in winter runoff and spring and winter soil moisture content in the future are likely to aggravate future water stress for crop growth and productivity elmahdi 2015 these results can potentially contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern australia the research methods used in the manning river catchment of eastern australia can be further extended to any other catchments and we expect our study provides

6499,hydrological responses of catchments to climate change require detailed examination to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on water resource availability of a catchment in eastern australia i e the manning river catchment and analyzed climate hydrology relationships for this evaluation the xinanjiang xaj model was used and validated to simulate monthly rainfall runoff relationships of the catchment statistically downscaled climate data based on 28 global climate models gcms under rcp8 5 scenarios were used to assess the impacts of climate changes on the manning river catchment our results showed that the xaj model was able to reproduce observed monthly rainfall runoff relationships with an r2 0 94 and a nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 92 the median estimates from the ensemble of downscaled gcm projections showed a slight decrease in annual rainfall and runoff for the period 2021 2060 and an increase for the period 2061 2100 annual actual evapotranspiration was projected to increase slightly while annual soil moisture content was predicted to decrease in the future our results also demonstrated that future changes in seasonal and annual runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are largely dominated by changes in rainfall with a smaller influence arising from changes in temperature an increase in the values of high runoffs and a decrease in the values of low runoffs predicted from the ensemble of the 28 gcms suggest increased variability of water resources at monthly and seasonal time scales in the future a trend of decreasing values in winter runoff and soil moisture content in the future is likely to aggravate possible future reductions in water availability in eastern australia these results contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern australia keywords gcms xinanjiang xaj model climate change eastern australia runoff 1 introduction global increases in atmospheric temperature is intensifying hydrological processes huntington 2006 oki and kanae 2006 for example climate change is associated with changes in rainfall amount timing and distribution increase in rates of evapotranspiration and changes in other climatic variables and these changes will be amplified in runoff chiew et al 2009 reshmidevi et al 2018 as a result hydrological responses to global climate change have been widely studied in recent years thus menzel and bürger 2002 predicted a trend of decreasing mean runoff for a catchment in germany while su et al 2017 reported that annual average runoff would increase in the 21st century in the upper yangtze river basin in china by the end of this century annual runoff is projected to decrease in parts of southern africa the middle east and southern europe while increased annual runoff is projected to occur in high northern latitudes consistent with large increases in spring and winter rainfall under the rcp8 5 scenario ipcc 2013 australia has the world s most variable climate manolas 2010 stokes et al 2010 and climate change has significantly affected australian regional water availability and ecosystem health csiro 2016 eastern australia including the majority ca 80 of the australian population is influenced by large scale drivers of atmospheric circulation including the el niño southern oscillation the indian ocean dipole and the southern annular mode cleverly et al 2016 leading to high variability and the frequent occurrence of extensive droughts and floods for instance eastern australia has been subject to considerable climate variability including the millennium drought and the two wettest years on record for australia 2010 2011 the latter as a result of two strong la niña events while several studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on the hydrology of eastern australia chiew et al 2009 vaze and teng 2011 there have been few detailed studies of impacts of climate change on individual catchments in eastern australia consequently we examined a catchment representative of eastern australia to provide detailed insight for future options for water management in most studies of the impacts of climate change global climate models gcms have been the primary means used for global and regional climate simulations reshmidevi et al 2018 especially with the large improvements in climate modelling in recent decades ipcc 2014 however climatic variables simulated from gcms are often too spatially coarse to be used directly in hydrological models jiang et al 2007 furthermore archived daily sequences simulated by gcms are currently available only for specific periods time slices of a few decades liu and zuo 2012 and for a few gcms therefore downscaling approaches have to be adopted to transform large scale gcms outputs to daily time series at local and regional scales liu and zuo 2012 silberstein et al 2012 over the last few decades a series of downscaling methods have been used for this purpose ahmed et al 2013 diaz nieto and wilby 2005 fowler et al 2007 frei et al 2003 gordon and o farrell 1997 hewitson and crane 2006 dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling are the two basic downscaling methods in the one way coupling of gcms and hydrological models chen et al 2012 fowler et al 2007 dynamical downscaling models involving the use of regional numerical models that include full sets of physics tang et al 2016 are highly computationally demanding and restricted to time slices although they have explicit physical meanings fowler et al 2007 in contrast statistical downscaling models are relatively computationally efficient and have been widely applied in assessments of impacts of regional climate change particularly in hydrological response assessments chen et al 2012 hay and clark 2003 thus in this study daily rainfall and meteorological variables were downscaled from monthly gcm simulations to specific sites with bias correction procedures using a statistical downscaling approach liu and zuo 2012 and this represents the first such application downscaled climatic variables are adopted as the input data for hydrological models to simulate historical and future runoff and to estimate impacts of climate change on runoff chang and jung 2010 ruelland et al 2012 in this way hydrological models are first calibrated using observed runoff data and then the hydrological models are run using downscaled climatic data with the same calibrated parameters and impacts of climate change on runoff are estimated using the modelled historical and future runoffs chiew et al 2009 reshmidevi et al 2018 however many uncertainties which depend on climate modelling downscaling techniques and simulated hydrologic regimes are incorporated along the entire modelling chain chen et al 2012 prudhomme et al 2003 climatic uncertainty is linked to green house gas ghg emission scenarios and especially to gcms minville et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that choosing a single gcm is the main factor contributing to the overall uncertainty in climate change impact modelling jie et al 2011 wilby and harris 2006 due to the enormous uncertainty caused by the choice of a single gcm an ensemble of multiple gcms has been adopted in many recent analyses tebaldi and knutti 2007 zhang and huang 2013 and multi gcms ensembles appear to provide more comprehensive simulations of climatic variables than a single gcm knutti et al 2010 in addition using simulations of a multi gcms ensemble may balance out non stationary biases which is unlikely to be corrected by statistical downscaling approaches liu and zuo 2012 therefore a diversity of gcms 28 from cmip5 under rcp8 5 will be used in the present study to minimize the uncertainty caused by the choice of gcms the xinanjiang xaj model a rainfall runoff basin model has been successfully and widely used in humid and semi humid catchments in china as a standard tool for a number of hydrological simulation purposes jayawardena and zhou 2000 jiang et al 2007 xu and singh 2004 yao et al 2014 for example tian et al 2013 used the xaj model to assess impacts of climate change on river high flows in a basin in china for the near future 2011 2040 it has also been successfully applied in many other countries including the united states canada germany belgium france sweden japan and thailand sahoo 2005 xu and singh 2004 for instance seiller and anctil 2014 examined climate change impacts on the hydrologic regime of a catchment in canada using the xaj model and other lumped conceptual models in addition the xaj model has been used across 210 catchments of southeast australia including the murray darling basin and the south east coast drainage basins that cover the most populated and important agricultural regions of australia with nse values in the calibration periods of greater than 0 6 in 80 percent of these catchments li et al 2009 zhang and chiew 2009 consequently this study will apply the xaj model forced with statistical downscaling of daily climate data based on 28 gcms to study the hydrological response to climate change in an australian catchment we aimed to evaluate hydrological responses to climate change in eastern australia specifically using the manning river catchment as a case study the objectives of this study were to 1 test the performance of the xaj model for simulating rainfall runoff relationship of the manning river catchment 2 project future changes in simulated runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content and 3 identify the importance of different climatic variables in explaining future changes in water availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the manning river catchment is located on the new south wales nsw mid north coast and includes the towns of taree wingham gloucester and walcha and has a temperate climate with summer dominated rainfall chiew and mcmahon 2002 fig 1 the catchment area is approximately 6630 km2 with elevation ranging from 12 m to 1591 m see fig 1 mean annual temperature for the study area is 14 9 c mean annual rainfall is 1052 mm mean annual potential evaporation is 1305 mm and the runoff coefficient is 0 20 zhang et al 2013 the manning river flows for 250 km rising in the great dividing range to the east of the basin and flowing south east through a coastal floodplain to taree where it divides in two the manning river catchment does not have large groundwater storages providing base flow to the river and the narrow floodplain pockets are the only source of base flow hughes et al 2011 in addition most of the rivers and creeks in the manning river catchment are unregulated with no major storages to capture and control flows as in most unregulated rivers flows are most affected during relatively dry times and this has been identified as one of the key water management issues in this catchment when water supply is low and consumptive demand high https www industry nsw gov au water basins catchments snapshots manning in addition significant decreases in river flows resulting from below average rainfall affects the stability of the manning river estuary entrance ruprecht and peirson 2011 however very few studies regarding hydrological response to climate change have been carried out in the manning river catchment thus this study represents an important step toward the assessment of the effects of the changing climate on catchment runoff and can help inform future priorities for regional water management of river basin in the context of global climate change in eastern australia the manning river gauging station at killawarra receives streamflow from the vast majority of water sources within the manning emu entitlement management unit therefore the manning river catchment above killawarra gauging station was selected as the case study area 2 2 observed data daily rainfall and potential evaporation data were used for hydrological simulation to incorporate the large spatial heterogeneity of rainfall across this catchment rainfall data from 30 meteorological stations sites within or close to the catchment were sampled fig 1 the thiessen polygon method was selected to estimate the mean area rainfall of this catchment because this is the most common and effective method for calculating spatial distribution of rainfall jiang et al 2007 the method proposed by abtew 1996 was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration using solar radiation and maximum daily temperature abtew 1996 daily streamflow data of the killawarra hydrological station were collected from the website of the australian government bureau of meteorology http www bom gov au waterdata daily observed hydrological and meteorological data in the period from 1991 to 2016 were used for hydrological model calibration and validation 2 3 statistical downscaling technique monthly gridded rainfall and climate data from gcms were downscaled to the meteorological observation sites at a daily time step using a statistical downscaling model nwai wg developed by liu and zuo 2012 this rapid and reliable statistical downscaling method consists of two steps to perform spatial and temporal downscaling separately this approach relies on empirical relationships between observational data and gcm outputs first the monthly gridded climate projections from gcms were spatially interpolated to specific sites of interest in this case 30 sites within or close to the manning river catchment fig 1 using an inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method followed by a bias correction procedure to correct site based monthly gcm simulations second daily climatic variables e g maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall were then generated for each site from the spatially downscaled projections by using a modified version of the wgen stochastic weather generator richardson and wright 1984 with parameters derived from the bias corrected monthly data see liu and zuo 2012 for details the validation carried out by liu and zuo 2012 has shown that this downscaling method can reproduce the observed climatic variables at daily monthly and annual time scales well unlike other statistical downscaling approaches developed in australia which have only been applied to either specific time periods timbal et al 2009 or small areas mehrotra and sharma 2010 due to data availability or time and cost this approach can be easily applied to any archived monthly gcm data for any site and across multiple time periods as the approach requires only monthly gcm data and daily historical climate records in this research we applied a post downscaling treatment to the nwai wg downscaled data when the downscaled site climate data are applied to catchment the occurrence of inconsistent daily rainfalls between sites can result in a more rainfall days and b smaller daily rainfall over the catchment and potentially poor simulation of the peak flows in the post downscaling treatment we selected the central station as the reference station and re downscaled other 29 sites in the catchment to have the same rainfall events with the amounts of gcm projected rainfalls for respective sites this method is validate based on the hypothesis that the weather stations are close enough so that the rain days are fairly consistent the catchment area is approximately 6630 km2 that is the radius of the study area is around 40 km thus we considered this catchment downscaling method is validate for this study this study was focused on the analyses of three periods of simulations the first examined the period 1977 2016 referred to as immediate past or baseline the second examined the period 2021 2060 referred to as the near future or 2040 s and the third the period 2061 2100 referred to as the far future or 2080 s in addition for baseline and future time periods hydro meteorological variables were downscaled from 28 gcms wang et al 2017 of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 under the rcp8 5 scenario rcp 8 5 a scenario that represents comparatively high greenhouse gas emission riahi et al 2011 and matches the current trajectory of ghgs fuss et al 2015 pagán et al 2016 to present the range in projected future climate monthly seasonal and annual change in maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall for the 28 gcms in the near future and the far future compared to baseline were computed for the catchment in addition monthly seasonal and annual changes in runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the 28 gcms in the 2040 s and 2080 s compared to baseline were estimated to show the range in projected future hydrological variables 2 4 the xaj model the xaj model is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model with physical based parameters zhao et al 1980 the model is widely used in humid and semi humid basins in china hu et al 2005 and was recently adopted and validated in southeast australia li et al 2012 furthermore the xaj model consistently performs better than four other conceptual rainfall runoff models the pitman model of south africa hughes 2013 the sacramento model of usa sorooshian et al 1993 the nam model of denmark nielsen and hansen 1973 and the smar model of ireland kachroo 1992 even in relatively dry catchments gan et al 1997 therefore the xaj model was selected for hydrological simulations in the present study the xaj model which uses rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data to simulate runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content is divided into four layers evapotranspiration runoff production separation of runoff components and flow concentration zhao 1992 its main feature is the concept of runoff formation of repletion of storage which means that runoff is not produced until the soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaches field capacity and thereafter runoff equals the rainfall excess without further loss zhao 1992 the flow chart of the xaj model is shown in fig 2 and the model parameters are listed in table 1 it should be noted that the xaj model used in this study does not consider vegetation and its interaction with the atmosphere however it has the advantage of fewer input data and simpler application it is crucial for water resource managers to be conscious of and prepared for the impacts of climate change on hydrological variables therefore daily hydrological simulations under baseline and future scenarios were obtained using the xaj model driven by downscaled climatic variables from 28 gcms to evaluate the changes in catchment hydrological cycle runoff which represents an integrated response to climatic inputs throughout the whole drainage basin is a very important indicator of the impacts of climate change on water resources in addition climate change will lead to changes in other hydrological variables which can also be simulated by the xaj model therefore changes of actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were also included in this study soil moisture is defined as the areal mean tension water storage w in the xaj model zhao 1992 the xaj model was calibrated and validated against river flow data only we did not calibrate and validate the model simulations in actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content because of a lack of field data for these variables the absolute values of soil moisture content should therefore not be used directly nevertheless it is still reasonable and valuable to compare the relative changes in the simulations because the model mimics the actual hydrological processes 2 5 parameter estimation and performance evaluation there are a lot of missed observed flow data in 1983 1989 and 1990 at killawarra gauging station however observed flow data from 1991 to 2016 26 years are relatively complete and continuous and were selected for model calibration and validation the time period for calibration and validation years was determined by the length of the observed data record for sufficiently long periods of observed data that represent different climate conditions it is possible to split the available data equally for calibration and validation however the observed record 26 years is not sufficient for an equal split the length of the data may be different in such a way that the calibration period is sufficiently long since optimized model parameters during calibration are used for model validation without further adjustment ayele et al 2017 therefore daily observed and simulated runoff in the period 1991 2008 18 years were used for model calibration and data from 2009 to 2016 8 years were used for model validation a global optimization method the sce ua shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona duan et al 2015 is an effective and efficient optimization technique for calibration of watershed models and was used to optimize xaj model parameters it combines the best features of multiple complex shuffling and competitive evolution based on the simplex search method nelder and mead 1965 the xaj model is calibrated by maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of daily flow together with a constraint to ensure that the total modelled flow in the calibration period is within 5 of the total observed flow vaze and teng 2011 nse and coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the performance of the xaj model the nse is one of the most widely used criteria for comparing hydrologic model performance with observed values le and pricope 2017 in addition many studies also used nse and r2 to evaluate the performance of hydrological models le and pricope 2017 vu et al 2012 nse varies from to 1 a value of 1 means the simulations perfectly match the observations so the closer the nse value is to 1 the better the hydrological model is deemed to have performed in general when both nse and r2 exceed 0 50 the hydrological model is deemed to effectively simulate stream flow for a given catchment liu et al 2017 the nse and r2 were calculated as follows 1 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 2 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 where q obs and q sim are the observed and simulated daily flow m3 s respectively q is the mean flow m3 s i is the ith sample and n is the number of samples 2 6 regression analyses prior to the analysis of the simulations we applied a bias correction procedure called secondary bias correction yang et al 2016 to correct the differences of the simulated outputs forced by gcm projected climate over those forced by observed climate a multiple liner regression model mlrm was used to quantify the effects of climate variables maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall on hydrologic variables runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture mlrm is a linear model that describes how y variable relates to two or more x variables dar 2017 the general structure of the model is as given below 3 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 where y is the dependent or response variable x is independent or predictor variable in this study the model is defined as below 4 δ y a δ t max b δ t min c δ r where δy is projected changes in hydrological variables runoff actual evapotranspiration or soil moisture δtmax c δtmin c and δr are changes in maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall respectively from these regression analyses the contribution of the change in specific climate factors to changes in hydrologic variables were quantified in addition rainfall elasticity c defined here as the proportional change in runoff divided by the proportional change in rainfall can also be derived 3 results 3 1 xaj model calibration and validation calibrated parameters for the xaj model in the manning river catchment are shown in table 1 runoff simulations at daily time scale were aggregated to monthly values and were compared with the observed data monthly observed runoff and the xaj model simulated runoff for calibration and validation periods in the manning river catchment were strongly correlated r2 0 94 and nse 0 92 and closely replicated temporal variation figs 3 and 4 with slopes within 25 of the 1 1 regression the slope of the regression during the validation period was much closer to the 1 1 line than that in the calibration period which may be caused by the slight underestimation of the extremely high runoff observed in the calibration period 3 2 projected changes in temperature and rainfall projected maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall in the future were aggregated to monthly and seasonal time scales and compared with baseline values all 28 gcms used in this study agree on a future temperature rise with higher temperature increases in 2080 s than 2040 s at both monthly and seasonal time scales figs 5 and 6 for maximum monthly temperatures fig 5a the largest median increase was 1 6 c 0 9 1 9 c in november by 2040 s and 3 8 c 3 5 4 2 c in september by 2080 s while the lowest median increase was 1 1 c 0 9 1 7 c in march by 2040 s and 2 5 c 1 8 3 0 c in february by 2080 s the range of uncertainty in brackets indicates the 25th and 75th percentiles of the 28 gcms used herein at seasonal time scales fig 6a the maximum temperature was projected to increase most in spring in both future periods the median increase was 1 5 c 1 1 1 8 c in 2040 s and 3 4 c 2 8 3 9 c in 2080 s while increases were lowest in autumn in 2040 s 1 3 c 0 9 1 6 c and in summer in 2080 s 2 9 c 2 4 3 4 c for temperature minima figs 5b and 6b the median estimate demonstrated the largest increase in may 1 9 c 1 6 2 5 c in 2040 s and 4 9 c 3 7 5 5 c in 2080 s autumn 1 7 c 1 4 1 9 c in 2040 s and 4 1 c 3 3 4 7 c in 2080 s and the smallest increase in temperature minima in february 1 0 c 0 8 1 3 c in 2040 s and 2 5 c 1 8 3 1 c in 2080 s summer 1 2 c 0 9 1 3 c in 2040 s and 2 7 c 2 3 3 2 c in 2080 s in the future the median increase for maximum temperature at an annual time scale was 1 4 c 1 2 1 5 c by 2021 2060 and 3 2 c 2 7 3 5 c by 2061 2100 fig 6a while median annual minimum temperatures were predicted to increase by 1 5 c 1 3 1 7 c in 2040 s and 3 5 c 3 1 4 1 c in 2080 s fig 6b changes to future rainfall differ across the different gcms and across seasons with the majority of gcms simulating increases in november march rainfall and the majority of gcms simulating decreases in the period of april to october the largest ensemble median increase in rainfall occurred in december 4 2 7 6 13 4 in 2040 s and 13 4 10 9 31 4 in 2080 s while the largest median decrease occurred in september 10 6 20 7 8 1 in 2040 s and 20 7 34 0 9 7 in 2080 s fig 5c median spring 1 7 13 5 10 0 in 2040 s and 1 4 17 4 13 8 in 2080 s and autumn 1 1 6 0 4 8 in 2040 s and 0 7 9 3 7 5 in 2080 s rainfall was projected to have relatively small changes in the future in contrast median rainfall was projected to have a larger increase in summer 4 2 3 6 11 7 in 2040 s and 9 1 2 9 24 9 in 2080 s but a decline 4 0 13 1 3 1 in 2040 s and 11 7 20 9 3 5 in 2080 s in winter with larger changes in 2080 s than in 2040 s at annual time scales the changes in rainfall as estimated by the 28 ranged from 5 2 25th percentile to 4 2 75th percentile in 2040 s and 9 5 25th percentile to 10 8 75th percentile in 2080 s with ensemble median values of 0 3 and 4 6 respectively 3 3 changes in simulated runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture projected runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were aggregated to monthly and seasonal time scales and were compared with baseline data the largest median monthly increase in runoff was 6 9 23 2 26 7 in november by 2040 s and 31 1 2 6 71 4 in february by 2080 s while the largest median decrease was 16 7 23 9 13 2 in june by 2040 s and 20 5 31 1 4 2 in july by 2080 s fig 7 a thus the largest monthly runoff is projected to shift from march during the baseline period table 2 to february in the far future the lowest runoff in september was simulated to decline 4 3 24 2 14 3 in 2040 s and 16 3 33 2 3 8 in 2080 s in the future the second largest runoff which occurred in the summer in the baseline period was projected to increase 11 6 12 8 24 9 in 2040 s and 23 8 5 3 46 2 in 2080 s in the future whereas the second smallest runoff which currently occurs in winter was projected to decline 6 9 23 0 4 9 in 2040 s and 14 8 28 7 to 0 06 in 2080 s in the future table 2 fig 8 a thus the largest seasonal runoff which currently occurs in the autumn was predicted to change to the summer in 2040 s and 2080 s in addition in 2080 s these monthly and seasonal changes generally became larger than those predicted in the 2040 s figs 7a and 8a there were considerable differences in the runoff projection of different gcms figs 7a 8a thus at annual time scales runoff change estimated by the 28 gcms ranged from 10 6 25th percentile to 8 9 75th percentile in 2040 s and 17 2 25th percentile to 22 0 75th percentile in 2080 s with median values of 2 3 and 7 7 respectively fig 8a furthermore median values in annual runoff in 2080 s showed a slight increase compared to 2040 s fig 8a and this may be related to the increase in rainfall in 2080 s fig 6c there was a wide range in differences among modelled values of actual evapotranspiration responses simulated by the 28 gcms median monthly actual evapotranspiration was projected to decrease only in august 2 2 5 1 5 1 in 2040 s and 4 3 13 7 3 7 in 2080 s september 4 1 11 4 1 3 in 2040 s and 8 9 21 1 to 1 4 in 2080 s and october 5 3 11 7 to 0 4 in 2040 s and 7 4 16 9 3 0 in 2080 s winter spring while median seasonal actual evapotranspiration only showed a trend of decreasing values 2 2 10 3 2 7 in 2040 s and 3 2 15 7 3 7 in 2080 s in spring in the future figs 7 and 8 at annual time scales actual evapotranspiration change estimated by the 28 gcms ranged from 3 0 25th percentile to 3 7 75th percentile in 2040 s and 4 3 25th percentile to 8 6 75th percentile in 2080 s with median values of 0 6 and 1 8 respectively fig 8b however the differences in actual evapotranspiration changes under different gcms are smaller than the modelled changes in runoff figs 7a b and 8a b differences in predicted 40 year mean monthly seasonal and annual soil moisture content resulting from different gcms were also considerable figs 7c 8c furthermore the median estimate indicated that monthly soil moisture content was projected to have a trend of decreasing values except february 1 5 8 8 5 3 in 2040 s and to increase slightly only in december 3 6 16 6 14 1 january 2 0 5 0 9 7 february 4 1 6 2 14 9 and march 0 7 7 0 12 9 in 2080 s while seasonal soil moisture was predicted to decrease in 2040 s and to increase marginally 0 5 7 9 10 7 only in summer in 2080 s finally at annual time scales changes in soil moisture content simulated by the 28 gcms ranged from 8 8 25th percentile to 0 2 75th percentile in 2040 s and 15 5 25th percentile to 1 6 75th percentile in 2080 s with ensemble median values of 4 4 and 5 1 respectively 3 4 relationships among hydrological responses and climate variables relationships among changes in hydrologic variables runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture content and changes in daily maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall are shown in table 3 runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were all largely dominated by rainfall at annual and seasonal time scales at annual time scales change in runoff was only significantly correlated with change in rainfall while change in actual evapotranspiration was significantly correlated with change in rainfall and daily maximum and minimum temperatures while soil moisture content was primarily dominated by rainfall and daily maximum temperature furthermore correlations of changes in hydrological variables to changes in climatic variables were estimated using the multiple regression model for example runoff could change by 5 1 7 2 7 7 and 10 6 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively with an annual change of 4 9 as a result of an increase of maximum temperature of 1 0 c annual rainfall elasticity of runoff was about 2 1 that is a 1 change in mean annual rainfall results in a 2 1 change in mean annual runoff in this catchment finally the effect of changes in rainfall on actual evapotranspiration was smaller than its effect on soil moisture content and much smaller than its impact on runoff at seasonal and annual time scales for instance a 1 change in mean annual rainfall results in a 0 6 and 0 8 change in mean annual actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content respectively in this catchment 4 discussion in this study hydrological responses to climate change in the manning river catchment were simulated using an ensemble of 28 gcms and the xaj model the overall calibration and validation results demonstrated that the xaj model was able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed runoff in this catchment figs 3 and 4 and the calibrated xaj model can be further used to evaluate the impacts of climate change on catchment hydrological variables while the hydrological model was generally able to replicate observed runoff it might have some difficulties in reproducing the extreme high runoff in the calibration period figs 3 and 4 similar results in reproducing peak flow also occur in other hydrological models for example tian et al 2013 used three models gr4j perrin et al 2003 hbv lindström et al 1997 and xaj to simulate daily discharge and their results demonstrated an underestimation of high rates of discharge in all three models eum et al 2017 used the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model to simulate daily runoff and found a poor capacity to simulate both low flows and very high flows thus difficulties in reproducing the highest rates of runoff are common because of the theories of hydrological models and criteria of model calibration this may be attributed to the theory of runoff production hao et al 2015 for example the xaj model assumes that runoff is not generated until soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaches field capacity this assumption may not be valid during heavy rain events because these can produce runoff when soils are not fully filled with water unsaturation runoff due to insufficient infiltration which is not simulated in the xaj model only saturation excess runoff is simulated therefore modification of the model structure by including unsaturation runoff during heavy rainfall events may lead to improved hydrologic simulations during these periods our results indicated that the median annual increase for maximum temperature was 1 4 c 1 2 1 5 c by 2021 2060 and 3 2 c 2 7 3 5 c by 2061 2100 while minimum temperature was predicted to increase by 1 5 c 1 3 1 7 c in 2021 2060 and 3 5 c 3 1 4 1 c in 2061 2100 the projected trend of increasing temperature agrees with previous studies for instance wang et al 2017 reported a 3 7 c increase in temperature for rcp8 5 across the wheat belt in nsw by 2061 2100 moreover an ensemble of 12 rcm simulations 4 gcms 3 rcms performed by the nsw and act regional climate modelling narclim project projects a 0 7 c rise in mean temperature by 2020 2039 and a 2 0 c rise by 2060 2079 in the north coast region of nsw including the manning river catchment www ccrc unsw edu au sites default files narclim index html however it should be noted that future time periods in our research 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 and the narclim project 2020 2039 and 2060 2079 are not exactly the same in addition to temperature our results also showed that median rainfall is projected to have a significant increase in summer and a decrease in winter in the future although the largest rainfall is in the summer and the lowest rainfall is in winter in this catchment table 2 therefore the trend of increasing values in high rainfalls and a trend of decreasing values in low rainfalls are likely to generate a larger degree of inter seasonal variation in the manning river catchment in the future this is generally consistent with previous studies for example narclim also projects an increase in rainfall during summer autumn and spring and a decrease in winter across the north coast region by 2060 2079 in addition liu and zuo 2012 analyzed the changes in summer and winter rainfall and found an increase in summer rainfall whilst winter rainfall has a high probability of decreasing in most areas of new south wales our results showed that multi gcm ensemble median values exhibit a slight decrease 2 3 10 6 8 9 in annual runoff in 2040 s which is similar to the trend of change in previous studies despite the gcms hydrological models downscaling methods and time periods differing across studies for instance chiew and mcmahon 2002 concluded that the annual runoff in catchments on the east coast of australia could change by 15 by 2030 relative to 1990 similarly chiew et al 2003 used the simhyd model and the csiro mark 2 gcm simulations and found a decrease in mean annual runoff of 6 8 in most of eastern australia in 2021 2050 relative to 1961 1990 vaze and teng 2011 used 15 gcms and the median estimate indicates that future mean annual runoff in 2030 relative to 1990 will be no change to a slight reduction in the eastern parts of australia in addition median estimates suggest a trend of increasing values in summer runoff the second largest runoff in the baseline period and a trend of decreasing values in winter runoff the second smallest runoff in the baseline period in the future consequently the trend of increasing values of high runoffs and a trend of decreasing values of low runoffs is likely to generate larger inter seasonal differences in the future this seasonal change in runoff is also consistent with previous studies chiew et al 2009 eisner et al 2017 vaze and teng 2011 moreover median estimates show that seasonal soil moisture content is predicted to decrease significantly in spring and winter the projected decrease in runoff and soil moisture in winter will threaten surface water supplies and have adverse implications for agriculture gardner 2009 which has significant implication for land and water resource management in the future changes in regional temperature and rainfall expected to occur as a result of future climate change may have significant impacts on different components of a catchment water budget nash and gleick 1991 thus changes in runoff are largely related to variations in rainfall reshmidevi et al 2018 in addition changes in temperature are likely to have impacts on runoff production through increasing evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation wang et al 2016 our results suggested that runoff changes are more sensitive to changes in rainfall than changes to temperature table 3 and this agrees with previous studies chiew et al 1995 a case in point is that chiew and mcmahon 2002 carried out climate change impacts modelling on 28 unimpaired australian catchments and found that the impact on runoff was much more dependent on rainfall than temperature rainfall elasticity is a simple estimate of the sensitivity of runoff to changes in rainfall and is particularly useful as an initial estimate of climate change impacts on runoff chiew 2006 thus it should be noted from table 3 coefficient c for annual runoff is 2 08 that the percentage change in average annual rainfall is generally amplified two fold in average annual runoff change which is also in commonly observed in previous research chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 for example jones et al 2006 estimated the sensitivity of mean annual runoff to climate change using 3 models across 22 australian catchments and results show mean sensitivities of 2 4 2 5 and 2 1 change in mean annual flow for every 1 change in mean annual rainfall respectively in addition table 3 shows that the lowest seasonal rainfall elasticity of runoff was observed in spring and this may be because of the largest et p evapotranspiration rainfall ratio occurring in spring table 2 which means spring is a relatively dry season in this catchment and the increase in rainfall is mainly used to evaporate and replenish soil moisture content table 3 shows that the highest value of coefficient c for seasonal actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture occurs in spring in addition to runoff variation in modelled actual evapotranspiration and modelled soil moisture content were also both largely dominated by variation in rainfall and have a weaker correlation with changes in temperature at annual and seasonal scales table 3 therefore there was a good correlation between the major components of the water budget and rainfall reflecting the fact that rainfall is the ultimate source of water for the land surface water budget fekete et al 2004 however the effect of variation in rainfall on actual evapotranspiration is much smaller than its effect on runoff in agreement with previous findings chiew and mcmahon 2002 assessments of the impacts of climate change on catchment water budgets are affected by the uncertainties in the gcms downscaling methods and ghg emission scenarios as well as the uncertainty in the hydrologic model itself this study used an ensemble of 28 gcms to reduce uncertainties arising from the choice of a single gcm however we only used one hydrological model to simulate water resource availability and therefore this may contribute some uncertainty because of the choice of model parameters and model structure eum et al 2017 jiang et al 2007 applied six monthly water balance models and found large differences in predicted runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content among models consequently using an ensemble of hydrological models a larger array of climate projections different downscaling methods and various bias correction algorithms is recommended to provide a full range and probability of future hydrologic simulations eum et al 2017 teutschbein and seibert 2012 in addition the present study was focused on the manning river catchment which although deemed to be representative of such catchments lacks replication at the catchment scale consequently more catchments will be selected in a following study to represent the large range of climate physical and flow characteristics throughout australia and to provide insights for future water management 5 summary and conclusions this study analysed the hydrologic sensitivity of the manning river catchment under projected climate change scenarios using the xaj hydrological model driven by statistically downscaled climate data from 28 gcms for the xaj model calibration and validation periods the daily nse were 0 89 and 0 93 and daily r2 were 0 93 and 0 93 respectively with monthly nse 0 92 and monthly r2 0 94 therefore the xaj model performed satisfactorily in this catchment nse and r2 were much larger than 0 50 this study explored the impacts of climate change on the water balance of the manning river catchment for 2040 s and 2080 s runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were all largely dominated by rainfall at annual and seasonal time scales maximum temperature was predicted to increase 1 4 c 1 2 1 5 c and 3 2 c 2 7 3 5 c in 2040 s and 2080 s while minimum temperature was predicted to increase 1 5 c 1 3 1 7 c and 3 5 c 3 1 4 1 c in 2040 s and 2080 s respectively as estimated from the median of the 28 gcms at an annual time scale rainfall runoff actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture content were projected to change 0 3 5 2 4 2 and 4 6 9 5 10 8 2 3 10 6 8 9 and 7 7 17 2 22 0 0 6 3 0 3 7 and 1 8 4 3 8 6 and 4 4 8 8 0 2 and 5 1 15 5 to 1 6 in 2040 s and 2080 s respectively variations at monthly and seasonal time scales were also analyzed with the trend of increasing values in high rainfall and runoff and the trend of decreasing values in low rainfall and runoff estimated from the ensemble of the 28 gcms a larger degree of inter seasonal variation in the manning river catchment are likely to be generated in the future in addition reductions in winter runoff and spring and winter soil moisture content in the future are likely to aggravate future water stress for crop growth and productivity elmahdi 2015 these results can potentially contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern australia the research methods used in the manning river catchment of eastern australia can be further extended to any other catchments and we expect our study provides
