11075,to mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases from paddy fields and solve water shortage problems sustainable and eco friendly water management systems for rice cultivation urgently need to be constructed alternate wetting and drying awd water management is effective and saves water however practical examples of awd at the district or on farm level are limited we aimed to investigate the feasibility of awd in experimental block units conventional weak dry and strong dry in paddy fields of about 44 ha in the red river delta area of vietnam by examining the effects of intermittent irrigation i e awd on the ponding depth ch4 and n2o emissions and rice yield in blocked experimental plots intermittent irrigation was expected to be achieved through the operation of irrigation pumps and sluice gates of water division works by the water management organization water user group of the district however the ponding depth was not controlled as initially planned because of frequent rainfall and low rate of decrease of the ponding depth in the study area it was however confirmed that the period during which the ponding depth decreased below the soil surface was mostly but not always longer in the dry type blocks ch4 emissions decreased with an increase in drying period and this reduction was large in the summer autumn season there appeared to be no relationship between n2o emissions and water management rice yield decreased due to extreme drying in the summer autumn season but was not affected by drying in the winter spring season this study demonstrated that ch4 emissions can be reduced and rice yield can be maintained by achieving a maximum drying index i e ratio of the period during which the ponding depth is below the soil surface of 0 6 in the summer autumn season in the paddy fields of the target area keywords on farm water management alternate wetting and drying water management organization greenhouse gas 1 introduction rice is a fundamental crop in the global stable food production and the main agricultural crop in southeast asian countries it has been reported that by the year 2020 a third of the asian population will face water shortages papademetriou 2000 water saving management has therefore been recognized as an important issue especially for agricultural sustainability and development bouman and tuong 2001 in addition water and atmospheric environments can be affected by inappropriate water management such as water pollution from the outflow of fertilizers or agricultural chemicals and the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs because rice is cultivated twice or three times a year in southern asian countries the practice of eco friendly and water saving management in paddy areas has become important and a topic of research focus for sustainable rice cultivation it is essential that water is managed appropriately through the introduction of irrigation systems despite the positive correlation between irrigation area ratio and increased rice yield per unit area the growth rate of irrigated areas in asia has declined due to the combined impacts of lower rice prices and higher construction costs baker et al 1998 if irrigation systems do not function adequately in terms of both hardware and software water may be unequally allocated across paddy fields resulting in water shortage and thus decreased yield in some sections in vietnam rice production uses the largest amount of water compared to domestic and industrial uses most farmers in the red river delta in vietnam are small farmers who have less than 0 5 ha of farmland and labor input for cultivation is large tuan and satoh 1998 in these farmlands insufficient on farm level water supply is a major problem to most downstream plots due to the lack of cooperation between water management organizations and the farmers and despite the construction of primary irrigation facilities the secondary and tertiary water channels have not been sufficiently prepared to ensure sufficient water supply to each plot farmers are forced to invest additional labor input or recently use portable pumps to obtain water from adjacent water channels therefore the improvement of irrigation and drainage systems is imperative for agricultural land consolidation i e to increase land and labor productivity tuan and satoh 1998 paddy areas in vietnam will greatly benefit from improved irrigation systems and investigations into eco friendly and water saving management methods will offer useful knowledge not only for vietnam but also for cambodia myanmar laos and other countries paddy water management influences rice yield for example matsushima 1962 conducted various experiments to examine the effects of drought and flooding at different growth stages and the effect of different ponding depths in the growing season on rice yield and showed that drought at the reduction division stage in pollen mother cells and around the heading ear emergence stage reduced the percentage of ripened grains and seriously damaged rice yield this remarkable reduction in yield was caused by the whole plant submergence treatment and rice yields obtained were in this order ponding depth 5 cm above the soil surface 15 cm above the soil surface 30 cm above the soil surface 0 cm 5 cm below the soil surface 15 cm below the soil surface nugroho et al 2018 showed that rice yields increased with intermittent irrigation in which the water depth was very shallow ca 2 cm from 0 to 40 days after transplanting and was associated with an increased number of panicles which resulted from enhanced tiller development under shallow water during the vegetative stage hence flooding during the periods after transplanting and around the ear emergence stage is important for securing rice yield physiologically on the other hand the effects of paddy water management on emissions of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o which have much higher greenhouse warming potential than carbon dioxide co2 is also something to be considered there is an inverse relationship between ch4 and n2o emissions with changes in soil redox potential and the recommended range of soil redox potential for water management is around 100 to 200 mv to prevent ch4 production and encourage n2o reduction hou et al 2000 ratering and conrad 1998 showed that drainage for 48 h resulted in drastically decreased ch4 emission rates while longer drainage and aeration resulted in a short term increase of n2o production appropriate water management should be considered by paying attention to the trade off relationship between ch4 and n2o emissions when controlling soil water regimes recently many studies have investigated alternate wetting and drying awd as an eco friendly and water saving management technique in paddy fields e g li et al 2018 carrijo et al 2018 mote et al 2018 islam et al 2018 darzi naftchali et al 2018 tirol padre et al 2018 awd is an intermittent irrigation technique that repeats flooding and recession periods in paddy systems instead of the traditional continuous flooding it has been reported that awd can reduce the amount of irrigation water needed oo et al 2018 reduce surface drainage and control the outflow of fertilizer components due to surface drainage without decreasing rice yield liang et al 2013 experiments by kima et al 2015 in taiwan showed that the optimal ponding depth in the awd technique i e that did not affect yield was 3 cm zhao et al 2011 showed that the system of rice intensification including awd was effective in decreasing the amount of irrigation water used and in increasing water use efficiency awd also increased grain yield by 15 in the wet season and by 7 in the dry season compared with continuous flooding maneepitak et al 2019 regarding ghgs it is possible to suppress ch4 emission by intermittent irrigation and midseason drainage oo et al 2018 increased n2o emissions under awd are associated with enhanced nitrification in the upper soil layers during plant establishment and are thus related to basal nitrogen fertilization and mineralization of native soil nitrogen verhoeven et al 2018 iida et al 2007 showed ch4 and n2o emissions cyclically fluctuated during intermittent irrigation such studies have shown that ch4 emission controlling and water saving management is possible through water management that involves intermittent irrigation however most of the previous experiments were conducted on small paddy plots several meters squared or test pots e g pascual and wang 2017 conducted experiments in 6 m2 plots to estimate the effect of water management oo et al 2018 used 7 5 m experimental plots and minamikawa and sakai 2005 used pot experiments to estimate the effect of soil redox potential control on rice yield and ch4 emission compared to conventional management methods continuous flooding midseason drainage and midseason drainage plus intermittent irrigation verhoeven et al 2018 conducted experiments using two paddies 20 80 m however the paddies were located in the italian rice research center where the water management was controlled by specialists practical and direct experiments of on farm level water management by farmers or water management organizations have rarely been conducted this lack of practical examples is a consequence of eco friendly and water saving management techniques not having a direct benefit for each farmer who serves as the water manager of each paddy plot there is therefore a lack of motivation to implement such eco friendly and water saving management under scenarios that irrigation water is not allocated fairly in the district and water supply is not stable such water saving irrigation will be unacceptable to farmers therefore organizational water management of on farm level i e water managed by an organization referred to as a water user group rather than by each farmer is expected to be an effective eco friendly and water saving management structure for example to conserve the water quality of the lake biwa i e the biggest in japan and an important water resources the cyclic irrigation system connected to the lake which involves the reuse of drainage water for irrigation to reduce suspended solids load hama et al 2010 and nitrogen load hama et al 2011 is managed by water management organization a water user group leads this water management and manages the operation of the pumps and gates in this study we examined the feasibility of on farm level organizational eco friendly and water saving management in the lowland paddy area of the red river delta vietnam we achieved this by introducing new water division works and sluice gates along the water channels in the district covering an area of 44 24 ha which were used by a water user group to control the irrigation and by clarifying the influence of intermittent irrigation on the ponding depth ch4 and n2o emissions and rice yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and water management design experiments were conducted in the rice paddy fields in the phu thinh commune which is located on the red river delta in the kim dong district hung yen province vietnam 21 25 n 105 46 e fig 1 the experimental paddy area was 44 24 ha fig 1 and the topography was mostly flat the paddy soil was clay with a hydraulic conductivity of 6 1 10 3 4 2 10 5 and 2 6 10 4 cm s 1 near the soil surface upper at 30 cm depth middle and at 50 cm depth lower respectively the carbon content of air dried paddy soil was 2 3 1 5 and 0 4 the nitrogen content was 0 24 0 15 and 0 05 and the c n ratio was 10 0 10 1 and 9 1 in the upper middle and lower soil layers respectively the experimental site was irrigated using two pumps discharge amounts 1000 and 1400 m3 h 1 in the pump station which used water from a main canal that was sourced from the red river the water channels in the site were dual purpose irrigation and drainage we constructed two water division works along the channel that were directly connected to the pumps just before initiation of the experiments the water division works consisted of three manual sluice gates gates 1 3 and 5 7 were attached to the water division works see fig 1 gates 4 and 8 11 were constructed or repaired to reduce water loss from the district and were usually closed but could be opened when needed water managers operated the pumps and gates and recorded their operation times and dates water managers were appointed by the agricultural cooperative that plays the role of the water user group in the district the experimental site was divided into three experimental blocks the conventional c weak dry w and strong dry s blocks fig 1 with areas of 26 73 8 11 and 9 40 ha respectively the target ponding water depth of paddy plots in the c block was traditional ponding was maintained except for the midseason drainage the w and s blocks contained the experimental awd water management paddy plots the target ponding depth was maintained at around 3 cm for one month after transplanting after which the water managers practiced intermittent irrigation until the midseason drainage ponding was targeted to be maintained from the end of the midseason drainage to the ear emergence period for about 35 days in the w block and for about 20 days including the ear emergence period in the s block because the period from 20 days before ear emergence to 10 days after ear emergence is sensitive to drought due to reduction in the percentage of ripened grains matsushima 1962 the successive intermittent irrigation was implemented thereafter during the intermittent irrigation period water was irrigated by the operation of pumps and gates water managers monitored the water level in pipes 20 cm in diameter that had holes in the pipe wall and had been buried in paddy plots near to the water division works i e to a depth of 5 cm under the soil surface hereafter referred to as 5 cm in the w block and to a depth of 15 cm hereafter referred to as 15 cm in the s block ideally gates for delivering water to the w or s block were closed when the ponding was not necessary and were opened only when the ponding depth was lower than 5 cm in the w block and 15 cm in the s block in this way the awd water management was expected to have been implemented by the systematic operation of pumps and gates by the water user group without requiring each farmer to manage the awd furthermore irrigation water had previously been distributed throughout the district however because water was allocated to only parts of the district by the operation of the gates of the water division works in this study the number of paddy plots that received irrigation increased and the awd water management and irrigation system used were expected to relieve the water shortage in the district 2 2 crop management in the study region rice was produced twice a year during the winter spring season ws from february or march to june and the summer autumn season sa from june to september some vegetables are cultivated from the harvest of the sa season to the start of the ws season experiments were conducted for both seasons in 2015 2016 and 2017 table 1 shows the transplanting and harvest dates growing period rice variety and the standard rice planting density fertilizers were applied three times during the growing season the first and basal fertilizer included nitrogen and phosphorous and was applied 1 or 2 days before the transplanting the second and top dressing fertilizer included nitrogen and was applied 5 or 7 days after the transplanting the third fertilizer included nitrogen phosphorous and potassium and was applied about 35 days after transplanting 2 3 meteorological conditions meteorological variables were measured from the rooftop of a house situated near to the experimental site at a height of 10 m above the ground a rain gauge ecrn 100 decagon devices inc a solar radiation sensor pyr decagon devices inc and a vapor pressure humidity and temperature sensor vp 3 decagon devices inc were installed data were collected every 10 min using a data logger em50 decagon devices inc daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated from the meteorological data using the penman equation penman 1948 chang 1970 fig 3 shows monthly rainfall monthly average air temperature monthly solar radiation and rainfall r minus potential evapotranspiration etp in 2015 2016 and 2017 annual rainfall was calculated from the data from one 12 month period and ranged between 1480 mm and 1797 mm average 1651 mm the rainfall amount was highest from june to august and the monthly rainfall varied from year to year for example the monthly rainfall in april and in july and august of 2015 were small compared to 2016 and 2017 the annual average air temperature was about 25 c and differed only slightly between years the monthly solar radiation in 2015 was high compared to 2016 and 2017 the annual potential evapotranspiration ranged from 668 mm to 763 mm average 731 mm differences between monthly rainfall and evapotranspiration were smaller in the ws season than in the sa season there was an abundance of rainfall compared to evapotranspiration in august 2016 and july 2017 2 4 measurements two observation plots were set up in each water management block c1 and c2 in the c block w1 and w2 in the w block and s1 and s2 in the s block fig 1 and table 2 in each observation plot temporal changes in the ponding depth were monitored at 10 min intervals at three points fig 2 using water level sensors wt hr intech instruments ltd the average value of the three points was assumed to be representative of the data for each plot to estimate the emission fluxes of ghgs gas sampling was conducted at around 7 day intervals using a chamber based method one base of the chamber was installed in each plot in 2015 and 2016 and two bases were installed in 2017 fig 2 the rectangular acrylic chamber was gently placed on the base during gas sampling the height of the base was 20 cm and the chamber dimensions were 60 60 100 cm length width height ten to seventeen rice stubbles were included within each chamber gas was collected using a 15 ml plastic syringe and the chamber air temperature was measured 1 10 and 20 min after installing the chamber the samples were immediately transferred to evacuated injection vials almost all samplings were conducted in the morning 8 30 11 30 a m the number of replicates for ghgs for each plot numbered one in 2015 and 2016 and two in 2017 replicates for each water management block c w and s numbered two in 2015 and 2016 and four in 2017 ch4 and n2o concentrations were measured using gas chromatographs equipped with flame ionization detectors and electron capture detectors respectively itoh et al 2011 gas emission flux was calculated based on the temporal change in gas concentration in the headspace of the chamber using the following equation 1 f d c d t m 273 22 4 1 t 273 v a where f is the gas flux mg m 2 min 1 c is the gas concentration ppm t is the time min m is the molecular weight g mol 1 t is the air temperature in the chamber c v is the volume of the headspace in the chamber m3 and a is the cross sectional area of the chamber m2 unhulled rice yield was estimated by the planting density the number of rice stubbles per unit area and the weight of ripened grains per one rice stubble ripened grains were selected using salt water with a density of 1 06 g cm 3 the planting density was obtained by measuring the area planted with 121 11 11 rice stubbles in each plot the weight of ripened and unhulled grain was the average of four rice stubbles in the process of estimating yields the number of ears per stubble and the number of grains per ear were also measured rice yield measurements were conducted at two or three points in each plot 3 results 3 1 paddy ponding depth and irrigation water management temporal changes in paddy ponding depths of the experimental plots are shown with daily rainfall amounts in fig 4 in the 2015 ws ponding frequently decreased and it was inferred that the prolonged period of dry surface soil was due to the lower rainfall in april fig 3 the ponding depths of all six plots showed similar temporal changes and no differences were observed among the treatments c w and s blocks because frequent rainfall events in the latter half of the irrigation period dominated the temporal changes in ponding depths in all experimental plots pump operation was not necessary and the ideal awd water management i e experiment was not achieved in the 2015 sa similar temporal changes in the ponding depth were observed among the treatments after the midseason drainage in the latter half of august the ponding depths of all experimental plots corresponded to rainfall amounts and it was not possible to conduct the awd water management in the 2016 ws the difference in ponding depths in response to the operation of pumps and gates were observed in mid april according to a record log a water manager operated the system to irrigate block w on april 15 and 19 and block s on april 15 pumped water was expected to irrigate block c on april 15 16 and 19 the ponding depth of the c1 plot was maintained above 0 cm the ponding depth of the w1 and w2 plots were temporarily at approximately 5 cm the flooding receded in the s1 plot in mid april and although the ponding depth of the c2 plot decreased the high ponding depth of s2 plot was maintained the ponding depths of the w1 w2 and s1 plots decreased to almost 20 cm in mid may although this observation was independent from the operation of the pumps in the 2016 sa according to a record log pumped water irrigated block w on july 20 and august 20 and block s on august 12 block c was expected to have been irrigated on july 14 july 20 august 12 and august 20 the ponding depths of the c1 and c2 plots were almost above soil surface those of w1 and w2 plots decreased frequently to 5 cm and to 5 to 15 cm respectively and the ponding depths of the s1 and s2 plots reached 20 cm a situation close to the ideal ponding depth was produced from july to august in 2016 despite the high rainfall in this season in the 2017 ws the ponding depths of all plots decreased in mid april although the ponding depths of the w1 w2 s1 and s2 plots increased on april 14 as a result of the operation of the pumps and gates the ponding depths of the c1 and c2 plots continued to decrease the ideal awd water management was not achieved in this season in the 2017 sa the operation of pumps was not recorded in july and august the ponding depths of the c1 and c2 plots were maintained above the soil surface longer than in the w1 w2 s1 and s2 plots however this was not as a result of water management i e the use of the gates 3 2 drying index to evaluate the degree of the period when the ponding depth was under the critical value we defined the drying index as the ratio of the period when the ponding depth was under the critical value to the period when the ponding depth was observed we estimated three drying index values when the critical value was 0 5 and 15 cm a drying index of zero means the ponding depth was higher than the critical value with flooding or wet soil conditions during the whole observation period on the other hand 1 in the index means the ponding depth was lower than the critical value with non flooding or dry soil conditions during the whole observation period table 3 shows statistics on the drying index at 0 cm for each water management treatment c w and s in ws and sa seasons over the three years the number of replicates was two for each treatment so there were no significant differences for each treatment in all cropping seasons p 0 05 except in the 2017 sa based on the tukey honest significant differences tukey hsd test there were no significant differences between each treatment at drying indexes for 5 and 15 cm fig 5 represents the comparison of drying indexes for each cropping season and each plot in the 2016 sa the ideal water management for awd was conducted as mentioned above and the intended differences for the drying indexes for 0 5 and 15 cm of the critical value were approximately confirmed in the 2017 sa the drying indexes in the c1 and c2 plots were relatively lower than in the w and s plots and an especially extremely high drying index was observed in the w plots for the 0 cm critical value the drying indexes for 0 5 and 15 cm in the 2015 ws were higher than in the other seasons and years due to the lower rainfall the average drying index was 0 65 in 2015 ws and 0 15 0 51 in other cropping seasons table 3 also smaller differences were observed between treatments especially the drying indexes for 0 and 5 cm we did not observe remarkable differences in the three drying indexes among blocks in the 2015 sa 2016 ws and 2017 ws 3 3 greenhouse gases emission 3 3 1 ch4 emission fig 6 shows the temporal changes in ch4 emission flux mg m 2 min 1 in each plot the 2015 ws and the 2017 ws presented similar temporal patterns in ch4 emission ch4 emissions were observed until early april and were almost negligible after mid april except in the w1 w2 and s2 plots on may 13 in 2017 until early april after the transplanting of rice the ponding depths were maintained above the soil surface fig 4 and this may have induced ch4 emissions even though the ponding depths increased and became positive after the midseason drainage ch4 emission did not occur immediately in the 2016 ws the midseason drainage was insufficient in mid april due to a rainfall event and the ch4 emission continued especially in the c and w plots the drainage in mid may may have decreased the ch4 emission the increase in ponding depths due to heavy rainfall at the end of may did not induce ch4 emissions in the w and s plots the ch4 emission fluxes were larger in the sa than in the ws in the 2015 sa there were no ch4 emissions during the midseason drainage at the end of august fig 4 and they did not occur until the end of the irrigation period in the 2016 sa high rainfall and the associated increase in ponding depth figs 3 and 4 caused continuous ch4 emissions in the c and w plots despite the missing ponding depth data in the 2017 sa the midseason drainage also induced a decrease in the ch4 emissions in the c1 w2 and s1 plots 3 3 2 n2o emission temporal changes in n2o emission flux mg m 2 min 1 are shown in fig 7 temporary n2o emissions were observed after the nitrogen fertilizer applications in ws there were temporary n2o emissions in march which were inferred to be the result of the second nitrogen fertilizer application and an especially high n2o emission was observed in early april in the 2016 ws in the 2015 sa 2016 sa and 2017 sa the n2o emissions in mid or late july from some plots occurred after the second fertilizer application although almost no n2o emissions were observed where there was no ponding fig 4 there was not a relationship between ponding depth and n2o emission rainfall events did not affect the n2o emissions additionally there was no effect of water management on the n2o emission in the mid august in the 2016 sa we could not confirm the relationship between water management and n2o emission 3 3 3 cumulative ghg emission amount daily average ch4 and n2o emission fluxes were calculated by dividing the cumulative gas emission amount by the observation period and were converted to co2 emission fluxes g co2 m 2 d 1 using the global warming potential values of 25 and 298 for ch4 and n2o respectively solomon et al 2007 the flux between the two observation dates was assumed to be constant and equal to the former one table 4 shows statistics on the daily ch4 emission flux for each water management treatment c w and s in ws and sa seasons over the three years there were no significant differences by water management treatment for each cropping season except the 2016 ws and 2015 sa higher ch4 emissions were observed in c plots than w and s plots in the 2016 ws but the amount of ch4 released was highest in s followed by w then c plots in the 2015 sa the average values of daily average ch4 emission flux in all plots were 1 7 9 6 and 3 5 g co2 m 2 d 1 for the 2015 ws 2016 ws and 2017 ws respectively and 11 5 22 2 and 15 8 g co2 m 2 d 1 for the 2015 sa 2016 sa and 2017 sa respectively there was a large difference in ch4 emission in relation to the cropping season and the cumulative ch4 emission in ws was smaller than in sa on the other hand the ch4 emissions were relatively higher in the c plots than in the w and s plots in the 2016 ws 2016 sa and 2017 sa although the tukey hsd test revealed that the differences among the three blocks were not significant p 0 05 table 5 shows the daily n2o emission fluxes for each water management treatment in ws and sa seasons over the three years there were no significant differences by water management treatment for each cropping season the n2o co2 equivalent emissions were less than ch4 the average n2o emission was 0 1 and 0 04 times that of ch4 in ws and sa respectively tables 4 and 5 fig 8 presents the daily average ch4 and n2o emission fluxes for each cropping season and each plot there is no error bar for 2015 and 2016 because only one chamber was set for each plot standard deviation error bars are shown in 2017 because gas sampling was conducted at two points per plot ch4 emissions in the c1 and c2 plots were higher than in the w and s plots in the 2016 sa although there were no significant differences 3 4 rice yield the unhulled rice yields for each water management treatment and each plot are shown in table 6 and fig 9 respectively over the three years the average yields in ws and sa were statistically different at 5 89 103 kg ha 1 and 4 46 103 kg ha 1 respectively welch s test p 7 7 10 10 in ws no significant differences were observed among 2015 2016 and 2017 in sa significant differences were observed between 2015 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2017 considering the varieties of rice cultivated in each season table 1 the variety thien uu 8 was cultivated in the 2015 sa and the 2017 sa this variety may have fewer yields in sa as a result of the tukey hsd test for comparisons among water management treatments only significant differences between c plots and s plots were observed in the 2015 sa p 0 0001 and between c plots and w plots in the 2015 sa p 0 0002 the w plot and s plot rice yields were higher than those of the c plots in sa in 2015 table 7 shows the correlation coefficients between rice yield and other components i e planting density the number of ears per stubble the number of grains per ear the ripening rate and the weight per grain ripening rate was defined by the ratio of the number of ripened grains and the number of total grains the highest correlation r 0 780 was observed between rice yield and ripening rate pearson s product moment correlation test p 2 17 10 8 since soil drying processes such as the midseason drainage are important to increase ripening rate especially under higher air temperature conditions kitagawa et al 2018 insufficient soil drying as a result of high rainfall may have influenced the lower yield that was recorded in sa 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness of water management by the water user group the original schedule of water management was intermittent irrigation at short intervals several days mainly after the midseason drainage and the simultaneous operation of pumps and gates however pumps were not frequently operated because ponding depth did not frequently decrease i e to a level that required irrigation except in the 2015 ws fig 4 due to high precipitation in the 2015 ws the ponding depth was not maintained above the soil surface in the c plots probably because water managers may have considered it unnecessary to operate pumps because of the rainfall events in may 2015 especially in the 2016 sa and the 2017 sa the length of the period during which the ponding depth was lower than 0 5 and 15 cm was longer in the w and s plots than in the c plots figs 4 and 5 although the elevations of the soil surface were almost the same in all observation plots table 2 we acknowledge the difficulty that water managers had in adhering to the original schedule under the actual meteorological conditions and with the actual ponding depth water managers may also have intentionally avoided driving the pumps to reduce electricity expense furthermore not all farmers in the district understood the pilot systematic water management and used their own manual pumps if they considered irrigation to be necessary hence the effect of water management by the water user group through the operation of pumps and gates was limited it was impossible to establish two different drying stages the weak dry and strong dry blocks in this district in the interview surveys some farmers stated that there was a decrease in the number of times that they used a manual pump when one or two blocks of the district were irrigated by the operation of the gates the water level of the channel in the corresponding block rose up and it was not necessary to use the manual pumps indicating that in such scenarios the water shortage problem was possibly solved it is hoped that organizational water management with a simultaneous operation of pumps and gates will be used for future block rotational irrigation and that irrigation water will spread to the end of each block not only for awd management 4 2 effect of drying index on ch4 emission daily average greenhouse gas emission flux of ch4 converted to equivalent co2 was much higher in this region than n2o fig 8 n2o emission is related to nitrogen fertilizer application cai et al 1997 showed that n2o emission increased significantly with the increase in the nitrogen application rate and that the n2o flux was very small when the paddy plots were flooded but peaked at the beginning of the recession of the floodwater the n2o emission in this study was however not related to the non ponding period and there was no trade off relationship between ch4 and n2o with drying hence n2o emission was temporary and not continuous fig 7 while ch4 emitted continuously during flooding fig 6 the soil redox potential may not have frequently exceeded 200 mv when ponding water was eliminated in this study and the soil water content may have decreased judging from the fact the recommended soil redox potential is 100 to 200 mv to prevent n2o emissions hou et al 2000 this study shows the importance of focusing on the mitigation of ch4 emissions to reduce the ghg impacts of paddy areas in this region the ch4 emission and the drying index for 0 cm were weakly negatively correlated in both seasons fig 10 emission of ch4 from rice paddies is the result of anoxic bacterial ch4 production neue et al 1996 minamikawa and sakai 2005 showed that the ch4 emissions decreased in response to the midseason drainage method and midseason plus intermittent irrigation method compared to continuous flooding despite the decrease in ch4 emission by prolonged drying periods being a well known phenomenon the on farm level investigation in this study did not demonstrate a distinct relationship between them especially in sa with regards to each cropping season we did not observe the negative relationship between ch4 emission and the drying index for 0 cm in response to the different water management treatments in ws it was difficult to control the ch4 emission by increasing the drying index for 0 cm in ws on the other hand since a weak negative relationship was observed in the sa in each year except in 2015 it may be possible to manage ch4 emissions by lengthening the drying period in the sa different trends were observed in the ws and sa the ch4 emission at the same drying index was higher in sa than in ws presumably due to the higher temperatures air temperature rose approximately from 20 c to 30 c from march to june in ws and were constant at about 30 c from june to september fig 3 in addition much organic matter presumably originated from the residues of rice straw at the beginning of sa because the season started immediately after ws the rice straw after the harvesting of sa may be decomposed from september to february and the amount of organic matter at the beginning of ws is inferred to be small although we did not collect organic matter data in this study it is thought that the effect of soil drying is likely to manifest due to the higher ch4 emissions in sa compared with ws the present study motivates for the importance of increasing the drying period in sa to reduce ch4 emissions from paddy areas through careful water management 4 3 effect of drying index on rice yield in ws the unhulled rice yield did not change with drying indexes for 0 cm and 15 cm left side of fig 11 in sa despite there being no remarkable change in rice yield with increasing drying indexes for 0 cm and 15 cm the large drying index induced a decrease in rice yield right side of fig 11 in the experiments by minamikawa and sakai 2005 the order of brown rice yield was as follows midseason drainage plus intermittent irrigation midseason drainage continuous flooding but excessive drying of the soil slightly affected rice yield in this study in particular the drying index for 0 cm ponding depth in the w1 and w2 plots in sa 2017 sufficient ponding water may not have been present at the period around ear emergence after midseason drainage matsushima 1962 water saving irrigation by controlling limiting values of soil water potential related to specific stages can increase grain yield yang et al 2007 on the other hand pascual and wang 2017 compared the effect of intermittent irrigation at 3 day intervals and at 7 day intervals to continuous flooding and showed that grain yield was comparable among irrigation regimes li et al 2018 mentioned that awd management led to a promotion in plant physiological activities and grain filling and hence increased grain yields the effects of water management on rice yield vary with rice varieties and meteorological conditions in the investigated area it was possible to conduct dry type water management without reducing rice yield in ws and we advise that water management regimes avoid the excessive drying out of paddy soils in sa the maximum drying index for 0 cm was approximately 0 6 which was adequate in sa to reduce ch4 emission and to maintain rice yield in any case it is important to flood water during periods when water is needed for rice growth physiologically 4 4 contributions to decision making process considering that flooding is recommended until the rooting stage after transplanting and for around 30 days before and after ear emergence which large effects on rice yield and that rainfall is relatively frequent in the study region opportunities for awd management are in fact limited therefore it is important to carry out awd management with certainty so it is considered that management by a water user group is more efficient than water management by individual farmers we proposed awd management by a water user group through the operation of irrigation pumps and sluice gates for water division work though the direct effects of pump operation and gates on ponding water management and ch4 reduction were limited this study showed potential for the organizational water management system to deliver sufficient water to target blocks the fact that ch4 emissions decreased with increased drying index and that there was no significant reduction in rice yield with careful drying in paddy field experiments covering ca 44 ha over the three years should be an incentive for farmers and administrative governments to develop eco friendly water management 5 conclusions in this study the organizational water management system i e involving the operation of pumps and gates was only able to be utilized on a few occasions as part of the awd management assessment due to the timing of precipitation and because the ponding depth remained above the soil surface the original schedule of water ponding depth was therefore not achieved the drying degree of the weak dry block and the strong dry block may have increased compared to the conventional block however it was limited to the period within the cropping season future research on the feasibility of awd management in this region is necessary for the organization of water management it is important to demonstrate the feasibility of a non flooded period for suppressing ch4 emissions to the water management organization and farmers taking into consideration the physiologically essential flooding period and the midseason drainage period to prevent reductions in rice yield ch4 emissions were much higher than n2o emissions so policies for reducing ch4 emissions should be focused on in the study region despite the ch4 emission having decreased with the increase in the drying index for the soil surface it was difficult to control the ch4 emission by increasing the drying index in the ws compared to that in the sa the findings of this study suggest that the drying period should be increased in sa through careful water management to effectively reduce ch4 emissions from rice paddies

11075,to mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases from paddy fields and solve water shortage problems sustainable and eco friendly water management systems for rice cultivation urgently need to be constructed alternate wetting and drying awd water management is effective and saves water however practical examples of awd at the district or on farm level are limited we aimed to investigate the feasibility of awd in experimental block units conventional weak dry and strong dry in paddy fields of about 44 ha in the red river delta area of vietnam by examining the effects of intermittent irrigation i e awd on the ponding depth ch4 and n2o emissions and rice yield in blocked experimental plots intermittent irrigation was expected to be achieved through the operation of irrigation pumps and sluice gates of water division works by the water management organization water user group of the district however the ponding depth was not controlled as initially planned because of frequent rainfall and low rate of decrease of the ponding depth in the study area it was however confirmed that the period during which the ponding depth decreased below the soil surface was mostly but not always longer in the dry type blocks ch4 emissions decreased with an increase in drying period and this reduction was large in the summer autumn season there appeared to be no relationship between n2o emissions and water management rice yield decreased due to extreme drying in the summer autumn season but was not affected by drying in the winter spring season this study demonstrated that ch4 emissions can be reduced and rice yield can be maintained by achieving a maximum drying index i e ratio of the period during which the ponding depth is below the soil surface of 0 6 in the summer autumn season in the paddy fields of the target area keywords on farm water management alternate wetting and drying water management organization greenhouse gas 1 introduction rice is a fundamental crop in the global stable food production and the main agricultural crop in southeast asian countries it has been reported that by the year 2020 a third of the asian population will face water shortages papademetriou 2000 water saving management has therefore been recognized as an important issue especially for agricultural sustainability and development bouman and tuong 2001 in addition water and atmospheric environments can be affected by inappropriate water management such as water pollution from the outflow of fertilizers or agricultural chemicals and the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs because rice is cultivated twice or three times a year in southern asian countries the practice of eco friendly and water saving management in paddy areas has become important and a topic of research focus for sustainable rice cultivation it is essential that water is managed appropriately through the introduction of irrigation systems despite the positive correlation between irrigation area ratio and increased rice yield per unit area the growth rate of irrigated areas in asia has declined due to the combined impacts of lower rice prices and higher construction costs baker et al 1998 if irrigation systems do not function adequately in terms of both hardware and software water may be unequally allocated across paddy fields resulting in water shortage and thus decreased yield in some sections in vietnam rice production uses the largest amount of water compared to domestic and industrial uses most farmers in the red river delta in vietnam are small farmers who have less than 0 5 ha of farmland and labor input for cultivation is large tuan and satoh 1998 in these farmlands insufficient on farm level water supply is a major problem to most downstream plots due to the lack of cooperation between water management organizations and the farmers and despite the construction of primary irrigation facilities the secondary and tertiary water channels have not been sufficiently prepared to ensure sufficient water supply to each plot farmers are forced to invest additional labor input or recently use portable pumps to obtain water from adjacent water channels therefore the improvement of irrigation and drainage systems is imperative for agricultural land consolidation i e to increase land and labor productivity tuan and satoh 1998 paddy areas in vietnam will greatly benefit from improved irrigation systems and investigations into eco friendly and water saving management methods will offer useful knowledge not only for vietnam but also for cambodia myanmar laos and other countries paddy water management influences rice yield for example matsushima 1962 conducted various experiments to examine the effects of drought and flooding at different growth stages and the effect of different ponding depths in the growing season on rice yield and showed that drought at the reduction division stage in pollen mother cells and around the heading ear emergence stage reduced the percentage of ripened grains and seriously damaged rice yield this remarkable reduction in yield was caused by the whole plant submergence treatment and rice yields obtained were in this order ponding depth 5 cm above the soil surface 15 cm above the soil surface 30 cm above the soil surface 0 cm 5 cm below the soil surface 15 cm below the soil surface nugroho et al 2018 showed that rice yields increased with intermittent irrigation in which the water depth was very shallow ca 2 cm from 0 to 40 days after transplanting and was associated with an increased number of panicles which resulted from enhanced tiller development under shallow water during the vegetative stage hence flooding during the periods after transplanting and around the ear emergence stage is important for securing rice yield physiologically on the other hand the effects of paddy water management on emissions of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o which have much higher greenhouse warming potential than carbon dioxide co2 is also something to be considered there is an inverse relationship between ch4 and n2o emissions with changes in soil redox potential and the recommended range of soil redox potential for water management is around 100 to 200 mv to prevent ch4 production and encourage n2o reduction hou et al 2000 ratering and conrad 1998 showed that drainage for 48 h resulted in drastically decreased ch4 emission rates while longer drainage and aeration resulted in a short term increase of n2o production appropriate water management should be considered by paying attention to the trade off relationship between ch4 and n2o emissions when controlling soil water regimes recently many studies have investigated alternate wetting and drying awd as an eco friendly and water saving management technique in paddy fields e g li et al 2018 carrijo et al 2018 mote et al 2018 islam et al 2018 darzi naftchali et al 2018 tirol padre et al 2018 awd is an intermittent irrigation technique that repeats flooding and recession periods in paddy systems instead of the traditional continuous flooding it has been reported that awd can reduce the amount of irrigation water needed oo et al 2018 reduce surface drainage and control the outflow of fertilizer components due to surface drainage without decreasing rice yield liang et al 2013 experiments by kima et al 2015 in taiwan showed that the optimal ponding depth in the awd technique i e that did not affect yield was 3 cm zhao et al 2011 showed that the system of rice intensification including awd was effective in decreasing the amount of irrigation water used and in increasing water use efficiency awd also increased grain yield by 15 in the wet season and by 7 in the dry season compared with continuous flooding maneepitak et al 2019 regarding ghgs it is possible to suppress ch4 emission by intermittent irrigation and midseason drainage oo et al 2018 increased n2o emissions under awd are associated with enhanced nitrification in the upper soil layers during plant establishment and are thus related to basal nitrogen fertilization and mineralization of native soil nitrogen verhoeven et al 2018 iida et al 2007 showed ch4 and n2o emissions cyclically fluctuated during intermittent irrigation such studies have shown that ch4 emission controlling and water saving management is possible through water management that involves intermittent irrigation however most of the previous experiments were conducted on small paddy plots several meters squared or test pots e g pascual and wang 2017 conducted experiments in 6 m2 plots to estimate the effect of water management oo et al 2018 used 7 5 m experimental plots and minamikawa and sakai 2005 used pot experiments to estimate the effect of soil redox potential control on rice yield and ch4 emission compared to conventional management methods continuous flooding midseason drainage and midseason drainage plus intermittent irrigation verhoeven et al 2018 conducted experiments using two paddies 20 80 m however the paddies were located in the italian rice research center where the water management was controlled by specialists practical and direct experiments of on farm level water management by farmers or water management organizations have rarely been conducted this lack of practical examples is a consequence of eco friendly and water saving management techniques not having a direct benefit for each farmer who serves as the water manager of each paddy plot there is therefore a lack of motivation to implement such eco friendly and water saving management under scenarios that irrigation water is not allocated fairly in the district and water supply is not stable such water saving irrigation will be unacceptable to farmers therefore organizational water management of on farm level i e water managed by an organization referred to as a water user group rather than by each farmer is expected to be an effective eco friendly and water saving management structure for example to conserve the water quality of the lake biwa i e the biggest in japan and an important water resources the cyclic irrigation system connected to the lake which involves the reuse of drainage water for irrigation to reduce suspended solids load hama et al 2010 and nitrogen load hama et al 2011 is managed by water management organization a water user group leads this water management and manages the operation of the pumps and gates in this study we examined the feasibility of on farm level organizational eco friendly and water saving management in the lowland paddy area of the red river delta vietnam we achieved this by introducing new water division works and sluice gates along the water channels in the district covering an area of 44 24 ha which were used by a water user group to control the irrigation and by clarifying the influence of intermittent irrigation on the ponding depth ch4 and n2o emissions and rice yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and water management design experiments were conducted in the rice paddy fields in the phu thinh commune which is located on the red river delta in the kim dong district hung yen province vietnam 21 25 n 105 46 e fig 1 the experimental paddy area was 44 24 ha fig 1 and the topography was mostly flat the paddy soil was clay with a hydraulic conductivity of 6 1 10 3 4 2 10 5 and 2 6 10 4 cm s 1 near the soil surface upper at 30 cm depth middle and at 50 cm depth lower respectively the carbon content of air dried paddy soil was 2 3 1 5 and 0 4 the nitrogen content was 0 24 0 15 and 0 05 and the c n ratio was 10 0 10 1 and 9 1 in the upper middle and lower soil layers respectively the experimental site was irrigated using two pumps discharge amounts 1000 and 1400 m3 h 1 in the pump station which used water from a main canal that was sourced from the red river the water channels in the site were dual purpose irrigation and drainage we constructed two water division works along the channel that were directly connected to the pumps just before initiation of the experiments the water division works consisted of three manual sluice gates gates 1 3 and 5 7 were attached to the water division works see fig 1 gates 4 and 8 11 were constructed or repaired to reduce water loss from the district and were usually closed but could be opened when needed water managers operated the pumps and gates and recorded their operation times and dates water managers were appointed by the agricultural cooperative that plays the role of the water user group in the district the experimental site was divided into three experimental blocks the conventional c weak dry w and strong dry s blocks fig 1 with areas of 26 73 8 11 and 9 40 ha respectively the target ponding water depth of paddy plots in the c block was traditional ponding was maintained except for the midseason drainage the w and s blocks contained the experimental awd water management paddy plots the target ponding depth was maintained at around 3 cm for one month after transplanting after which the water managers practiced intermittent irrigation until the midseason drainage ponding was targeted to be maintained from the end of the midseason drainage to the ear emergence period for about 35 days in the w block and for about 20 days including the ear emergence period in the s block because the period from 20 days before ear emergence to 10 days after ear emergence is sensitive to drought due to reduction in the percentage of ripened grains matsushima 1962 the successive intermittent irrigation was implemented thereafter during the intermittent irrigation period water was irrigated by the operation of pumps and gates water managers monitored the water level in pipes 20 cm in diameter that had holes in the pipe wall and had been buried in paddy plots near to the water division works i e to a depth of 5 cm under the soil surface hereafter referred to as 5 cm in the w block and to a depth of 15 cm hereafter referred to as 15 cm in the s block ideally gates for delivering water to the w or s block were closed when the ponding was not necessary and were opened only when the ponding depth was lower than 5 cm in the w block and 15 cm in the s block in this way the awd water management was expected to have been implemented by the systematic operation of pumps and gates by the water user group without requiring each farmer to manage the awd furthermore irrigation water had previously been distributed throughout the district however because water was allocated to only parts of the district by the operation of the gates of the water division works in this study the number of paddy plots that received irrigation increased and the awd water management and irrigation system used were expected to relieve the water shortage in the district 2 2 crop management in the study region rice was produced twice a year during the winter spring season ws from february or march to june and the summer autumn season sa from june to september some vegetables are cultivated from the harvest of the sa season to the start of the ws season experiments were conducted for both seasons in 2015 2016 and 2017 table 1 shows the transplanting and harvest dates growing period rice variety and the standard rice planting density fertilizers were applied three times during the growing season the first and basal fertilizer included nitrogen and phosphorous and was applied 1 or 2 days before the transplanting the second and top dressing fertilizer included nitrogen and was applied 5 or 7 days after the transplanting the third fertilizer included nitrogen phosphorous and potassium and was applied about 35 days after transplanting 2 3 meteorological conditions meteorological variables were measured from the rooftop of a house situated near to the experimental site at a height of 10 m above the ground a rain gauge ecrn 100 decagon devices inc a solar radiation sensor pyr decagon devices inc and a vapor pressure humidity and temperature sensor vp 3 decagon devices inc were installed data were collected every 10 min using a data logger em50 decagon devices inc daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated from the meteorological data using the penman equation penman 1948 chang 1970 fig 3 shows monthly rainfall monthly average air temperature monthly solar radiation and rainfall r minus potential evapotranspiration etp in 2015 2016 and 2017 annual rainfall was calculated from the data from one 12 month period and ranged between 1480 mm and 1797 mm average 1651 mm the rainfall amount was highest from june to august and the monthly rainfall varied from year to year for example the monthly rainfall in april and in july and august of 2015 were small compared to 2016 and 2017 the annual average air temperature was about 25 c and differed only slightly between years the monthly solar radiation in 2015 was high compared to 2016 and 2017 the annual potential evapotranspiration ranged from 668 mm to 763 mm average 731 mm differences between monthly rainfall and evapotranspiration were smaller in the ws season than in the sa season there was an abundance of rainfall compared to evapotranspiration in august 2016 and july 2017 2 4 measurements two observation plots were set up in each water management block c1 and c2 in the c block w1 and w2 in the w block and s1 and s2 in the s block fig 1 and table 2 in each observation plot temporal changes in the ponding depth were monitored at 10 min intervals at three points fig 2 using water level sensors wt hr intech instruments ltd the average value of the three points was assumed to be representative of the data for each plot to estimate the emission fluxes of ghgs gas sampling was conducted at around 7 day intervals using a chamber based method one base of the chamber was installed in each plot in 2015 and 2016 and two bases were installed in 2017 fig 2 the rectangular acrylic chamber was gently placed on the base during gas sampling the height of the base was 20 cm and the chamber dimensions were 60 60 100 cm length width height ten to seventeen rice stubbles were included within each chamber gas was collected using a 15 ml plastic syringe and the chamber air temperature was measured 1 10 and 20 min after installing the chamber the samples were immediately transferred to evacuated injection vials almost all samplings were conducted in the morning 8 30 11 30 a m the number of replicates for ghgs for each plot numbered one in 2015 and 2016 and two in 2017 replicates for each water management block c w and s numbered two in 2015 and 2016 and four in 2017 ch4 and n2o concentrations were measured using gas chromatographs equipped with flame ionization detectors and electron capture detectors respectively itoh et al 2011 gas emission flux was calculated based on the temporal change in gas concentration in the headspace of the chamber using the following equation 1 f d c d t m 273 22 4 1 t 273 v a where f is the gas flux mg m 2 min 1 c is the gas concentration ppm t is the time min m is the molecular weight g mol 1 t is the air temperature in the chamber c v is the volume of the headspace in the chamber m3 and a is the cross sectional area of the chamber m2 unhulled rice yield was estimated by the planting density the number of rice stubbles per unit area and the weight of ripened grains per one rice stubble ripened grains were selected using salt water with a density of 1 06 g cm 3 the planting density was obtained by measuring the area planted with 121 11 11 rice stubbles in each plot the weight of ripened and unhulled grain was the average of four rice stubbles in the process of estimating yields the number of ears per stubble and the number of grains per ear were also measured rice yield measurements were conducted at two or three points in each plot 3 results 3 1 paddy ponding depth and irrigation water management temporal changes in paddy ponding depths of the experimental plots are shown with daily rainfall amounts in fig 4 in the 2015 ws ponding frequently decreased and it was inferred that the prolonged period of dry surface soil was due to the lower rainfall in april fig 3 the ponding depths of all six plots showed similar temporal changes and no differences were observed among the treatments c w and s blocks because frequent rainfall events in the latter half of the irrigation period dominated the temporal changes in ponding depths in all experimental plots pump operation was not necessary and the ideal awd water management i e experiment was not achieved in the 2015 sa similar temporal changes in the ponding depth were observed among the treatments after the midseason drainage in the latter half of august the ponding depths of all experimental plots corresponded to rainfall amounts and it was not possible to conduct the awd water management in the 2016 ws the difference in ponding depths in response to the operation of pumps and gates were observed in mid april according to a record log a water manager operated the system to irrigate block w on april 15 and 19 and block s on april 15 pumped water was expected to irrigate block c on april 15 16 and 19 the ponding depth of the c1 plot was maintained above 0 cm the ponding depth of the w1 and w2 plots were temporarily at approximately 5 cm the flooding receded in the s1 plot in mid april and although the ponding depth of the c2 plot decreased the high ponding depth of s2 plot was maintained the ponding depths of the w1 w2 and s1 plots decreased to almost 20 cm in mid may although this observation was independent from the operation of the pumps in the 2016 sa according to a record log pumped water irrigated block w on july 20 and august 20 and block s on august 12 block c was expected to have been irrigated on july 14 july 20 august 12 and august 20 the ponding depths of the c1 and c2 plots were almost above soil surface those of w1 and w2 plots decreased frequently to 5 cm and to 5 to 15 cm respectively and the ponding depths of the s1 and s2 plots reached 20 cm a situation close to the ideal ponding depth was produced from july to august in 2016 despite the high rainfall in this season in the 2017 ws the ponding depths of all plots decreased in mid april although the ponding depths of the w1 w2 s1 and s2 plots increased on april 14 as a result of the operation of the pumps and gates the ponding depths of the c1 and c2 plots continued to decrease the ideal awd water management was not achieved in this season in the 2017 sa the operation of pumps was not recorded in july and august the ponding depths of the c1 and c2 plots were maintained above the soil surface longer than in the w1 w2 s1 and s2 plots however this was not as a result of water management i e the use of the gates 3 2 drying index to evaluate the degree of the period when the ponding depth was under the critical value we defined the drying index as the ratio of the period when the ponding depth was under the critical value to the period when the ponding depth was observed we estimated three drying index values when the critical value was 0 5 and 15 cm a drying index of zero means the ponding depth was higher than the critical value with flooding or wet soil conditions during the whole observation period on the other hand 1 in the index means the ponding depth was lower than the critical value with non flooding or dry soil conditions during the whole observation period table 3 shows statistics on the drying index at 0 cm for each water management treatment c w and s in ws and sa seasons over the three years the number of replicates was two for each treatment so there were no significant differences for each treatment in all cropping seasons p 0 05 except in the 2017 sa based on the tukey honest significant differences tukey hsd test there were no significant differences between each treatment at drying indexes for 5 and 15 cm fig 5 represents the comparison of drying indexes for each cropping season and each plot in the 2016 sa the ideal water management for awd was conducted as mentioned above and the intended differences for the drying indexes for 0 5 and 15 cm of the critical value were approximately confirmed in the 2017 sa the drying indexes in the c1 and c2 plots were relatively lower than in the w and s plots and an especially extremely high drying index was observed in the w plots for the 0 cm critical value the drying indexes for 0 5 and 15 cm in the 2015 ws were higher than in the other seasons and years due to the lower rainfall the average drying index was 0 65 in 2015 ws and 0 15 0 51 in other cropping seasons table 3 also smaller differences were observed between treatments especially the drying indexes for 0 and 5 cm we did not observe remarkable differences in the three drying indexes among blocks in the 2015 sa 2016 ws and 2017 ws 3 3 greenhouse gases emission 3 3 1 ch4 emission fig 6 shows the temporal changes in ch4 emission flux mg m 2 min 1 in each plot the 2015 ws and the 2017 ws presented similar temporal patterns in ch4 emission ch4 emissions were observed until early april and were almost negligible after mid april except in the w1 w2 and s2 plots on may 13 in 2017 until early april after the transplanting of rice the ponding depths were maintained above the soil surface fig 4 and this may have induced ch4 emissions even though the ponding depths increased and became positive after the midseason drainage ch4 emission did not occur immediately in the 2016 ws the midseason drainage was insufficient in mid april due to a rainfall event and the ch4 emission continued especially in the c and w plots the drainage in mid may may have decreased the ch4 emission the increase in ponding depths due to heavy rainfall at the end of may did not induce ch4 emissions in the w and s plots the ch4 emission fluxes were larger in the sa than in the ws in the 2015 sa there were no ch4 emissions during the midseason drainage at the end of august fig 4 and they did not occur until the end of the irrigation period in the 2016 sa high rainfall and the associated increase in ponding depth figs 3 and 4 caused continuous ch4 emissions in the c and w plots despite the missing ponding depth data in the 2017 sa the midseason drainage also induced a decrease in the ch4 emissions in the c1 w2 and s1 plots 3 3 2 n2o emission temporal changes in n2o emission flux mg m 2 min 1 are shown in fig 7 temporary n2o emissions were observed after the nitrogen fertilizer applications in ws there were temporary n2o emissions in march which were inferred to be the result of the second nitrogen fertilizer application and an especially high n2o emission was observed in early april in the 2016 ws in the 2015 sa 2016 sa and 2017 sa the n2o emissions in mid or late july from some plots occurred after the second fertilizer application although almost no n2o emissions were observed where there was no ponding fig 4 there was not a relationship between ponding depth and n2o emission rainfall events did not affect the n2o emissions additionally there was no effect of water management on the n2o emission in the mid august in the 2016 sa we could not confirm the relationship between water management and n2o emission 3 3 3 cumulative ghg emission amount daily average ch4 and n2o emission fluxes were calculated by dividing the cumulative gas emission amount by the observation period and were converted to co2 emission fluxes g co2 m 2 d 1 using the global warming potential values of 25 and 298 for ch4 and n2o respectively solomon et al 2007 the flux between the two observation dates was assumed to be constant and equal to the former one table 4 shows statistics on the daily ch4 emission flux for each water management treatment c w and s in ws and sa seasons over the three years there were no significant differences by water management treatment for each cropping season except the 2016 ws and 2015 sa higher ch4 emissions were observed in c plots than w and s plots in the 2016 ws but the amount of ch4 released was highest in s followed by w then c plots in the 2015 sa the average values of daily average ch4 emission flux in all plots were 1 7 9 6 and 3 5 g co2 m 2 d 1 for the 2015 ws 2016 ws and 2017 ws respectively and 11 5 22 2 and 15 8 g co2 m 2 d 1 for the 2015 sa 2016 sa and 2017 sa respectively there was a large difference in ch4 emission in relation to the cropping season and the cumulative ch4 emission in ws was smaller than in sa on the other hand the ch4 emissions were relatively higher in the c plots than in the w and s plots in the 2016 ws 2016 sa and 2017 sa although the tukey hsd test revealed that the differences among the three blocks were not significant p 0 05 table 5 shows the daily n2o emission fluxes for each water management treatment in ws and sa seasons over the three years there were no significant differences by water management treatment for each cropping season the n2o co2 equivalent emissions were less than ch4 the average n2o emission was 0 1 and 0 04 times that of ch4 in ws and sa respectively tables 4 and 5 fig 8 presents the daily average ch4 and n2o emission fluxes for each cropping season and each plot there is no error bar for 2015 and 2016 because only one chamber was set for each plot standard deviation error bars are shown in 2017 because gas sampling was conducted at two points per plot ch4 emissions in the c1 and c2 plots were higher than in the w and s plots in the 2016 sa although there were no significant differences 3 4 rice yield the unhulled rice yields for each water management treatment and each plot are shown in table 6 and fig 9 respectively over the three years the average yields in ws and sa were statistically different at 5 89 103 kg ha 1 and 4 46 103 kg ha 1 respectively welch s test p 7 7 10 10 in ws no significant differences were observed among 2015 2016 and 2017 in sa significant differences were observed between 2015 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2017 considering the varieties of rice cultivated in each season table 1 the variety thien uu 8 was cultivated in the 2015 sa and the 2017 sa this variety may have fewer yields in sa as a result of the tukey hsd test for comparisons among water management treatments only significant differences between c plots and s plots were observed in the 2015 sa p 0 0001 and between c plots and w plots in the 2015 sa p 0 0002 the w plot and s plot rice yields were higher than those of the c plots in sa in 2015 table 7 shows the correlation coefficients between rice yield and other components i e planting density the number of ears per stubble the number of grains per ear the ripening rate and the weight per grain ripening rate was defined by the ratio of the number of ripened grains and the number of total grains the highest correlation r 0 780 was observed between rice yield and ripening rate pearson s product moment correlation test p 2 17 10 8 since soil drying processes such as the midseason drainage are important to increase ripening rate especially under higher air temperature conditions kitagawa et al 2018 insufficient soil drying as a result of high rainfall may have influenced the lower yield that was recorded in sa 4 discussion 4 1 effectiveness of water management by the water user group the original schedule of water management was intermittent irrigation at short intervals several days mainly after the midseason drainage and the simultaneous operation of pumps and gates however pumps were not frequently operated because ponding depth did not frequently decrease i e to a level that required irrigation except in the 2015 ws fig 4 due to high precipitation in the 2015 ws the ponding depth was not maintained above the soil surface in the c plots probably because water managers may have considered it unnecessary to operate pumps because of the rainfall events in may 2015 especially in the 2016 sa and the 2017 sa the length of the period during which the ponding depth was lower than 0 5 and 15 cm was longer in the w and s plots than in the c plots figs 4 and 5 although the elevations of the soil surface were almost the same in all observation plots table 2 we acknowledge the difficulty that water managers had in adhering to the original schedule under the actual meteorological conditions and with the actual ponding depth water managers may also have intentionally avoided driving the pumps to reduce electricity expense furthermore not all farmers in the district understood the pilot systematic water management and used their own manual pumps if they considered irrigation to be necessary hence the effect of water management by the water user group through the operation of pumps and gates was limited it was impossible to establish two different drying stages the weak dry and strong dry blocks in this district in the interview surveys some farmers stated that there was a decrease in the number of times that they used a manual pump when one or two blocks of the district were irrigated by the operation of the gates the water level of the channel in the corresponding block rose up and it was not necessary to use the manual pumps indicating that in such scenarios the water shortage problem was possibly solved it is hoped that organizational water management with a simultaneous operation of pumps and gates will be used for future block rotational irrigation and that irrigation water will spread to the end of each block not only for awd management 4 2 effect of drying index on ch4 emission daily average greenhouse gas emission flux of ch4 converted to equivalent co2 was much higher in this region than n2o fig 8 n2o emission is related to nitrogen fertilizer application cai et al 1997 showed that n2o emission increased significantly with the increase in the nitrogen application rate and that the n2o flux was very small when the paddy plots were flooded but peaked at the beginning of the recession of the floodwater the n2o emission in this study was however not related to the non ponding period and there was no trade off relationship between ch4 and n2o with drying hence n2o emission was temporary and not continuous fig 7 while ch4 emitted continuously during flooding fig 6 the soil redox potential may not have frequently exceeded 200 mv when ponding water was eliminated in this study and the soil water content may have decreased judging from the fact the recommended soil redox potential is 100 to 200 mv to prevent n2o emissions hou et al 2000 this study shows the importance of focusing on the mitigation of ch4 emissions to reduce the ghg impacts of paddy areas in this region the ch4 emission and the drying index for 0 cm were weakly negatively correlated in both seasons fig 10 emission of ch4 from rice paddies is the result of anoxic bacterial ch4 production neue et al 1996 minamikawa and sakai 2005 showed that the ch4 emissions decreased in response to the midseason drainage method and midseason plus intermittent irrigation method compared to continuous flooding despite the decrease in ch4 emission by prolonged drying periods being a well known phenomenon the on farm level investigation in this study did not demonstrate a distinct relationship between them especially in sa with regards to each cropping season we did not observe the negative relationship between ch4 emission and the drying index for 0 cm in response to the different water management treatments in ws it was difficult to control the ch4 emission by increasing the drying index for 0 cm in ws on the other hand since a weak negative relationship was observed in the sa in each year except in 2015 it may be possible to manage ch4 emissions by lengthening the drying period in the sa different trends were observed in the ws and sa the ch4 emission at the same drying index was higher in sa than in ws presumably due to the higher temperatures air temperature rose approximately from 20 c to 30 c from march to june in ws and were constant at about 30 c from june to september fig 3 in addition much organic matter presumably originated from the residues of rice straw at the beginning of sa because the season started immediately after ws the rice straw after the harvesting of sa may be decomposed from september to february and the amount of organic matter at the beginning of ws is inferred to be small although we did not collect organic matter data in this study it is thought that the effect of soil drying is likely to manifest due to the higher ch4 emissions in sa compared with ws the present study motivates for the importance of increasing the drying period in sa to reduce ch4 emissions from paddy areas through careful water management 4 3 effect of drying index on rice yield in ws the unhulled rice yield did not change with drying indexes for 0 cm and 15 cm left side of fig 11 in sa despite there being no remarkable change in rice yield with increasing drying indexes for 0 cm and 15 cm the large drying index induced a decrease in rice yield right side of fig 11 in the experiments by minamikawa and sakai 2005 the order of brown rice yield was as follows midseason drainage plus intermittent irrigation midseason drainage continuous flooding but excessive drying of the soil slightly affected rice yield in this study in particular the drying index for 0 cm ponding depth in the w1 and w2 plots in sa 2017 sufficient ponding water may not have been present at the period around ear emergence after midseason drainage matsushima 1962 water saving irrigation by controlling limiting values of soil water potential related to specific stages can increase grain yield yang et al 2007 on the other hand pascual and wang 2017 compared the effect of intermittent irrigation at 3 day intervals and at 7 day intervals to continuous flooding and showed that grain yield was comparable among irrigation regimes li et al 2018 mentioned that awd management led to a promotion in plant physiological activities and grain filling and hence increased grain yields the effects of water management on rice yield vary with rice varieties and meteorological conditions in the investigated area it was possible to conduct dry type water management without reducing rice yield in ws and we advise that water management regimes avoid the excessive drying out of paddy soils in sa the maximum drying index for 0 cm was approximately 0 6 which was adequate in sa to reduce ch4 emission and to maintain rice yield in any case it is important to flood water during periods when water is needed for rice growth physiologically 4 4 contributions to decision making process considering that flooding is recommended until the rooting stage after transplanting and for around 30 days before and after ear emergence which large effects on rice yield and that rainfall is relatively frequent in the study region opportunities for awd management are in fact limited therefore it is important to carry out awd management with certainty so it is considered that management by a water user group is more efficient than water management by individual farmers we proposed awd management by a water user group through the operation of irrigation pumps and sluice gates for water division work though the direct effects of pump operation and gates on ponding water management and ch4 reduction were limited this study showed potential for the organizational water management system to deliver sufficient water to target blocks the fact that ch4 emissions decreased with increased drying index and that there was no significant reduction in rice yield with careful drying in paddy field experiments covering ca 44 ha over the three years should be an incentive for farmers and administrative governments to develop eco friendly water management 5 conclusions in this study the organizational water management system i e involving the operation of pumps and gates was only able to be utilized on a few occasions as part of the awd management assessment due to the timing of precipitation and because the ponding depth remained above the soil surface the original schedule of water ponding depth was therefore not achieved the drying degree of the weak dry block and the strong dry block may have increased compared to the conventional block however it was limited to the period within the cropping season future research on the feasibility of awd management in this region is necessary for the organization of water management it is important to demonstrate the feasibility of a non flooded period for suppressing ch4 emissions to the water management organization and farmers taking into consideration the physiologically essential flooding period and the midseason drainage period to prevent reductions in rice yield ch4 emissions were much higher than n2o emissions so policies for reducing ch4 emissions should be focused on in the study region despite the ch4 emission having decreased with the increase in the drying index for the soil surface it was difficult to control the ch4 emission by increasing the drying index in the ws compared to that in the sa the findings of this study suggest that the drying period should be increased in sa through careful water management to effectively reduce ch4 emissions from rice paddies

rainwater harvesting srwh is an important process in rainfed farming areas improving the capacity for srwh via tillage is essential in many parts of the world in recent years reservoir tillage rt has attracted attention because it was said that rt contributes to srwh the objectives of this study were to measure the cumulative soil harvested rainwater shr of slopes subjected to rt and to evaluate the contribution of rt to srwh under different rainfall conditions a smooth surface ss served as a control surface three slope degrees 5 15 and 25 were subjected to low and heavy 60 and 120 mm h and long term rainfall 90 min the results showed that the cumulative shr decreased to different extents under different rainfall intensities as the slope degree increased on the gentle slope 5 and under low rainfall intensity 60 mm h no significant differences in cumulative shr were detected between the rt and ss treatments whereas significant differences in cumulative shr were detected between them on the steep slopes 15 and 25 and under high rainfall intensity 120 mm h the differences in cumulative shr among the different conditions occurred because the contribution of rt to srwh varied as the soil surface properties changed especially as surface depression storage decreased due to sediment deposition under the conditions of long term rainfall for example on the 5 slope at a rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the contribution of rt to srwh was 18 58 during the 0 30 min rainfall stage but 14 84 during the 60 90 min stage resulting in nearly equal cumulative shr values between the rt slope and the ss slope our results suggest that rt is not necessary contribute to srwh in all cases keywords reservoir tillage rt slopes soil harvested rainwater shr soil rainwater harvesting srwh

runoff velocity and increasing infiltration rates keesstra et al 2012 prosdocimi et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 soil surface roughness ssr is an important parameter widely used to quantify the size of microtopographies kamphorst et al 2000 jester and klik 2005 several studies have shown that surface depression storage increases as ssr increases and vice versa onstad 1984 alvarez mozos et al 2011 a greater soil infiltration rate is generally associated with surfaces having greater ssr steichen 1984 however due to the spatial structural differences in the surface microtopographies subjected to different tillage techniques surface depression storage and soil infiltration strongly differ in terms of quantity under different circumstances su et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 some studies have suggested that tillage has a significant effect on srwh because the surface runoff is significantly delayed and the rainwater loss from the tilled surfaces is generally lower than that from smooth surfaces or untilled soils due to the collection of depressions guzha 2004 patrick et al 2007 salem et al 2014 this conclusion has served as an important basis for modelling soil erosion such as for models generated by the universal soil loss equation usle and by the water erosion prediction project wepp however several researchers have argued that compared with the effects of conservation tillage techniques such as no tillage the effects of traditional tillage techniques on the harvesting rainwater capacity of soils is limited because the latter reduces the anti erodibility of the topsoil moreno et al 1997 jin et al 2008 morris et al 2010 on tilled surfaces rill erosion occurs easily gómez et al 2003 once rill erosion has occurred rainwater stored in surface depressions is easily lost via rill networks during rainfall events in this case the role of surface depressions in increasing srwh diminishes systematic experimental studies of the effects of tillage on srwh on tilled surfaces are lacking reservoir tillage rt is widely used in many areas when planting crops on sloping lands such as the mediterranean region and the loess plateau of china patrick et al 2007 salem et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 this tillage technique leaves many mini depressions on the surface during rainfall these surface depressions retain rainwater and hence delay surface runoff during the early stage of rainfall events chu et al 2013 salem et al 2014 therefore the use of rt is also an important strategy for maintaining land productivity because it harvests large amounts natural rainwater in arid and semiarid environments and is highly supported by soil and water conservation management organizations in china the effects of the rt technique on soil erosion have recently been investigated patrick et al 2007 salem et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 patrick et al 2007 defined rt as a system in which numerous small surface depressions are formed to hold and collect water during rainfall to prevent rainwater loss salem et al 2014 suggested that compared with surfaces without depressions surfaces subjected to rt can reduce surface runoff by approximately 61 although these studies also evaluated the role of rt in srwh their results do not provide insight into the effects of rt on srwh or the underlying mechanisms moreover slope gradients significantly affect depression volume relationships between slope gradient and srwh have never been reported to further verify the effects of rt on the rainwater harvesting capacity of soils a laboratory experiment was conducted under simulated rainfall conditions we conducted a series of simulated rainfall events that persisted for a long 90 min duration on three different slope degrees and at two different intensities the objectives of this study were to measure the srwh of the surfaces subjected to rt and determine the changes in srwh in response to rainfall we predicted that the soils with rt would harvest higher amounts of rain than would the soils with smooth surfaces under rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river of china it covers a total area of 600 000 km2 and has a population of 82 million the annual average temperature is 8 3 c and the climate ranges from semiarid in the south to arid in the north the annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm in the northwest to 700 mm in the southwest and is distributed unevenly throughout the year he et al 2003 most rainstorms occur in summer when sudden storms with rainfall intensities of more than 100 mm h 1 are common therefore soil and water loss predominately occur during this season shi and shao 2000 rt is widely used on sloping farmland on the loess plateau of china usually rt is applied by hoeing from the bottom to the top of the slope forming many mini depressions on the surface the geometrical shape of the depressions is an approximate upside down cone the mean volume of a single depression is approximately 100 cm3 and the mean depth of a depression is approximately 4 cm zhao et al 2012 2 2 reservoir tillage preparation in soil boxes topsoil depth of 0 20 cm was collected from farmland 34 17 56 n 108 04 07 e in the study area the soil is classified as an eum orthic anthrosol and is a sandy clay loam consisting of 57 sand 18 silt and 25 clay the soil samples were air dried in the laboratory and then sieved through a 10 mm sieve to ensure homogeneity a soil box that was 2 0 m in length by 1 0 m in width by 0 5 m in depth was filled with the sieved soil in successive layers that were 0 05 m thick and the total thickness of the backfilled soil in the boxes was 0 4 m the bulk density of the soil layers in each box was 1 30 g cm3 which is close to the bulk density of natural soil layers under field conditions after filling the boxes with soil rt was simulated in the soil boxes at the downslope end of each box was a v shaped drainage outlet that was used to collect the rainwater lost surface runoff during rainfall fig 1 in this study a total of three slope degrees i e 5 15 and 25 were considered the simulated rt procedure in the soil boxes was the same for each slope degree a ss that was not tilled served as a control surface in this study 2 3 simulated rainfall procedure the rainfall simulator was equipped with a side spray nozzle that produced raindrops at a kinetic energy impact rate that was 80 of that of natural rainfall with a corresponding intensity the simulator nozzles were installed at a height of 6 m above the ground changes in rainfall intensity were controlled by adjusting the water pressure in the supply pipe two rainfall nozzles were placed 1 m in front and behind the runoff plots and the nozzles were positioned to face the soil surface and were located in the centre of each of the runoff plots before the rainfall applications eight gauges were evenly placed throughout the rainfall area to calibrate the rainfall intensity the results showed that the rainfall uniformity was greater than 90 which is greater than that of the local natural rainfall reported by wu et al 2011 the effective rainfall area was 7 m by 5 m rainfall intensities of 60 and 120 mm h were used and the rainfall duration was 90 min using this rainfall duration we obtained steady rates of surface runoff production for all the rainfall intensities during the rainfall experiments the runoff or rainwater loss from the surface was collected in 5 l plastic buckets an empty bucket was substituted at the collection point every 2 min after the rainfall events the samples in each bucket were weighed the weight of the sediment in each bucket was then measured after drying the sediment at 110 c for 12 h the runoff in the rt and ss treatments was calculated by subtracting the sediment weight and tare of bucket from the sample weight this runoff or rainwater loss was subsequently used to determine the cumulative shr of the rt and ss treatments during rainfall before and after rainfall the surface elevations were measured using a laser scanner zhang et al 2014 the measured spacing was 2 by 2 cm and approximately 3480 elevation points were obtained for each surface during each run these data were used to create a digital elevation model dem and to determine the changes in surface microtopography during rainfall a series of dems with a grid size of 2 mm were generated using arcgis 10 2 the main processes involved in the generation of the dem can be found elsewhere zhao et al 2016 for visualization of the surface microtopography surface depressions and their changes the elevation ranges of the dem were concerted to colour codes resulting in coloured surface microtopography maps helming et al 1998 for each surface depositional crust area maps based on before and after dems were derived using the cut fill tool in arcgis 10 2 these resulting maps served as a basis for discussing the experimental results 2 4 data analysis in this study shr represented the harvested rainwater of soils during rainfall the shr was calculated based on the principle of water balance as follows 1 i t p t q t e t where i t represents the shr at rainfall time t kg min t is the rainfall time min and p t q t and e t represent the rainfall rainwater loss and evaporation at time t respectively kg min in this study p t was 60 and 120 mm h q t is equal to the runoff which was measured at the downslope outlet during rainfall the measuring procedure of q t is described above and e t 0 because the experiment was conducted in the laboratory the contribution of rt to srwh was calculated using the following equation 2 i t o t a l t 0 t i r t t t 0 t i s s t t 0 t i s s t 100 where itotal represents the contribution of rt to srwh t is the rainfall time min t is the rainfall duration t 90 min and t 0 t i r t t and t 0 t i s s t represent the cumulative shr in the rt and ss treatments respectively kg the itotal was calculated as different time stages of 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 0 90 min this division occurred because rainwater loss or the runoff hydrograph tended to increase during 0 30 min representing the stage during which rainwater loss changed quickly during the 30 60 min stage the runoff hydrograph also changed albeit to a small extent during the 60 90 min stage the runoff hydrograph reached a steady state the data from the four stages were used to better understand the temporal changes in shr with rainfall time and the contributions of rt to srwh we used ms excel 10 0 for data arrangement and plot construction and the significance between different treatments at the p 0 05 level was determined with dps software version 17 10 a statistical analysis system presented by tang and zhang 2013 3 results 3 1 rainwater loss in this study rainwater loss increased as the slope degree increased fig 2 the differences in rainwater loss were significant between the rainfall events of 60 and 120 mm h intensities at the 60 mm h intensity the cumulative rainwater loss crl ranged from 79 46 to 109 20 kg and from 81 33 to 107 60 kg in the rt and ss treatments respectively no significant difference in crl was detected between the rt and ss treatments but the differences between the gentle 5 and steep slopes 15 and 25 within each treatment were significant however the differences in crl between the rt and ss treatments were significant on the steep slopes 15 and 25 when the rainfall intensity was 120 mm h moreover at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the rainwater loss was threefold greater than that at 60 mm h intensity for each of the three slopes 3 2 soil rainwater harvesting fig 3 shows the cumulative shr of the slopes under different rainfall conditions the duration of rainfall was 90 min for all experiments the cumulative shr decreased as the slope degree increased whereas the crl increased as the slope degree increased at the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h no significant difference in cumulative shr was detected between the rt and ss treatments within the same slope degree fig 3a however significant differences in cumulative shr were detected between the gentle i e 5 and steep slopes i e 15 and 25 the cumulative shr for the rt treatment was 104 54 kg on the 5 slope but 74 81 kg on the 25 slope at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the cumulative shr decreased as the slope degree increased but exhibited characteristics different from those at the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h fig 3b in addition to the significant differences in cumulative shr between the gentle and steep slopes significant differences were detected between the rt and ss treatments on the steep slopes i e 15 and 25 the cumulative shr in the rt treatment ranged from 61 72 to 104 59 kg at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the greatest cumulative shr in the rt treatment was detected on the 5 slope for both rainfall intensities and the smallest cumulative shr was detected on the 25 slope on the 25 slope the cumulative shr was significantly lower for the rainfall of 120 mm h than for the 60 mm h rainfall the results indicate that both slope degree and rainfall intensity affect srwh albeit to different extents under different rainfall conditions 3 3 cumulative curves of shr fig 4 shows the cumulative curves of shr after 90 min of rainfall rt ss 60 and 120 represent the two surface treatments and the two rainfall intensities respectively the greater the relative distance among the cumulative shr curves the greater the difference in cumulative shr among the different treatments cumulative curves of the rt treatment above those of the ss treatment would indicate that the soils in the rt treatment harvested more rainwater than did the ss soils that is rt improved shr cumulative curves in the opposite pattern would indicate that rt did not improve shr during the first 10 min after the beginning of rainfall all cumulative curves rapidly rose this result indicates that the rainfall harvesting capacity of the soils is greater during the early stage of rainfall than during the later stages this is true because there was no runoff generated on the surfaces and the rainwater loss was equal to zero in this study in other words the cumulative shr is equal to the cumulative rainfall as long as surface runoff is not generated from the slope in this case the cumulative shr depends on the cumulative rainfall the greater the rainfall intensity the greater the cumulative shr in our experiments we observed measurable runoff after 3 to 5 min from the slopes in the ss treatment and after 5 to 10 min from the slopes in the rt treatment the cumulative curves of shr for all rt treatments were above all those of the ss treatments before the generation of runoff in addition after the generation of runoff the relationship between the cumulative curves of the rt and ss treatments exhibited different characteristics this phenomenon may be related to the soil erosion processes occurring on the surface on the tilled surface surface microtopography will affect soil infiltration and rainwater loss and thus will affect soil erosion processes in turn soil erosion induced surface microtopography will subsequently affect srwh and rainwater loss the relative distance of cumulative curves between the rt and ss treatments varied with time for example at a rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the cumulative curves of the rt treatment were always above those of the ss treatment the rt 60 and ss 60 cumulative curves intersected at 60 70 min furthermore to better understand the effects of rt on srwh the contribution of rt to srwh was calculated with formula 2 for the four rainfall stages the results are listed in table 1 during the different rainfall stages the contributions of the rt technique to srwh differ three situations can be seen in table 1 1 in some of the stages the cumulative shr is less than zero while the total cumulative shr is greater than zero 2 in some of the stages the cumulative shr is greater than zero while the total cumulative shr is less than zero and 3 no significant trend was observed for the cumulative shr among the different slopes and between the rainfall intensities for example on the 5 slope the cumulative shr was 1 82 during the 0 90 min rainfall stage and was less than zero during the 30 60 and 60 90 min stages the cumulative shr at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h was significantly greater than that at the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h on each of the 15 and 25 slopes 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of soil rainwater harvesting the mechanism of soil rainwater harvesting is illustrated in fig 5 soil infiltration is the only source of srwh the horton flow theory states that all rainwater can become soil water until the soil infiltration becomes lower than the rainfall intensity and runoff is generated from the surface fig 5a this conclusion is consistent for the rt and ss slopes after the generation of runoff the runoff rate increased as the rainfall time increased while the soil infiltration rate decreased the increased runoff rate indicates increased rainwater loss and shr decreases accordingly however for soils subjected to rt in which depressions are left on the surface after tilling excess rainwater is first retained in the depression areas when the soil infiltration rate is lower than the rainfall intensity fig 5b and c this phenomenon will delay rainwater loss from soils subjected to rt and hence prolong the infiltration time this phenomenon will also increase the amount of rainwater infiltrated into soils therefore in theory under the same rainfall conditions the shr of a tilled surface is greater than that of a ss second tilled surfaces have a larger surface area or infiltration surface area than sss during rainfall over a larger area rainwater spreads over this larger area resulting in a low bulk density of the top layer soil and a high soil total porosity relative to those observed for smaller areas leading to high soil permeability and hence increasing shr cassel et al 1995 sun et al 2009 third on the tilled surface due to surface microtopographical impacts the flow length is longer than that on the ss therefore the rainwater that moved from the position at which it fell to the outlet of the tilled surface took longer than it did on the ss which also increases the opportunity for rainwater infiltration into soils effects of tillage on flow length have been investigated by helming et al 1998 and zhao and wu 2015 last and most importantly during rainfall rainwater collected in the surface depressions allows more time for infiltration after rainfall some of the rainwater collected in the surface depressions does not flow out onto the surface except for a small amount lost through evaporation that rainwater infiltrates the soils within a short time period fig 5d this phenomenon will increase the total amount of rainwater that infiltrates the soil salem et al 2014 the amount of rainwater stored in depressions after the cessation of rainfall depends on the final surface depression storage capacity if this capacity decreases little during rainfall the surface depression storage after rainfall differs little from that before rainfall and thus has a large contribution to the total amount of shr otherwise it has little or no contribution overall the above four methods represent the main mechanisms by which soils harvest rainwater on the tilled surface and together they affect srwh on the tilled surface 4 2 analysis of factors that influence soil rainwater harvesting the rt technique contributes to srwh in four ways as discussed above therefore influencing the abovementioned four ways will affect the rainwater harvesting capacity of soils subjected to rt treatment the main advantage of the rt technique is that the depressions created on the surface will retain a portion of the rainwater and allow it to infiltrate into the soil over time in previous tillage and soil erosion studies the amount of rainwater stored in the depression areas was referred to as surface depression storage onstad 1984 hansen et al 1999 planchon et al 2001 antoine et al 2012 and others most of those studies concluded that compared with the rainwater loss from sss the rainwater loss from tilled surfaces was delayed and soil infiltration increased due to depression storage freebairn et al 1989 zhao et al 2013 rocha junior et al 2016 a reason for this result as explained by fox et al 1998 is that rainwater that had collected in the surface depressions improves local water head pressure strengthening the infiltration rate however the surface depression storage decreased as the slope degree increased onstad 1984 in addition the effect of depressions on srwh is diminished on steep slopes this phenomenon is generally consistent with our finding that the cumulative shr decreased as the slope degree increased as shown in fig 3 soil crust is another indispensable factor that influences srwh although tillage techniques can improve soil infiltration they are not sustainable because a few rainfalls are enough to build up a new crust stroosnijder and hoogmoed 1984 mando et al 1996 sun et al 2009 surface crusts formed under rainfall are subject to raindrop impacts and sedimentary seals may directly reduce soil infiltration fox et al 1998 especially for the rt technique after the generation of surface runoff surface depressions can deposit sediment eroded by surface runoff from upslope regions and can form a thick depositional crust in water filled areas fig 5 this crust can reduce soil infiltration in depression areas burwell and larson 1969 pointed out that during simulated rainfall increases in tillage induced surface microtopography and pore space increased water infiltration before runoff started but did not significantly influence infiltration throughout a 5 cm runoff period strudley et al 2008 suggested that most tillage techniques have pronounced effects on soil hydraulic properties including soil infiltration immediately following tillage applications but that these effects can diminish rapidly similar results have also been reported by mohamoud et al 1990 and zhao et al 2013 under simulation rainfall conditions rill erosion is another factor that affects srwh surface depression storage not only depends on the initial volume of depressions on the surface but is also related to the surface change in space and time as runoff and sediment processes are prolonged surface elevation changes to low areas and flow paths may be well developed on the whole surface the development of flow paths will connect the original separated depressions to the outlet of the surface and ultimately form an integrated rill network visualizations of surfaces subjected to rt at a rainfall intensity of 60 mm h are presented in fig 6 the elevations obtained from the dem have been transformed into colour codes the same colour represents an approximate elevation from which runoff can flow each figure consists of three images that represent the initial surface after rt preparation left the changed surface after 90 min of rainfall middle and the depositional crust area red colour map right for each surface the relatively higher elevation was reduced due to rainfall erosion but the elevation in the depression area increased due to deposition impact after rainfall most importantly after rainfall the connected area of the same colour increased and formed a continuous area from the low edge of the slope to the middle upper part of the slope this represents the flow path of rainwater loss on the tilled surface during rainfall as reported by darboux et al 2001 this result suggests that flow connectivity increased and that most depressions connect at least once to the outflow boundary meaning that rainwater is easily lost in fact this result is consistent with the findings observed in some published laboratory and simulation studies helming et al 1998 römkens et al 2002 gómez et al 2003 liu and singh 2004 during the rill development stage tilled surfaces usually generate more runoff than they do during other stages souchere et al 1998 zhao et al 2018 that is the contribution of rt to srwh differs between before and after rill erosion liu et al 2014 suggested that rainwater loss increased by 55 8 from the rill erosion stage on contour ridge surfaces zhao et al 2018 reported that compared with the total runoff from a ss the total runoff from a tilled surface increased by 25 because of rill development at a later stage of rainfall in our experiments at a rainfall intensity of 120 mm h well developed flow paths and rill erosion were also visible after the later stage of the rainfall event in the rt treatment in this case rill erosion and flow concentration were apparently the dominant processes helming et al 1998 su et al 2015 compared with that on the relatively ss the increased flow concentration on the tilled surface translated into a decrease in cumulative shr because of the reduced surface depression storage of soils however our results also suggest that rt contributes differently to srwh during different rainfall stages table 1 this result may be related to the response of runoff generation to changes in flow connectivity darboux et al 2002 on the surfaces subjected to rt the initial depressions were not connected to each other as the rainfall time prolonged the depressions were filled by the additional rainwater and the water that began to flow out from the depressions contributed to the runoff due to differences in volume and flow distance of the depressions the contributions to runoff of each depression are different these differences will affect the contributions of rt to srwh during different rainfall stages darboux and huang 2005 pointed out that rainwater spilled from depressions can instantly increase rainwater losses by 10 chu et al 2013 systematically studied the effects of depressions on overall rainwater loss the authors suggested that rainwater loss is a depression to depression filling outflowing process fig 5b and c during the filling sub process rainwater loss is reduced whereas in the outflowing sub process rainwater loss is increased in the present case the amount of rainwater lost by surface runoff was variable because the filling and outflowing processes alternated during rainfall until all depressions were connected to the outlet of the slope the steady state of runoff is a common way to determine whether the runoff process is balanced darboux and huang 2005 zhao and wu 2015 if balanced all the depressions were connected otherwise they were not many previous studies have shown that for sss the runoff time generally reaches a steady state from 30 to 60 min gómez and nearing 2005 however in general compared with that of sss runoff rates on tilled surfaces differentially change over time because of the impact of surface microtopography and the runoff steady state requires a long time to achieve darboux et al 2002 liu et al 2014 this result is also consistent with the results of our experiment before the steady state of runoff was reached the runoff rate in the rt treatment differed from that in the ss treatment therefore we measured the intersection relationship of the cumulative curves between the rt and ss treatments fig 4b and c this approach has been used in many previous studies chu et al 2013 salem et al 2014 therefore during rainfall rt responds differently to rainfall leading to various chrs values in response to different periods of rainfall table 1 in this case the accumulated infiltration and surface depression storage on the tilled surface are dynamic and uncertain yang and chu 2015 this phenomenon represents a key reason why different changes in cumulative curves were detected for the rt and ss treatments in our experiment 5 conclusions the objectives of this study were to measure and analyse the effects of slope and rainfall intensity on the cumulative shr of soils subjected to rt the results suggested that unlike the ss treatment the rt treatment had complicated effects on the cumulative shr it seemed that rt was effective on 5 and 15 slopes but not the 25 slope however the cumulative shr generally decreased as the slope degree increased even given a twofold increase in rainfall intensity the cumulative shr for the rt treatment did not substantially improve at the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h relative to the ss treatment the rt treatment did not increase the cumulative shr when the soils had the same degree of slope therefore previous conclusions in which rt is an effective technique for increasing soil water and reducing soil erosion might not be accurate in the rt treatment the change in depression storage capacity due to sediment deposition was important if depressions are fully deposited by sediment the contribution of rt to srwh will disappear in future studies accurate surface depression storage calculations during changes in rainfall may be important for explaining the effects of rt on srwh acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the national natural

rainwater harvesting srwh is an important process in rainfed farming areas improving the capacity for srwh via tillage is essential in many parts of the world in recent years reservoir tillage rt has attracted attention because it was said that rt contributes to srwh the objectives of this study were to measure the cumulative soil harvested rainwater shr of slopes subjected to rt and to evaluate the contribution of rt to srwh under different rainfall conditions a smooth surface ss served as a control surface three slope degrees 5 15 and 25 were subjected to low and heavy 60 and 120 mm h and long term rainfall 90 min the results showed that the cumulative shr decreased to different extents under different rainfall intensities as the slope degree increased on the gentle slope 5 and under low rainfall intensity 60 mm h no significant differences in cumulative shr were detected between the rt and ss treatments whereas significant differences in cumulative shr were detected between them on the steep slopes 15 and 25 and under high rainfall intensity 120 mm h the differences in cumulative shr among the different conditions occurred because the contribution of rt to srwh varied as the soil surface properties changed especially as surface depression storage decreased due to sediment deposition under the conditions of long term rainfall for example on the 5 slope at a rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the contribution of rt to srwh was 18 58 during the 0 30 min rainfall stage but 14 84 during the 60 90 min stage resulting in nearly equal cumulative shr values between the rt slope and the ss slope our results suggest that rt is not necessary contribute to srwh in all cases keywords reservoir tillage rt slopes soil harvested rainwater shr soil rainwater harvesting srwh surface depression storage 1 introduction in arid and semiarid regions rainwater is the only source of soil water and is an important factor that limits land productivity vaezi and bahrami 2014 kurothe et al 2014 therefore reducing rainwater loss or surface runoff and improving the rainwater harvesting capacity of soils during rainfall via tillage techniques are essential in many parts of the world patrick et al 2007 salem et al 2014 araya et al 2016a 2016b tillage induced microtopography which increases surface depression storage significantly affects rainwater loss and sediment production during rainfall events in agricultural lands takken et al 2001 gómez et al 2003 cerdà et al 2009 microtopography can play a similar role as a mulch or vegetation cover in reducing surface runoff velocity and increasing infiltration rates keesstra et al 2012 prosdocimi et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 soil surface roughness ssr is an important parameter widely used to quantify the size of microtopographies kamphorst et al 2000 jester and klik 2005 several studies have shown that surface depression storage increases as ssr increases and vice versa onstad 1984 alvarez mozos et al 2011 a greater soil infiltration rate is generally associated with surfaces having greater ssr steichen 1984 however due to the spatial structural differences in the surface microtopographies subjected to different tillage techniques surface depression storage and soil infiltration strongly differ in terms of quantity under different circumstances su et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 some studies have suggested that tillage has a significant effect on srwh because the surface runoff is significantly delayed and the rainwater loss from the tilled surfaces is generally lower than that from smooth surfaces or untilled soils due to the collection of depressions guzha 2004 patrick et al 2007 salem et al 2014 this conclusion has served as an important basis for modelling soil erosion such as for models generated by the universal soil loss equation usle and by the water erosion prediction project wepp however several researchers have argued that compared with the effects of conservation tillage techniques such as no tillage the effects of traditional tillage techniques on the harvesting rainwater capacity of soils is limited because the latter reduces the anti erodibility of the topsoil moreno et al 1997 jin et al 2008 morris et al 2010 on tilled surfaces rill erosion occurs easily gómez et al 2003 once rill erosion has occurred rainwater stored in surface depressions is easily lost via rill networks during rainfall events in this case the role of surface depressions in increasing srwh diminishes systematic experimental studies of the effects of tillage on srwh on tilled surfaces are lacking reservoir tillage rt is widely used in many areas when planting crops on sloping lands such as the mediterranean region and the loess plateau of china patrick et al 2007 salem et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 this tillage technique leaves many mini depressions on the surface during rainfall these surface depressions retain rainwater and hence delay surface runoff during the early stage of rainfall events chu et al 2013 salem et al 2014 therefore the use of rt is also an important strategy for maintaining land productivity because it harvests large amounts natural rainwater in arid and semiarid environments and is highly supported by soil and water conservation management organizations in china the effects of the rt technique on soil erosion have recently been investigated patrick et al 2007 salem et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 patrick et al 2007 defined rt as a system in which numerous small surface depressions are formed to hold and collect water during rainfall to prevent rainwater loss salem et al 2014 suggested that compared with surfaces without depressions surfaces subjected to rt can reduce surface runoff by approximately 61 although these studies also evaluated the role of rt in srwh their results do not provide insight into the effects of rt on srwh or the underlying mechanisms moreover slope gradients significantly affect depression volume relationships between slope gradient and srwh have never been reported to further verify the effects of rt on the rainwater harvesting capacity of soils a laboratory experiment was conducted under simulated rainfall conditions we conducted a series of simulated rainfall events that persisted for a long 90 min duration on three different slope degrees and at two different intensities the objectives of this study were to measure the srwh of the surfaces subjected to rt and determine the changes in srwh in response to rainfall we predicted that the soils with rt would harvest higher amounts of rain than would the soils with smooth surfaces under rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river of china it covers a total area of 600 000 km2 and has a population of 82 million the annual average temperature is 8 3 c and the climate ranges from semiarid in the south to arid in the north the annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm in the northwest to 700 mm in the southwest and is distributed unevenly throughout the year he et al 2003 most rainstorms occur in summer when sudden storms with rainfall intensities of more than 100 mm h 1 are common therefore soil and water loss predominately occur during this season shi and shao 2000 rt is widely used on sloping farmland on the loess plateau of china usually rt is applied by hoeing from the bottom to the top of the slope forming many mini depressions on the surface the geometrical shape of the depressions is an approximate upside down cone the mean volume of a single depression is approximately 100 cm3 and the mean depth of a depression is approximately 4 cm zhao et al 2012 2 2 reservoir tillage preparation in soil boxes topsoil depth of 0 20 cm was collected from farmland 34 17 56 n 108 04 07 e in the study area the soil is classified as an eum orthic anthrosol and is a sandy clay loam consisting of 57 sand 18 silt and 25 clay the soil samples were air dried in the laboratory and then sieved through a 10 mm sieve to ensure homogeneity a soil box that was 2 0 m in length by 1 0 m in width by 0 5 m in depth was filled with the sieved soil in successive layers that were 0 05 m thick and the total thickness of the backfilled soil in the boxes was 0 4 m the bulk density of the soil layers in each box was 1 30 g cm3 which is close to the bulk density of natural soil layers under field conditions after filling the boxes with soil rt was simulated in the soil boxes at the downslope end of each box was a v shaped drainage outlet that was used to collect the rainwater lost surface runoff during rainfall fig 1 in this study a total of three slope degrees i e 5 15 and 25 were considered the simulated rt procedure in the soil boxes was the same for each slope degree a ss that was not tilled served as a control surface in this study 2 3 simulated rainfall procedure the rainfall simulator was equipped with a side spray nozzle that produced raindrops at a kinetic energy impact rate that was 80 of that of natural rainfall with a corresponding intensity the simulator nozzles were installed at a height of 6 m above the ground changes in rainfall intensity were controlled by adjusting the water pressure in the supply pipe two rainfall nozzles were placed 1 m in front and behind the runoff plots and the nozzles were positioned to face the soil surface and were located in the centre of each of the runoff plots before the rainfall applications eight gauges were evenly placed throughout the rainfall area to calibrate the rainfall intensity the results showed that the rainfall uniformity was greater than 90 which is greater than that of the local natural rainfall reported by wu et al 2011 the effective rainfall area was 7 m by 5 m rainfall intensities of 60 and 120 mm h were used and the rainfall duration was 90 min using this rainfall duration we obtained steady rates of surface runoff production for all the rainfall intensities during the rainfall experiments the runoff or rainwater loss from the surface was collected in 5 l plastic buckets an empty bucket was substituted at the collection point every 2 min after the rainfall events the samples in each bucket were weighed the weight of the sediment in each bucket was then measured after drying the sediment at 110 c for 12 h the runoff in the rt and ss treatments was calculated by subtracting the sediment weight and tare of bucket from the sample weight this runoff or rainwater loss was subsequently used to determine the cumulative shr of the rt and ss treatments during rainfall before and after rainfall the surface elevations were measured using a laser scanner zhang et al 2014 the measured spacing was 2 by 2 cm and approximately 3480 elevation points were obtained for each surface during each run these data were used to create a digital elevation model dem and to determine the changes in surface microtopography during rainfall a series of dems with a grid size of 2 mm were generated using arcgis 10 2 the main processes involved in the generation of the dem can be found elsewhere zhao et al 2016 for visualization of the surface microtopography surface depressions and their changes the elevation ranges of the dem were concerted to colour codes resulting in coloured surface microtopography maps helming et al 1998 for each surface depositional crust area maps based on before and after dems were derived using the cut fill tool in arcgis 10 2 these resulting maps served as a basis for discussing the experimental results 2 4 data analysis in this study shr represented the harvested rainwater of soils during rainfall the shr was calculated based on the principle of water balance as follows 1 i t p t q t e t where i t represents the shr at rainfall time t kg min t is the rainfall time min and p t q t and e t represent the rainfall rainwater loss and evaporation at time t respectively kg min in this study p t was 60 and 120 mm h q t is equal to the runoff which was measured at the downslope outlet during rainfall the measuring procedure of q t is described above and e t 0 because the experiment was conducted in the laboratory the contribution of rt to srwh was calculated using the following equation 2 i t o t a l t 0 t i r t t t 0 t i s s t t 0 t i s s t 100 where itotal represents the contribution of rt to srwh t is the rainfall time min t is the rainfall duration t 90 min and t 0 t i r t t and t 0 t i s s t represent the cumulative shr in the rt and ss treatments respectively kg the itotal was calculated as different time stages of 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 0 90 min this division occurred because rainwater loss or the runoff hydrograph tended to increase during 0 30 min representing the stage during which rainwater loss changed quickly during the 30 60 min stage the runoff hydrograph also changed albeit to a small extent during the 60 90 min stage the runoff hydrograph reached a steady state the data from the four stages were used to better understand the temporal changes in shr with rainfall time and the contributions of rt to srwh we used ms excel 10 0 for data arrangement and plot construction and the significance between different treatments at the p 0 05 level was determined with dps software version 17 10 a statistical analysis system presented by tang and zhang 2013 3 results 3 1 rainwater loss in this study rainwater loss increased as the slope degree increased fig 2 the differences in rainwater loss were significant between the rainfall events of 60 and 120 mm h intensities at the 60 mm h intensity the cumulative rainwater loss crl ranged from 79 46 to 109 20 kg and from 81 33 to 107 60 kg in the rt and ss treatments respectively no significant difference in crl was detected between the rt and ss treatments but the differences between the gentle 5 and steep slopes 15 and 25 within each treatment were significant however the differences in crl between the rt and ss treatments were significant on the steep slopes 15 and 25 when the rainfall intensity was 120 mm h moreover at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the rainwater loss was threefold greater than that at 60 mm h intensity for each of the three slopes 3 2 soil rainwater harvesting fig 3 shows the cumulative shr of the slopes under different rainfall conditions the duration of rainfall was 90 min for all experiments the cumulative shr decreased as the slope degree increased whereas the crl increased as the slope degree increased at the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h no significant difference in cumulative shr was detected between the rt and ss treatments within the same slope degree fig 3a however significant differences in cumulative shr were detected between the gentle i e 5 and steep slopes i e 15 and 25 the cumulative shr for the rt treatment was 104 54 kg on the 5 slope but 74 81 kg on the 25 slope at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the cumulative shr decreased as the slope degree increased but exhibited characteristics different from those at the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h fig 3b in addition to the significant differences in cumulative shr between the gentle and steep slopes significant differences were detected between the rt and ss treatments on the steep slopes i e 15 and 25 the cumulative shr in the rt treatment ranged from 61 72 to 104 59 kg at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the greatest cumulative shr in the rt treatment was detected on the 5 slope for both rainfall intensities and the smallest cumulative shr was detected on the 25 slope on the 25 slope the cumulative shr was significantly lower for the rainfall of 120 mm h than for the 60 mm h rainfall the results indicate that both slope degree and rainfall intensity affect srwh albeit to different extents under different rainfall conditions 3 3 cumulative curves of shr fig 4 shows the cumulative curves of shr after 90 min of rainfall rt ss 60 and 120 represent the two surface treatments and the two rainfall intensities respectively the greater the relative distance among the cumulative shr curves the greater the difference in cumulative shr among the different treatments cumulative curves of the rt treatment above those of the ss treatment would indicate that the soils in the rt treatment harvested more rainwater than did the ss soils that is rt improved shr cumulative curves in the opposite pattern would indicate that rt did not improve shr during the first 10 min after the beginning of rainfall all cumulative curves rapidly rose this result indicates that the rainfall harvesting capacity of the soils is greater during the early stage of rainfall than during the later stages this is true because there was no runoff generated on the surfaces and the rainwater loss was equal to zero in this study in other words the cumulative shr is equal to the cumulative rainfall as long as surface runoff is not generated from the slope in this case the cumulative shr depends on the cumulative rainfall the greater the rainfall intensity the greater the cumulative shr in our experiments we observed measurable runoff after 3 to 5 min from the slopes in the ss treatment and after 5 to 10 min from the slopes in the rt treatment the cumulative curves of shr for all rt treatments were above all those of the ss treatments before the generation of runoff in addition after the generation of runoff the relationship between the cumulative curves of the rt and ss treatments exhibited different characteristics this phenomenon may be related to the soil erosion processes occurring on the surface on the tilled surface surface microtopography will affect soil infiltration and rainwater loss and thus will affect soil erosion processes in turn soil erosion induced surface microtopography will subsequently affect srwh and rainwater loss the relative distance of cumulative curves between the rt and ss treatments varied with time for example at a rainfall intensity of 120 mm h the cumulative curves of the rt treatment were always above those of the ss treatment the rt 60 and ss 60 cumulative curves intersected at 60 70 min furthermore to better understand the effects of rt on srwh the contribution of rt to srwh was calculated with formula 2 for the four rainfall stages the results are listed in table 1 during the different rainfall stages the contributions of the rt technique to srwh differ three situations can be seen in table 1 1 in some of the stages the cumulative shr is less than zero while the total cumulative shr is greater than zero 2 in some of the stages the cumulative shr is greater than zero while the total cumulative shr is less than zero and 3 no significant trend was observed for the cumulative shr among the different slopes and between the rainfall intensities for example on the 5 slope the cumulative shr was 1 82 during the 0 90 min rainfall stage and was less than zero during the 30 60 and 60 90 min stages the cumulative shr at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h was significantly greater than that at the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h on each of the 15 and 25 slopes 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of soil rainwater harvesting the mechanism of soil rainwater harvesting is illustrated in fig 5 soil infiltration is the only source of srwh the horton flow theory states that all rainwater can become soil water until the soil infiltration becomes lower than the rainfall intensity and runoff is generated from the surface fig 5a this conclusion is consistent for the rt and ss slopes after the generation of runoff the runoff rate increased as the rainfall time increased while the soil infiltration rate decreased the increased runoff rate indicates increased rainwater loss and shr decreases accordingly however for soils subjected to rt in which depressions are left on the surface after tilling excess rainwater is first retained in the depression areas when the soil infiltration rate is lower than the rainfall intensity fig 5b and c this phenomenon will delay rainwater loss from soils subjected to rt and hence prolong the infiltration time this phenomenon will also increase the amount of rainwater infiltrated into soils therefore in theory under the same rainfall conditions the shr of a tilled surface is greater than that of a ss second tilled surfaces have a larger surface area or infiltration surface area than sss during rainfall over a larger area rainwater spreads over this larger area resulting in a low bulk density of the top layer soil and a high soil total porosity relative to those observed for smaller areas leading to high soil permeability and hence increasing shr cassel et al 1995 sun et al 2009 third on the tilled surface due to surface microtopographical impacts the flow length is longer than that on the ss therefore the rainwater that moved from the position at which it fell to the outlet of the tilled surface took longer than it did on the ss which also increases the opportunity for rainwater infiltration into soils effects of tillage on flow length have been investigated by helming et al 1998 and zhao and wu 2015 last and most importantly during rainfall rainwater collected in the surface depressions allows more time for infiltration after rainfall some of the rainwater collected in the surface depressions does not flow out onto the surface except for a small amount lost through evaporation that rainwater infiltrates the soils within a short time period fig 5d this phenomenon will increase the total amount of rainwater that infiltrates the soil salem et al 2014 the amount of rainwater stored in depressions after the cessation of rainfall depends on the final surface depression storage capacity if this capacity decreases little during rainfall the surface depression storage after rainfall differs little from that before rainfall and thus has a large contribution to the total amount of shr otherwise it has little or no contribution overall the above four methods represent the main mechanisms by which soils harvest rainwater on the tilled surface and together they affect srwh on the tilled surface 4 2 analysis of factors that influence soil rainwater harvesting the rt technique contributes to srwh in four ways as discussed above therefore influencing the abovementioned four ways will affect the rainwater harvesting capacity of soils subjected to rt treatment the main advantage of the rt technique is that the depressions created on the surface will retain a portion of the rainwater and allow it to infiltrate into the soil over time in previous tillage and soil erosion studies the amount of rainwater stored in the depression areas was referred to as surface depression storage onstad 1984 hansen et al 1999 planchon et al 2001 antoine et al 2012 and others most of those studies concluded that compared with the rainwater loss from sss the rainwater loss from tilled surfaces was delayed and soil infiltration increased due to depression storage freebairn et al 1989 zhao et al 2013 rocha junior et al 2016 a reason for this result as explained by fox et al 1998 is that rainwater that had collected in the surface depressions improves local water head pressure strengthening the infiltration rate however the surface depression storage decreased as the slope degree increased onstad 1984 in addition the effect of depressions on srwh is diminished on steep slopes this phenomenon is generally consistent with our finding that the cumulative shr decreased as the slope degree increased as shown in fig 3 soil crust is another indispensable factor that influences srwh although tillage techniques can improve soil infiltration they are not sustainable because a few rainfalls are enough to build up a new crust stroosnijder and hoogmoed 1984 mando et al 1996 sun et al 2009 surface crusts formed under rainfall are subject to raindrop impacts and sedimentary seals may directly reduce soil infiltration fox et al 1998 especially for the rt technique after the generation of surface runoff surface depressions can deposit sediment eroded by surface runoff from upslope regions and can form a thick depositional crust in water filled areas fig 5 this crust can reduce soil infiltration in depression areas burwell and larson 1969 pointed out that during simulated rainfall increases in tillage induced surface microtopography and pore space increased water infiltration before runoff started but did not significantly influence infiltration throughout a 5 cm runoff period strudley et al 2008 suggested that most tillage techniques have pronounced effects on soil hydraulic properties including soil infiltration immediately following tillage applications but that these effects can diminish rapidly similar results have also been reported by mohamoud et al 1990 and zhao et al 2013 under simulation rainfall conditions rill erosion is another factor that affects srwh surface depression storage not only depends on the initial volume of depressions on the surface but is also related to the surface change in space and time as runoff and sediment processes are prolonged surface elevation changes to low areas and flow paths may be well developed on the whole surface the development of flow paths will connect the original separated depressions to the outlet of the surface and ultimately form an integrated rill network visualizations of surfaces subjected to rt at a rainfall intensity of 60 mm h are presented in fig 6 the elevations obtained from the dem have been transformed into colour codes the same colour represents an approximate elevation from which runoff can flow each figure consists of three images that represent the initial surface after rt preparation left the changed surface after 90 min of rainfall middle and the depositional crust area red colour map right for each surface the relatively higher elevation was reduced due to rainfall erosion but the elevation in the depression area increased due to deposition impact after rainfall most importantly after rainfall the connected area of the same colour increased and formed a continuous area from the low edge of the slope to the middle upper part of the slope this represents the flow path of rainwater loss on the tilled surface during rainfall as reported by darboux et al 2001 this result suggests that flow connectivity increased and that most depressions connect at least once to the outflow boundary meaning that rainwater is easily lost in fact this result is consistent with the findings observed in some published laboratory and simulation studies helming et al 1998 römkens et al 2002 gómez et al 2003 liu and singh 2004 during the rill development stage tilled surfaces usually generate more runoff than they do during other stages souchere et al 1998 zhao et al 2018 that is the contribution of rt to srwh differs between before and after rill erosion liu et al 2014 suggested that rainwater loss increased by 55 8 from the rill erosion stage on contour ridge surfaces zhao et al 2018 reported that compared with the total runoff from a ss the total runoff from a tilled surface increased by 25 because of rill development at a later stage of rainfall in our experiments at a rainfall intensity of 120 mm h well developed flow paths and rill erosion were also visible after the later stage of the rainfall event in the rt treatment in this case rill erosion and flow concentration were apparently the dominant processes helming et al 1998 su et al 2015 compared with that on the relatively ss the increased flow concentration on the tilled surface translated into a decrease in cumulative shr because of the reduced surface depression storage of soils however our results also suggest that rt contributes differently to srwh during different rainfall stages table 1 this result may be related to the response of runoff generation to changes in flow connectivity darboux et al 2002 on the surfaces subjected to rt the initial depressions were not connected to each other as the rainfall time prolonged the depressions were filled by the additional rainwater and the water that began to flow out from the depressions contributed to the runoff due to differences in volume and flow distance of the depressions the contributions to runoff of each depression are different these differences will affect the contributions of rt to srwh during different rainfall stages darboux and huang 2005 pointed out that rainwater spilled from depressions can instantly increase rainwater losses by 10 chu et al 2013 systematically studied the effects of depressions on overall rainwater loss the authors suggested that rainwater loss is a depression to depression filling outflowing process fig 5b and c during the filling sub process rainwater loss is reduced whereas in the outflowing sub process rainwater loss is increased in the present case the amount of rainwater lost by surface runoff was variable because the filling and outflowing processes alternated during rainfall until all depressions were connected to the outlet of the slope the steady state of runoff is a common way to determine whether the runoff process is balanced darboux and huang 2005 zhao and wu 2015 if balanced all the depressions were connected otherwise they were not many previous studies have shown that for sss the runoff time generally reaches a steady state from 30 to 60 min gómez and nearing 2005 however in general compared with that of sss runoff rates on tilled surfaces differentially change over time because of the impact of surface microtopography and the runoff steady state requires a long time to achieve darboux et al 2002 liu et al 2014 this result is also consistent with the results of our experiment before the steady state of runoff was reached the runoff rate in the rt treatment differed from that in the ss treatment therefore we measured the intersection relationship of the cumulative curves between the rt and ss treatments fig 4b and c this approach has been used in many previous studies chu et al 2013 salem et al 2014 therefore during rainfall rt responds differently to rainfall leading to various chrs values in response to different periods of rainfall table 1 in this case the accumulated infiltration and surface depression storage on the tilled surface are dynamic and uncertain yang and chu 2015 this phenomenon represents a key reason why different changes in cumulative curves were detected for the rt and ss treatments in our experiment 5 conclusions the objectives of this study were to measure and analyse the effects of slope and rainfall intensity on the cumulative shr of soils subjected to rt the results suggested that unlike the ss treatment the rt treatment had complicated effects on the cumulative shr it seemed that rt was effective on 5 and 15 slopes but not the 25 slope however the cumulative shr generally decreased as the slope degree increased even given a twofold increase in rainfall intensity the cumulative shr for the rt treatment did not substantially improve at the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h relative to the ss treatment the rt treatment did not increase the cumulative shr when the soils had the same degree of slope therefore previous conclusions in which rt is an effective technique for increasing soil water and reducing soil erosion might not be accurate in the rt treatment the change in depression storage capacity due to sediment deposition was important if depressions are fully deposited by sediment the contribution of rt to srwh will disappear in future studies accurate surface depression storage calculations during changes in rainfall may be important for explaining the effects of rt on srwh acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the national natural

11077,partitioning between latent let and sensible h heat fluxes is critical in improving the greenhouse crops irrigation scheduling and microclimate by applying the bulk transfer bt and penman monteith pm models the energy fluxes in different growing stages of the cucumber crop were determined in a venlo type greenhouse the application of the bt and pm models is constrained by accurate parameterizations of canopy resistance rc and aerodynamic resistance ra in this paper we measured micrometeorological data crop growth index and let during cucumber growing seasons in spring and autumn of 2016 the rc was modelled with stomatal conductance of cucumber leaves and validated with actual measurement of let by lysimeters the results showed that rc varied from 35 s m 1 during the day to 500 s m 1 at night in spring season whilst it ranged from 40 s m 1 during the day to 1000 s m 1 at night in autumn season comparison of rc estimated by the pm and the bt models demonstrated that the rc estimated by the two methods were similar and highly correlated for both seasons during the spring season the pm and the bt models gave the determination coefficients r 2 of predicted hourly let equal to 0 94 and 0 83 whereas during the autumn season the values were 0 94 and 0 76 respectively the average root mean square errors rmse of measured and predicted hourly let were 96 97 and 74 74 w m 2 for the spring and autumn seasons for pm model respectively in contrast the bt model gave rmse of measured and predicted hourly let of 82 47 and 69 14 w m 2 for spring and autumn respectively the results also depicted that the simplified energy balance approach was a feasible alternative to partition the energy fluxes in the greenhouse the predictions made in this study would be an easy and relatively accurate way to partition greenhouse cucumber energy fluxes and thus scientifically plan the irrigation schedule in conclusion this study provides scientific basis for optimizing efficient water saving irrigation development of a suitable irrigation scheduling and improving crop water use efficiency in the greenhouse and consequently more energy savings by avoiding excessive water application and thereby the objective of having improved and satisfactory yield and higher economic returns can be achieved keywords canopy resistance energy balance latent heat flux spring autumn 1 introduction greenhouse farming also known as protected cultivation is a major farming system used globally to provide and maintain controlled environment suitable for optimum crop production resulting in maximising profits harmanto et al 2005 in this integrated production and protection greenhouse system cleaner crops are produced at better quality with less pesticide less water less land and more carefully directed fertilization compared to open field production impron 2011 this also allows all year crop production in regions where in open fields this is not possible baudoin and von zabeltitz 2002 irrigated greenhouse agriculture is particularly well served by an irrigation scheduling program that predicts when to irrigate and amount of water to apply rana et al 2011 acquah et al 2018 the latent heat let and sensible heat fluxes h are key variables in energy and water vapour exchanges between the crop surface and the atmospheric conditions within the greenhouse the partitioning between let and h is critical in improving and enhancing the greenhouse irrigation scheduling and microclimate wilson et al 2002 energy balance for agricultural systems involves let which is also expressed as evapotranspiration et let accounts for over 90 of water losses in field agriculture crop production luo et al 2012 yang et al 2016 li et al 2018 yan et al 2018a therefore accurate determination of let is an essential component for the appropriate management of water resources and irrigation scheduling yan et al 2012 lagos et al 2013 li et al 2014 a better knowledge and understanding of let is a good investigative tool to establish whether irrigation can be improved so as to use available water resource more productively and efficiently in order to avoid waste kite 2000 zhao et al 2013 yan et al 2018b yin et al 2018 one of the most appropriate technologies available for the measurement of let is the bowen ratio energy balance breb for continuous measurement of micrometeorological elements over extensive homogeneous surfaces throughout the growth season over the past 50 years in the open field jensen et al 1990 hussein 1999 ventura et al 1999 villa nova et al 2007 he et al 2009 however most greenhouse crops cannot be considered to be homogeneously distributed over the ground surface within the greenhouse due to the presence of access paths papadakis et al 1994 as a result the breb approach has limited uses in greenhouses the penman monteith pm and the bulk transfer bt models have been employed to identify and formulate many of the energy fluxes in greenhouse horticulture over the past decades boulard and jemaa 1993 takakura et al 2009 morille et al 2013 two resistances are required when using pm and bt models one is the aerodynamic resistance ra and the other is canopy resistance rc the ra is the resistance caused by vegetation to upward flow of water vapour depending on the friction between airflow and the vegetative surface while the rc describes the resistance of surface to water vapour through the stomatal openings which depends on total leaf area and soil surface monteith 1965 however the application of the pm and bt models is constrained by the accurate parameterization of rc a key variable in the models which is mostly influenced by climatological and agronomical variables like canopy structure modelling rc physically and mathematically has proved to be extremely difficult because it is under biological rather than physical control and hence the only practical option to its calculation is by means of empirical expressions katerji et al 2011 a number of complicated models have been developed to calculate rc and ra for the pm model in greenhouses kittas et al 1999 pirkner et al 2014 gong et al 2017 the rc estimated here is the true canopy stomatal resistance since its behaviour reflects that of the stomatal aperture baldocchi et al 1991 therefore the rc referred to hereafter should be considered as bulk stomatal resistance and represents the stomatal response of the big leaf used in this study hence the rc can be modelled with stomatal conductance of the cucumber leaves inside the greenhouse the actual measurement of let by lysimeter was used to validate the ra value and the constructed rc model there is lack of studies on energy flux partitioning based on actual measurement of let under greenhouse conditions consequently this study is based on the following hypothesis 1 that the greenhouse energy partitioning can be equated to that of the open field conditions when the heat transfer from the heating pipe system to the air inside greenhouse is neglected and 2 that the pm and bt models used mainly in open fields to partition energy fluxes are applicable under greenhouse conditions accordingly we parameterized ra and rc based on the semi empirical expression proposed by thom and oliver 1977 and stomatal conductance of cucumber leaves respectively the influences of ra and rc on the energy fluxes of a cucumber crop were then analysed based on the pm and bt models with the measured let by lysimeters and meteorological data inside the greenhouse evaluation of the accuracy of the pm and bt models and their overall let and h partitioning capabilities were checked with statistical tools the energy fluxes under greenhouse conditions based on actual measurement of let by lysimeters during spring and autumn growing seasons were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and test greenhouse structure the experiments

proper uniform mixture of soil and biochar in the soil boxes transplanting was done with a planting density equal to 6 63 per m2 evenly spaced at 0 40 m apart to ensure growth of transplanted seedlings all plants were immediately irrigated with 25 mm of water drip irrigation with spatial interval of the emitters in each drip tape being 35 cm was applied the designed discharge rate of each

p p2o5 and 5 of k k2o applied directly to the cucumber plants to measure the latent heat flux let of cucumbers inside the greenhouse cucumber plants one plant per lysimeter with similar planting

the size of the bucket is enough for the irrigation water movements at both vertical and horizontal directions the let was measured by three balances mettler toledo switzerland that worked on the load cell compensation principle of weighing lysimeters by weighing the decrease of the weight of the lysimeters with cucumbers the balances were located in the centre of the plots to form a continuous

canopy resistance rc the canopy resistance rc estimated here is the true canopy stomatal resistance since its behaviour reflects that of the stomatal aperture baldocchi et al 1991 the successful estimation of let to a large extent depends on the accurate modelling of rc by means of the bt or the pm model yan et al 2015 hence rc estimated in this study is considered as bulk stomatal resistance and represents the stomatal response of the big leaf the canopy resistance rc is estimated from the stomatal resistance rs as pirkner et al 2014 8 r c 2 r s l a i 9 r s p r e s s 0 001 g s r t l where

of agreement d were employed to validate the accuracy of the models used in this study the calculations are as follows yan et al 2018a 2018b 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n c i m i 2 1 2 11 m s e s 1 n i 1 n c ˆ

hourly let ĉ is the estimated hourly let from least square regression the mse s determines the linear or system error of the model and therefore the better the regression between the calculated and the measured values the smaller the systematic error the unsystematic difference measures the discrepancies between the calculated and the measured values which are due to random processes or influences from outside the legitimate range of the model low rmse values is an indication that the model is a good one capable of explaining most of the variations in the measured values the systematic error should be closer to zero whereas the unsystematic error should approach the rmse value the index of agreement d is a measure of the correlation between the departure of each calculated value from the measured mean and the departure of each measured value from the measured mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of cucumber leaf area index lai and plant height a total of 54 healthy leaves with representative shapes and sizes were selected from different plants for the determination of the relationship between the area of a cucumber leaf la and its length ll and width wl was obtained and the relation then was determined as 14 l a 0 859 i l w l 0 0968 where la is in m2 and ll and wl are both in m coefficient of determination r 2 of eq 14 was 0 97 the lai of the cucumber plant was obtained by summing up the area of all its leaves and then dividing the summation by the corresponding ground area yang 1988 the evolution of cucumber plant height and the lai are presented in fig 2 a b the cucumber plants at 80 95 dat reached maximum heights of 2 52 and 2 43 m and lai of 4 in spring and autumn respectively fig 2a b beyond this point there is only approximate estimate of the lai since further lai growth could be affected by pruning results similar to this study were reported by yang 1988 and medrano et al 2005 in greenhouse cucumber studies 3 2 variations of aerodynamic resistance ra and canopy resistance rc a fairly constant ra was observed across the cucumber growing stages in both seasons probably due to the relatively small variations in wind speed within the greenhouse in an attempt to improve the accuracy of the let predictions eqs 7 and 8 were used to determine the ra and the rc respectively upon determination of the hourly behaviour of the two resistances their corresponding averages were computed for the ra averages were found to be 60 2 s m 1 and 84 1 s m 1 for the spring and autumn respectively the average ra found for both planting seasons were in agreement with values previously reported in the literature for greenhouse microclimate conditions stanghellini 1987 zhang and lemeur 1992 the rc was estimated based on the stomatal conductance of cucumber leaves and with observations of meteorological conditions rs and vpd and the growing stages as discussed the rc were observed to be high particularly during the night to early morning and later afternoon hours for both growing seasons fig 3 a b the basic reason and explanation to this behaviour can be attributed to the stomatal closures during those periods of the day the stomata stay closed at night leading to higher resistances to the water vapour transfer under solar radiation during day hours the stomata open for photosynthesis thereby reducing in a dramatic manner the rc to the water vapour transfer villarreal guerrero et al 2011 wang et al 2018 we observed that the rc was low during the day increased rapidly at dusk and remained high during the night the general trend of the rc observed from both spring and autumn seasons was somewhat similar however the values for spring were lower compared to those of the autumn season an obvious reason for the larger rc in autumn may be due to the less intense radiation observed during the autumn the rc increased rapidly with decreasing rs because stomata began to close see fig 3a b the rc was calibrated and tested for both the bt and pm models and found to vary from 25 s m 1 during the day to 500 s m 1 at night for the spring season fig 3a the autumn season recorded higher rc varying from 40 s m 1 during the day to 1000s m 1 at night as presented in fig 3b the rc had considerable hourly variation and was smaller in spring compared to autumn fig 3a b from fig 3a b rc is smaller in the spring season compared to the autumn season this confirms that in reality rc changes with time of day and with time season of year and the findings in this study is quite close to the recommendations by allen et al 2006 as described elsewhere in the literature rana et al 1994 todorovic 1999 perez et al 2006 rc is small and tends to remain relatively constant on average from 08 00 to 14 00 from 14 00 rc tends to increase gradually in the afternoon as depicted in fig 3a b the values of ra were relatively lower than rc in the greenhouse as indicated in fig 3a b in fact it is the considered view of alves et al 1998 that rc has an indirect aerodynamic component although it is commonly assumed that it mainly represents a stomatal response this is because rc is the combined resistance of all the leaves as well as the soil surface and the resistance to vapour transfer inside the canopy from these surfaces up to the vegetation leaves stomata of a big leaf cucumber tended to be more sensitive to the decrease of rs under high vpd conditions as seen in fig 3a stomatal response to rs and vpd under conditions of high vpd indicates that the stomata remained open under the spring season fig 3a thus stomata of cucumber opens more actively in spring under conditions of high vpd in autumn the stomata remained closed under a wide range of rs under low vpd and closes rapidly as rs decreased fig 3b these results show that the stomatal aperture response to rs and vpd depends on the growing season of cucumber results obtained in this study were in good agreement with oue 2005 in a paddy rice study 3 3 hourly variations of energy balance and measured fluxes in the greenhouse average hourly climate data and the variations of energy fluxes and let on typical days for each growth stage for the experimental period are presented in figs 4a d and 5 a d each data point in the figures represents an average from the hours within the days randomly chosen corresponding to each season experimented in this study for spring season fig 4a d typical non consecutive days randomly selected to analyze the energy fluxes in different growth stages were initial 10 days development 11 days mid season 11 and late season 12 days the energy flux in the greenhouse was characterized by the major partitioning to let as shown in figs 4a d and 5 a d net radiation rn varied from 6 86 to 726 90 w m 2 from 06 00 to 18 00 with the maximum rn ranging from 621 50 to 726 90 w m 2 let the main component of rn was typically near zero at night and ranged from 6 15 to 666 66 w m 2 with the average ratios of let to rn being 91 7 91 5 88 7 and 88 3 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively soil heat fluxes g measured were 74 0 51 65 61 25 and 74 45 w m 2 with their corresponding minimum values of 36 83 18 35 10 62 and 18 47 w m 2 respectively for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages average ratio of g to rn were 10 18 8 64 11 44 and 11 98 for initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively sensible heat flux h estimated from eq 5 was typically negative and low between 17 00 to 07 00 during the initial and development growth stages in the spring season however this trend changed in the mid season to late season growth stages and the maximum values recorded were 1 09 1 27 1 74 and 2 24 w m 2 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages with their corresponding minimum values as 1 21 1 23 0 94 and 0 27 w m 2 respectively h to rn ratio were 0 15 0 21 0 33 and 0 36 for the respective growth stages for the autumn season the typical non consecutive days randomly selected were initial 10 days development 14 days mid season 17 days and late season growth stages 7 days during the autumn season the energy flux was characterized by the major partitioning to let with relatively low rn let and g as shown in fig 5a d rn recorded between 06 00 to 18 00 ranged from 52 99 to 253 80 w m 2 with the maximum varying between 225 40 to 253 80 w m 2 let varied from 59 09 to 196 25 w m 2 with average ratios of let to rn as 67 2 62 8 77 3 and 73 7 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively maximum g measured were 77 21 78 43 83 21 and 89 9 w m 2 with corresponding minimum values of 8 13 34 18 33 55 and 39 87 w m 2 respectively for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages average ratio of g to rn were 107 91 86 09 32 79 and 39 88 for initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively h was mostly positive and tended to increase appreciably from the morning till the midday average maximum h in the greenhouse were 1 46 0 97 2 35 and 2 94 w m 2 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively with their corresponding minimum values as 0 04 0 01 0 01 and 0 08 w m 2 h to rn ratios were 2 04 1 06 0 93 and 1 30 for the respective growth stages the term δw was estimated from the average depth at which the soil heat flux plates were installed below the ground beneath the cucumber crop canopy and the value of the term w in figs 4a d and 5 a d is very low and near to 0 in all the seasons estimated the maximum amount of energy available rn g either to evaporate water or to heat the surface air within the greenhouse was 667 03 w m 2 at the initial growth stage during the spring season the maximum rn g for the development mid season and late season growth stages were 548 29 475 95 and 556 17 w m 2 respectively the minimum rn g were 5 95 5 52 2 98 and 8 71 w m 2 with the corresponding averages of 158 89 134 86 81 02 and 159 83 w m 2 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively the heat fluxes were evaluated for each growth stage within each season directly from mean hourly trends excluding nocturnal periods maximum amount of energy consumed let h in the greenhouse was 666 67 w m 2 which apparently occurred during the initial growth stage the development mid season and late season growth stages consumed energy amounts of 548 32 476 51 and 550 67 w m 2 with the minimum energy fluxes of 5 64 5 27 2 97 and 8 62 w m 2 respectively maximum rn g for autumn was 200 11 w m 2 during the mid season growth stage with a minimum of 33 54 w m 2 rn g for the initial development and the late season growth stages were 50 87 59 30 and 169 19 w m 2 with the corresponding minimum values of 6 48 56 75 and 19 95 w m 2 respectively the energy consumed let h was at its peak in the greenhouse at 198 42 w m 2 occurring during the mid season growth stage the initial development and late season growth stages consumed cumulative energy amounts of 48 44 57 69 and 168 45 w m 2 having the average minimum energy fluxes of 8 73 58 76 and 20 78 w m 2 respectively the data indicated that global solar net radiation and let in autumn were 35 and 29 lower than in spring in contrast g in the greenhouse during the autumn season was 120 that of the spring season accordingly the let in the greenhouse during the spring season was significantly higher than that of the autumn season as presented in fig 4a d and fig 5a d from the description of let for bt and pm models in eqs 4 and 6 respectively it follows that both contain at least one parameter which can be determined by soil and plant factors these are ra rc rn and g in the pm model and ra and rc in the bt model generally these quantities depend on many factors like availability of soil moisture stage of development of the plant canopy concentration of co2 irradiance etc oue 2001 jarvis 1976 modelled canopy resistance rc with five main environmental factors namely rs ta rh co2 concentration and soil water potential by scaling up rs to rc hence appropriate rc values for each growth stage in each experimental season were estimated in this study for the purposes of comparing the models under consideration for the model comparison the strategy is to first adjust the model parameters for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages and then evaluate the greenhouse surface energy fluxes with the bt and the pm models finally a comparison will be made with the measured fluxes using meteorological data inside the greenhouse 3 4 comparison of rc estimated by the two methods comparison of rc estimated by the bt model eq 4 and the pm model eq 6 are shown in fig 6 a b for spring and autumn respectively these values were estimated hourly from 06 00 to 18 00 the comparison demonstrated that rc estimated by each method are similar and highly correlated for the two seasons according to oue 2005 the pm equation provides a more practical approach because ts is not needed while the bt equation is more accurate in this study the rc was estimated from the stomatal resistance rs as derived from the stomatal conductance gs measured on 10 may and 21 october 2016 for the spring and autumn seasons respectively using eqs 1 8 and 9 3 5 calculation of hourly let by the bt and pm models the leaf stomatal resistance is an important parameter in the determination of the rc and depends on a number of environmental factors stanghellini 1987 reported that rs vpd ta and co2 concentration affected the stomatal resistance of greenhouse tomatoes similar to earlier studies which suggested that stomatal resistance strongly depends on vpd e g watts 1975 baldocchi et al 1985 choudhury and idso 1985 the semi empirical expression for rc in this study was arrived at from the empirical evidences adduced by researchers e g stanghellini 1987 oue 2005 allen et al 2006 jahani et al 2017 and the assumption that vpd and rs are functions of ta and rn respectively the let of the cucumber crop in the greenhouse was measured by the weighing lysimeters and also estimated with the bt and pm models the models were validated using data from the two seasons in this study daily values of measured and calculated let showing the four growth stages of cucumber crop and the two growing seasons of spring and autumn are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively this is a comparison between let measured by the weighing lysimeters and calculated let by the bt and the pm methods during the entire spring season there was a high correlation between the let calculated by the bt and the pm methods let measured by the lysimeters was significantly p 0 01 lower compared to the let calculated by the bt and pm methods however there was no significant difference p 0 01 between let measured by lysimeters and the let calculated by bt and pm methods in autumn until the mid season and late season growth stages from the mid season to late season growth stages in autumn the let calculated by the bt and pm methods exhibited some significant difference p 0 01 compared to the let measured by the lysimeters this observation could probably be due to the high global solar radiation experienced during the entire spring season and also from the mid season to the late season growth stages in autumn furthermore the let calculated by pm method showed significant difference p 0 01 during the mid season to late season growth stages in autumn because net radiation is a function of the pm model the coefficients of determination r 2 between measured and calculated let by the pm model during the spring and autumn periods were 0 94 and 0 94 respectively table 3 however the bt model showed slightly lower correlations between measured and calculated let and the r 2 were 0 83 and 0 76 for the spring and autumn seasons respectively the results of this study indicated that let could be estimated by the pm model as well as the bt model using rc estimated by the stomatal resistance derived from the stomatal conductance of the greenhouse cucumbers on one hand the rmse were equal to 96 97 and 74 74 w m 2 respectively for the let calculated by the pm method and that measured by the lysimeter for the spring and autumn periods on the other hand there was good agreement between measured and calculated let by the bt equation with rmse equal to 81 62 and 69 14 w m 2 respectively during the spring and autumn table 3 also shows the other error analysis statistics of the comparison between measured and calculated let by the bt and the pm methods for the spring and autumn growth seasons the statistical tools showed that the pm model performed better both in the spring and autumn growth seasons but the performance of the bt equation declined during the autumn probably due to reduced radiation culminating in lower let in the greenhouse comparing the performances of the two models using the spring and autumn datasets it is obvious that pm is preferred by all statistical measures in this study the pm is also robust in both the spring and autumn growing seasons whereas the bt equation underperformed during the autumn season even though the bt equation is more accurate as reported by oue 2005 the two methods gave higher index of agreement d of 0 92 and 0 88 during the spring whilst in autumn the values were 0 82 and 0 72 for pm and bt respectively the reasons might not only be that the pm model has the advantage of taking into account the set of climatic variables affecting rc rn vpd but also its robustness in arid semi arid and humid environments the average absolute errors between lysimeter measured and calculated let by the pm equation were 92 12 w m 2 and 73 17 w m 2 while the average absolute errors between lysimeter measured and calculated let by the bt method were 99 46 w m 2 and 74 53 w m 2 respectively for the spring and autumn growing seasons the relative errors between lysimeter measured and calculated let by the pm method were 21 16 and 12 51 whilst the relative errors were 29 and 16 52 for the bt equation respectively for the spring and autumn growth seasons the other statistical parameters such as systematic mean square errors mse s unsystematic mean square errors mse u and index of agreement d and slope of least square regression line a are presented in table 3 generally greenhouse structures reduce light transmission so rn is reduced and because wind speed is nearly 0 and rh is often higher let is lower in the greenhouse compared with open field conditions these factors affect crop energy partitioning in the greenhouse and hence partitioning rn into let and h by micrometeorological factors is most appropriate thus using micrometeorological approaches inside the greenhouse to partition cucumber crop energy offers a scientific approach aimed to highlight greenhouse innovations and act as a catalyst to inspire scientific basis for optimizing efficient water saving irrigation development of a suitable irrigation scheduling and improving crop water use efficiency the theory of using micrometeorological methods to calculate let under greenhouse conditions provides the scientific basis for controlling the greenhouse microclimate for optimum yield with better quality through efficient water management and energy savings by avoiding excessive water application and thus achieving the objective of improved and satisfactory yield and higher economic returns 4 conclusions in this study we applied the pm and the bt methods to calculate the heat fluxes let and h in a greenhouse grown with cucumber for spring and autumn growth seasons an empirical model of stomatal resistance based on the stomatal conductance was developed in order to calculate rc while r a was determined using the semi empirical expression proposed by thom and oliver 1977 by estimating the rc modelled using the stomatal conductance inside the greenhouse the rc computed by the pm and the bt equations were compared and found there were good agreements between the two methods in both spring and autumn growing seasons this study showed that within the greenhouse the hourly energy fluxes of the growth stages of cucumber for two growing seasons can appropriately be described using the pm and the bt models under the local greenhouse conditions and the meteorological data generated during the experiments let measurements obtained by the weighing lysimeters gave practically identical estimates which were in good agreements with those obtained by the pm model the simplified energy balance approach was a feasible alternative to partition the energy fluxes and hence irrigation scheduling in the greenhouse the statistical analysis revealed that the let could be reproduced by both the pm model and the bt equation with the rc sub model the predictions made in this study would be an easy and relatively accurate way to partition greenhouse cucumber energy fluxes and thus the appropriate irrigation schedule could be made the findings in this research were based on observational data from the greenhouse and were considered representative for the venlo type greenhouses in order to confirm that our findings are transferrable to other greenhouse types more observational data from different greenhouses and further analyses in related research studies are recommended in

11077,partitioning between latent let and sensible h heat fluxes is critical in improving the greenhouse crops irrigation scheduling and microclimate by applying the bulk transfer bt and penman monteith pm models the energy fluxes in different growing stages of the cucumber crop were determined in a venlo type greenhouse the application of the bt and pm models is constrained by accurate parameterizations of canopy resistance rc and aerodynamic resistance ra in this paper we measured micrometeorological data crop growth index and let during cucumber growing seasons in spring and autumn of 2016 the rc was modelled with stomatal conductance of cucumber leaves and validated with actual measurement of let by lysimeters the results showed that rc varied from 35 s m 1 during the day to 500 s m 1 at night in spring season whilst it ranged from 40 s m 1 during the day to 1000 s m 1 at night in autumn season comparison of rc estimated by the pm and the bt models demonstrated that the rc estimated by the two methods were similar and highly correlated for both seasons during the spring season the pm and the bt models gave the determination coefficients r 2 of predicted hourly let equal to 0 94 and 0 83 whereas during the autumn season the values were 0 94 and 0 76 respectively the average root mean square errors rmse of measured and predicted hourly let were 96 97 and 74 74 w m 2 for the spring and autumn seasons for pm model respectively in contrast the bt model gave rmse of measured and predicted hourly let of 82 47 and 69 14 w m 2 for spring and autumn respectively the results also depicted that the simplified energy balance approach was a feasible alternative to partition the energy fluxes in the greenhouse the predictions made in this study would be an easy and relatively accurate way to partition greenhouse cucumber energy fluxes and thus scientifically plan the irrigation schedule in conclusion this study provides scientific basis for optimizing efficient water saving irrigation development of a suitable irrigation scheduling and improving crop water use efficiency in the greenhouse and consequently more energy savings by avoiding excessive water application and thereby the objective of having improved and satisfactory yield and higher economic returns can be achieved keywords canopy resistance energy balance latent heat flux spring autumn 1 introduction greenhouse farming also known as protected cultivation is a major farming system used globally to provide and maintain controlled environment suitable for optimum crop production resulting in maximising profits harmanto et al 2005 in this integrated production and protection greenhouse system cleaner crops are produced at better quality with less pesticide less water less land and more carefully directed fertilization compared to open field production impron 2011 this also allows all year crop production in regions where in open fields this is not possible baudoin and von zabeltitz 2002 irrigated greenhouse agriculture is particularly well served by an irrigation scheduling program that predicts when to irrigate and amount of water to apply rana et al 2011 acquah et al 2018 the latent heat let and sensible heat fluxes h are key variables in energy and water vapour exchanges between the crop surface and the atmospheric conditions within the greenhouse the partitioning between let and h is critical in improving and enhancing the greenhouse irrigation scheduling and microclimate wilson et al 2002 energy balance for agricultural systems involves let which is also expressed as evapotranspiration et let accounts for over 90 of water losses in field agriculture crop production luo et al 2012 yang et al 2016 li et al 2018 yan et al 2018a therefore accurate determination of let is an essential component for the appropriate management of water resources and irrigation scheduling yan et al 2012 lagos et al 2013 li et al 2014 a better knowledge and understanding of let is a good investigative tool to establish whether irrigation can be improved so as to use available water resource more productively and efficiently in order to avoid waste kite 2000 zhao et al 2013 yan et al 2018b yin et al 2018 one of the most appropriate technologies available for the measurement of let is the bowen ratio energy balance breb for continuous measurement of micrometeorological elements over extensive homogeneous surfaces throughout the growth season over the past 50 years in the open field jensen et al 1990 hussein 1999 ventura et al 1999 villa nova et al 2007 he et al 2009 however most greenhouse crops cannot be considered to be homogeneously distributed over the ground surface within the greenhouse due to the presence of access paths papadakis et al 1994 as a result the breb approach has limited uses in greenhouses the penman monteith pm and the bulk transfer bt models have been employed to identify and formulate many of the energy fluxes in greenhouse horticulture over the past decades boulard and jemaa 1993 takakura et al 2009 morille et al 2013 two resistances are required when using pm and bt models one is the aerodynamic resistance ra and the other is canopy resistance rc the ra is the resistance caused by vegetation to upward flow of water vapour depending on the friction between airflow and the vegetative surface while the rc describes the resistance of surface to water vapour through the stomatal openings which depends on total leaf area and soil surface monteith 1965 however the application of the pm and bt models is constrained by the accurate parameterization of rc a key variable in the models which is mostly influenced by climatological and agronomical variables like canopy structure modelling rc physically and mathematically has proved to be extremely difficult because it is under biological rather than physical control and hence the only practical option to its calculation is by means of empirical expressions katerji et al 2011 a number of complicated models have been developed to calculate rc and ra for the pm model in greenhouses kittas et al 1999 pirkner et al 2014 gong et al 2017 the rc estimated here is the true canopy stomatal resistance since its behaviour reflects that of the stomatal aperture baldocchi et al 1991 therefore the rc referred to hereafter should be considered as bulk stomatal resistance and represents the stomatal response of the big leaf used in this study hence the rc can be modelled with stomatal conductance of the cucumber leaves inside the greenhouse the actual measurement of let by lysimeter was used to validate the ra value and the constructed rc model there is lack of studies on energy flux partitioning based on actual measurement of let under greenhouse conditions consequently this study is based on the following hypothesis 1 that the greenhouse energy partitioning can be equated to that of the open field conditions when the heat transfer from the heating pipe system to the air inside greenhouse is neglected and 2 that the pm and bt models used mainly in open fields to partition energy fluxes are applicable under greenhouse conditions accordingly we parameterized ra and rc based on the semi empirical expression proposed by thom and oliver 1977 and stomatal conductance of cucumber leaves respectively the influences of ra and rc on the energy fluxes of a cucumber crop were then analysed based on the pm and bt models with the measured let by lysimeters and meteorological data inside the greenhouse evaluation of the accuracy of the pm and bt models and their overall let and h partitioning capabilities were checked with statistical tools the energy fluxes under greenhouse conditions based on actual measurement of let by lysimeters during spring and autumn growing seasons were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and test greenhouse structure the experiments were conducted in a venlo type greenhouse at the school of agricultural equipment engineering greenhouse located at jiangsu university 32 11 n 119 25 e zhenjiang city jiangsu province china from april

proper uniform mixture of soil and biochar in the soil boxes transplanting was done with a planting density equal to 6 63 per m2 evenly spaced at 0 40 m apart to ensure growth of transplanted seedlings all plants were immediately irrigated with 25 mm of water drip irrigation with spatial interval of the emitters in each drip tape being 35 cm was applied the designed discharge rate of each drip tape was 100 ml min drip surface irrigation application was initiated 3 days after transplanting dat together with 200 ppm aodeli fertilizer solution corresponding to 25 n as urea with 46 n 5 of p p2o5 and 5 of k k2o applied directly to the cucumber plants to measure the latent heat flux let of cucumbers inside the greenhouse cucumber plants one plant per lysimeter with similar planting density as that of the soil box were transplanted into 3 lysimeters 30 cm in diameter and 50 cm in depth we applied drip surface irrigation and based on our calculation and observation in this study the size of the bucket is enough for the irrigation water movements at both vertical and horizontal directions the let was measured by three balances mettler toledo switzerland that worked on the load cell compensation principle of weighing lysimeters by weighing the decrease of the weight of the lysimeters with cucumbers the balances were located in the centre of the plots to form a continuous

canopy resistance rc the canopy resistance rc estimated here is the true canopy stomatal resistance since its behaviour reflects that of the stomatal aperture baldocchi et al 1991 the successful estimation of let to a large extent depends on the accurate modelling of rc by means of the bt or the pm model yan et al 2015 hence rc estimated in this study is considered as bulk stomatal resistance

hourly let ĉ is the estimated hourly let from least square regression the mse s determines the linear or system error of the model and therefore the better the regression between the calculated and the measured values the smaller the systematic error the unsystematic difference measures the discrepancies between the calculated and the measured values which are due to random processes or influences from outside the legitimate range of the model low rmse values is an indication that the model is a good one capable of explaining most of the variations in the measured values the systematic error should be closer to zero whereas the unsystematic error should approach the rmse value the index of agreement d is a measure of the correlation between the departure of each calculated value from the measured mean and the departure of each measured value from the measured mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of cucumber leaf area index lai and plant height a total of 54 healthy leaves with representative shapes and sizes were selected from different plants for the determination of the relationship between the area of a cucumber leaf la and its length ll and width wl was obtained and the relation then was determined as 14 l a 0 859 i l w l 0 0968 where la is in m2 and ll and wl are both in m coefficient of determination r 2 of eq 14 was 0 97 the lai of the cucumber plant was obtained by summing up the area of all its leaves and then dividing the summation by the corresponding ground area yang 1988 the evolution of cucumber plant height and the lai are presented in fig 2 a b the cucumber plants at 80 95 dat reached maximum heights of 2 52 and 2 43 m and lai of 4 in spring and autumn respectively fig 2a b beyond this point there is only approximate estimate of the lai since further lai growth could be affected by pruning results similar to this study were reported by yang 1988 and medrano et al 2005 in greenhouse cucumber studies 3 2 variations of aerodynamic resistance ra and canopy resistance rc a fairly constant ra was observed across the cucumber growing stages in both seasons probably due to the relatively small variations in wind speed within the greenhouse in an attempt to improve the accuracy of the let predictions eqs 7 and 8 were used to determine the ra and the rc respectively upon determination of the hourly behaviour of the two resistances their corresponding averages were computed for the ra averages were found to be 60 2 s m 1 and 84 1 s m 1 for the spring and autumn respectively the average ra found for both planting seasons were in agreement with values previously reported in the literature for greenhouse microclimate conditions stanghellini 1987 zhang and lemeur 1992 the rc was estimated based on the stomatal conductance of cucumber leaves and with observations of meteorological conditions rs and vpd and the growing stages as discussed the rc were observed to be high particularly during the night to early morning and later afternoon hours for both growing seasons fig 3 a b the basic reason and explanation to this behaviour can be attributed to the stomatal closures during those periods of the day the stomata stay closed at night leading to higher resistances to the water vapour transfer under solar radiation during day hours the stomata open for photosynthesis thereby reducing in a dramatic manner the rc to the water vapour transfer villarreal guerrero et al 2011 wang et al 2018 we observed that the rc was low during the day increased rapidly at dusk and remained high during the night the general trend of the rc observed from both spring and autumn seasons was somewhat similar however the values for spring were lower compared to those of the autumn season an obvious reason for the larger rc in autumn may be due to the less intense radiation observed during the autumn the rc increased rapidly with decreasing rs because stomata began to close see fig 3a b the rc was calibrated and tested for both the bt and pm models and found to vary from 25 s m 1 during the day to 500 s m 1 at night for the spring season fig 3a the autumn season recorded higher rc varying from 40 s m 1 during the day to 1000s m 1 at night as presented in fig 3b the rc had considerable hourly variation and was smaller in spring compared to autumn fig 3a b from fig 3a b rc is smaller in the spring season compared to the autumn season this confirms that in reality rc changes with time of day and with time season of year and the findings in this study is quite close to the recommendations by allen et al 2006 as described elsewhere in the literature rana et al 1994 todorovic 1999 perez et al 2006 rc is small and tends to remain relatively constant on average from 08 00 to 14 00 from 14 00 rc tends to increase gradually in the afternoon as depicted in fig 3a b the values of ra were relatively lower than rc in the greenhouse as indicated in fig 3a b in fact it is the considered view of alves et al 1998 that rc has an indirect aerodynamic component although it is commonly assumed that it mainly represents a stomatal response this is because rc is the combined resistance of all the leaves as well as the soil surface and the resistance to vapour transfer inside the canopy from these surfaces up to the vegetation leaves stomata of a big leaf cucumber tended to be more sensitive to the decrease of rs under high vpd conditions as seen in fig 3a stomatal response to rs and vpd under conditions of high vpd indicates that the stomata remained open under the spring season fig 3a thus stomata of cucumber opens more actively in spring under conditions of high vpd in autumn the stomata remained closed under a wide range of rs under low vpd and closes rapidly as rs decreased fig 3b these results show that the stomatal aperture response to rs and vpd depends on the growing season of cucumber results obtained in this study were in good agreement with oue 2005 in a paddy rice study 3 3 hourly variations of energy balance and measured fluxes in the greenhouse average hourly climate data and the variations of energy fluxes and let on typical days for each growth stage for the experimental period are presented in figs 4a d and 5 a d each data point in the figures represents an average from the hours within the days randomly chosen corresponding to each season experimented in this study for spring season fig 4a d typical non consecutive days randomly selected to analyze the energy fluxes in different growth stages were initial 10 days development 11 days mid season 11 and late season 12 days the energy flux in the greenhouse was characterized by the major partitioning to let as shown in figs 4a d and 5 a d net radiation rn varied from 6 86 to 726 90 w m 2 from 06 00 to 18 00 with the maximum rn ranging from 621 50 to 726 90 w m 2 let the main component of rn was typically near zero at night and ranged from 6 15 to 666 66 w m 2 with the average ratios of let to rn being 91 7 91 5 88 7 and 88 3 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively soil heat fluxes g measured were 74 0 51 65 61 25 and 74 45 w m 2 with their corresponding minimum values of 36 83 18 35 10 62 and 18 47 w m 2 respectively for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages average ratio of g to rn were 10 18 8 64 11 44 and 11 98 for initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively sensible heat flux h estimated from eq 5 was typically negative and low between 17 00 to 07 00 during the initial and development growth stages in the spring season however this trend changed in the mid season to late season growth stages and the maximum values recorded were 1 09 1 27 1 74 and 2 24 w m 2 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages with their corresponding minimum values as 1 21 1 23 0 94 and 0 27 w m 2 respectively h to rn ratio were 0 15 0 21 0 33 and 0 36 for the respective growth stages for the autumn season the typical non consecutive days randomly selected were initial 10 days development 14 days mid season 17 days and late season growth stages 7 days during the autumn season the energy flux was characterized by the major partitioning to let with relatively low rn let and g as shown in fig 5a d rn recorded between 06 00 to 18 00 ranged from 52 99 to 253 80 w m 2 with the maximum varying between 225 40 to 253 80 w m 2 let varied from 59 09 to 196 25 w m 2 with average ratios of let to rn as 67 2 62 8 77 3 and 73 7 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively maximum g measured were 77 21 78 43 83 21 and 89 9 w m 2 with corresponding minimum values of 8 13 34 18 33 55 and 39 87 w m 2 respectively for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages average ratio of g to rn were 107 91 86 09 32 79 and 39 88 for initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively h was mostly positive and tended to increase appreciably from the morning till the midday average maximum h in the greenhouse were 1 46 0 97 2 35 and 2 94 w m 2 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively with their corresponding minimum values as 0 04 0 01 0 01 and 0 08 w m 2 h to rn ratios were 2 04 1 06 0 93 and 1 30 for the respective growth stages the term δw was estimated from the average depth at which the soil heat flux plates were installed below the ground beneath the cucumber crop canopy and the value of the term w in figs 4a d and 5 a d is very low and near to 0 in all the seasons estimated the maximum amount of energy available rn g either to evaporate water or to heat the surface air within the greenhouse was 667 03 w m 2 at the initial growth stage during the spring season the maximum rn g for the development mid season and late season growth stages were 548 29 475 95 and 556 17 w m 2 respectively the minimum rn g were 5 95 5 52 2 98 and 8 71 w m 2 with the corresponding averages of 158 89 134 86 81 02 and 159 83 w m 2 for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages respectively the heat fluxes were evaluated for each growth stage within each season directly from mean hourly trends excluding nocturnal periods maximum amount of energy consumed let h in the greenhouse was 666 67 w m 2 which apparently occurred during the initial growth stage the development mid season and late season growth stages consumed energy amounts of 548 32 476 51 and 550 67 w m 2 with the minimum energy fluxes of 5 64 5 27 2 97 and 8 62 w m 2 respectively maximum rn g for autumn was 200 11 w m 2 during the mid season growth stage with a minimum of 33 54 w m 2 rn g for the initial development and the late season growth stages were 50 87 59 30 and 169 19 w m 2 with the corresponding minimum values of 6 48 56 75 and 19 95 w m 2 respectively the energy consumed let h was at its peak in the greenhouse at 198 42 w m 2 occurring during the mid season growth stage the initial development and late season growth stages consumed cumulative energy amounts of 48 44 57 69 and 168 45 w m 2 having the average minimum energy fluxes of 8 73 58 76 and 20 78 w m 2 respectively the data indicated that global solar net radiation and let in autumn were 35 and 29 lower than in spring in contrast g in the greenhouse during the autumn season was 120 that of the spring season accordingly the let in the greenhouse during the spring season was significantly higher than that of the autumn season as presented in fig 4a d and fig 5a d from the description of let for bt and pm models in eqs 4 and 6 respectively it follows that both contain at least one parameter which can be determined by soil and plant factors these are ra rc rn and g in the pm model and ra and rc in the bt model generally these quantities depend on many factors like availability of soil moisture stage of development of the plant canopy concentration of co2 irradiance etc oue 2001 jarvis 1976 modelled canopy resistance rc with five main environmental factors namely rs ta rh co2 concentration and soil water potential by scaling up rs to rc hence appropriate rc values for each growth stage in each experimental season were estimated in this study for the purposes of comparing the models under consideration for the model comparison the strategy is to first adjust the model parameters for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages and then evaluate the greenhouse surface energy fluxes with the bt and the pm models finally a comparison will be made with the measured fluxes using meteorological data inside the greenhouse 3 4 comparison of rc estimated by the two methods comparison of rc estimated by the bt model eq 4 and the pm model eq 6 are shown in fig 6 a b for spring and autumn respectively these values were estimated hourly from 06 00 to 18 00 the comparison demonstrated that rc estimated by each method are similar and highly correlated for the two seasons according to oue 2005 the pm equation provides a more practical approach because ts is not needed while the bt equation is more accurate in this study the rc was estimated from the stomatal resistance rs as derived from the stomatal conductance gs measured on 10 may and 21 october 2016 for the spring and autumn seasons respectively using eqs 1 8 and 9 3 5 calculation of hourly let by the bt and pm models the leaf stomatal resistance is an important parameter in the determination of the rc and depends on a number of environmental factors stanghellini 1987 reported that rs vpd ta and co2 concentration affected the stomatal resistance of greenhouse tomatoes similar to earlier studies which suggested that stomatal resistance strongly depends on vpd e g watts 1975 baldocchi et al 1985 choudhury and idso 1985 the semi empirical expression for rc in this study was arrived at from the empirical evidences adduced by researchers e g stanghellini 1987 oue 2005 allen et al 2006 jahani et al 2017 and the assumption that vpd and rs are functions of ta and rn respectively the let of the cucumber crop in the greenhouse was measured by the weighing lysimeters and also estimated with the bt and pm models the models were validated using data from the two seasons in this study daily values of measured and calculated let showing the four growth stages of cucumber crop and the two growing seasons of spring and autumn are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively this is a comparison between let measured by the weighing lysimeters and calculated let by the bt and the pm methods during the entire spring season there was a high correlation between the let calculated by the bt and the pm methods let measured by the lysimeters was significantly p 0 01 lower compared to the let calculated by the bt and pm methods however there was no significant difference p 0 01 between let measured by lysimeters and the let calculated by bt and pm methods in autumn until the mid season and late season growth stages from the mid season to late season growth stages in autumn the let calculated by the bt and pm methods exhibited some significant difference p 0 01 compared to the let measured by the lysimeters this observation could probably be due to the high global solar radiation experienced during the entire spring season and also from the mid season to the late season growth stages in autumn furthermore the let calculated by pm method showed significant difference p 0 01 during the mid season to late season growth stages in autumn because net radiation is a function of the pm model the coefficients of determination r 2 between measured and calculated let by the pm model during the spring and autumn periods were 0 94 and 0 94 respectively table 3 however the bt model showed slightly lower correlations between measured and calculated let and the r 2 were 0 83 and 0 76 for the spring and autumn seasons respectively the results of this study indicated that let could be estimated by the pm model as well as the bt model using rc estimated by the stomatal resistance derived from the stomatal conductance of the greenhouse cucumbers on one hand the rmse were equal to 96 97 and 74 74 w m 2 respectively for the let calculated by the pm method and that measured by the lysimeter for the spring and autumn periods on the other hand there was good agreement between measured and calculated let by the bt equation with rmse equal to 81 62 and 69 14 w m 2 respectively during the spring and autumn table 3 also shows the other error analysis statistics of the comparison between measured and calculated let by the bt and the pm methods for the spring and autumn growth seasons the statistical tools showed that the pm model performed better both in the spring and autumn growth seasons but the performance of the bt equation declined during the autumn probably due to reduced radiation culminating in lower let in the greenhouse comparing the performances of the two models using the spring and autumn datasets it is obvious that pm is preferred by all statistical measures in this study the pm is also robust in both the spring and autumn growing seasons whereas the bt equation underperformed during the autumn season even though the bt equation is more accurate as reported by oue 2005 the two methods gave higher index of agreement d of 0 92 and 0 88 during the spring whilst in autumn the values were 0 82 and 0 72 for pm and bt respectively the reasons might not only be that the pm model has the advantage of taking into account the set of climatic variables affecting rc rn vpd but also its robustness in arid semi arid and humid environments the average absolute errors between lysimeter measured and calculated let by the pm equation were 92 12 w m 2 and 73 17 w m 2 while the average absolute errors between lysimeter measured and calculated let by the bt method were 99 46 w m 2 and 74 53 w m 2 respectively for the spring and autumn growing seasons the relative errors between lysimeter measured and calculated let by the pm method were 21 16 and 12 51 whilst the relative errors were 29 and 16 52 for the bt equation respectively for the spring and autumn growth seasons the other statistical parameters such as systematic mean square errors mse s unsystematic mean square errors mse u and index of agreement d and slope of least square regression line a are presented in table 3 generally greenhouse structures reduce light transmission so rn is reduced and because wind speed is nearly 0 and rh is often higher let is lower in the greenhouse compared with open field conditions these factors affect crop energy partitioning in the greenhouse and hence partitioning rn into let and h by micrometeorological factors is most appropriate thus using micrometeorological approaches inside the greenhouse to partition cucumber crop energy offers a scientific approach aimed to highlight greenhouse innovations and act as a catalyst to inspire scientific basis for optimizing efficient water saving irrigation development of a suitable irrigation scheduling and improving crop water use efficiency the theory of using micrometeorological methods to calculate let under greenhouse conditions provides the scientific basis for controlling the greenhouse microclimate for optimum yield with better quality through efficient water management and energy savings by avoiding excessive water application and thus achieving the objective of improved and satisfactory yield and higher economic returns 4 conclusions in this study we applied the pm and the bt methods to calculate the heat fluxes let and h in a greenhouse grown with cucumber for spring and autumn growth seasons an empirical model of stomatal resistance based on the stomatal conductance was developed in order to calculate rc while r a was determined using the semi empirical expression proposed by thom and oliver 1977 by estimating the rc modelled using the stomatal conductance inside the greenhouse the rc computed by the pm and the bt equations were compared and found there were good agreements between the two methods in both spring and autumn growing seasons this study showed that within the greenhouse the hourly energy fluxes of the growth stages of cucumber for two growing seasons can appropriately be described using the pm and the bt models under the local greenhouse conditions and the meteorological data generated during the experiments let measurements obtained by the weighing lysimeters gave practically identical estimates which were in good agreements with those obtained by the pm model the simplified energy balance approach was a feasible alternative to partition the energy fluxes and hence irrigation scheduling in the greenhouse the statistical analysis revealed that the let could be reproduced by both the pm model and the bt equation with the rc sub model the predictions made in this study would be an easy and relatively accurate way to partition greenhouse cucumber energy fluxes and thus the appropriate irrigation schedule could be made the findings in this research were based on observational data from the greenhouse and were considered representative for the venlo type greenhouses in order to confirm that our findings are transferrable to other greenhouse types more observational data from different greenhouses and further analyses in related research studies are recommended in

11078,in arid areas water diverted from highly uncertain flash floods is often the only source of water for crop production stakeholders in spate irrigation systems have developed numerous measures to cope with uncertain water supply related to low high and untimely floods this research evaluates the effectiveness of these measures using the mulino decision support system mdss4 tool which is based on the driving force pressure state impact response dpsir framework using data from interviews with 101 randomly selected farmers 17 water user associations wuas and 7 system water managers in the gash spate irrigation system in sudan we compare the effectiveness with the rate of adoption the results reveal the most effective measures are 1 pre flood preparedness 2 risk sharing measures through water and land management during and after flood by wuas 3 crop management by farmers and 4 flexibility in operation by water managers unfortunately the most effective measures are not the most adopted ones the level of adoption is primarily related to the capacity of the farmers wuas and water managers to implement the measures without outside support generally measures taken by downstream farmers are less effective than those adopted by upstream farmers due to weak institutional arrangements and lack of adequate resources supporting farmers wuas and water managers for a wider adoption of the existing effective measures will greatly improve irrigation performance and hence food security in the study area keywords spate irrigation gash agricultural scheme adaptation strategies floods uncertain water supply dpsir framework 1 introduction the adverse impact of climate variability on agricultural production in sub saharan africa poses a substantial threat to food and water security funk et al 2008 in arid regions of north eastern africa sudan ethiopia eritrea farmers use seasonal flash floods to sustain agricultural production flash floods also called spate are usually one of the few water sources available in arid areas spate irrigation is the practice of diverting flood water from ephemeral rivers to adjacent terraced fields for direct application or into sub surface storage as soil moisture using simple earthen canals and distribution systems van steenbergen et al 2010 the area in sudan under spate irrigation amounts to 132 000 ha van steenbergen et al 2010 spate irrigation has been practiced in sudan since the late 19th century major spate irrigation areas are located around khor baraka in far eastern sudan khor abu habil in western sudan and the gash river in eastern sudan in the gash delta spate irrigation has been practiced since 1924 ngirazie et al 2015 though playing an instrumental role in local food security it has received relatively little attention from investors development agencies and researchers water supply in spate irrigation is highly variable ranging from large destructive floods to insufficient supplies during the drought years there is considerable uncertainty in the timing and the volume of floods van steenbergen 1997 the area that can be irrigated varies each season due to reasons such as the flood volume the effectiveness of the system to divert floods from highly sediment laden unstable rivers and changes in command area levels van steenbergen et al 2010 other non climatic factors that influence the spate irrigated area are the human environment linkages haile 2007 and more broadly the social ecological interactions zimmerer 2011 which amplify the complexity of the biophysical system in general there is a lack of studies on spate irrigation a few past studies regarding uncertain water supply in spate irrigation focused on the biophysical and infrastructure related issues for example van steenbergen 1997 described how failure of spate irrigation projects in baluchistan resulted from inappropriate engineering measures such as weak structures unsuitable design and wrongly situated structures due to river meandering the study recommended the adoption of a flexible management approach as well as flexible rules and engineering designs to accommodate variable flows and an appropriate organisational framework and institutions similarly khan et al 2014 recommended flexibility of water distribution rules to account for medium and long term changes in the flood systems of spate irrigation in the indus river pakistan mehari et al 2008 emphasized the importance of flexibility not only in view of variations in flow but also to ensure equitable access and fairness of water sharing past research into spate irrigation studied local experiences with uncertain water supplies primarily in terms of infrastructure flexibility in engineering design and water sharing rules abdelgalil and bushara 2017 haile et al 2011 khan et al 2014 komakech et al 2011 ngirazie et al 2015 saher et al 2014 van steenbergen 1997 ignoring farmers and the water user association s wua s own coping strategies effective strategies can greatly reduce the impact of climate variability and enhance local capacity to adjust and cope with the negative consequences cooper et al 2008 martínez alvarez et al 2014 compared farmers adaptation strategies in normal and dry years at water scarce region in an irrigation district in spain the comparison was only limited to strategies dealing with the risks of using of brackish water with high salinity ortega reig et al 2014 has shown how farmer managed irrigation system of valencia in spain successfully deal with the river flow fluctuations through a well established water sharing rules the study investigated farmers perceptions on the level of transparency and equity in water sharing without considering other adaptive strategies for land soil and crop management or their effectiveness in reducing the impacts of river flow fluctuations similarly by focusing on irrigation intensity and crop choice strategies gaydon et al 2012 found different strategies used during high and low water availability in a farm in australia s riverina region many researchers employed a direct simple approach for evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation strategies using stakeholder s perception azumah et al 2018 mcharo 2013 pradhan et al 2017 shivakoti and thapa 2005 from the literature review we recognized that past studies do not differentiate between the different strategies used for different types of river flow fluctuations in particular flood risks such as low high and untimely floods it is also unclear to which extent and why or why not these strategies are adopted by the different stakeholders in addition to closing these gaps this research added the novel approach of evaluating the strength and weakness of the adaptation strategies to combat risks of uncertain water supply resulting from flash flood diversion the objectives of this research are to identify driving force pressure state impact and response elements of water supply risks to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptation strategies to explore the reasons behind the differences in adoption level by upstream and downstream users and to evaluate the adoption rate of effective strategies to address these objectives we a applied the mulino decision support system mdss4 tool based on the driving force pressure state impact response dpsir framework to a case study from a spate irrigation system in sudan 2 data and methods a mixed method approach was used for data gathering including a literature review field survey consultations workshops and key informant interviews we applied the mdss4 tool based on the dpsir framework to evaluate the current strategies presenting a logical sequence from 1 identification of the main elements in the dpsir framework 2 identification of the existing adaptation strategies 3 selection of the evaluation criteria and indicators and 4 choosing the most effective measures in each strategy that perform better with respect to the selected criteria the methodology used present a novel approach for evaluation of adaptation measures in a spate irrigation context due to environmental risks and can generally be applied to other irrigation systems with socio environmental problems characterized by data scarcity 2 1 the mdss4 tool the mdss4 tool based on the dpsir conceptual framework was originally developed in the mulino project multi sectoral integrated and operational decision support system for sustainable use of water resources at the catchment scale the approach is aimed at facilitating the involvement of stakeholders in the process of integrated water resources management and natural resources management giupponi et al 2004 the mdss4 tool uses three phases the conceptual phase the design phase and the choice phase fig 1 the conceptual phase involves problem structuring and identification of the study area the environmental and socio economic features are linked through cause effect relationships using the dpsir framework eea 1999 in this context the driving forces represented by natural and social processes are the underlying causes and origins of pressures on the spate irrigation system the pressures are outcomes of the driving forces which influence the current state of the irrigation scheme the state reflects the condition change of the irrigation scheme natural resource while the impacts describe the ultimate effects of changes of state the responses demonstrate the measures to solve the problems the design phase involves a identification of responses or measures in terms of the dpsir framework b selection of a comprehensive set of decision criteria and indicators giupponi 2007 c organizing the analysis matrix am which contains the indicator values of the measures for each decision criteria and d building the evaluation matrix em which involves normalization and weighting of the indicator values to evaluate the strategies each measure is scored and ranked according to its relevance under each scenario sabbaghian et al 2016 using multi criteria decision making mcdm which is widely adopted in irrigation planning zarghami 2011 mcdm shows the impact of different irrigation management decisions billib et al 2009 and evaluates best management practices for agriculture sabbaghian et al 2016 the choice phase applies the mcdm to identify the best measures which perform better on the selected criteria by using decision rule s provided in mcdm decision rules aggregate partial preferences describing individual criteria into global preferences and rank the measures 2 2 indicator selection and scoring this study uses qualitative indicators which help to overcome the large uncertainties in the measurement and estimates of variable water supply and the limited monitoring systems available in the study area in addition environmental issues often involve multiple dimension of analysis uncertainty and difficulty in obtaining a single measurement scale from different actors corral quintana et al 2016 under such circumstances the use of qualitative assessment along with the most commonly used indicators in the literature stakeholder analysis and expert judgment for ranking and prioritization were recommended corral quintana et al 2016 de bruin et al 2009 iglesias and garrote 2015 the role of farmers and policy makers in interpreting adaptation strategies assist in risk management and decision making quiroga and iglesias 2009 the suitable criteria and indicators and associated weights were defined based on the information gathered during the field visits underpinned by the views of the representative set of stakeholders and experts including researchers academics members from related institutes and knowledgeable members of wuas the values of the selected indicators ranged from 5 and 5 to reflect the effect of the measure on the elements of the dpsi 1 1 driving

performing measures normalization of units was not needed in our case since we are using a similar scale for all the measures the analysis was implemented for measures to cope with high low and untimely flood seasons 2 3 characteristics of the study area the gash agricultural scheme gas is the largest spate irrigation scheme in eastern sudan fig 2 the seasonal gash river is the main water source for gas it originates from the eritrean and ethiopian highlands where it is called the mareb river the river is dry for most time of the year but is subject to flash floods during the rainy

managers developed more effective measures to cope with high and untimely floods 89 and 85 of their measures were medium to highly effective respectively further wuas were comparatively poor in developing effective measures for high and untimely floods unlike individual farmers at their farms yet the majority of farmers measures were not among the highly effective ones these results were largely influenced by the level of perception towards flood risks fadul et al 2018 niles and mueller 2016 performance of the measures used by farmers wuas and water managers is shown in fig 5 a c respectively 5 difference between upstream and downstream farmers there is a clear difference between measures taken by farmers in upstream and downstream blocks the differences can be attributed to the location and performance of the wuas and water managers in the upstream kassala block improved field water distribution systems such as infield canals and spurs to deflect water are more prevalent than in the downstream metateib block fig 6 a c additionally farmers in the kassala block are collectively organized in subgroups to operate and maintain the large sized fields unlike farmers at metateib block who work individually hence reduced cultivable area per farmer 0 1 0 2 ha the collective action in flood water distribution access to agreed farm holding size 1 25 ha as well as the conflict resolution by the organized wuas supported wider adoption of risk management strategies at the upstream block than the downstream block being the first irrigation block to divert flood water the kassala block could suffer from the impact of potentially destructive high floods but also has the opportunity to divert water during the whole season unlike the downstream block which receives floods in lesser quantities the proximity of the kassala block to the kassala city has drawn the attention of donors gas administration and more qualified technical staff and labour which has resulted in more technical and administrative support to wuas and hence better o m of infrastructure 5 1 performance and adoption of flood strategies after assessing the effectiveness of coping strategies with different flood types we compared them with adoption rates as reported in interviews during our study for simplicity we grouped high and medium effective measures in highly ranked hr performance score 0 5 and low effective measures in low ranked lr performance score 0 5 similarly for the adoption of measures we selected highly adopted ha adoption rate 50 and low adopted la adoption rates 50 fig 7 a c illustrate the four matrix quadrants of all the measures adopted by the farmers wuas and water managers for low high and untimely flood strategies respectively the analysis revealed that all ha measures could be implemented by farmers and wuas without external support or technical difficulty however most hr measures were not well adopted by all the stakeholders for the hr measures in the case of the farmers wuas and water managers the adoption rates were only 38 11 and 29 respectively 5 1 1 low flood strategy fig 7a the most effective measures to cope with low floods and hence low water availability are performed before the start of the irrigation season such as land and soil preparations farmers and mesquite clearance wuas for water managers the most effective measure is frequent monitoring of the irrigated area which allows for timely termination of irrigation if fields have been supplied with enough water the lottery system for field allocation based on distributing the irrigable area scored similarly to a fixed system which gives the farmer the right to access the same part of a particular field all the time fixing the location of a tenancy was implemented in 2004 with the introduction of the wuas act to allow farmers to clean and prepare their own part of farms sharecropping can adjust to low flood risks such as irrigation failure or poorly irrigated field increasing income by changing the cropping plan from sorghum to fodder vegetable production is a flexible cropping activity that can at least provide fodder for their livestock a large number of hr measures are not adopted by farmers and wuas the adoption level depends on the capacity available resources and support systems for example field preparation and mesquite clearance needs financial and institutional support which are not available to the majority of farmers and wuas therefore hr measures that could be adopted by the farmers without outside support include sharecropping wetting seeds and making in situ flood harvesting similarly wuas could easily adopt hr measures developed for uniform water distribution e g water spreading use of shrubs weeds at field head the results for water managers were influenced by the differences between the upstream and downstream block in the downstream metateib block hr measures such as frequent monitoring of the flood area and water allocation rules allowing for fallow fields are not practiced while lr measures such as options to minimize the losses of a low flood season with the least possible benefits show high adoption rates finding opportunities with even lr measures is a way to deal with the flood risks when no other options are available 5 1 2 high flood strategy fig 7b simple traditional methods with less dependency on external support were among the measures most adopted by farmers the promising measures include delaying the date of cropping to reduce soil moisture and increasing income from cash crop production such as water melons however these measures have not been widely adopted due to the lack of investment needed until harvest the best measures for wuas were desilting of field canals and secondary system and raising embankments maintenance activities are poorly adopted by wuas due to poor access to equipment and resources unlike wuas and farmers water managers were better equipped for dealing with the high floods almost all the measures adopted by water managers were ranked as medium or highly effective in dealing with high floods nevertheless adoption of measures was location dependent as there is more concern of high floods water managers at the upstream kassala block which is the first to divert floods developed and adopted most of the best scored measures compared to the downstream metateib block nevertheless the best scored measure routine maintenance of the irrigation system is less adopted in both blocks due to the limited amount of equipment and human and financial resources 5 1 3 untimely flood strategy fig 7c there is a relatively low number of measures dealing with untimely floods early late long and short floods if untimely floods occur during the maintenance and preparation activities this may lead to breaching of the poorly maintained canals and structures farmers most effective measure is the use of sand bags and locally made lebsha i e vertically laid sticks filled with dry shrubs this accumulates the sediment from the flow to form a cementing material to reduce flow energy fig 8 illustrates a lebsha installed at a field entrance although changing the crop and delaying cropping were highly scored farmers were reluctant to change their crop due to their preference for subsistence crop production and the high cost of cash crop production the lottery system was the hr measure for the wuas to distribute the actual irrigated area between farmers wuas in metateib have heavily adopted the lottery system as a result of the high risk of poor irrigation in the downstream block involving private companies in the maintenance work to prepare irrigation system to accommodate the untimely floods was the best measure for water managers and in particular highly adopted in the kassala block fig 9 demonstrates the impact of untimely flood occurred during maintenance activities similarly flexibility in the start and end dates of irrigation were highly adopted in the kassala block as compared to the metateib block where conflicts and disagreement between wuas are more prevalent in general low adoption of hr measures were observed at all levels while lr measures such as adopting an emergency maintenance plan for the most critical section infringement of water rights of downstream wuas and exit cropping were heavily adopted as the minimum action to reduce the losses by water managers wuas and farmers respectively 6 conclusion the stakeholders at all levels in the gash agricultural scheme gas in eastern sudan have developed numerous measures to cope with uncertain water supply ranging from too low too high and untimely floods this study evaluated the effectiveness of these measures adopted by the farmers water user associations wuas and system water managers the research used the driver pressure state impact response dpsir concept for problem structuring and the mdss4 software for the evaluation based on a set of selected criteria and indicators most relevant to the local context of spate irrigated agriculture the evaluation of coping strategies revealed a low correlation between effectiveness and adoption most of the highly effective ranked measures had a low adoption rate by farmers wuas and water managers similarly some of the poorly ranking measures were among the most frequently adopted ones the most effective measures adopted by the farmers to cope with risks of low floods were characterized by activities performed before flood mostly for field and soil preparations generally frequently adopted measures were characterized by low dependency on external resources there were limited measures developed by the wuas to deal with high and untimely floods due to inaccessible resources water managers have developed effective strategies for high and untimely floods however effective strategies are well practiced at the upstream block and very poorly practiced at the downstream block the promotion of highly effective but less frequently adopted measures could boost the productivity of the gas in this regard there is a need for institutional arrangements with respect to operation and maintenance building capacity of the water managers and wuas to strengthen their roles and capabilities for taking effective actions additionally the adopted measures should be strengthened with better knowledge and research with respect to crop water use the optimum irrigation schedule crop yield response to different flood scenarios and management options the application of dpsir framework in the spate irrigation context has been useful in problem identification using a holistic approach this assists in understanding and focusing on the element that need to be improved in this study the pressure element described by the technical difficulty including technical financial and management capabilities indicator was found to be the most sensitive factor that can introduce change towards improved spate water management this is in line with the findings by bashier et al 2014 who assessed the performance of wuas in gas and concluded that wuas in gas were technically and financially poor at managing spate water systems while much knowledge still needs to be known about complex spate systems it is vital for farmers and wuas to participate in the planning implementation and operation to have productive spate systems to improve performance of water management in spate irrigation adoption of effective strategies to cope with risks related to uncertain water supply is crucial we observe that the most effective measures are least adopted and vice versa most of the effective measures are constrained by 1 lack of institutional policy and technological support for irrigation 2 limited access to irrigation water and 3 limited access to maintenance services for farmers land preparation soil and crop management and improving equal access to well irrigated fields can be enhanced through revisiting land rights at farm level and provision of credits these efforts could be useful to reduce and mitigate risks faced by the farmers for wuas programs for the eradication of mesquite involvement of private sector for field levelling and preparation reducing the irrigation failure of large sized fields by improving field design revisiting regulation of water rights field offtakes access to maintenance equipment and provisional of financial resources can increase the irrigation efficiency and equity at wua field level for water managers provision of timely service to wuas to maintain the field and secondary system can result in efficient operation and maintenance efficient operation of intakes and distribution systems can be achieved through enhanced policy and institutional set up of gas administration upgrading technical staff to ensure a continuous operation and maintenance process before during and after the flood season and provision of wuas with access to equipment and capacity building these efforts could be useful in reducing and mitigating risks faced by the farmers wuas and water managers and hence improve productivity and sustainability funding

11078,in arid areas water diverted from highly uncertain flash floods is often the only source of water for crop production stakeholders in spate irrigation systems have developed numerous measures to cope with uncertain water supply related to low high and untimely floods this research evaluates the effectiveness of these measures using the mulino decision support system mdss4 tool which is based on the driving force pressure state impact response dpsir framework using data from interviews with 101 randomly selected farmers 17 water user associations wuas and 7 system water managers in the gash spate irrigation system in sudan we compare the effectiveness with the rate of adoption the results reveal the most effective measures are 1 pre flood preparedness 2 risk sharing measures through water and land management during and after flood by wuas 3 crop management by farmers and 4 flexibility in operation by water managers unfortunately the most effective measures are not the most adopted ones the level of adoption is primarily related to the capacity of the farmers wuas and water managers to implement the measures without outside support generally measures taken by downstream farmers are less effective than those adopted by upstream farmers due to weak institutional arrangements and lack of adequate resources supporting farmers wuas and water managers for a wider adoption of the existing effective measures will greatly improve irrigation performance and hence food security in the study area keywords spate irrigation gash agricultural scheme adaptation strategies floods uncertain water supply dpsir framework 1 introduction the adverse impact of climate variability on agricultural production in sub saharan africa poses a substantial threat to food and water security funk et al 2008 in arid regions of north eastern africa sudan ethiopia eritrea farmers use seasonal flash floods to sustain agricultural production flash floods also called spate are usually one of the few water sources available in arid areas spate irrigation is the practice of diverting flood water from ephemeral rivers to adjacent terraced fields for direct application or into sub surface storage as soil moisture using simple earthen canals and distribution systems van steenbergen et al 2010 the area in sudan under spate irrigation amounts to 132 000 ha van steenbergen et al 2010 spate irrigation has been practiced in sudan since the late 19th century major spate irrigation areas are located around khor baraka in far eastern sudan khor abu habil in western sudan and the gash river in eastern sudan in the gash delta spate irrigation has been practiced since 1924 ngirazie et al 2015 though playing an instrumental role in local food security it has received relatively little attention from investors development agencies and researchers water supply in spate irrigation is highly variable ranging from large destructive floods to insufficient supplies during the drought years there is considerable uncertainty in the timing and the volume of floods van steenbergen 1997 the area that can be irrigated varies each season due to reasons such as the flood volume the effectiveness of the system to divert floods from highly sediment laden unstable rivers and changes in command area levels van steenbergen et al 2010 other non climatic factors that influence the spate irrigated area are the human environment linkages haile 2007 and more broadly the social ecological interactions zimmerer 2011 which amplify the complexity of the biophysical system in general there is a lack of studies on spate irrigation a few past studies regarding uncertain water supply in spate irrigation focused on the biophysical and infrastructure related issues for example van steenbergen 1997 described how failure of spate irrigation projects in baluchistan resulted from inappropriate engineering measures such as weak structures unsuitable design and wrongly situated structures due to river meandering the study recommended the adoption of a flexible management approach as well as flexible rules and engineering designs to accommodate variable flows and an appropriate organisational framework and institutions similarly khan et al 2014 recommended flexibility of water distribution rules to account for medium and long term changes in the flood systems of spate irrigation in the indus river pakistan mehari et al 2008 emphasized the importance of flexibility not only in view of variations in flow but also to ensure equitable access and fairness of water sharing past research into spate irrigation studied local experiences with uncertain water supplies primarily in terms of infrastructure flexibility in engineering design and water sharing rules abdelgalil and bushara 2017 haile et al 2011 khan et al 2014 komakech et al 2011 ngirazie et al 2015 saher et al 2014 van steenbergen 1997 ignoring farmers and the water user association s wua s own coping strategies effective strategies can greatly reduce the impact of climate variability and enhance local capacity to adjust and cope with the negative consequences cooper et al 2008 martínez alvarez et al 2014 compared farmers adaptation strategies in normal and dry years at water scarce region in an irrigation district in spain the comparison was only limited to strategies dealing with the risks of using of brackish water with high salinity ortega reig et al 2014 has shown how farmer managed irrigation system of valencia in spain successfully deal with the river flow fluctuations through a well established water sharing rules the study investigated farmers perceptions on the level of transparency and equity in water sharing without considering other adaptive strategies for land soil and crop management or their effectiveness in reducing the impacts of river flow fluctuations similarly by focusing on irrigation intensity and crop choice strategies gaydon et al 2012 found different strategies used during high and low water availability in a farm in australia s riverina region many researchers employed a direct simple approach for evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation strategies using stakeholder s perception azumah et al 2018 mcharo 2013 pradhan et al 2017 shivakoti and thapa 2005 from the literature review we recognized that past studies do not differentiate between the different strategies used for different types of river flow fluctuations in particular flood risks such as low high and untimely floods it is also unclear to which extent and why or why not these strategies are adopted by the different stakeholders in addition to closing these gaps this research added the novel approach of evaluating the strength and weakness of the adaptation strategies to combat risks of uncertain water supply resulting from flash flood diversion the objectives of this research are to identify driving force pressure state impact and response elements of water supply risks to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptation strategies to explore the reasons behind the differences in adoption level by upstream and downstream users and to evaluate the adoption rate of effective strategies to address these objectives we a applied the mulino decision support system mdss4 tool based on the driving force pressure state impact response dpsir framework to a case study from a spate irrigation system in sudan 2 data and methods a mixed method approach was used for data gathering including a literature review field survey consultations workshops and key informant interviews we applied the mdss4 tool based on the dpsir framework to evaluate the current strategies presenting a logical sequence from 1 identification of the main elements in the dpsir framework 2 identification of the existing adaptation strategies 3 selection of the evaluation criteria and indicators and 4 choosing the most effective measures in each strategy that perform better with respect to the selected criteria the methodology used present a novel approach for evaluation of adaptation measures in a spate irrigation context due to environmental risks and can generally be applied to other irrigation systems with socio environmental problems characterized by data scarcity 2 1 the mdss4 tool the mdss4 tool based on the dpsir conceptual framework was originally developed in the mulino project multi sectoral integrated and operational decision support system for sustainable use of water resources at the catchment scale the approach is aimed at facilitating the involvement of stakeholders in the process of integrated water resources management and natural resources management giupponi et al 2004 the mdss4 tool uses three phases the conceptual phase the design phase and the choice phase fig 1 the conceptual phase involves problem structuring and identification of the study area the environmental and socio economic features are linked through cause effect relationships using the dpsir framework eea 1999 in this context the driving forces represented by natural and social processes are the underlying causes and origins of pressures on the spate irrigation system the pressures are outcomes of the driving forces which influence the current state of the irrigation scheme the state reflects the condition change of the irrigation scheme natural resource while the impacts describe the ultimate effects of changes of state the responses demonstrate the measures to solve the problems the design phase involves a identification of responses or measures in terms of the dpsir framework b selection of a comprehensive set of decision criteria and indicators giupponi 2007 c organizing the analysis matrix am which contains the indicator values of the measures for each decision criteria and d building the evaluation matrix em which involves normalization and weighting of the indicator values to evaluate the strategies each measure is scored and ranked according to its relevance under each scenario sabbaghian et al 2016 using multi criteria decision making mcdm which is widely adopted in irrigation planning zarghami 2011 mcdm shows the impact of different irrigation management decisions billib et al 2009 and evaluates best management practices for agriculture sabbaghian et al 2016 the choice phase applies the mcdm to identify the best measures which perform better on the selected criteria by using decision rule s provided in mcdm decision rules aggregate partial preferences describing individual criteria into global preferences and rank the measures 2 2 indicator selection and scoring this study uses qualitative indicators which help to overcome the large uncertainties in the measurement and estimates of variable water supply and the limited monitoring systems available in the study area in addition environmental issues often involve multiple dimension of analysis uncertainty and difficulty in obtaining a single measurement scale from different actors corral quintana et al 2016 under such circumstances the use of qualitative assessment along with the most commonly used indicators in the literature stakeholder analysis and expert judgment for ranking and prioritization were recommended corral quintana et al 2016 de bruin et al 2009 iglesias and garrote 2015 the role of farmers and policy makers in interpreting adaptation strategies assist in risk management and decision making quiroga and iglesias 2009 the suitable criteria and indicators and associated weights were defined based on the information gathered during the field visits underpinned by the views of the representative set of stakeholders and experts including researchers academics members from related institutes and knowledgeable members of wuas the values of the selected indicators ranged from 5 and 5 to reflect the effect of the measure on the elements of the dpsi 1 1 driving force pressure state impact dpsi chain with 5 very high 4 high 3 medium 2 low 1 very low and 0 neutral the positive and negative signs describe the degree to which the measure positively or negatively

total number of indicators the score represents a simple sum of the indicator values of every measure weighted by the vector of weights with p 0 the highest score values are assigned for the best performing measures normalization of units was not needed in our case since we are using a similar scale for all the measures the analysis was implemented for measures to cope with high low and untimely flood seasons 2 3 characteristics of the study area the gash agricultural scheme gas is the largest spate irrigation scheme in eastern sudan fig 2 the seasonal gash river is the main water source for gas it originates from the eritrean and ethiopian highlands where it is called the mareb river the river is dry for most time of the year but is subject to flash floods during the rainy

2004 with the introduction of the wuas act to allow farmers to clean and prepare their own part of farms sharecropping can adjust to low flood risks such as irrigation failure or poorly irrigated field increasing income by changing the cropping plan from sorghum to fodder vegetable production is a flexible cropping activity that can at least provide fodder for their livestock a large number of hr measures are not adopted by farmers and wuas the adoption level depends on the capacity available resources and support systems for example field preparation and mesquite clearance needs financial and institutional support which are not available to the majority of farmers and wuas therefore hr measures that could be adopted by the farmers without outside support include sharecropping wetting seeds and making in situ flood harvesting similarly wuas could easily adopt hr measures developed for uniform water distribution e g water spreading use of shrubs weeds at field head the results for water managers were influenced by the differences between the upstream and downstream block in the downstream metateib block hr measures such as frequent monitoring of the flood area and water allocation rules allowing for fallow fields are not practiced while lr measures such as options to minimize the losses of a low flood season with the least possible benefits show high adoption rates finding opportunities with even lr measures is a way to deal with the flood risks when no other options are available 5 1 2 high flood strategy fig 7b simple traditional methods with less dependency on external support were among the measures most adopted by farmers the promising measures include delaying the date of cropping to reduce soil moisture and increasing income from cash crop production such as water melons however these measures have not been widely adopted due to the lack of investment needed until harvest the best measures for wuas were desilting of field canals and secondary system and raising embankments maintenance activities are poorly adopted by wuas due to poor access to equipment and resources unlike wuas and farmers water managers were better equipped for dealing with the high floods almost all the measures adopted by water managers were ranked as medium or highly effective in dealing with high floods nevertheless adoption of measures was location dependent as there is more concern of high floods water managers at the upstream kassala block which is the first to divert floods developed and adopted most of the best scored measures compared to the downstream metateib block nevertheless the best scored measure routine maintenance of the irrigation system is less adopted in both blocks due to the limited amount of equipment and human and financial resources 5 1 3 untimely flood strategy fig 7c there is a relatively low number of measures dealing with untimely floods early late long and short floods if untimely floods occur during the maintenance and preparation activities this may lead to breaching of the poorly maintained canals and structures farmers most effective measure is the use of sand bags and locally made lebsha i e vertically laid sticks filled with dry shrubs this accumulates the sediment from the flow to form a cementing material to reduce flow energy fig 8 illustrates a lebsha installed at a field entrance although changing the crop and delaying cropping were highly scored farmers were reluctant to change their crop due to their preference for subsistence crop production and the high cost of cash crop production the lottery system was the hr measure for the wuas to distribute the actual irrigated area between farmers wuas in metateib have heavily adopted the lottery system as a result of the high risk of poor irrigation in the downstream block involving private companies in the maintenance work to prepare irrigation system to accommodate the untimely floods was the best measure for water managers and in particular highly adopted in the kassala block fig 9 demonstrates the impact of untimely flood occurred during maintenance activities similarly flexibility in the start and end dates of irrigation were highly adopted in the kassala block as compared to the metateib block where conflicts and disagreement between wuas are more prevalent in general low adoption of hr measures were observed at all levels while lr measures such as adopting an emergency maintenance plan for the most critical section infringement of water rights of downstream wuas and exit cropping were heavily adopted as the minimum action to reduce the losses by water managers wuas and farmers respectively 6 conclusion the stakeholders at all levels in the gash agricultural scheme gas in eastern sudan have developed numerous measures to cope with uncertain water supply ranging from too low too high and untimely floods this study evaluated the effectiveness of these measures adopted by the farmers water user associations wuas and system water managers the research used the driver pressure state impact response dpsir concept for problem structuring and the mdss4 software for the evaluation based on a set of selected criteria and indicators most relevant to the local context of spate irrigated agriculture the evaluation of coping strategies revealed a low correlation between effectiveness and adoption most of the highly effective ranked measures had a low adoption rate by farmers wuas and water managers similarly some of the poorly ranking measures were among the most frequently adopted ones the most effective measures adopted by the farmers to cope with risks of low floods were characterized by activities performed before flood mostly for field and soil preparations generally frequently adopted measures were characterized by low dependency on external resources there were limited measures developed by the wuas to deal with high and untimely floods due to inaccessible resources water managers have developed effective strategies for high and untimely floods however effective strategies are well practiced at the upstream block and very poorly practiced at the downstream block the promotion of highly effective but less frequently adopted measures could boost the productivity of the gas in this regard there is a need for institutional arrangements with respect to operation and maintenance building capacity of the water managers and wuas to strengthen their roles and capabilities for taking effective actions additionally the adopted measures should be strengthened with better knowledge and research with respect to crop water use the optimum irrigation schedule crop yield response to different flood scenarios and management options the application of dpsir framework in the spate irrigation context has been useful in problem identification using a holistic approach this assists in understanding and focusing on the element that need to be improved in this study the pressure element described by the technical difficulty including technical financial and management capabilities indicator was found to be the most sensitive factor that can introduce change towards improved spate water management this is in line with the findings by bashier et al 2014 who assessed the performance of wuas in gas and concluded that wuas in gas were technically and financially poor at managing spate water systems while much knowledge still needs to be known about complex spate systems it is vital for farmers and wuas to participate in the planning implementation and operation to have productive spate systems to improve performance of water management in spate irrigation adoption of effective strategies to cope with risks related to uncertain water supply is crucial we observe that the most effective measures are least adopted and vice versa most of the effective measures are constrained by 1 lack of institutional policy and technological support for irrigation 2 limited access to irrigation water and 3 limited access to maintenance services for farmers land preparation soil and crop management and improving equal access to well irrigated fields can be enhanced through revisiting land rights at farm level and provision of credits these efforts could be useful to reduce and mitigate risks faced by the farmers for wuas programs for the eradication of mesquite involvement of private sector for field levelling and preparation reducing the irrigation failure of large sized fields by improving field design revisiting regulation of water rights field offtakes access to maintenance equipment and provisional of financial resources can increase the irrigation efficiency and equity at wua field level for water managers provision of timely service to wuas to maintain the field and secondary system can result in efficient operation and maintenance efficient operation of intakes and distribution systems can be achieved through enhanced policy and institutional set up of gas administration upgrading technical staff to ensure a continuous operation and maintenance process before during and after the flood season and provision of wuas with access to equipment and capacity building these efforts could be useful in reducing and mitigating risks faced by the farmers wuas and water managers and hence improve productivity and sustainability funding

is often needed due to low water holding capacity and high drainage rates to minimize the variation of crop yields in sandy soils farmers tend to over irrigate the fields morgan et al 2003 which leads to lower irrigation efficiency and leaching of agrochemicals saffigna and kenney 1977 shrestha et al 2010 to improve irrigation management in the sandy soils it is necessary to understand the spatial and temporal variations in soil water storage and deep drainage conventional methods of estimating soil water storage require collecting soil samples and bulk density cores in the field followed by gravimetric methods to determine soil volumetric water content to understand how much water is available to crops measurements of soil water characteristics field capacity and permanent wilting are required deep drainage is defined as downward water flux below the root zone and is often quantified by direct measurements using lysimeters gunawardena et al 2011 alternatively indirect methods have been employed which rely on either water mass balance eilers et al 2007 weaver et al 2005 or empirical predictive models black et al 1969 wohling et al 2012 wyatt et al 2017 conventional methods of measuring soil water characteristics are time consuming labor intensive and thus expensive since soil water storage and deep drainage are heterogeneous in space and dynamic in time nocco et al 2018 sharma et al 2006 it is not easy to extrapolate these measurements across large areas over the past decades various geophysical instruments have been employed to provide rapid estimates of volumetric

in characterizing the spatial and temporal variations in volumetric water content at the field catchment and regional scales sandy soils are often used for irrigated agriculture alhammadi and al shrouf 2013 but relatively little research has been done to characterize the spatial and temporal variations in soil water storage and deep drainage the impact of spatial and temporal variations in

plains 44 0267 89 5925 between 2014 and 2017 yost and hartemink 2019 the field was 78 ha in size fig 1 and the soils are sandy throughout according to the web soil survey three soil orders are present alfisols entisols and mollisols eighty percent of the soils at study site are classified as richford loamy sand loamy superactive mesic arenic hapludalfs the soil properties vary throughout the top 0 45 m table 1 yost and hartemink 2019 the field was divided into two halves fig 1 potatoes were grown in the western half of the field in 2014 and in the eastern half in 2015 potatoes were grown every other year and were rotated with either soybean or maize 2 2 irrigation schedule irrigation was applied using a center pivot system to the field irrigation events were scheduled every 2 or 3 days over the growing seasons with the main irrigation application amounts of 5 mm 8 mm 10 mm and 13 mm of water the western half of the field was irrigated 29 times beginning may 30 and ending on september 10 2014 in total 269 mm of irrigation was applied the eastern half of the field was irrigated 32 times beginning may 15 and ending on august 16 2015 in total 281 mm of irrigation was applied the study sites were irrigated at full evapotranspiration estimated using climate data measured from a local weather station refer to section 2 6 2 3 soil sensor data apparent electrical conductivity data was collected across the study site using a veris msp3 salina ks usa fig 1 the shallow mode was used which enabled measuring soil apparent electrical conductivity at the depth of 0 0 0 30 m from the apparent electrical conductivity measurements three irrigation zones were established dry 0 6 1 2 ms m 1 intermediate 1 2 1 6 ms m 1 and wet 1 6 2 0 ms m 1 low apparent electrical conductivity values suggest coarser and drier soils while high apparent electrical conductivity measurements suggest finer and wetter soils corwin and lesch 2003 soil tension probes were placed on the field throughout the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons soil water tension was measured using hortau model tx 3 tension probes connected to a web tx4 field station lévis québec canada the tensiometer was connected to a mobile phone network and continuous measurements were collected every 30 min from 7 june 2014 to 14 september 2014 and from 7 june 2015 to 29 august 2015 in 2014 six tensiometers were placed within each irrigation zone at 0 20 0 30 and 0 45 m across the field fig 1 at each zone two soil tensiometers were placed at each depth in 2015 three tensiometers were placed two locations per zone at 0 20 and 0 45 m at each zone two soil tensiometers were placed at 0 20 m and one at 0 45 m 2 4 soil samples collection laboratory analysis and prediction of volumetric water content soil cores were collected from the field in 2015 and 2017 at 0 20 0 30 and 0 45 m and analyzed in the laboratory in 2015 soil cores were collected at each irrigation zone approximately 1 m from the tensiometers in 2017 soil cores were collected from each irrigation zone based on the eca of the field the analysis of the cores was described in yost and hartemink 2019 soil moisture characteristic curves were measured in the lab with van genuchten parameters estimated yost and hartemink 2019 the van genuchten equation 1980 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ m n m where θ is the soil volumetric water content θ s is the saturated soil water content θ r is the residual soil water content α m and n are shape parameters ψ m is the soil matrix potential as measured by the tensiometers volumetric water content values were predicted using the soil tension measurements collected in 2014 and the van genuchten models derived from the corresponding soil samples collected in 2015 and 2017 in each zone prediction of volumetric water content at six locations in 2015 was done using the soil tension measurements and the van genuchten models derived from the soil moisture characteristic samples collected in 2015 to reduce the short scale variation of soil properties across the field the mean values of all the tensiometers in each zone in 2014 and 2015 were used for daily soil water storage and deep drainage estimates 2 5 daily soil water storage and deep drainage estimates half hourly soil water storage mm in 0 45 m soil was calculated by averaging volumetric water content data based on the depths 2 soil water storage θ 0 0 0 20 m 200 mm θ 0 30 0 45 m 250 mm daily soil water storage was calculated using the mean values of the half hourly soil water storage data we observed that there were very few potato roots below 0 45 m so downward water flux at 0 45 m represents deep drainage hydrus 1d software pc progress was used to estimate the water flux at 0 45 m whereby the richards equation was solved to simulate water infiltration in 1 dimension richards 1931 šimůnek et al 2016 soil hydraulic properties and climate information were required to simulate water infiltration in this study rosetta pedo transfer functions schaap et al 2001 embedded in hydrus 1d software were used to estimate the van genuchten parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity simultaneously for different irrigation zones at the depths of 0 0 0 20 m and 0 30 0 45 m to avoid local scale variability of the soil hydraulic properties estimation was done using the measured mean values of soil particle size fractions sand silt and clay contents field capacity and permanent wilting point in each irrigation zone at two depths table 1 daily rainfall maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed during the experiment were obtained from the hancock agricultural research station approximately 12 km northeast of the study site daily reference evapotranspiration was calculated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 adjusted evapotranspiration was calculated by multiplying the daily reference evapotranspiration by a crop coefficient which was a function of the crop growth stage wisconsin irrigation scheduler 2018 2 6 soil water storage to quantify the temporal variations in soil water storage the average soil water storage in the top 0 45 m was calculated during three potato growth stages in 2014 and 2015 emergency to full cover full cover and full cover to harvest the spatial variation of soil water storage average soil water storage at different locations during full cover in 2014 and 2015 was used a linear regression model was fitted using jmp 11 software to predict average soil water storage across the field in 2014 and 2015 3 average soil water storage during full cover α β e c a where eca is apparent electrical conductivity and α and β are coefficients of the regression model 2 7 potato yield potato yield maps were derived using yield data collected from the farmers yield was also collected from each of the tensiometer locations in 2014 four 3 m rows were manually harvested and passed through a potato grader a similar procedure was used in 2015 however four 2 m rows harvested at each tensiometer location 3 results 3 1 distribution of soil properties in three irrigation zones the apparent electrical conductivity mapping was used to derive three irrigation zones i e dry intermediate and wet fig 1 although the differences between the three zones were small 1 ms m 1 subtle differences in soil properties were identified table 1 in the top 0 20 m sand content decreased as follows dry 94 intermediate 88 and wet 85 this was also the case for silt content and soil organic carbon in the top 0 20 m which was approximately twice as high in the intermediate and wet zones compared to the dry zone there were fewer differences below 0 30 m soil depth the differences in soil properties e g silt content and soil organic carbon led to different soil water storage under field capacity 10 kpa and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa in three zones yost and hartemink 2019 as shown in fig 2 soil water storage increased with depth soil water storage at field capacity in the top 0 45 m was largest in the wet zone 78 mm intermediate in the intermediate zone 71 mm and smallest in the dry zone 54 mm similarly soil water storage at the permanent wilting point in the top 0 45 m was 23 20 and 12 mm in the wet intermediate and dry zones crop available water storage were predicted to be 54 51 and 42 mm for these three zones 3 2 van genuchten parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity table 2 shows the summary statistics of the fitted van genuchten parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity using the rosetta software in general saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with depth and was largest in the dry zone 1607 and 818 mm day 1 intermediate in the intermediate zone 566 and 472 mm day 1 and smallest in the wet zone 254 and 312 mm day 1 at 0 0 0 20 m depth saturated hydraulic conductivity in the dry zone was more than 5 times larger than in the wet zone 3 3 volumetric water content distinct temporal dynamics of volumetric water content m3 m 3 were observed in three irrigation zones fig 3 throughout the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 volumetric water content at 0 0 0 20 m was highest in the wet zone and lowest in the dry zone however this was not the case for volumetric water content in 0 30 0 45 m in 2014 volumetric water content values were highest in the wet zone however volumetric water content values were highest in the intermediate zone in 2015 3 4 soil water storage temporal dynamics of soil water storage in the top 0 45 m was different for the three irrigation zones fig 4 during the growing season in 2014 soil water storage was highest in the wet zone and lowest in the dry zone to interpret the soil water storage in terms of crop available water the number of days as over the growing season for different soil moisture status was calculated table 3 in 2014 in the dry zone 53 of the days the volumetric water content values in 0 0 0 20 m were above field capacity while in the intermediate and wet zones 86 and 99 of days volumetric water content values were above field capacity at 0 30 0 45 m soil depth volumetric water content was above field capacity close to 100 all days in the three zones similar patterns were identified for soil water storage dynamics in 2015 fig 4 in 2015 soil water storage decreased from the wet zone to the dry zone however this was not the case for available crop water the dry intermediate and wet zones had 36 62 and 100 of days during which volumetric water content in 0 0 0 20 m was above the field capacity and 100 83 and 65 of days when volumetric water content in 0 30 0 45 m was above the field capacity 3 5 deep drainage deep drainage was estimated using the downward water flux at 0 45 m and its temporal dynamics were calculated for three zones fig 4 during the growing season in 2014 deep drainage was lowest in the dry zone and highest in the wet zone a different pattern was identified for deep drainage dynamics in 2015 in this case deep drainage was lowest in the wet zone and highest in the dry zone only small differences were identified for deep drainage values and dd r i in three irrigation zones table 4 this suggests that deep drainage was fairly uniform across the field despite the difference in soil water storage among three irrigation zones it is worth noting that deep drainage values in 2014 were higher than those in 2015 because of more rainfall and less evapotranspiration in 2014 compared to 2015 3 6 potato yields summary statistics of soil water storage in the three irrigation zones were shown in table 4 and fig 5 potato yields were significantly higher p 0 001 in the intermediate zone than the dry and wet zones while soil water storage during three growing stages and over the whole season continued to increase from the dry zone to the wet zone 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variation it was noted that the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity values were 4 to 6 times smaller than those reported by rawls et al 1982 and carsel 1988 for sand 5040 and 7128 mm day 1 respectively and loamy sand 1466 and 3502 mm day 1 respectively this was possibly due to the strong variability saturated hydraulic conductivity as identified from the soil cores standard deviation 2342 mm day 1 see yost and hartemink 2019 the variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity was also reported by carsel 1988 for sand and loamy sand standard deviation 3744 and 2726 mm day 1 respectively and can be caused by the preferential flows kung 1990 the spatial distribution of soil water dynamics can be extremely heterogeneous in agricultural fields as shown in this study soil water storage presented distinct patterns in a fairly uniform sandy field sand content 85 this was due to the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties across the field for example the field capacity in the top 0 20 m of the wet zone was 63 larger than that of the dry zone which was mainly caused by the subtle differences in silt clay and soil organic carbon content table 1 as reported by yost and hartemink 2019 field capacity permanent wilting point and available water capacity increased by 0 01 to 0 02 m3 m 3 with a 2 increase in silt plus clay content while available water capacity increased by approximately 0 05 m3 m 3 with a 1 increase in soil organic carbon however the difference of deep drainage in three zones was small even though the saturated hydraulic conductivity values were different table 2 rainfall evapotranspiration crop transpiration and irrigation were uniform at the field scale while the change of soil water storage was low due to the low field capacity of the sandy soils 0 20 m3 m 3 in this study the estimated deep drainage was between 150 and 250 mm over the growing season i e june to september and about 60 to 90 of the applied irrigation this was consistent with nocco et al 2018 who estimated deep drainage values of 106 to 538 mm june to december from 2013 to 2016 in potato growing fields in the sandy soils of the wisconsin central sands plains these deep drainage values suggest that potential groundwater recharge could occur in the sandy soils of these potato growing fields which is potentially beneficial to the regional groundwater recharge 4 2 temporal variation the temporal variation in soil water storage and deep drainage are considerable table 4 in general soil water storage was largest during emergence to full cover intermediate during full cover and smallest during full cover to harvest this is likely caused by increasing crop water use during the growing season and as a function of the increasing transpiration with increasing crop cover deep drainage generally decreased with time except for the dry zone in 2014 as the root systems develop with time causing increased water uptake in this study adjusted evapotranspiration was calculated using the potential evapotranspiration and a crop coefficient which was a function of the crop growth stage wisconsin irrigation scheduler 2018 this estimation is relatively accurate because impedance to water movement is controlled by the plant when the soil suction is low close to field capacity gardner and ehlig 1962 to further understand the temporal variations of transpiration and its impacts on soil water storage actual evapotranspiration should be estimated in the real time in the field gebler et al 2015 sharma et al 2017 4 3 potato yield a correlation analysis showed that potato yield was negatively correlated with soil water storage with pearson s correlation coefficients of 0 44 0 45 0 36 and 0 41 over emergence to full cover full cover full cover to harvest and the whole season respectively this suggests all three zones were over irrigated and the soil was close to saturation spatial distribution of soil water storage during full cover and crop yield using a yield monitor are shown in fig 6 the intermediate zone 80 90 mm is somewhat consistent with the area of higher yields conversely the low and high soil water storage zones corresponds to the intermediate and low yield when the soil became too wet i e the wet zone or too dry crop yields are reduced in the wet zone anaerobic conditions created by a waterlogging inhibits root activities and can lead to tuber rot burton and wigginton 1970 lund and nicholls 1970 in the dry zone soil water storage was below the permanent wilting points during 6 and 2 of the growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 and an insufficient water supply to the root systems could have caused crop stress and reduced yield turner and begg 1981 soil water storage in the intermediate and wet zones was found above field capacity of the soil during 60 100 of the growing season table 3 this suggested that these areas were over irrigated during the growing season based on the definition of plant available water capacity the portion of water above field capacity is not available to plants due to the inhibited root water uptake under low oxygen conditions if the water uptake was inhibited by wet soil conditions in the intermediate zone the potato yield of the intermediate and wet zones should be smaller than that of the dry zone assuming all the other agricultural management practices are the same previous studies have suggested the permanent wilting point was not related to crop transpiration and plant growth gardner and nieman 1964 meyer and boyer 1972 similarly it is thought that the field capacity may not always be the upper limit of the available water capacity and root water uptake and should be taken into consideration when modeling the root water uptake van genuchten 1987 4 4 implications the results of this study have a number of implications for soil and water management in sandy soils first the spatial variation of soil hydraulic properties in sandy soils can be high the variation in soil hydraulic properties contributes to differences in soil water storage and crop yield across the field to reduce the within field yield variation farmers need to characterize the spatial variations of soil properties e g available water capacity within the field and apply different strategies to different zones morgan et al 2003 given the wide applications of electromagnetic induction in soil and environmental studies doolittle and brevik 2014 a digital soil mapping approach can be used to obtain high resolution maps of soil physical and hydraulic properties at the field scale huang et al 2014 a negative correlation was found between soil water storage and crop yield this is most likely due to over irrigation and indicates the need to improve irrigation and water use efficiency without decreasing the crop yields during the manual potato harvest it was observed that some of the potatoes in the wet zone were rotting due to high volumetric water content throughout the growing season to achieve this soil moisture probes can be installed in zones of contrasting soil texture and hydraulic properties to obtain real time soil water dynamics information the methods used in this study can also be applied elsewhere given that temporal dynamics of key weather variables e g precipitation and temperature are difficult to predict particularly under the predicted climate change wisconsin initiative on climate change impacts 2011 future work is required to better understand soil plant atmosphere continuum and investigate the impacts of soil water status i e soil water content and potential on root water uptake and crop growth anderson et al 2003 this requires simultaneously measuring and modeling real time soil water status huang et al 2018 leaf turgor pressure and stem water status bramley et al 2015 in relation to crop growth and in different soil types shanahan et al 2015 in addition long term research can be carried out to study the relationship between average soil water storage at different growth stages and crop yield in different climate regimes and soil types 5 conclusions a spatial and temporal analysis of soil water dynamics during the growing season in a uniform sandy field revealed distinct patterns of soil water storage in space and time predicted potential groundwater recharge ranged from 150 to 250 mm during the growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 and showed little spatial variation a negative correlation was found between the average soil water storage and potato yields the variation of potato yields in space and time was likely due to over irrigation the methods used in this study can be applied elsewhere to improve irrigation efficiency and water use efficiency and mitigate the adverse impacts of changing climates on agricultural productivity future work is required to understand the soil plant atmosphere continuum and the impacts of soil water status i e soil water content and potential on root water uptake and crop growth based on long term research and in different climate regimes and

to lower irrigation efficiency and leaching of agrochemicals saffigna and kenney 1977 shrestha et al 2010 to improve irrigation management in the sandy soils it is necessary to understand the spatial and temporal variations in soil water storage and deep drainage conventional methods of estimating soil water storage require collecting soil samples and bulk density cores in the field followed by gravimetric methods to determine soil volumetric water content to understand how much water is available to crops measurements of soil water characteristics field capacity and permanent wilting are required deep drainage is defined as downward water flux below the root zone and is often quantified by direct measurements using lysimeters gunawardena et al 2011 alternatively indirect methods have been employed which rely on either water mass balance eilers et al 2007 weaver et al 2005 or empirical predictive models black et al 1969 wohling et al 2012 wyatt et al 2017 conventional methods of measuring soil water characteristics are time consuming labor intensive and thus expensive since soil water storage and deep drainage are heterogeneous in space and dynamic in time nocco et al 2018 sharma et al 2006 it is not easy to extrapolate these measurements across large areas over the past decades various geophysical instruments have been employed to provide rapid estimates of volumetric water content in the field these include neutron probes gardner and kirkham 1952 capacitance probes fares and alva 2000 time domain reflectometry robinson et al 2003 topp and davis 1985 heat dissipation probes wyatt et al 2017 cosmic ray neutron probes wang et al 2017 and electromagnetic induction sensors huang et al 2017 to characterize the variation of volumetric water content in space empirical models have been established de lannoy et al 2007 dong et al 2016 huang et al 2017 and require an understanding of the interactions between soil water dynamics and various controlling factors including rainfall temperature joshi and mohanty 2010 topography sharma et al 2006 vegetation jian et al 2015 and soil texture wang et al 2017 these instruments and models have shown success in characterizing the spatial and temporal variations in volumetric water content at the field catchment and regional scales sandy soils are often used for irrigated agriculture alhammadi and al shrouf 2013 but relatively little research has been done to characterize the spatial and temporal variations in soil water storage and deep drainage the impact of spatial and temporal variations in soil water storage and deep drainage on plant growth crop yield and groundwater recharge is not well understood in this study we investigated soil water storage and deep drainage in sandy soils under potato in the wisconsin central sand plains usa the aims of the research were i to estimate soil water storage and deep drainage at two depths 0 0 0 25 m 0 30 0 45 m at three irrigation zones during two growing seasons ii to investigate the impact of various soil properties on soil water storage deep drainage and irrigation efficiency and iii to understand the impacts of soil water storage and drainage on potato yield and groundwater recharge in space and time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and soils this research was conducted at a farm in coloma in the wisconsin central sand plains 44 0267 89 5925 between 2014 and 2017 yost and hartemink 2019 the field was 78 ha in size fig 1 and the soils are sandy throughout according to the web soil survey three soil orders are present alfisols entisols and mollisols eighty percent of the soils at study site are classified as richford loamy sand loamy superactive mesic arenic hapludalfs the soil properties vary throughout the top 0 45 m table 1 yost and hartemink 2019 the field was divided into two halves fig 1 potatoes were grown in the western half of the field in 2014 and in the eastern half in 2015 potatoes were grown every other year and were rotated with either soybean or maize 2 2 irrigation schedule irrigation was applied using a center pivot system to the field irrigation events were scheduled every 2 or 3 days over the growing seasons with the main irrigation application amounts of 5 mm 8 mm 10 mm and 13 mm of water the western half of the field was irrigated 29 times beginning may 30 and ending on september 10 2014 in total 269 mm of irrigation was applied the eastern half of the field was irrigated 32 times beginning may 15 and ending on august 16 2015 in total 281 mm of irrigation was applied the study sites were irrigated at full evapotranspiration estimated using climate data measured from a local weather station refer to section 2 6 2 3 soil sensor data apparent electrical conductivity data was collected across the study site using a veris msp3 salina ks usa fig 1 the shallow mode was used which enabled measuring soil apparent electrical conductivity at the depth of 0 0 0 30 m from the apparent electrical conductivity measurements three irrigation zones were established dry 0 6 1 2 ms m 1 intermediate 1 2 1 6 ms m 1 and wet 1 6 2 0 ms m 1 low apparent electrical conductivity values suggest coarser and drier soils while high apparent electrical conductivity measurements suggest finer and wetter soils corwin and lesch 2003 soil tension probes were placed on the field throughout the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons soil water tension was measured using hortau model tx 3 tension probes connected to a web tx4 field station lévis québec canada the tensiometer was connected to a mobile phone network and continuous measurements were collected every 30 min from 7 june 2014 to 14 september 2014 and from 7 june 2015 to 29 august 2015 in 2014 six tensiometers were placed within each irrigation zone at 0 20 0 30 and 0 45 m across the field fig 1 at each zone two soil tensiometers were placed at each depth in 2015 three tensiometers were placed two locations per zone at 0 20 and 0 45 m at each zone two soil tensiometers were placed at 0 20 m and one at 0 45 m 2 4 soil samples collection laboratory analysis and prediction of volumetric water content soil cores were collected from the field in 2015 and 2017 at 0 20 0 30 and 0 45 m and analyzed in the laboratory in 2015 soil cores were collected at each irrigation zone approximately 1 m from the tensiometers in 2017 soil cores were collected from each irrigation zone based on the eca of the field the analysis of the cores was described in yost and hartemink 2019 soil moisture characteristic curves were measured in the lab with van genuchten parameters estimated yost and hartemink 2019 the van genuchten equation 1980 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ m n m where θ is the soil volumetric water content θ s is the saturated soil water content θ r is the residual soil water content α m and n are shape parameters ψ m is the soil matrix potential as measured by the tensiometers volumetric water content values were predicted using the soil tension measurements collected in 2014 and the van genuchten models derived from the corresponding soil samples collected in 2015 and 2017 in each zone prediction of volumetric water content at six locations in 2015 was done using the soil tension measurements and the van genuchten models derived from the soil moisture characteristic samples collected in 2015 to reduce the short scale variation of soil properties across the field the mean values of all the tensiometers in each zone in 2014 and 2015 were used for daily soil water storage and deep drainage estimates 2 5 daily soil water storage and deep drainage estimates half hourly soil water storage mm in 0 45 m soil was calculated by averaging volumetric water content data based on the depths 2 soil water storage θ 0 0 0 20 m 200 mm θ 0 30 0 45 m 250 mm daily soil water storage was calculated using the mean values of the half hourly soil water storage data we observed that there were very few potato roots below 0 45 m so downward water flux at 0 45 m represents deep drainage hydrus 1d software pc progress was used to estimate the water flux at 0 45 m whereby the richards equation was solved to simulate water infiltration in 1 dimension richards 1931 šimůnek et al 2016 soil hydraulic properties and climate information were required to simulate water infiltration in this study rosetta pedo transfer functions schaap et al 2001 embedded in hydrus 1d software were used to estimate the van genuchten parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity simultaneously for different irrigation zones at the depths of 0 0 0 20 m and 0 30 0 45 m to avoid local scale variability of the soil hydraulic properties estimation was done using the measured mean values of soil particle size fractions sand silt and clay contents field capacity and permanent wilting point in each irrigation zone at two depths table 1 daily rainfall maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed during the experiment were obtained from the hancock agricultural research station approximately 12 km northeast of the study site daily reference evapotranspiration was calculated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 adjusted evapotranspiration was calculated by multiplying the daily reference evapotranspiration by a crop coefficient which was a function of the crop growth stage wisconsin irrigation scheduler 2018 2 6 soil water storage to quantify the temporal variations in soil water storage the average soil water storage in the top 0 45 m was calculated during three potato growth stages in 2014 and 2015 emergency to full cover full cover and full cover to harvest the spatial variation of soil water storage average soil water storage at different locations during full cover in 2014 and 2015 was used a linear regression model was fitted using jmp 11 software to predict average soil water storage across the field in 2014 and 2015 3 average soil water storage during full cover α β e c a where eca is apparent electrical conductivity and α and β are coefficients of the regression model 2 7 potato yield potato yield maps were derived using yield data collected from the farmers yield was also collected from each of the tensiometer locations in 2014 four 3 m rows were manually harvested and passed through a potato grader a similar procedure was used in 2015 however four 2 m rows harvested at each tensiometer location 3 results 3 1 distribution of soil properties in three irrigation zones the apparent electrical conductivity mapping was used to derive three irrigation zones i e dry intermediate and wet fig 1 although the differences between the three zones were small 1 ms m 1 subtle differences in soil properties were identified table 1 in the top 0 20 m sand content decreased as follows dry 94 intermediate 88 and wet 85 this was also the case for silt content and soil organic carbon in the top 0 20 m which was approximately twice as high in the intermediate and wet zones compared to the dry zone there were fewer differences below 0 30 m soil depth the differences in soil properties e g silt content and soil organic carbon led to different soil water storage under field capacity 10 kpa and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa in three zones yost and hartemink 2019 as shown in fig 2 soil water storage increased with depth soil water storage at field capacity in the top 0 45 m was largest in the wet zone 78 mm intermediate in the intermediate zone 71 mm and smallest in the dry zone 54 mm similarly soil water storage at the permanent wilting point in the top 0 45 m was 23 20 and 12 mm in the wet intermediate and dry zones crop available water storage were predicted to be 54 51 and 42 mm for these three zones 3 2 van genuchten parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity table 2 shows the summary statistics of the fitted van genuchten parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity using the rosetta software in general saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with depth and was largest in the dry zone 1607 and 818 mm day 1 intermediate in the intermediate zone 566 and 472 mm day 1 and smallest in the wet zone 254 and 312 mm day 1 at 0 0 0 20 m depth saturated hydraulic conductivity in the dry zone was more than 5 times larger than in the wet zone 3 3 volumetric water content distinct temporal dynamics of volumetric water content m3 m 3 were observed in three irrigation zones fig 3 throughout the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 volumetric water content at 0 0 0 20 m was highest in the wet zone and lowest in the dry zone however this was not the case for volumetric water content in 0 30 0 45 m in 2014 volumetric water content values were highest in the wet zone however volumetric water content values were highest in the intermediate zone in 2015 3 4 soil water storage temporal dynamics of soil water storage in the top 0 45 m was different for the three irrigation zones fig 4 during the growing season in 2014 soil water storage was highest in the wet zone and lowest in the dry zone to interpret the soil water storage in terms of crop available water the number of days as over the growing season for different soil moisture status was calculated table 3 in 2014 in the dry zone 53 of the days the volumetric water content values in 0 0 0 20 m were above field capacity while in the intermediate and wet zones 86 and 99 of days volumetric water content values were above field capacity at 0 30 0 45 m soil depth volumetric water content was above field capacity close to 100 all days in the three zones similar patterns were identified for soil water storage dynamics in 2015 fig 4 in 2015 soil water storage decreased from the wet zone to the dry zone however this was not the case for available crop water the dry intermediate and wet zones had 36 62 and 100 of days during which volumetric water content in 0 0 0 20 m was above the field capacity and 100 83 and 65 of days when volumetric water content in 0 30 0 45 m was above the field capacity 3 5 deep drainage deep drainage was estimated using the downward water flux at 0 45 m and its temporal dynamics were calculated for three zones fig 4 during the growing season in 2014 deep drainage was lowest in the dry zone and highest in the wet zone a different pattern was identified for deep drainage dynamics in 2015 in this case deep drainage was lowest in the wet zone and highest in the dry zone only small differences were identified for deep drainage values and dd r i in three irrigation zones table 4 this suggests that deep drainage was fairly uniform across the field despite the difference in soil water storage among three irrigation zones it is worth noting that deep drainage values in 2014 were higher than those in 2015 because of more rainfall and less evapotranspiration in 2014 compared to 2015 3 6 potato yields summary statistics of soil water storage in the three irrigation zones were shown in table 4 and fig 5 potato yields were significantly higher p 0 001 in the intermediate zone than the dry and wet zones while soil water storage during three growing stages and over the whole season continued to increase from the dry zone to the wet zone 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variation it was noted that the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity values were 4 to 6 times smaller than those reported by rawls et al 1982 and carsel 1988 for sand 5040 and 7128 mm day 1 respectively and loamy sand 1466 and 3502 mm day 1 respectively this was possibly due to the strong variability saturated hydraulic conductivity as identified from the soil cores standard deviation 2342 mm day 1 see yost and hartemink 2019 the variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity was also reported by carsel 1988 for sand and loamy sand standard deviation 3744 and 2726 mm day 1 respectively and can be caused by the preferential flows kung 1990 the spatial distribution of soil water dynamics can be extremely heterogeneous in agricultural fields as shown in this study soil water storage presented distinct patterns in a fairly uniform sandy field sand content 85 this was due to the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties across the field for example the field capacity in the top 0 20 m of the wet zone was 63 larger than that of the dry zone which was mainly caused by the subtle differences in silt clay and soil organic carbon content table 1 as reported by yost and hartemink 2019 field capacity permanent wilting point and available water capacity increased by 0 01 to 0 02 m3 m 3 with a 2 increase in silt plus clay content while available water capacity increased by approximately 0 05 m3 m 3 with a 1 increase in soil organic carbon however the difference of deep drainage in three zones was small even though the saturated hydraulic conductivity values were different table 2 rainfall evapotranspiration crop transpiration and irrigation were uniform at the field scale while the change of soil water storage was low due to the low field capacity of the sandy soils 0 20 m3 m 3 in this study the estimated deep drainage was between 150 and 250 mm over the growing season i e june to september and about 60 to 90 of the applied irrigation this was consistent with nocco et al 2018 who estimated deep drainage values of 106 to 538 mm june to december from 2013 to 2016 in potato growing fields in the sandy soils of the wisconsin central sands plains these deep drainage values suggest that potential groundwater recharge could occur in the sandy soils of these potato growing fields which is potentially beneficial to the regional groundwater recharge 4 2 temporal variation the temporal variation in soil water storage and deep drainage are considerable table 4 in general soil water storage was largest during emergence to full cover intermediate during full cover and smallest during full cover to harvest this is likely caused by increasing crop water use during the growing season and as a function of the increasing transpiration with increasing crop cover deep drainage generally decreased with time except for the dry zone in 2014 as the root systems develop with time causing increased water uptake in this study adjusted evapotranspiration was calculated using the potential evapotranspiration and a crop coefficient which was a function of the crop growth stage wisconsin irrigation scheduler 2018 this estimation is relatively accurate because impedance to water movement is controlled by the plant when the soil suction is low close to field capacity gardner and ehlig 1962 to further understand the temporal variations of transpiration and its impacts on soil water storage actual evapotranspiration should be estimated in the real time in the field gebler et al 2015 sharma et al 2017 4 3 potato yield a correlation analysis showed that potato yield was negatively correlated with soil water storage with pearson s correlation coefficients of 0 44 0 45 0 36 and 0 41 over emergence to full cover full cover full cover to harvest and the whole season respectively this suggests all three zones were over irrigated and the soil was close to saturation spatial distribution of soil water storage during full cover and crop yield using a yield monitor are shown in fig 6 the intermediate zone 80 90 mm is somewhat consistent with the area of higher yields conversely the low and high soil water storage zones corresponds to the intermediate and low yield when the soil became too wet i e the wet zone or too dry crop yields are reduced in the wet zone anaerobic conditions created by a waterlogging inhibits root activities and can lead to tuber rot burton and wigginton 1970 lund and nicholls 1970 in the dry zone soil water storage was below the permanent wilting points during 6 and 2 of the growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 and an insufficient water supply to the root systems could have caused crop stress and reduced yield turner and begg 1981 soil water storage in the intermediate and wet zones was found above field capacity of the soil during 60 100 of the growing season table 3 this suggested that these areas were over irrigated during the growing season based on the definition of plant available water capacity the portion of water above field capacity is not available to plants due to the inhibited root water uptake under low oxygen conditions if the water uptake was inhibited by wet soil conditions in the intermediate zone the potato yield of the intermediate and wet zones should be smaller than that of the dry zone assuming all the other agricultural management practices are the same previous studies have suggested the permanent wilting point was not related to crop transpiration and plant growth gardner and nieman 1964 meyer and boyer 1972 similarly it is thought that the field capacity may not always be the upper limit of the available water capacity and root water uptake and should be taken into consideration when modeling the root water uptake van genuchten 1987 4 4 implications the results of this study have a number of implications for soil and water management in sandy soils first the spatial variation of soil hydraulic properties in sandy soils can be high the variation in soil hydraulic properties contributes to differences in soil water storage and crop yield across the field to reduce the within field yield variation farmers need to characterize the spatial variations of soil properties e g available water capacity within the field and apply different strategies to different zones morgan et al 2003 given the wide applications of electromagnetic induction in soil and environmental studies doolittle and brevik 2014 a digital soil mapping approach can be used to obtain high resolution maps of soil physical and hydraulic properties at the field scale huang et al 2014 a negative correlation was found between soil water storage and crop yield this is most likely due to over irrigation and indicates the need to improve irrigation and water use efficiency without decreasing the crop yields during the manual potato harvest it was observed that some of the potatoes in the wet zone were rotting due to high volumetric water content throughout the growing season to achieve this soil moisture probes can be installed in zones of contrasting soil texture and hydraulic properties to obtain real time soil water dynamics information the methods used in this study can also be applied elsewhere given that temporal dynamics of key weather variables e g precipitation and temperature are difficult to predict particularly under the predicted climate change wisconsin initiative on climate change impacts 2011 future work is required to better understand soil plant atmosphere continuum and investigate the impacts of soil water status i e soil water content and potential on root water uptake and crop growth anderson et al 2003 this requires simultaneously measuring and modeling real time soil water status huang et al 2018 leaf turgor pressure and stem water status bramley et al 2015 in relation to crop growth and in different soil types shanahan et al 2015 in addition long term research can be carried out to study the relationship between average soil water storage at different growth stages and crop yield in different climate regimes and soil types 5 conclusions a spatial and temporal analysis of soil water dynamics during the growing season in a uniform sandy field revealed distinct patterns of soil water storage in space and time predicted potential groundwater recharge ranged from 150 to 250 mm during the growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 and showed little spatial variation a negative correlation was found between the average soil water storage and potato yields the variation of potato yields in space and time was likely due to over irrigation the methods used in this study can be applied elsewhere to improve irrigation efficiency and water use efficiency and mitigate the adverse impacts of changing climates on agricultural productivity future work is required to understand the soil plant atmosphere continuum and the impacts of soil water status i e soil water content and potential on root water uptake and crop growth based on long term research and in different climate regimes and
