21065,the hydrodynamic characteristics of cambered otter boards with a camber ratio of 15 and aspect ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 were investigated through flume tank experiments and cfd analysis for the cases in which the wingtips were blocked or unblocked in the blocked wingtip case the maximum lift coefficient stall angle and lift slope α 0 to 15 were approximately 1 75 15 and 0 115 deg 1 respectively regardless of the aspect ratio comparatively in the unblocked wingtip case maximum lift coefficients were 1 74 stall angle 40 1 65 35 1 54 25 and 1 50 20 and the lift slope increased from 0 063 to 0 097 deg 1 as the aspect ratio increased from 0 5 to 2 0 the drag coefficients for all unblocked wingtip models were larger for all considered angles of attack the effect of the wingtip flow formed around the otter board on the hydrodynamic characteristics was visualized using cfd analysis a small scale wingtip plate with a width of 0 1c was designed particularly for boards with aspect ratios of 1 0 1 5 and a 0 1c wingtip plate lift slopes and maximum lift coefficients approached those for the blocked wingtip cases and stall angles were close to those for the unblocked wingtip cases keywords cambered otter board hydrodynamic characteristics aspect ratio wingtip flow wingtip plate 1 introduction otter boards or trawl doors are devices that fulfill the crucial task of ensuring a suitable horizontal net opening at the required depth they generate a hydrodynamic lift force at the cost of introducing a drag force that adds to the total resistance the trawler must overcome since the invention of otter trawling at the beginning of the 20th century efforts have been made to design various types of trawl doors to improve hydrodynamic performance and static and dynamic stabilities as a result of these efforts a simple cambered otter board with an economical price and easy operation has been used widely numerous designs and modifications based on the cambered otter board are preferred in order to seek an optimal board to realize various types of otter trawls such as the bottom otter trawl semi pelagic otter trawl and mid water otter trawl süberkrüb 1959 crewe 1964 fao 1974 fukuda et al 2000 matuda 2001 mellibovsky et al 2015 you et al 2020a the aspect ratio λ b c defined as the span length b divided by the chord length c of the otter board is commonly less than 2 in contrast some boards having aspect ratios of more than 2 associated with large scale trawl nets are used for deep sea fishing in essence the otter board behaves like a low aspect ratio airfoil but its camber ratio cr f c defined as maximum camber f divided by chord length is large at 15 20 and the board operates at a higher angle of attack 20 to 35 than is usual for the wing crewe 1964 fao 1974 matuda 2001 in the past two decades a great deal of interest has been developed in the field of aerodynamics associated with low aspect ratio wings usually below 2 operating at low reynolds numbers roughly between 2 104 and 2 105 with the goal of aiding the design of unmanned aerial vehicles and micro air vehicles pelletier et al 2000 mueller et al 2003 torres et al 2004 cosyn et al 2006 shields et al 2012 mizoguchi et al 2013 the camber ratio for the low aspect ratio wings in these studies was less than 4 some were flat plates which is significantly smaller than usual for an otter board early experimental studies have revealed that classical aerodynamic theory although accurate for full scale aircraft analysis is inadequate for this combination of aspect ratio camber ratio and reynolds number furthermore wings with low aspect ratios exhibit unique aerodynamic properties such as a high stall angle yielding the maximum lift coefficient and nonlinear lift vs angle of attack pelletier et al 2000 mueller et al 2003 torres et al 2004 for a low aspect ratio wing the difference in air pressure between the pressure side lower surface and the suction side upper surface of the wing causes air to escape around the wingtip the wingtip flow is characterized by two tip vortices at the side edges of the wing and is located above the suction side of the wing the wingtip flow around the tips of a cambered otter board with a camber ratio of 15 in a free stream has also been visualized using the hydrogen bubble method as shown in fig 1 the lift mechanism for low aspect ratio wings can be summarized in terms of two additive sources of lift a linear source and a nonlinear source the linear lift can be modeled by the existence of circulation around the airfoil and is what is typically thought of as lift for higher aspect ratio wings nonlinear lift arises from the existence of strong wingtip vortices which generate wingtip flow velocities on the upper surface of the wing the ensuing decrease in pressure is considered to be the primary source of nonlinear lift for low aspect ratio wings at moderate to high angles of attack muller et al 2003 torres et al 2004 nevertheless the wingtip flow diverting the lift vector causes a drag component to be generated that is parallel to the freestream airflow which is referred to as the induced drag if the aspect ratio becomes small a larger wing area is affected by the wingtip flow as a result of increasing induced drag conversely if the span becomes large then the induced drag is less well formed at small influenced sections closest to the tip and the lift coefficient for the wing increases more sharply with increasing angle of attack mizoguchi et al 2013 tested flat plates with aspect ratios of 0 5 6 0 at reynolds numbers between 2 6 104 and 7 6 104 through a wind tunnel experiment they reported that the effect of wingtip flow was not very significant and the aerodynamic characteristics were qualitatively similar for wings with an aspect ratio of 3 0 or above although the magnitude of the effect for low aspect ratio wing structures has been emphasized few studies have examined the effect of wingtip flow on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a cambered otter board with a high camber ratio the design of cambered otter boards is perhaps hindered by the lack of a thorough understanding of the hydrodynamic characteristics associated with a low aspect ratio for a low aspect ratio wing several effective solutions such as winglets and wing endplates have been proposed either to alleviate or to benefit from the effects of the wingtip vortices based on a thorough understanding of the effect of wingtip flow on aerodynamic characteristics computational research was conducted by viieru et al 2003 in order to investigate the effects of winglet addition to a micro air vehicle at low angles of attack 6 and 15 and the results indicated that the lift and the lift to drag ratio were increased shields et al 2012 reported that the winglets on a tapered flat plate contributed to an increase in the lift coefficient at small angles of attack along with a reduction in the nonlinear behavior of the wing by displacing the tip vortex flow from the wing the idea behind wingtip devices is to diffuse the strong vortices released at the wingtips and to optimize the lift curve slope as well as aerodynamic efficiency while maintaining a relatively large stall angle within certain limits arora et al 2005 moreover the use of wingtip devices depends considerably on the issues for low aspect ratio wings that must be addressed this is also the case for a cambered otter board in the actual operation of an otter trawl the otter board is rigged by the anterior warp and posterior otter pendants the otter board operates at a given angle of attack with respect to the towing direction unlike a wing fixed to a fuselage the posture angles of attack heel and tilt of the otter board connected with flexible wires would be altered by disturbances such as contact with a subsea pipeline and turn sailing applied to the otter board during towing sala et al 2009 you et al 2020b however there is no practical method by which to directly control the posture of the towed otter board especially the angle of attack once the operation angle of the otter board exceeds its stall angle the spread of the otter board would shrink sharply due to a drastic decrease in lift coefficient eventually leading to low catch efficiency of the otter trawl in order to avoid this phenomenon the angle of attack of a commercial otter board is typically approximately 5 less than the stall angle on the other hand although the otter board is small compared to a trawl net its drag relative to the total drag of the entire assembly otter board warp and trawl net is responsible for roughly 10 30 of the total drag vincent et al 2006 diminishing the drag of the otter board is critical to the reduction of fuel consumption therefore an otter board with superior hydrodynamic efficiency excellent lift coefficient and low drag coefficient covering a wide range of angles of attack is sought in order to meet the needs of otter trawling in the present study cambered otter boards with a camber ratio of 15 and aspect ratios from 0 5 to 2 0 were adopted two large scale acrylic disks were installed 10 mm from the board so that no wingtip vortex occurred at the wingtip of the board through flume tank experiments the lift and drag characteristics of the cambered boards with and without disks blocking wingtip vortex development were measured for various angles of attack 0 50 operating at the current velocity range of 50 100 cm s respectively then a cfd approach was applied to cambered otter boards for both the blocked and unblocked wingtip cases in order to visualize the flow field around the board and to determine the effect of the wingtip flow on the hydrodynamic characteristics with respect to the aspect ratio and angle of attack finally in order to refine the hydrodynamic efficiency at an economical cost a practical and straightforward wingtip plate for the cambered otter board was proposed and tested in a flume tank experiment 2 materials and methods a model experiment and cfd analysis were carried out using four types of arc circular shaped otter board models with aspect ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the chord length of the models was 18 cm the maximum camber of the models was located in the middle of the chord and the camber ratio was 15 all models were fabricated from stainless steel sheets with a thickness of 2 0 mm without brackets 2 1 flume tank experiment to investigate the effect of wingtip flow on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cambered otter board hydrodynamic experiments on cambered otter board models were conducted in a circulating flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology observation section length 9 0 m width 2 2 m and water depth 1 6 m the measurement system was as shown in fig 2 in experiment 1 two acrylic disks with a thickness of 1 5 cm and a diameter for 130 5 cm mounted parallel to the flow were fixed onto four support rods which were covered with streamlined sheathes in order to reduce the turbulence generated by the support rods a steel rod length 36 cm diameter 16 mm was fixed to the top center of the cambered otter board model through a hole diameter 18 mm in the upper disk in order to enable connection to a six component balance electronic industrial co ltd maximum load 49 n rated power output 0 5 mv v hysteresis 0 5 ro which measured the lift force l and the drag force d the gap between the model and the upper or lower disk was adjusted to approximately 10 mm considering the safety of the flume tank experiment although the gap was suggested to be less than 0 5 of the wingspan converted value 0 45 1 8 mm in the present study as reported by rae et al 1984 for reference experiment 2 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cambered otter boards were measured in the free stream when two disks were removed in the present study the two cases are referred to as the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cases respectively load cells were calibrated through a series of gravity measurements in advance and before each experimental run we performed a zero reset step without a load being exerted on the devices the above two experiments were carried out at current velocities v from 50 to 100 cm s in increments of 10 cm s measured using a propeller type current meter kenek co ltd model vot2 200 20 measurement range 3 cm s to 200 cm s resolution 0 7 cm s installed 100 cm upstream of the model the root mean square deviation of the measured current was on the order of 1 6 cm s the angle of attack α of the models was set to be within the range from 0 to 50 in increments of 5 α 40 and 10 α 40 the temperature of the water was approximately 15 c during the experiments the method of data acquisition used in the present study was as follows 1 a load cell with a full capacity of 5 kgf recorded the acting force in the form of voltage signals 2 an excitation voltage of 5 v was used for all of the strain gauge bridges 3 noise in the data was filtered out 4 a 12 bit a d converter changed analog signals to digital signals which were real time and viewable on a monitor and 5 the actual force was determined based on the calibration coefficient the time series data including hydrodynamic forces were collected at a sampling frequency of 20 hz for a period of 20 s and the arithmetic mean of the data was adopted each experiment was repeated three times in order to assure the repeatability of the tests the lift coefficient c l 2l ρav 2 the drag coefficient c d 2d ρav 2 the lift to drag ratio e c l c d and the reynolds number r e vc ν can thus be calculated using the measured values of the current v lift l and drag d here a is the wing area of the otter board ρ is the water density and ν is the kinematic viscosity the reynolds number r e was in the range 6 8 104 to 1 3 105 the kline mcclintock technique kline and mcclintock 1953 for error propagation was used to evaluate all uncertainties in the hydrodynamic characteristics the uncertainties were approximately 6 for the lift coefficient and 3 for the drag coefficient for the investigated angles of attack the uncertainty in the angle of attack was determined to be on the order of 0 2 tests of the repeatability of the data presented in the present study showed that all the data were repeatable within the uncertainty bounds described earlier 2 2 computational fluid dynamics approach a schematic diagram and the feasibility of the cfd approach applied to otter boards e g a biplane type otter board and a rectangular otter board have been introduced and verified based on hydrodynamic performance and the flow field around the board compared with the results of flume tank experiments in prior studies takahashi et al 2015 xu et al 2017 you et al 2020c in the present study the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were solved using the cfd software fluent from ansys inc the flow was assumed to be steady incompressible and viscous the closure was provided using the realizable k ε turbulence model which is likely to provide superior performance for a flow involving a strong pressure gradient enhanced wall treatment was used for the wall function the volume integrated steady state versions of the governing equation were discretized using a finite volume approach and were solved using a segregated iterative solver with an algebraic multigrid method with under relaxation the simple method was used for the pressure velocity coupling spatial discretization for pressure momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate were carried out using a second order scheme the simulations were defined as having reached a converged solution when all residuals were reduced to less than 1 10 3 the models for the cfd approach were of the same scale as those tested in flume tank experiments fig 3 since the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cambered otter boards were symmetrical in shape a half model was adopted for the target model in order to simplify the calculation in order to avoid the blockage effect and disturbance of the outer boundaries the computational domains were sufficiently extended as shown in fig 3 the inlet region was far from the leading edge at 5c and the outlet in the downstream direction was at a distance of 10c from the leading edge the y direction boundary was extended by 10c the height in the z direction was the half span b 2 for the wingtip blocked models and is extended by 10c for the wingtip unblocked models fig 3 the computational grid around the model was generated with icem cfd the grids were unstructured tetrahedrons that were clustered around the models and a prismatic inflation layer was extruded from all surfaces of the model the element size of the far field in the calculation domain was 50 mm and the maximum element size of the otter board was set to be 2 mm in order to capture the viscous boundary layer well a grid dependency study on the initial layer height of the 15 layer prism was conducted in the pre test the results indicated that an initial layer height of 0 04 mm range 0 02 0 08 mm at a height ratio of 1 2 was sufficient for accurate prediction of the lift and drag the maximum number of elements totaled approximately 9 7 105 with the node elements totaling approximately 3 0 105 in the wingtip blocked case and these values for the wingtip unblocked case were 3 2 106 and 1 1 106 respectively the grids around the otter board were refined and the value of y was within the range of 1 5 in both cases the fluid was modeled as freshwater with a density of 998 2 kg m3 and a viscosity of 0 001003 kg ms the current velocity at the inlet boundary was set at a uniform flow of 1 0 m s r e 1 3 105 the pressure outlet condition used was downstream of the domain the walls of the model were assumed to be smooth and under no slip conditions the bottom of the computational domain was set to be symmetrical the upper surfaces in the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cases were assumed for a no slip wall and a moving wall respectively smooth walls under free slip conditions were assumed for the other walls the lift and drag coefficients were calculated varying from the angle of attack from 0 to 50 2 3 application testing of a small scale wingtip plate for the cambered otter board in order to achieve an excellent lift coefficient and low drag coefficient as well as a large stall angle for the cambered otter board a small scale wingtip plate has been designed as shown in fig 4 the maximum width of the plate was the sum of the maximum camber and the offset width h from the cambered otter board in the present study the maximum camber was a constant value of 15 c in previous studies it was reported that a width h of 0 1c was appropriate for a cambered otter board with an aspect ratio of 1 0 in the tested range from 0 to 0 2c shen et al 2015 in the present study we prepared such a pair of wingtip plates with an offset width of 0 1c to attach to the tips of the cambered otter board application testing of the wingtip plate was performed in the free stream and the lift and drag coefficients for the novel cambered otter board were obtained through a flume tank experiment furthermore the cfd approach as described above for the novel cambered otter boards with a 0 1c wingtip plate at an angle of attack of 10 and stall angles of 40 for an aspect ratio of 0 5 30 for an aspect ratio of 1 0 25 for an aspect ratio of 1 5 and 20 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 was also performed in order to visualize the flow field around the model 3 results 3 1 comparison of hydrodynamic characteristics of wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cambered otter boards the lift coefficient drag coefficient and lift to drag ratio for the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cambered otter boards with aspect ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 obtained through a flume tank experiment and cfd analysis are illustrated in fig 5 refer to appendix a based on the results of the model experiment and the cfd approach the differences in the lift and drag coefficients were generally less than 10 based on the angle of attack the changing trends of hydrodynamic characteristics including the lift to drag ratio across the angle of attack in the experiment were in excellent agreement with those of cfd analysis the feasibility of applying the cfd approach to the cambered otter board considered in the present study was confirmed with acceptable accuracy when the tips of the board were blocked the hydrodynamic characteristics of all otter board models were qualitatively similar and are referred to as experimental results fig 5a here c l increased approximately linearly for an increment in the angle of attack of less than 10 the rate of increase for c l dropped slightly for angles of attack above 10 maximum lift coefficients of approximately 1 75 for the models were obtained at an angle of attack of 15 stall angle moreover c d increased with the angle of attack although there was a slight difference in drag coefficient at various angles of attack the discrepancy in the lift to drag ratio with respect to the aspect ratio was remarkable at angles of attack below 10 and became negligible at angles of attack greater than 10 the lift to drag ratio for all models at an angle of attack of 20 which is a conventional operation angle in otter trawl was approximately 4 1 in addition in the wingtip blocked case a monotonically increasing trend of lift coefficient for the aspect ratio at an angle of attack of 10 from the flume tank experiment was not clear fig 5a however this trend was noticeable from the cfd results at an angle of attack of 10 fig 5b the gap of 10 mm between the model and the disks adopted during the flume tank experiment was a compromise in consideration of safety 0 5 of the span was not reached which may lead to slight differences in hydrodynamic characteristics for both investigation methods because of the experimental limitation for the otter board model without disks in the free stream the c l and c d curves showed nonlinear variation starting from an angle of attack of 0 fig 5a a reduction in the lift curve slope with decreasing aspect ratio was apparent the slopes of the lift coefficient in the range of angles of attack 0 15 decreased from 0 097 to 0 063 deg 1 as the aspect ratio decreased which was lower than the value of 0 115 deg 1 in the wingtip blocked case the maximum lift coefficients for the boards were 1 74 stall angle 40 1 65 35 1 54 25 and 1 50 20 in the order of aspect ratios from 0 5 to 2 0 showing an increasing tendency as the aspect ratio became small fig 5a drag coefficients when varying the angle of attack from 0 to 15 for all models were similar however c d became larger as the aspect ratio was decreased after 15 note that the drag coefficients for all wingtip unblocked models were larger than those in the wingtip blocked case before an angle of attack of 20 the lift to drag ratio for the wingtip unblocked models decreased as the aspect ratio decreased at α 20 the lift to drag ratio for the wingtip unblocked models decreased from 3 0 to 1 7 in the order of aspect ratios from 0 5 to 2 0 which is significantly lower than 4 1 in the wingtip blocked case 3 2 effect of wingtip flow on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cambered otter board the fluid flowing around the cambered otter boards at an angle of attack of 10 in both wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cases as well as that around the wingtip unblocked models at all considered stall angles is shown in fig 6 as an iso surface by a method involving the q criterion hunt et al 1988 fu et al 2013 the blue zone represents the fluid flow along the model surface or over the tips to form a wingtip vortex in contrast the grey zone indicates an area in which the flow separates from the surface at an angle of attack of 10 in the wingtip blocked case the wall shear stress distribution of the suction side and the static pressure distributions of suction and pressure sides for the models are illustrated in fig 7 the fluid flows from left to right the left hand boundary of each figure is the leading edge and the right hand boundary is the trailing edge of the otter board red and blue indicate high and low values respectively of the wall shear stress arrow or static pressure the opposite direction of the wall shear stress relative to the current from left to right indicates the existence of separated flow in addition the static pressure distributions for the wingtip unblocked models at an angle of attack of 10 and at the stall angles are shown in fig 8 when the wingtips of the board were completely blocked at an angle of attack of 10 fig 7a there was a thin region of separated flow which eventually reattached after separation on the suction side near the leading edge in particular a pair of vortices on the suction side close to the trailing edge developing from the tips to the central section of the otter board was observed based on the wall shear stress distribution the area influenced by the pair of vortices relative to the overall wing area in the wingtip blocked case became small as the aspect ratio increased eventually the elliptical shape of the wall shear stress distribution parallel to the flow direction for the otter board with an aspect ratio of 2 0 was formed as indicated by the grey area in fig 6a this is also reflected in the static pressure distribution as shown in fig 7b there was no significant difference in pressure distribution on the pressure side for all models at an angle of attack of 10 however a slight difference in the pressure distribution on the suction side was created the pair of vortices is likely to be taken into account for the monotonically increasing trend of the lift coefficient at an angle of attack of 10 in the wingtip blocked case fig 5b assuming that the span length of a cambered otter board is infinite no such vortex existed in addition the drag coefficient for the infinite span otter board is perhaps lower than that for the low aspect ratio wingtip blocked model fig 6b shows that the wingtip flow was formed closest to the half chord at an angle of attack of 10 for the otter board without blocking the wingtip the flow on the suction side remained attached until the trailing edge with the help of the wingtip flow which might be the reason why there was no noticeable pressure difference on the suction side for all aspect ratios fig 8a nevertheless the high pressure fluid on the pressure side flowed with the wingtip vortex and the loss proportion of high pressure decreased as the aspect ratio increased fig 8a this is reflected in the increasing trend of the lift coefficient with respect to the aspect ratio at α 10 on the other hand at an angle of attack of 10 compared with the wingtip unblocked otter board the wingtip blocked board with a larger pressure difference was assumed to have been subjected to a greater drag force but its drag coefficient was smaller than that for the wingtip unblocked otter board fig 5 the wingtip flow caused upwash and downwash fluid currents that altered the direction of the freestream flow generated induced drag from the lift force and consequently enhanced the overall drag force profile drag and induced drag note that even at a low angle of attack the proportion of the induced drag by the tip vortices relative to overall drag was qualitatively large when the angle of attack reached the stall angle for the wingtip unblocked cambered otter board the merged point of the wingtip flow moved forward to the leading edge the wingtip flow prevented the fluid on the forepart of the suction surface from completely stalling fig 6c consequently obtaining the maximum lift at a high angle of attack fig 8b shows that there is no remarkable difference in the pressure distribution at the pressure side at stall angles for the cambered otter board but the low pressure region of the suction side close to the trailing edge indicated in yellow decreased as the aspect ratio increased this tendency is consistent with the difference in the maximum lift coefficient for all aspect ratios simultaneously as a result of the high drag coefficients the induced drag of the board increased due to the wingtip flow until the stall angle was reached as observed through the vortical structure 3 3 hydrodynamic performance of the cambered otter board with a small scale wingtip plate the lift coefficient drag lift curve and lift to drag ratio for the cambered otter board with a 0 1c wingtip plate with respect to the angle of attack are shown in fig 9 refer to appendix b the results for the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cambered otter boards with an aspect ratio of 1 0 are also presented in the background for comparison as observed from the streamline around a wingtip section of the otter board fig 10 a the wingtip flow over the small scale wingtip plate was still able to energize the flow to move along the suction side of the otter board thereby delaying the onset of separation at low angles of attack the slopes of the lift coefficient for the models with a 0 1c wingtip plate in the range of angle of attack from 0 to 15 were 0 079 0 097 0 105 and 0 106 deg 1 in the order of aspect ratios from 0 5 to 2 0 which were larger than those in the wingtip unblocked case and gradually approached the slope values for the wingtip blocked case the performance indicated by the drag lift curves for the tested cambered otter boards was similar to that indicated by the lift angle slope if the profile drag is assumed to only be generated by the cambered otter board in the wingtip blocked case then the induced drag deducting the profile drag from overall resistance of the boards with 0 1c wingtip plates tended to increase as the aspect ratio decreased in addition the drag coefficient for the board with the pair of plates at an aspect ratio of 0 5 approached the curve for the wingtip unblocked otter board before reaching the stall angle this suggests that the induced drag would be well reduced by the 0 1c wingtip plate when the aspect ratio for the monoplane type otter board is larger than 0 5 compared with the wingtip unblocked board the lift to drag ratio for the models with a 0 1c wingtip plate at 20 increased to 2 4 for an aspect ratio of 0 5 3 0 for an aspect ratio of 1 0 3 5 for an aspect ratio of 1 5 and 3 7 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 fig 11 b shows that the wingtip flows at an angle of attack of 40 for an aspect ratio of 0 5 30 for an aspect ratio of 1 0 25 for an aspect ratio of 1 5 and 20 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 contributed to suppressing the flow separation over a large area of the suction surface the maximum lift coefficients for the boards at aspect ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 are 1 79 stall angle 42 1 80 30 1 71 27 and 1 63 22 respectively interestingly adopting a wingtip plate with an appropriate scale would not only improve the lift force and lift to drag ratio at low angles of attack but would also maintain the suppression effect of the wingtip flow on stalling with a higher maximum lift coefficient 4 discussion the hydrodynamic characteristics of the lateral wingtip flow were clarified with respect to the angle of attack and the aspect ratio using a cambered otter board with a camber ratio of 15 first the maximum lift coefficient can be obtained at a higher stall angle while decreasing the effective angle of attack to postpone the stall for example the stall angle is 40 for an aspect ratio of 0 5 and 20 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 in the free stream as compared with a stall angle of 15 for the models with the blocked wingtip note that c lmax for the wingtip unblocked otter board was lower than that for the wingtip blocked board due to the loss in pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side e g the maximum reduction was approximately 15 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 moreover the lift curve slope before the low angle of attack of 15 was considerably lower because of the suppressing effect on the flow separation on the suction side second the induced drag generated by the wingtip flow accounts for a large proportion of the overall resistance at low angles of attack consequently causing a low hydrodynamic efficiency in terms of the lift to drag ratio with a decrease of 25 55 at an angle of attack of 20 as compared with the otter board with disks blocking the wingtip flow many of the phenomena described thus far can be explained by the influence of the wingtip flow which contributed to the lift drag and lift to drag ratio it is instructive therefore either to reduce or benefit from the effect of the wingtip flow over the suction surface of the board with the addition of the wingtip plates or winglets in the present study a newly designed small scale wingtip plate with an offset width of 0 1c has been proposed in order to refine the hydrodynamic performance of commercial cambered otter boards the increasing trends of the lift coefficient and the lift to drag ratio at small angles of attack indicate that the static pressure on the pressure side was well prevented from being reduced by inclusion of a small wingtip plate interestingly the wingtip flow around the novel board still existed and remained useful for postponing the onset of flow separation at moderate to high angles of attack as in the wingtip unblocked case based on the improvement of the lift coefficient at low angles of attack the lift force of the model with the 0 1c wingtip plate continued to increase as the angle of attack increased up to the stall angle which revealed that the maximum lift coefficients for the models with wingtip plates were higher than those for the wingtip unblocked models based on the results of the application testing of the wingtip plate with a 0 1c offset width otter boards with aspect ratios of 1 0 and 1 5 performed excellently the maximum lift coefficient and the lift curve slope as well as the stall angles for the two otter boards guaranteed a broader range of operational angles of attack for high lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio with the excellent efficiency of the wingtip plate for a cambered otter board with an aspect ratio of 1 0 1 5 hyper lift trawl doors with a 0 1 c width wingtip plates at aspect ratios of 1 0 shen et al 2015 you et al 2020a and 1 33 hu et al 2017 have been proposed where the leading edge of the otter board is shaped into an airfoil not only a reduced scale model but also a full scale hyper lift trawl door in practical hauling operations for mid water and bottom otter trawling have exhibited superior hydrodynamic performance which is regarded as successful application of the wingtip plate for otter boards nevertheless satisfying the modification needs of otter boards for various aspect ratios using wingtip plates is difficult for an otter board with an aspect ratio of 2 0 the improvements in terms of the maximum lift coefficient stall angle and the slope of the lift coefficient were not excellent fukuda et al 2000 reported that the stall angle of a cambered otter board without plates in a free stream decreased from 20 to 15 when the aspect ratio was in the range of 2 0 6 0 this indicates that the wingtip effect on the postponement of stall became limited as the aspect ratio increased in this case instead of a wingtip plate structural modifications to an otter board with a high aspect ratio are can be conducted e g shape optimization you et al 2020b a biplane type structure fukuda et al 1997 takahashi et al 2015 you et al 2020c or a multi element structure mellibovsky et al 2018 xu et al 2018 in order to achieve excellent hydrodynamic performance an otter board with an aspect ratio of 0 5 is customarily used in the bottom otter trawl in which the seabed is contacted during towing although the maximum lift coefficient at a stall angle of 40 approximated the value of the wingtip blocked board the wingtip plate failed to considerably increase the lift curve slope at low angles of attack a high angle of attack e g 35 is thus adopted as the operation angle in order to ensure sufficient lift force for practical use nevertheless the high costs in terms of massive drag and low hydrodynamic efficiency for a board at a high angle of attack directly decrease the profitability of the trawlers worse still is that the area swept on the seabed by the otter board would become broader by using a high operation angle which would have a severe physical impact on the sediment mchugh et al 2017 amoroso et al 2018 mcconnaughey et al 2019 in the future efforts will be made to further mitigate the high intensity of trawl gear and seabed impact issues in otter trawling

21065,the hydrodynamic characteristics of cambered otter boards with a camber ratio of 15 and aspect ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 were investigated through flume tank experiments and cfd analysis for the cases in which the wingtips were blocked or unblocked in the blocked wingtip case the maximum lift coefficient stall angle and lift slope α 0 to 15 were approximately 1 75 15 and 0 115 deg 1 respectively regardless of the aspect ratio comparatively in the unblocked wingtip case maximum lift coefficients were 1 74 stall angle 40 1 65 35 1 54 25 and 1 50 20 and the lift slope increased from 0 063 to 0 097 deg 1 as the aspect ratio increased from 0 5 to 2 0 the drag coefficients for all unblocked wingtip models were larger for all considered angles of attack the effect of the wingtip flow formed around the otter board on the hydrodynamic characteristics was visualized using cfd analysis a small scale wingtip plate with a width of 0 1c was designed particularly for boards with aspect ratios of 1 0 1 5 and a 0 1c wingtip plate lift slopes and maximum lift coefficients approached those for the blocked wingtip cases and stall angles were close to those for the unblocked wingtip cases keywords cambered otter board hydrodynamic characteristics aspect ratio wingtip flow wingtip plate 1 introduction otter boards or trawl doors are devices that fulfill the crucial task of ensuring a suitable horizontal net opening at the required depth they generate a hydrodynamic lift force at the cost of introducing a drag force that adds to the total resistance the trawler must overcome since the invention of otter trawling at the beginning of the 20th century efforts have been made to design various types of trawl doors to improve hydrodynamic performance and static and dynamic stabilities as a result of these efforts a simple cambered otter board with an economical price and easy operation has been used widely numerous designs and modifications based on the cambered otter board are preferred in order to seek an optimal board to realize various types of otter trawls such as the bottom otter trawl semi pelagic otter trawl and mid water otter trawl süberkrüb 1959 crewe 1964 fao 1974 fukuda et al 2000 matuda 2001 mellibovsky et al 2015 you et al 2020a the aspect ratio λ b c defined as the span length b divided by the chord length c of the otter board is commonly less than 2 in contrast some boards having aspect ratios of more than 2 associated with large scale trawl nets are used for deep sea fishing in essence the otter board behaves like a low aspect ratio airfoil but its camber ratio cr f c defined as maximum camber f divided by chord length is large at 15 20 and the board operates at a higher angle of attack 20 to 35 than is usual for the wing crewe 1964 fao 1974 matuda 2001 in the past two decades a great deal of interest has been developed in the field of aerodynamics associated with low aspect ratio wings usually below 2 operating at low reynolds numbers roughly between 2 104 and 2 105 with the goal of aiding the design of unmanned aerial vehicles and micro air vehicles pelletier et al 2000 mueller et al 2003 torres et al 2004 cosyn et al 2006 shields et al 2012 mizoguchi et al 2013 the camber ratio for the low aspect ratio wings in these studies was less than 4 some were flat plates which is significantly smaller than usual for an otter board early experimental studies have revealed that classical aerodynamic theory although accurate for full scale aircraft analysis is inadequate for this combination of aspect ratio camber ratio and reynolds number furthermore wings with low aspect ratios exhibit unique aerodynamic properties such as a high stall angle yielding the maximum lift coefficient and nonlinear lift vs angle of attack pelletier et al 2000 mueller et al 2003 torres et al 2004 for a low aspect ratio wing the difference in air pressure between the pressure side lower surface and the suction side upper surface of the wing causes air to escape around the wingtip the wingtip flow is characterized by two tip vortices at the side edges of the wing and is located above the suction side of the wing the wingtip flow around the tips of a cambered otter board with a camber ratio of 15 in a free stream has also been visualized using the hydrogen bubble method as shown in fig 1 the lift mechanism for low aspect ratio wings can be summarized in terms of two additive sources of lift a linear source and a nonlinear source the linear lift can be modeled by the existence of circulation around the airfoil and is what is typically thought of as lift for higher aspect ratio wings nonlinear lift arises from the existence of strong wingtip vortices which generate wingtip flow velocities on the upper surface of the wing the ensuing decrease in pressure is considered to be the primary source of nonlinear lift for low aspect ratio wings at moderate to high angles of attack muller et al 2003 torres et al 2004 nevertheless the wingtip flow diverting the lift vector causes a drag component to be generated that is parallel to the freestream airflow which is referred to as the induced drag if the aspect ratio becomes small a larger wing area is affected by the wingtip flow as a result of increasing induced drag conversely if the span becomes large then the induced drag is less well formed at small influenced sections closest to the tip and the lift coefficient for the wing increases more sharply with increasing angle of attack mizoguchi et al 2013 tested flat plates with aspect ratios of 0 5 6 0 at reynolds numbers between 2 6 104 and 7 6 104 through a wind tunnel experiment they reported that the effect of wingtip flow was not very significant and the aerodynamic characteristics were qualitatively similar for wings with an aspect ratio of 3 0 or above although the magnitude of the effect for low aspect ratio wing structures has been emphasized few studies have examined the effect of wingtip flow on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a cambered otter board with a high camber ratio the design of cambered otter boards is perhaps hindered by the lack of a thorough understanding of the hydrodynamic characteristics associated with a low aspect ratio for a low aspect ratio wing several effective solutions such as winglets and wing endplates have been proposed either to alleviate or to benefit from the effects of the wingtip vortices based on a thorough understanding of the effect of wingtip flow on aerodynamic characteristics computational research was conducted by viieru et al 2003 in order to investigate the effects of winglet addition to a micro air vehicle at low angles of attack 6 and 15 and the results indicated that the lift and the lift to drag ratio were increased shields et al 2012 reported that the winglets on a tapered flat plate contributed to an increase in the lift coefficient at small angles of attack along with a reduction in the nonlinear behavior of the wing by displacing the tip vortex flow from the wing the idea behind wingtip devices is to diffuse the strong vortices released at the wingtips and to optimize the lift curve slope as well as aerodynamic efficiency while maintaining a relatively large stall angle within certain limits arora et al 2005 moreover the use of wingtip devices depends considerably on the issues for low aspect ratio wings that must be addressed this is also the case for a cambered otter board in the actual operation of an otter trawl the otter board is rigged by the anterior warp and posterior otter pendants the otter board operates at a given angle of attack with respect to the towing direction unlike a wing fixed to a fuselage the posture angles of attack heel and tilt of the otter board connected with flexible wires would be altered by disturbances such as contact with a subsea pipeline and turn sailing applied to the otter board during towing sala et al 2009 you et al 2020b however there is no practical method by which to directly control the posture of the towed otter board especially the angle of attack once the operation angle of the otter board exceeds its stall angle the spread of the otter board would shrink sharply due to a drastic decrease in lift coefficient eventually leading to low catch efficiency of the otter trawl in order to avoid this phenomenon the angle of attack of a commercial otter board is typically approximately 5 less than the stall angle on the other hand although the otter board is small compared to a trawl net its drag relative to the total drag of the entire assembly otter board warp and trawl net is responsible for roughly 10 30 of the total drag vincent et al 2006 diminishing the drag of the otter board is critical to the reduction of fuel consumption therefore an otter board with superior hydrodynamic efficiency excellent lift coefficient and low drag coefficient covering a wide range of angles of attack is sought in order to meet the needs of otter trawling in the present study cambered otter boards with a camber ratio of 15 and aspect ratios from 0 5 to 2 0 were adopted two large scale acrylic disks were installed 10 mm from the board so that no wingtip vortex occurred at the wingtip of the board through flume tank experiments the lift and drag characteristics of the cambered boards with and without disks blocking wingtip vortex development were measured for various angles of attack 0 50 operating at the current velocity range of 50 100 cm s respectively then a cfd approach was applied to cambered otter boards for both the blocked and unblocked wingtip cases in order to visualize the flow field around the board and to determine the effect of the wingtip flow on the hydrodynamic characteristics with respect to the aspect ratio and angle of attack finally in order to refine the hydrodynamic efficiency at an economical cost a practical and straightforward wingtip plate for the cambered otter board was proposed and tested in a flume tank experiment 2 materials and methods a model experiment and cfd analysis were carried out using four types of arc circular shaped otter board models with aspect ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the chord length of the models was 18 cm the maximum camber of the models was located in the middle of the chord and the camber ratio was 15 all models were fabricated from stainless steel sheets with a thickness of 2 0 mm without brackets 2 1 flume tank experiment to investigate the effect of wingtip flow on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cambered otter board hydrodynamic experiments on cambered otter board models were conducted in a circulating flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology observation section length 9 0 m width 2 2 m and water depth 1 6 m the measurement system was as shown in fig 2 in experiment 1 two acrylic disks with a thickness of 1 5 cm and a diameter for 130 5 cm mounted parallel to the flow were fixed onto four support rods which were covered with streamlined sheathes in order to reduce the turbulence generated by the support rods a steel rod length 36 cm diameter 16 mm was fixed to the top center of the cambered otter board model through a hole diameter 18 mm in the upper disk in order to enable connection to a six component balance electronic

adjusted to approximately 10 mm considering the safety of the flume tank experiment although the gap was suggested to be less than 0 5 of the wingspan converted value 0 45 1 8 mm in the present study as reported by rae et al 1984 for reference experiment 2 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cambered otter boards were measured in the free stream when two disks were removed in the present study the two cases are referred to as the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cases respectively load cells were calibrated through a series of gravity measurements in advance and before each experimental run we performed a zero reset step without a load being exerted on the devices the above two experiments were carried out at current velocities v from 50 to 100 cm s in increments of 10 cm s measured using a propeller type current meter kenek co ltd model vot2 200 20 measurement range 3 cm s to 200 cm s resolution 0 7 cm s installed 100 cm upstream of the model the root mean square deviation of the measured current was on the order of 1 6 cm s the angle of attack α of the models was set to be within the range from 0 to 50 in increments of 5 α 40 and 10 α 40 the temperature of the water was approximately 15 c during the experiments the method of data acquisition used in the present study was as follows 1 a load cell with a full capacity of 5 kgf recorded the acting force in the form of voltage signals 2 an excitation voltage of 5 v was used for all of the strain gauge bridges 3 noise in the data was filtered out 4 a 12 bit a d converter changed analog signals to digital signals which were real time and viewable on a monitor and 5 the actual force was determined based on the calibration coefficient the time series data including hydrodynamic forces were collected at a sampling frequency of 20 hz for a period of 20 s and the arithmetic mean of the data was adopted each experiment was repeated three times in order to assure the repeatability of the tests the lift

and drag d here a is the wing area of the otter board ρ is the water density and ν is the kinematic viscosity the reynolds number r e was in the range 6 8 104 to 1 3 105 the kline mcclintock technique kline and mcclintock 1953 for error propagation was used to evaluate all uncertainties in the hydrodynamic characteristics the uncertainties were approximately 6 for the lift coefficient and 3 for the drag coefficient for the investigated angles of attack the uncertainty in the angle of attack was determined to be on the order of 0 2 tests of the repeatability of the data presented in the present study showed that all the data were repeatable within the uncertainty bounds described earlier 2 2 computational fluid dynamics approach a schematic diagram and the feasibility of the cfd approach applied to otter boards e g a biplane type otter board and a rectangular otter board have been introduced and verified based on hydrodynamic performance and the flow field around the board compared with the results of flume tank experiments in prior studies takahashi et al 2015 xu et al 2017 you et al 2020c in the present study the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were solved using the cfd software fluent from ansys inc the flow was assumed to be steady incompressible and viscous the closure was provided using the realizable k ε turbulence model which is likely to provide

discretized using a finite volume approach and were solved using a segregated iterative solver with an algebraic multigrid method with under relaxation the simple method was used for the pressure velocity coupling spatial discretization for pressure momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate were carried out using a second order scheme the simulations were defined as having reached a converged solution when all residuals were reduced to less than 1 10 3 the models for the cfd approach were of the same scale as those tested in flume tank experiments fig 3 since the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cambered otter boards were symmetrical in shape a half model was adopted for the target model in order to simplify the calculation in order to avoid the blockage effect and disturbance of the outer boundaries the computational domains were sufficiently extended as shown in fig 3 the inlet region was far from the leading edge at 5c and the outlet in the downstream direction was at a distance of 10c from the leading edge the y direction boundary was extended by 10c the height in the z direction was the half span b 2 for the wingtip blocked models and is extended by 10c for the wingtip unblocked models fig 3 the computational grid around the model was generated with icem cfd the grids were unstructured tetrahedrons that were clustered around the models and a prismatic inflation layer was extruded from all surfaces of the model the element size of the far field in the calculation domain was 50 mm and the maximum element size of the otter board was set to be 2 mm in order to capture the viscous boundary layer well a grid dependency study on the initial layer height of the 15 layer prism was conducted in the pre test the results indicated that an initial layer height of 0 04 mm range 0 02 0 08 mm at a height ratio of 1 2 was sufficient for accurate prediction of the lift and drag the maximum number of elements totaled approximately 9 7 105 with the node elements totaling approximately 3 0 105 in the wingtip blocked case and these values for the wingtip unblocked case were 3 2 106 and 1 1 106 respectively the grids around the otter board were refined and the value of y was within the range of 1 5 in both cases the fluid was modeled as freshwater with a density of 998 2 kg m3 and a viscosity of 0 001003 kg ms the current velocity at the inlet boundary was set at a uniform flow of 1 0 m s r e 1 3 105 the pressure outlet condition used was downstream of the domain the walls of the model were assumed to be smooth and under no slip conditions the bottom of the computational domain was set to be symmetrical the upper surfaces in the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cases were assumed for a no slip wall and a moving wall respectively smooth walls under free slip conditions were assumed for the other walls the lift and drag coefficients were calculated varying from the angle of attack from 0 to 50 2 3 application testing of a small scale wingtip plate for the cambered otter board in order to achieve an excellent lift coefficient and low drag coefficient as well as a large stall angle for the cambered otter board a small scale wingtip plate has been designed as shown in fig 4 the maximum width of the plate was the sum of the maximum camber and the offset width h from the cambered otter board in the present study the maximum camber was a constant value of 15 c in previous studies it was reported that a width h of 0 1c was appropriate for a cambered otter board with an aspect ratio of 1 0 in the tested range from 0 to 0 2c shen et al 2015 in the present study we prepared such a pair of wingtip plates with an offset width of 0 1c to attach to the tips of the cambered otter board application testing of the wingtip plate was performed in the free stream and the lift and drag coefficients for the novel cambered otter board were obtained through a flume tank experiment furthermore the cfd approach as described above for the novel cambered otter boards with a 0 1c wingtip plate at an angle of attack of 10 and stall angles of 40 for an aspect ratio of 0 5 30 for an aspect ratio of 1 0 25 for an aspect ratio of 1 5 and 20 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 was also performed in order to visualize the flow field around the model 3 results 3 1 comparison of hydrodynamic characteristics of wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cambered otter boards the lift coefficient drag coefficient and lift to drag ratio for the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cambered otter boards with aspect ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 obtained through a flume tank experiment and cfd analysis are illustrated in fig 5 refer to appendix a based on the results of the model experiment and the cfd approach the differences in the lift and drag coefficients were generally less than 10 based on the angle of attack the changing trends of hydrodynamic characteristics including the lift to drag ratio across the angle of attack in the experiment were in excellent agreement with those of cfd analysis the feasibility of applying the cfd approach to the cambered otter board considered in the present study was confirmed with acceptable accuracy when the tips of the board were blocked the hydrodynamic characteristics of all otter board models were qualitatively similar and are referred to as experimental results fig 5a here c l increased approximately linearly for an increment in the angle of attack of less than 10 the rate of increase for c l dropped slightly for angles of attack above 10 maximum lift coefficients of approximately 1 75 for the models were obtained at an angle of attack of 15 stall angle moreover c d increased with the angle of attack although there was a slight difference in drag coefficient at various angles of attack the discrepancy in the lift to drag ratio with respect to the aspect ratio was remarkable at angles of attack below 10 and became negligible at angles of attack greater than 10 the lift to drag ratio for all models at an angle of attack of 20 which is a conventional operation angle in otter trawl was approximately 4 1 in addition in the wingtip blocked case a monotonically increasing trend of lift coefficient for the aspect ratio at an angle of attack of 10 from the flume tank experiment was not clear fig 5a however this trend was noticeable from the cfd results at an angle of attack of 10 fig 5b the gap of 10 mm between the model and the disks adopted during the flume tank experiment was a compromise in consideration of safety 0 5 of the span was not reached which may lead to slight differences in hydrodynamic characteristics for both investigation methods because of the experimental limitation for the otter board model without disks in the free stream the c l and c d curves showed nonlinear variation starting from an angle of attack of 0 fig 5a a reduction in the lift curve slope with decreasing aspect ratio was apparent the slopes of the lift coefficient in the range of angles of attack 0 15 decreased from 0 097 to 0 063 deg 1 as the aspect ratio decreased which was lower than the value of 0 115 deg 1 in the wingtip blocked case the maximum lift coefficients for the boards were 1 74 stall angle 40 1 65 35 1 54 25 and 1 50 20 in the order of aspect ratios from 0 5 to 2 0 showing an increasing tendency as the aspect ratio became small fig 5a drag coefficients when varying the angle of attack from 0 to 15 for all models were similar however c d became larger as the aspect ratio was decreased after 15 note that the drag coefficients for all wingtip unblocked models were larger than those in the wingtip blocked case before an angle of attack of 20 the lift to drag ratio for the wingtip unblocked models decreased as the aspect ratio decreased at α 20 the lift to drag ratio for the wingtip unblocked models decreased from 3 0 to 1 7 in the order of aspect ratios from 0 5 to 2 0 which is significantly lower than 4 1 in the wingtip blocked case 3 2 effect of wingtip flow on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cambered otter board the fluid flowing around the cambered otter boards at an angle of attack of 10 in both wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cases as well as that around the wingtip unblocked models at all considered stall angles is shown in fig 6 as an iso surface by a method involving the q criterion hunt et al 1988 fu et al 2013 the blue zone represents the fluid flow along the model surface or over the tips to form a wingtip vortex in contrast the grey zone indicates an area in which the flow separates from the surface at an angle of attack of 10 in the wingtip blocked case the wall shear stress distribution of the suction side and the static pressure distributions of suction and pressure sides for the models are illustrated in fig 7 the fluid flows from left to right the left hand boundary of each figure is the leading edge and the right hand boundary is the trailing edge of the otter board red and blue indicate high and low values respectively of the wall shear stress arrow or static pressure the opposite direction of the wall shear stress relative to the current from left to right indicates the existence of separated flow in addition the static pressure distributions for the wingtip unblocked models at an angle of attack of 10 and at the stall angles are shown in fig 8 when the wingtips of the board were completely blocked at an angle of attack of 10 fig 7a there was a thin region of separated flow which eventually reattached after separation on the suction side near the leading edge in particular a pair of vortices on the suction side close to the trailing edge developing from the tips to the central section of the otter board was observed based on the wall shear stress distribution the area influenced by the pair of vortices relative to the overall wing area in the wingtip blocked case became small as the aspect ratio increased eventually the elliptical shape of the wall shear stress distribution parallel to the flow direction for the otter board with an aspect ratio of 2 0 was formed as indicated by the grey area in fig 6a this is also reflected in the static pressure distribution as shown in fig 7b there was no significant difference in pressure distribution on the pressure side for all models at an angle of attack of 10 however a slight difference in the pressure distribution on the suction side was created the pair of vortices is likely to be taken into account for the monotonically increasing trend of the lift coefficient at an angle of attack of 10 in the wingtip blocked case fig 5b assuming that the span length of a cambered otter board is infinite no such vortex existed in addition the drag coefficient for the infinite span otter board is perhaps lower than that for the low aspect ratio wingtip blocked model fig 6b shows that the wingtip flow was formed closest to the half chord at an angle of attack of 10 for the otter board without blocking the wingtip the flow on the suction side remained attached until the trailing edge with the help of the wingtip flow which might be the reason why there was no noticeable pressure difference on the suction side for all aspect ratios fig 8a nevertheless the high pressure fluid on the pressure side flowed with the wingtip vortex and the loss proportion of high pressure decreased as the aspect ratio increased fig 8a this is reflected in the increasing trend of the lift coefficient with respect to the aspect ratio at α 10 on the other hand at an angle of attack of 10 compared with the wingtip unblocked otter board the wingtip blocked board with a larger pressure difference was assumed to have been subjected to a greater drag force but its drag coefficient was smaller than that for the wingtip unblocked otter board fig 5 the wingtip flow caused upwash and downwash fluid currents that altered the direction of the freestream flow generated induced drag from the lift force and consequently enhanced the overall drag force profile drag and induced drag note that even at a low angle of attack the proportion of the induced drag by the tip vortices relative to overall drag was qualitatively large when the angle of attack reached the stall angle for the wingtip unblocked cambered otter board the merged point of the wingtip flow moved forward to the leading edge the wingtip flow prevented the fluid on the forepart of the suction surface from completely stalling fig 6c consequently obtaining the maximum lift at a high angle of attack fig 8b shows that there is no remarkable difference in the pressure distribution at the pressure side at stall angles for the cambered otter board but the low pressure region of the suction side close to the trailing edge indicated in yellow decreased as the aspect ratio increased this tendency is consistent with the difference in the maximum lift coefficient for all aspect ratios simultaneously as a result of the high drag coefficients the induced drag of the board increased due to the wingtip flow until the stall angle was reached as observed through the vortical structure 3 3 hydrodynamic performance of the cambered otter board with a small scale wingtip plate the lift coefficient drag lift curve and lift to drag ratio for the cambered otter board with a 0 1c wingtip plate with respect to the angle of attack are shown in fig 9 refer to appendix b the results for the wingtip blocked and wingtip unblocked cambered otter boards with an aspect ratio of 1 0 are also presented in the background for comparison as observed from the streamline around a wingtip section of the otter board fig 10 a the wingtip flow over the small scale wingtip plate was still able to energize the flow to move along the suction side of the otter board thereby delaying the onset of separation at low angles of attack the slopes of the lift coefficient for the models with a 0 1c wingtip plate in the range of angle of attack from 0 to 15 were 0 079 0 097 0 105 and 0 106 deg 1 in the order of aspect ratios from 0 5 to 2 0 which were larger than those in the wingtip unblocked case and gradually approached the slope values for the wingtip blocked case the performance indicated by the drag lift curves for the tested cambered otter boards was similar to that indicated by the lift angle slope if the profile drag is assumed to only be generated by the cambered otter board in the wingtip blocked case then the induced drag deducting the profile drag from overall resistance of the boards with 0 1c wingtip plates tended to increase as the aspect ratio decreased in addition the drag coefficient for the board with the pair of plates at an aspect ratio of 0 5 approached the curve for the wingtip unblocked otter board before reaching the stall angle this suggests that the induced drag would be well reduced by the 0 1c wingtip plate when the aspect ratio for the monoplane type otter board is larger than 0 5 compared with the wingtip unblocked board the lift to drag ratio for the models with a 0 1c wingtip plate at 20 increased to 2 4 for an aspect ratio of 0 5 3 0 for an aspect ratio of 1 0 3 5 for an aspect ratio of 1 5 and 3 7 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 fig 11 b shows that the wingtip flows at an angle of attack of 40 for an aspect ratio of 0 5 30 for an aspect ratio of 1 0 25 for an aspect ratio of 1 5 and 20 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 contributed to suppressing the flow separation over a large area of the suction surface the maximum lift coefficients for the boards at aspect ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 are 1 79 stall angle 42 1 80 30 1 71 27 and 1 63 22 respectively interestingly adopting a wingtip plate with an appropriate scale would not only improve the lift force and lift to drag ratio at low angles of attack but would also maintain the suppression effect of the wingtip flow on stalling with a higher maximum lift coefficient 4 discussion the hydrodynamic characteristics of the lateral wingtip flow were clarified with respect to the angle of attack and the aspect ratio using a cambered otter board with a camber ratio of 15 first the maximum lift coefficient can be obtained at a higher stall angle while decreasing the effective angle of attack to postpone the stall for example the stall angle is 40 for an aspect ratio of 0 5 and 20 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 in the free stream as compared with a stall angle of 15 for the models with the blocked wingtip note that c lmax for the wingtip unblocked otter board was lower than that for the wingtip blocked board due to the loss in pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side e g the maximum reduction was approximately 15 for an aspect ratio of 2 0 moreover the lift curve slope before the low angle of attack of 15 was considerably lower because of the suppressing effect on the flow separation on the suction side second the induced drag generated by the wingtip flow accounts for a large proportion of the overall resistance at low angles of attack consequently causing a low hydrodynamic efficiency in terms of the lift to drag ratio with a decrease of 25 55 at an angle of attack of 20 as compared with the otter board with disks blocking the wingtip flow many of the phenomena described thus far can be explained by the influence of the wingtip flow which contributed to the lift drag and lift to drag ratio it is instructive therefore either to reduce or benefit from the effect of the wingtip flow over the suction surface of the board with the addition of the wingtip plates or winglets in the present study a newly designed small scale wingtip plate with an offset width of 0 1c has been proposed in order to refine the hydrodynamic performance of commercial cambered otter boards the increasing trends of the lift coefficient and the lift to drag ratio at small angles of attack indicate that the static pressure on the pressure side was well prevented from being reduced by inclusion of a small wingtip plate interestingly the wingtip flow around the novel board still existed and remained useful for postponing the onset of flow separation at moderate to high angles of attack as in the wingtip unblocked case based on the improvement of the lift coefficient at low angles of attack the lift force of the model with the 0 1c wingtip plate continued to increase as the angle of attack increased up to the stall angle which revealed that the maximum lift coefficients for the models with wingtip plates were higher than those for the wingtip unblocked models based on the results of the application testing of the wingtip plate with a 0 1c offset width otter boards with aspect ratios of 1 0 and 1 5 performed excellently the maximum lift coefficient and the lift curve slope as well as the stall angles for the two otter boards guaranteed a broader range of operational angles of attack for high lift coefficient and lift to drag ratio with the excellent efficiency of the wingtip plate for a cambered otter board with an aspect ratio of 1 0 1 5 hyper lift trawl doors with a 0 1 c width wingtip plates at aspect ratios of 1 0 shen et al 2015 you et al 2020a and 1 33 hu et al 2017 have been proposed where the leading edge of the otter board is shaped into an airfoil not only a reduced scale model but also a full scale hyper lift trawl door in practical hauling operations for mid water and bottom otter trawling have exhibited superior hydrodynamic performance which is regarded as successful application of the wingtip plate for otter boards nevertheless satisfying the modification needs of otter boards for various aspect ratios using wingtip plates is difficult for an otter board with an aspect ratio of 2 0 the improvements in terms of the maximum lift coefficient stall angle and the slope of the lift coefficient were not excellent fukuda et al 2000 reported that the stall angle of a cambered otter board without plates in a free stream decreased from 20 to 15 when the aspect ratio was in the range of 2 0 6 0 this indicates that the wingtip effect on the postponement of stall became limited as the aspect ratio increased in this case instead of a wingtip plate structural modifications to an otter board with a high aspect ratio are can be conducted e g shape optimization you et al 2020b a biplane type structure fukuda et al 1997 takahashi et al 2015 you et al 2020c or a multi element structure mellibovsky et al 2018 xu et al 2018 in order to achieve excellent hydrodynamic performance an otter board with an aspect ratio of 0 5 is customarily used in the bottom otter trawl in which the seabed is contacted during towing although the maximum lift coefficient at a stall angle of 40 approximated the value of the wingtip blocked board the wingtip plate failed to considerably increase the lift curve slope at low angles of attack a high angle of attack e g 35 is thus adopted as the operation angle in order to ensure sufficient lift force for practical use nevertheless the high costs in terms of massive drag and low hydrodynamic efficiency for a board at a high angle of attack directly decrease the profitability of the trawlers worse still is that the area swept on the seabed by the otter board would become broader by using a high operation angle which would have a severe physical impact on the sediment mchugh et al 2017 amoroso et al 2018 mcconnaughey et al 2019 in the future efforts will be made to further mitigate the high intensity of trawl gear and seabed impact issues in otter trawling

21066,oscillating water column owc with its mechanism based on converting hydrodynamic energy into pneumatic energy is one of the earliest wave energy converters studied by researchers while the focus of the previous studies were mainly on hydrodynamic efficiency this paper addresses free surface fluctuation inside the owc chamber emphasizing on sloshing phenomenon through irregular wave impingement as reflection response of an offshore owc plays an important role in energy conversion chain this paper also provides an insight of wave reflection by such devices the experimental results show that decreasing damping effect boosts the sloshing energy stored inside the owc chamber but the ratio of sloshing energy content to the total stored energy inside the chamber decreases accentuating the importance of tuning short period waves with larger slot sizes in the context of reflection response of an owc relative depth kd is the most important factor which can make a great difference in reflection coefficients even up to 100 spectral reflection analysis shows that regardless of incident wave height slot size and draft value there is a range of relative chamber length l

of fossil energy and its pollutant nature it is indispensable to find a solution for world future energy demand and renewable energy seems to be the best substitution to escape energy crisis among different kinds of renewable energies wave energy is one of the best resources as it includes higher energy density khan et al 2017 wave energy as an almost untapped resource of renewable energy is one the most interesting marine issues researchers have studied in the last two decades of the numerous devices devised for converting wave energy to electricity falcão 2010 lópez et al 2013 one that particularly stands out is oscillating water column owc consisting of a chamber which can be built as a bottom fixed shore or nearshore device or can be a bottom detached structure placed offshore the mechanism of owc working includes wave induced water fluctuation inside a chamber followed by air compressing or decompressing the pressurized air flow passes through a vent or nozzle to drive a turbine installed to the chamber the latter mechanism is done by the so called power take off pto system although there are a lot of studies on owcs even leaded to full scale prototypes falcão 2000 heath et al 2000 washio et al 2000 they are not fully commercialized due to their sophisticated hydrodynamic behavior and there are steps to bridge the gap between research and industry lots of studies have been performed to examine hydrodynamic behavior of an owc evans 1978 was among the first researchers conducted an investigation on hydrodynamic behavior of a fixed owc assuming inner chamber water fluctuation as a rigid piston as well as a weightless one a plausible assumption provided that the ratio of wavelength to chamber size is substantial later researchers falcão and sarmento 1980 falnes and mciver 1985 developed the weightless rigid piston model by exerting periodic surface pressure distribution which allows considering non plane free surface fluctuation inadequacy of potential theories in taking nonlinear interaction such as sloshing and wave breaking into account accompanied by advances in computing processes power conveyed the researchers to those studies which are based on solving navier stokes equation these investigations were mainly based on finite volume method fvm çelik and altunkaynak 2020 iturrioz et al 2015 kamath et al 2015a lopez et al 2014 luo et al 2014 mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 simonetti et al 2017 2018 teixeira et al 2013 vyzikas et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 even though utilizing smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method in analyzing hydrodynamic performance of an owc was applied lately crespo et al 2017 didier et al 2016 wen et al 2018 contrary to numerical studies conducting experimental tests on owcs is quite limited but indispensable and this limitation is more pronounced for offshore owcs perhaps due to their higher costs however it should be kept in mind that in comparison with shore based owcs offshore ones have the merit of being subjected to higher wave energy moreover they are appropriate choices at small islands or offshore construction sites where conventional source of energy is unavailable or costly he et al 2017 regarding experimental studies on fixed offshore owcs crema et al 2015 worked on a 1 50 scaled model of owc they investigated the effects of wave frequency and chamber geometry such as chamber width and front wall draft on owc efficiency the experimental tests conducted by elhanafi et al 2017c and elhanafi and kim 2018 on offshore stationary owcs were another data set in the context of analyzing owc efficiency moreover they have much done to advance the knowledge of harnessing wave energy using owcs based on numerically developed cfd model implemented in star ccm elhanafi et al 2017a 2017b 2017d 2017e reviewing the aforementioned researches show that most of the previous studies focused on hydrodynamic efficiency of an owc device either shore based or offshore located and less attention was paid to the complex hydrodynamic especially to the nonlinear phenomenon inside the chamber that is to say sloshing although an attempt was made by çelik and altunkaynak 2018 who studied water fluctuation and sloshing inside the owc chamber under regular wave attack sloshing relevance to geometric and hydrodynamic parameters needs to be fully studied particularly under irregular wave impingement where distribution of energy content over wider frequencies gives a new insight of sloshing phenomenon another important wave structure interaction which takes place outside the chamber is reflection generally there are two main reasons for investigation on reflection response of an owc the first one is to separate the incident wave in order to measure the incoming wave energy and consequently the device efficiency correctly and the second one is to understand the mechanism of an important part of the energy conversion chain which was neither absorbed nor transmitted from another aspect analyzing hydrodynamic behavior shouldn t be restricted to the owc efficiency as owcs can be integrated with breakwaters mustapa et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 a logical idea to reduce its construction cost which has drawn researches attention recently howe et al 2020a 2020b hence presenting reflection response of the owcs is of great importance as it is one of the usual parameters which should be taken into account during the design procedure investigation on the reflection of an owc and its influence on both energy efficiency and wave forces analysis has been conducted in the literature in this regard viviano et al 2016 determined their shore based owc reflection response it should be noted that reflection and energy balance of shore based and offshore owcs which is the case of this research are completely different elhanafi et al 2016 2017a moreover he and huang 2014 conducted experimental tests to determine reflection and transmission coefficients of a floating type owc integrated with breakwater influenced by regular waves however their research includes differences other than wave condition since they studied an owc with symmetric wall not located in deep water zone as the ratio of water depth to wavelength d l was between 0 14 and 0 32 although the mentioned works presented a good insight of wave owc interaction to the best knowledge of the authors wave reflection and sloshing phenomenon in a fixed offshore owc influenced by irregular wave attack has not yet been studied especially under different geometric and hydrodynamic parameters moreover the current study has the advantage of being conducted in a towing tank this is of great importance since most of the previous studies suffer from sidewall effects which can significantly influence on results in this regard elhanafi et al 2017e showed that modeling offshore owcs in a 2d domain or a narrow wave flume substantially overestimates the owc device performance to be crystal clear the aim of this paper can be classified to two main points the first one is to illustrate sloshing phenomenon and its relevance to hydrodynamic and geometric parameters the second point is to analyze wave reflection by an offshore located owc these issues are of great importance as better understanding of what is happening inside and outside the chamber will definitely help engineers to design an efficient owc the rest of the paper is organized as follows the next section is dedicated to setting up the physical model including instrumentation wave tank information and wave condition then section 3 presents theoretical background of sloshing phenomenon and reflection calculation procedure section 4 provides the results in two main categories inner chamber fluctuation and reflection by owc accompanied by discussion on the current findings finally the paper ends with concluding remarks 2 experimental methodology 2 1 model set up the experimental tests were performed in the towing tank of national iranian marine laboratory nimala tehran iran the towing tank is 400 m long 6 m wide and 4 m deep the laboratory is equipped with a piston type wave maker which is able to generate regular and irregular waves up to 40 cm height and 3 s period towing tank long length accompanied by artificial beach at the end of the tank ensure that reflection of the transmitted waves will not influence on incident waves to hold owc in its position without any displacement a steel frame was designed and auxiliary tight cables were used in order to stop any wave induced movement of the owc structure fig 1 depicts the steel frame and the owc model which was connected to it in a layout and 3d view respectively for transporting such a huge frame along the towing tank six wheels were used each having 1000 kg loading capacity after reaching to the appropriate position i e 38 m far from the wave generator system the wheels of the frame were removed using a handy jack to put the frame on the ground a physical 1 15 scale model of a fixed offshore owc was built using plexiglass material of 10 mm thickness it is worth mentioning that couple of parameters such as practical wave data in the north west part of indian ocean and also southern region of caspian sea mazaheri et al 2013 characteristics of nimala towing tank and its associated wave maker have been considered in determining the model scale in addition to above points the previous studies crema et al 2015 elhanafi et al 2017b 2017e he et al 2017 have been used towards the selection of the scale and other characteristics of the experimental model detailed explanation of chosen dimensions shown in fig 2 can be found in the authors published paper zabihi et al 2019 the thickness of the owc front wall was considered to be 14 mm to lessen the probability of distortion or damage considering fig 2 chamber length l is 0 8 m chamber width w is 0 92 m and total chamber height z is 1 11 m as elhanafi et al 2017e stated conducting experiments in a narrow wave flume bounded to the owc wall leads to overestimation of the owc efficiency particularly in wave frequencies higher than chamber resonant frequency hence to remove wall effects the owc model was set up in the midpoint of wave tank width so that the ratio of owc width to towing tank breadth was smaller than 0 2 chakrabarti 1994 in another word the minimum distance to tank side walls in order to neglect wall effects was met three wave gauges wg were employed to measure incident wave outside the owc chamber two also were used inside the chamber to track the water fluctuation inside the owc device the method of mansard and funke 1980 was applied for separation of incident and reflected waves two pressure sensors ps were used to measure air pressure induced by water fluctuation inside the chamber it should be noted that ps data are not presented in this paper as the focus of this paper is on reflection response of owc and water fluctuation inside the chamber all data were sampled with frequency of 50 hz a top view of the wgs location as well as owc position is schematically shown in fig 3 and fig 4 generally the wave gauges distances were determined based on mansard and funke 1980 the wave gauge 3 has been placed approximately 6 m far from the owc structure which is equal to the average of incident wavelengths tested the other distances were determined based on the following recommendations mansard and funke 1980 1 x 13 l p 5 x 13 3 l p 10 x 12 p l p 2 x 13 q x 12 where x12 is the distance between wave gauge 1 and 2 x13 also indicates the distance between gauge 1 and 3 p and q are integers and l p denote peak wavelength a widely used approach to simulate damping effect in an owc physical model is applying an orifice or a slot in the current research slot opening was used it is denoted by s in fig 4 moreover exact indication of the pss location on chamber roof can be found in fig 4 further details on experimental set up and uncertainty of the measurements can be found in the newly published paper of the authors zabihi et al 2019 2 2 wave characteristic and range of the tested parameters standard jonswap spectrum was applied and introduced into the wave maker in this paper the parametrized jonswap spectrum is given as follows 2 s f α h s 2 f p 4 f 5 γ b exp 5 4 f p f 4 where α 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ h s is significant wave height f is the wave frequency and f p is the peak wave frequency γ is known as spectral peak enhancement coefficient which is considered to be 3 3 in this paper and b exp f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 where σ 0 07 for f f p otherwise σ 0 09 for f f p each test lasted for 250 300 s the range of the tested parameters including both wave characteristics and geometric factors are presented in table 1 h m0 is the spectral wave height and t p is the peak wave period water depth d was 4 m and it was remained unchanged in all the tests dr represents front wall draft of the owc to be comparable with similar studies some non dimensional parameters including ratio of the front wall draft to water depth wave height to front wall draft and slot ratio are introduced it is noted that slot ratio is defined as the ratio of slot area to chamber roof area multiplied by 100 3 theoretical background this section includes two subsections a brief explanation of sloshing phenomenon is presented in the first part and then an abridged description for incident and reflected wave separation is illustrated in the second part 3 1 sloshing prior to presenting results a brief description of sloshing phenomenon occurring inside the owc chamber is explained in this part sloshing is a nonlinear phenomenon which is possible to happen at closed tanks therefore wave owc interaction may cause sloshing in owc chamber sloshing gets in the way of chambers piston type oscillation consequently results in almost zero chamber pressure this zero pressure is rooted in negligible change in the air volume which is trapped in the chamber hence sloshing should be avoided in designing procedure of owcs for removing sloshing effect completely chamber length must be very small in comparison to incident wavelength this is the case where rigid piston behavior is governing however for capturing incident wave energy there is always an optimum ratio for chamber length to incident wavelength for a closed tank like an owc chamber sloshing modes can be depicted using fig 5 sloshing modes can be determined using the following relation k l n π where k is wave number l is chamber length and n represents the nth mode rabinovich 2009 all odd modes are asymmetric while even modes are symmetric the fundamental mode occurs when the incident wavelength is twice the chamber length other modes have wavelengths equal to one half one third one forth and so on of the wavelength of the fundamental mode rabinovich 2009 considering that chamber net length was 0 78 m and being constant during the tests first and second mode of sloshing can be seen at frequency of 1 hz and 1 4 hz respectively another point which should be considered is that for regular incident waves the possibility of detecting sloshing energy content in the inner chamber fluctuation spectrum is much less than that of irregular waves this is due to the fact that for incident waves of random type the wave owc interaction leads to higher energy transfer between different wave frequencies rather than what may be detected in regular incident waves considering the abovementioned points spectral analysis can be employed for studying different modes of sloshing and its corresponding energy a brief definition of spectrum density is presented in the following paragraph based on liu and frigaard 1999 the spectrum density shows the distribution of wave energy over different frequencies it provides a frequency decomposition in harmonics which their behavior is interested any surface elevation measurement contains a series of data with constant interval sampling rate if the sampling frequency is f s then the time between two consecutive measurements will be 1 f s assuming that n data sampling has been recorded then the duration of a test would be t d n 1 f s to convert an irregular surface elevation η t into a spectrum it is needed to decompose the irregular wave into its linear components this can be done using fourier series 3 η t a 0 2 i 1 n 1 a i cos 2 π i t d t b i sin 2 π i t d t 2 i 0 n 1 a i cos ω i t b i sin ω i t where ω i is the angular frequency a and b are fourier coefficients given by 4 a i 1 t d 0 t d η t cos ω i t d t b i 1 t d 0 t d η t sin ω i t d t where i 0 1 2 n 1 the eq 3 can be rewritten as what follows 5 η t i 0 n 1 2 c i cos ω i t δ i where 2 c i 2 a i 2 b i 2 represents the amplitude and δ i is the random phase now the spectral density can be defined as 6 s f 2 c i 2 2 δ f 2 a i 2 b i 2 δ f where δ f is the frequency bandwidth it should be noted that applying fft leads to real and complex aliasing parts to solve the aliasing after fourier analysis the concept of nyquist frequency known also as cut off frequency which is equal to f s 2 is used it assumes that there is no linear components in irregular wave time series whose frequency is greater than nyquist frequency 3 2 reflection coefficient and reflection function separating incident and reflected waves are explained in detail by faraci et al 2014 however the mathematical background is presented in the following paragraph briefly wave surface elevation can be defined as the composition of linear incident and reflected wave components in its complex form it is as follows 7 η n n n a i n e i ω n t k n x a r n e i ω n t k n x f o r n 0 where a in and a rn are the complex parameters indicating incident and reflected components respectively their absolute values represent the amplitude t is time x is wave propagation direction subscript n shows nth harmonic component ω n is angular frequency defined as ω n 2 π n t d where in the aforementioned relation t d represents the total test duration k n is the wave number after applying fourier transformation on water surface elevation measured by each probe called as m it can be written as function of a complex parameter f n m 8 η m n n n f n m e i ω n now from eq 7 the following relation can be obtained 9 f n m a i n e i k n x m a r n e i k n x m where x m represents the location of the probe m this method can be applied for each of the probes for 3 probes which is the case in this study method described by mansard and funke 1980 based on least square method can be employed to solve the unknowns as stated before absolute values of a in and a rn are correspondent to incident and reflected wave amplitude for the nth harmonic respectively therefore reflection function cr f for each wave frequency component can be determined as 10 c r f a r n a i n and total wave reflection coefficient can be obtained using eq 11 11 c r n n 1 n 2 a r n 2 n n 1 n 2 a i n 2 where n 1 and n 2 are the lower and the upper limits of the spectral range which were used to obtain reflection value 4 results and discussion 4 1 inner chamber water fluctuation water fluctuation inside the chamber can be discussed at two frequencies the primary energy content will be stored at frequencies equal to incident peak wave frequency wave owc interaction causes the energy content inside the chamber to be transferred into the higher frequencies the energy content corresponding to higher frequencies can be treated as sloshing energy although the energy content associated with sloshing frequencies is less than the energy corresponding to lower frequencies sloshing influences on extracting wave energy and forces acting on owc walls therefore it should be considered in designing owcs in what follows sloshing energy content influenced by wave period wave height slot size and front wall draft is examined first then analyzing of primary energy content is presented following the sloshing phenomenon discussion 4 1 1 sloshing induced water fluctuation inside the chamber as mentioned earlier sloshing modes depend on the ratio of wavelength to chamber length hence wavelength or wave period must be the most important factor in evaluating sloshing fig 6 shows inner chamber spectra for four different relative depths kd it should be noted that kd is a non dimensional parameter which is the product of the wave number k 2 π l p and the water depth d where l p stands for peak wavelength the measured spectra for both of the wgs are shown it should be noted that wave height h m0 15 cm front wall draft dr 20 cm and slot size s 1 cm were all unchanged for evaluation of wave period effect it is clearly visible that for incident waves of shorter periods kd 6 29 sloshing energy at frequency of 1 hz is significant which is correspondent to sloshing mode 1 higher sloshing modes in short period waves had lower energy content for mid wave periods sloshing energy content is decreased on the other hand for long incident waves such as what can be detected at kd 2 6 sloshing energy at frequency of 1 4 hz is noticeable which is correspondent to sloshing mode 2 wave height effect on sloshing energy content inside the chamber is shown in fig 7 as can be expected the more the wave height increases the more energy content in the chamber boosts this was detectable both at peak and sloshing frequencies the bar chart shown in fig 8 provides detailed information on total energy stored in the chamber due to water fluctuation and sloshing induced energy content for three different wave height conditions the bar chart accentuate the increasing amount of sloshing energy by increasing incident wave height the ratio of sloshing energy to total energy denoted as es was approximately between 0 03 and 0 05 the largest ratio es 0 05 was detected at h m0 30 cm h m0 dr 1 5 slot size impact on sloshing energy content is similar to wave height effect in another word greater slot sizes or lower damping effects by power take off pto system cause more water fluctuation inside the chamber and consequently the energy content inside the chamber corresponding to sloshing frequency increases see fig 9 fig 10 depicts the total energy stored in the chamber due to water fluctuation and sloshing induced energy content influenced by slot ratio although the amount of sloshing energy increased by increasing slot ratio es defined as the ratio of sloshing energy to total energy decreased by increasing slot ratio in fact for slot ratio of 0 64 es was almost 0 2 while for slot ratio 1 28 and 1 92 it reached to 0 17 and 0 13 respectively this shows that for short period waves it is generally better to tune the device by lower damping ratios or higher slot ratios this is in agreement with previous findings kamath et al 2015b the effects of draft variation on sloshing energy content is shown in time series plots instead of presenting them in frequency domain in another word the sloshing frequency is filtered to isolate sloshing induced inner chamber water fluctuations fig 11 it is clearly evident that fluctuation corresponding to sloshing frequency decreased by increasing draft one can detect that for time instant 245 250 s sloshing induced free surface fluctuation for dr d 0 05 was approximately 7 cm while at the same time it reached to approximately 1 cm for dr d 0 1 similar to previous analyzes a bar chart including sloshing energy content and total energy content induced by water fluctuation inside the chamber is presented in fig 12 according to fig 12 es calculated for dr d 0 05 is approximately 0 1 while it reached to 0 07 and 0 03 for dr d 0 075 and dr d 0 1 respectively again highlighting the effect of increasing draft on reducing sloshing energy content this reduction in sloshing energy due to increasing front wall draft can be attributed to the less energy transferred to the owc chamber it is worth mentioning that whenever the amount of total energy transferred to the chamber is equal for different values of dr which is the case for long period waves see fig 16 the dr corresponding to less sloshing energy will yield higher efficiency zabihi et al 2019 4 1 2 total free surface fluctuation inside the chamber to evaluate total free surface fluctuation inside the chamber r defined as the ratio of the spectral wave height inside the chamber to incident spectral wave height r h m 0 i n s i d e h m 0 i n c i d e n t is plotted against relative depth kd for different tests fig 13 shows the effect of incident wave height on r values it should be noted that these tests are performed for a constant dr of 20 cm dr d 0 05 it is obvious that increasing wave height leaded to decrease of the r values except for h m0 dr 1 5 where r values were significantly greater than the other h m0 dr values which had been tested regarding fig 13 it is notable that h m0 dr 1 5 and kd 6 leads to breaking waves since wave breaking changes energy balance of offshore owc devices the wave characteristics were selected based upon non breaking waves although in offshore wave condition the breaking limit is introduced using wave height to wavelength ratio that is 0 14 practically the ratio is limited to 0 1 therefore to avoid breaking waves occurrence peak wave steepness was limited to h m0 l p 0 062 figs 14 and 15 show the effect of slot ratio on r as can be seen for both of the wave heights higher damping caused by lower slot ratios leaded to lower r values however it can be concluded that by decreasing damping which is equivalent to increasing slot ratio the difference between r values gets smaller for example according to fig 14 the maximum difference between r values for slot ratio 1 92 and 1 28 reaches to 18 at kd 6 29 while there is a much more difference between r values corresponding to slot ratio 1 28 and 0 64 the maximum difference gets to 64 at kd 4 97 fig 16 indicates the effect of front wall draft variation on r values for a constant slot ratio of 1 28 and unchanged incident wave height of 15 cm it is evident that for low frequency waves the impact of front wall draft is negligible and can be ignored as all the draft value tested showed similar r values highlighting that approximately equal amount of energy has been transferred in to the chamber in long period waves however the discrepancy between r values was more conspicuous for incident waves of higher frequency in that case the more the front wall draft increased the less energy transferred into the system and consequently r values decreased now by considering figs 11 and 16 it can be concluded that for long period waves where the amount of energy transferred in to the system is almost equal the larger front wall draft which causes lower sloshing will lead to higher energy capture 4 2 reflection by fixed offshore owc as stated before reflection response of an owc will influence on both energy efficiency and wave forces analysis in this section wave reflection from the fixed offshore owc model see figs 1 and 2 is analyzed and the effects of front wall draft slot size and spectral wave height are illustrated fig 17 shows variation of the wave reflection versus kd for three draft values fig 17 indicates that wave reflection has a decreasing trend as incident peak wave period increases the reason can be attributed to the greater ratio of wavelength to chamber length which causes the energy to be transmitted more rather than to be reflected from another angle the larger front wall draft is the greater reflection coefficient is this is due to the fact that larger dr blocks the incoming wave energy and performs like a seawall preventing the energy to be transmitted it is clearly visible that the effect of wave period on wave reflection is much more than the effect of front wall draft as reflection coefficient increased by almost 100 when kd rose from 2 61 to 6 29 fig 18 shows the effect of different slot ratios on reflection coefficient for h m0 15 and 22 cm respectively as it can be seen slot ratio has negligible impact on reflection however reflection coefficient increased slightly as slot ratio decreased so that for the lowest slot ratio sr 0 64 reflection was higher this issue arises from higher damping caused by slot ratio 0 64 which decreases the energy transferred to the owc with more energy halted at the owc entrance increase in wave reflection is acceptable another point which should be considered is that for longer wavelengths kd 2 61 and 3 34 changing in slot ratio has a greater impact on reflection coefficient so that with increasing kd kd 6 29 and 7 16 the reflection coefficients are almost equal for different slot ratios it should be mentioned that maximum increase in wave reflection for low frequency waves was bounded to approximately 0 04 for the both wave heights fig 18 accentuate again that wave reflection is strongly dependent to incident wave period rather than slot size for further evaluation of the wave height impact on reflection response of an offshore owc variation of reflection coefficient against kd is plotted in fig 19 for more wave height values no significant difference can be found in reflection coefficient caused by increasing h m0 dr 1 1 1 5 moreover cr values associated with h m0 dr 0 75 were almost equal to what was obtained for h m0 dr 1 1 1 5 especially for kd 5 lowering wave height to h m0 10 cm h m0 dr 0 5 brought about a bigger difference in reflection coefficients especially at lower frequency waves as at kd 3 34 cr value is approximately 0 04 less than cr values for h m0 30 cm h m0 dr 1 5 regarding the reflection responses obtained in this study the following point should be considered that is the problem investigated in this paper is a 3d problem as stated before elhanafi et al 2017e numerically found that conducting a test in narrow bounded flumes can cause an overestimation in energy efficiency significantly especially for shorter wavelengths this means that dealing with structures where diffraction is of great importance it is necessary to apply 3d models frostick et al 2011 in fact in comparison with 3d wide wave tanks narrow wave flumes reflect more energy especially for short period waves he and huang 2014 moreover in narrow wave flumes while a part of the energy not allowed to be transmitted is reflected the remaining part enters the owc chamber which can be noticed as higher free surface fluctuation inside the chamber conversely in 3d models which is a more similar condition to the real sea state the wave scattering phenomena results in reduction of the absorbed energy due to this change in energy conversion chain the reflection responses obtained in this study are different from what was obtained in narrow wave flumes however the results of reflection are more reliable as they have been obtained from more realistic condition for a more profound analyze spectral reflection is plotted for some cases spectral reflection cr f has the merit of presenting reflection coefficients for each incident wave frequency fig 20 shows the impact of slot size on spectral reflection against relative length l l of the owc chamber defined as the ratio of chamber length l to wavelength l note that what is meant by length is the dimension of the owc device which is in parallel with the incident wavelength moreover l stands for wavelength for each wave component in spectral analysis hence it is different from l p which is the peak wavelength in a series of irregular waves as it is shown the lower slot ratio is the greater spectral reflection coefficient is in each frequency component it is vividly clear that spectral reflection coefficients for both slot ratios reach their minimum values for 0 08 l l 0 30 without being affected by slot ratio spectral reflection coefficient versus relative chamber length is plotted for evaluation of other factors such as draft dr relative depth kd and wave height h m0 and their effects on reflection are demonstrated through figs 21 23 the general trend of spectral reflection variation against l l influenced by aforementioned factors is similar to each other they all include a range of zero reflection which is corresponding to 0 1 l l 0 35 approximately however considering fig 22 it is possible to detect that relative depth which is influenced by incident peak wave period can change the zero reflection range slightly as for the largest tested kd kd 6 29 zero reflection range starts from 0 09 and for the lowest kd kd 2 61 the aforementioned range begins from l l 0 05 to recapitulate regardless of spectral reflection values influenced by different factors the general trend of spectral reflection variation against l l is independent of wave height slot size and draft value and by isolating kd impact it is evident that by increasing kd zero reflection range decreases and it begins from larger l l outside the range of 0 1 l l 0 35 and for greater l l values approximately 0 4 l l 0 5 spectral reflection coefficients were greater than 1 this behavior is previously detected and discussed by viviano et al 2016 in bottom fixed owcs it is probably due to energy transfer between wave frequencies it is clear that wave energy conversion in an owc system strongly depends on water and air motion as irregular waves are inherently variable in time domain their interaction with owc affect air intake and outflow when incident wave is not in phase with air flow inside the chamber its pressure immediately adjusts but it takes a longer time for air frequency to be adjusted hence those wave frequencies which are in phase with air flow and actually are around peak frequencies would be converted to pneumatic energy and those which are not in phase with air motion are not capable to get into the chamber the latter wave frequencies are those frequencies which have greater reflection amplitude rather than their incident amplitude leading to reflection values greater than 1 viviano et al 2016 it should be kept in mind that cr values computed by eq 11 always yield a value lower than 1 because it considers the ratio between the incident and reflected energy and satisfies the conservation of energy faraci et al 2014 on the other hand as spectral components characterized by cr f 1 are insignificant they have no influence on total cr computed by eq 11 5 conclusion this paper addressed the inner chamber fluctuation and reflection response of a fixed offshore owc experimentally to perform such a hydrodynamic investigation a 1 15 scale model of an offshore owc was built by plexiglass material in addition to different wave height and period conditions geometric front wall draft and damping effects were also examined all the tests were performed by introducing jonswap wave spectrum into the wave maker the remarkable points of this study are summarized in the following paragraphs inner chamber fluctuation was studied in sloshing frequencies and the effects of relative depth wave height slot size and front wall draft were clarified it was shown that the first mode of sloshing is significant in short period incident waves kd 6 29 while the second mode is pronounced in long period waves kd 2 6 increasing wave height and slot size brought about an increase in sloshing energy content stored in the chamber while increasing draft decreased the amount of sloshing energy content while sloshing energy inside the chamber increased by increasing slot size es value defined as the ratio of sloshing energy content to the total stored energy inside the chamber due to water fluctuation decreased this was not the case for wave height as increasing wave height boosted the sloshing energy and es simultaneously decreasing es value by increasing slot size highlights the importance of tuning short period waves with larger slot sizes the free surface fluctuation inside the chamber was analyzed based on r variation defined as the ratio of the spectral wave height inside the chamber to incident spectral wave height by decreasing damping the difference between r values got smaller the maximum difference between r values for slot ratio 1 92 and 1 28 was 18 while it was 64 for r values corresponding to slot ratio 1 28 and 0 64 increasing wave height leaded to decrease of the r values for h m0 dr 1 1 but for greater values of h m0 dr r increases for low frequency waves where kd 4 03 draft variation had no significant impact on r but this was not the case for high frequency waves where lower draft values brought about higher r values reflection of the tested model was considerably influenced by kd the difference between reflection coefficients reached to 100 when kd increased from 2 61 to 6 29 front wall draft was the second important factor affecting reflection as it prevents energy transfer by blocking the incident wave draft change increased reflection by 25 slot size and wave height impact on reflection coefficients were most detectable at lower frequency waves such as kd 4 03 regardless of spectral reflection coefficient influenced by different factors the general trend of spectral reflection variation versus l l was independent of wave height slot size and draft value and there was a range of zero reflection which was corresponding to 0 1 l l 0 30 approximately by isolating kd impact it was shown that by increasing kd zero reflection range decreased and it started from larger l l of particular interest for future research could be the evaluation of applying sloshing barriers effect or the impact of changing an individual owc into double or triple chambers on efficiency of the owc device credit authorship contribution statement milad zabihi conceptualization formal analysis investigation software

21066,oscillating water column owc with its mechanism based on converting hydrodynamic energy into pneumatic energy is one of the earliest wave energy converters studied by researchers while the focus of the previous studies were mainly on hydrodynamic efficiency this paper addresses free surface fluctuation inside the owc chamber emphasizing on sloshing phenomenon through irregular wave impingement as reflection response of an offshore owc plays an important role in energy conversion chain this paper also provides an insight of wave reflection by such devices the experimental results show that decreasing damping effect boosts the sloshing energy stored inside the owc chamber but the ratio of sloshing energy content to the total stored energy inside the chamber decreases accentuating the importance of tuning short period waves with larger slot sizes in the context of reflection response of an owc relative depth kd is the most important factor which can make a great difference in reflection coefficients even up to 100 spectral reflection analysis shows that regardless of incident wave height slot size and draft value there is a range of relative chamber length l

of fossil energy and its pollutant nature it is indispensable to find a solution for world future energy demand and renewable energy seems to be the best substitution to escape energy crisis among different kinds of renewable energies wave energy is one of the best resources as it includes higher energy density khan et al 2017 wave energy as an almost untapped resource of renewable energy is one the most interesting marine issues researchers have studied in the last two decades of the numerous devices devised for converting wave energy to electricity falcão 2010 lópez et al 2013 one that particularly stands out is oscillating water column owc consisting of a chamber which can be built as a bottom fixed shore or nearshore device or can be a bottom detached structure placed offshore the mechanism of owc working includes wave induced water fluctuation inside a chamber followed by air compressing or decompressing the pressurized air flow passes through a vent or nozzle to drive a turbine installed to the chamber the latter mechanism is done by the so called power take off pto system although there are a lot of studies on owcs even leaded to full scale prototypes falcão 2000 heath et al 2000 washio et al 2000 they are not fully commercialized due to their sophisticated hydrodynamic behavior and there are steps to bridge the gap between research and industry lots of studies have been performed to examine hydrodynamic behavior of an owc evans 1978 was among the first researchers conducted an investigation on hydrodynamic behavior of a fixed owc assuming inner chamber water fluctuation as a rigid piston as well as a weightless one a plausible assumption provided that the ratio of wavelength to chamber size is substantial later researchers falcão and sarmento 1980 falnes and mciver 1985 developed the weightless rigid piston model by exerting periodic surface pressure distribution which allows considering non plane free surface fluctuation inadequacy of potential theories in taking nonlinear interaction such as sloshing and wave breaking into account accompanied by advances in computing processes power conveyed the researchers to those studies which are based on solving navier stokes equation these investigations were mainly based on finite volume method fvm çelik and altunkaynak 2020 iturrioz et al 2015 kamath et al 2015a lopez et al 2014 luo et al 2014 mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 simonetti et al 2017 2018 teixeira et al 2013 vyzikas et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 even though utilizing smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method in analyzing hydrodynamic performance of an owc was applied lately crespo et al 2017 didier et al 2016 wen et al 2018 contrary to numerical studies conducting experimental tests on owcs is quite limited but indispensable and this limitation is more pronounced for offshore owcs perhaps due to their higher costs however it should be kept in mind that in comparison with shore based owcs offshore ones have the merit of being subjected to higher wave energy moreover they are appropriate choices at small islands or offshore construction sites where conventional source of energy is unavailable or costly he et al 2017 regarding experimental studies on fixed offshore owcs crema et al 2015 worked on a 1 50 scaled model of owc they investigated the effects of wave frequency and chamber geometry such as chamber width and front wall draft on owc efficiency the experimental tests conducted by elhanafi et al 2017c and elhanafi and kim 2018 on offshore stationary owcs were another data set in the context of analyzing owc efficiency moreover they have much done to advance the knowledge of harnessing wave energy using owcs based on numerically developed cfd model implemented in star ccm elhanafi et al 2017a 2017b 2017d 2017e reviewing the aforementioned researches show that most of the previous studies focused on hydrodynamic efficiency of an owc device either shore based or offshore located and less attention was paid to the complex hydrodynamic especially to the nonlinear phenomenon inside the chamber that is to say sloshing although an attempt was made by çelik and altunkaynak 2018 who studied water fluctuation and sloshing inside the owc chamber under regular wave attack sloshing relevance to geometric and hydrodynamic parameters needs to be fully studied particularly under irregular wave impingement where distribution of energy content over wider frequencies gives a new insight of sloshing phenomenon another important wave structure interaction which takes place outside the chamber is reflection generally there are two main reasons for investigation on reflection response of an owc the first one is to separate the incident wave in order to measure the incoming wave energy and consequently the device efficiency correctly and the second one is to understand the mechanism of an important part of the energy conversion chain which was neither absorbed nor transmitted from another aspect analyzing hydrodynamic behavior shouldn t be restricted to the owc efficiency as owcs can be integrated with breakwaters mustapa et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 a logical idea to reduce its construction cost which has drawn researches attention recently howe et al 2020a 2020b hence presenting reflection response of the owcs is of great importance as it is one of the usual parameters which should be taken into account during the design procedure investigation on the reflection of an owc and its influence on both energy efficiency and wave forces analysis has been conducted in the literature in this regard viviano et al 2016 determined their shore based owc reflection response it should be noted that reflection and energy balance of shore based and offshore owcs which is the case of this research are completely different elhanafi et al 2016 2017a moreover he and huang 2014 conducted experimental tests to determine reflection and transmission coefficients of a floating type owc integrated with breakwater influenced by regular waves however their research includes differences other than wave condition since they studied an owc with symmetric wall not located in deep water zone as the ratio of water depth to wavelength d l was between 0 14 and 0 32 although the mentioned works presented a good insight of wave owc interaction to the best knowledge of the authors wave reflection and sloshing phenomenon in a fixed offshore owc influenced by irregular wave attack has not yet been studied especially under different geometric and hydrodynamic parameters moreover the current study has the advantage of being conducted in a towing tank this is of great importance since most of the previous studies suffer from sidewall effects which can significantly influence on results in this regard elhanafi et al 2017e showed that modeling offshore owcs in a 2d domain or a narrow wave flume substantially overestimates the owc device performance to be crystal clear the aim of this paper can be classified to two main points the first one is to illustrate sloshing phenomenon and its relevance to hydrodynamic and geometric parameters the second point is to analyze wave reflection by an offshore located owc these issues are of great importance as better understanding of what is happening inside and outside the chamber will definitely help engineers to design an efficient owc the rest of the paper is organized as follows the next section is dedicated to setting up the physical model including instrumentation wave tank information and wave condition then section 3 presents theoretical background of sloshing phenomenon and reflection calculation procedure section 4 provides the results in two main categories inner chamber fluctuation and reflection by owc accompanied by discussion on the current findings finally the paper ends with concluding remarks 2 experimental methodology 2 1 model set up the experimental tests were performed in the towing tank of national iranian marine laboratory nimala tehran iran the towing tank is 400 m long 6 m wide and 4 m deep the laboratory is equipped with a piston type wave maker which is able to generate regular and irregular waves up to 40 cm height and 3 s period towing tank long length accompanied by artificial beach at the end of the tank ensure that reflection of the transmitted waves will not influence on incident waves to hold owc in its position without any displacement a steel frame was designed and auxiliary tight cables were used in order to stop any wave induced movement of the owc structure fig 1 depicts the steel frame and the owc model which was connected to it in a layout and 3d view respectively for transporting such a huge frame along the towing tank six wheels were used each having 1000 kg loading capacity after reaching to the appropriate position i e 38 m far from the wave generator system the wheels of the frame were removed using a handy jack to put the frame on the ground a physical 1 15 scale model of a fixed offshore owc was built using plexiglass material of 10 mm thickness it is worth mentioning that couple of parameters such as practical wave data in the north west part of indian ocean and also southern region of caspian sea mazaheri et al 2013 characteristics of nimala towing tank and its associated wave maker have been considered in determining the model scale in addition to above points the previous studies crema et al 2015 elhanafi et al 2017b 2017e he et al 2017 have been used towards the selection of the scale and other characteristics of the experimental model detailed explanation of chosen dimensions shown in fig 2 can be found in the authors published paper zabihi et al 2019 the thickness of the owc front wall was considered to be 14 mm to lessen the probability of distortion or damage considering fig 2 chamber length l is 0 8 m chamber width w is 0 92 m and total chamber height z is 1 11 m as elhanafi et al 2017e stated conducting experiments in a narrow wave flume bounded to the owc wall leads to overestimation of the owc efficiency particularly in wave frequencies higher than chamber resonant frequency hence to remove wall effects the owc model was set up in the midpoint of wave tank width so that the ratio of owc width to towing tank breadth was smaller than 0 2 chakrabarti 1994 in another word the minimum distance to tank side walls in order to neglect wall effects was met three wave gauges wg were employed to measure incident wave outside the owc chamber two also were used inside the chamber to track the water fluctuation inside the owc device the method of mansard and funke 1980 was applied for separation of incident and reflected waves two pressure sensors ps were used to measure air pressure induced by water fluctuation inside the chamber it should be noted that ps data are not presented in this paper as the focus of this paper is on reflection response of owc and water fluctuation inside the chamber all data were sampled with frequency of 50 hz a top view of the wgs location as well as owc position is schematically shown in fig 3 and fig 4 generally the wave gauges distances were determined based on mansard and funke 1980 the wave gauge 3 has been placed approximately 6 m far from the owc structure which is equal to the average of incident wavelengths tested the other distances were determined based on the following recommendations mansard and funke 1980 1 x 13 l p 5 x 13 3 l p 10 x 12 p l p 2 x 13 q x 12 where x12 is the distance between wave gauge 1 and 2 x13 also indicates the distance between gauge 1 and 3 p and q are integers and l p denote peak wavelength a widely used approach to simulate damping effect in an owc physical model is applying an orifice or a slot in the current research slot opening was used it is denoted by s in fig 4 moreover exact indication of the pss location on chamber roof can be found in fig 4 further details on experimental set up and uncertainty of the measurements can be found in the newly published paper of the authors zabihi et al 2019 2 2 wave characteristic and range of the tested parameters standard jonswap spectrum was applied and introduced into the wave maker in this paper the parametrized jonswap spectrum is given as follows 2 s f α h s 2 f p 4 f 5 γ b exp 5 4 f p f 4 where α 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ h s is significant wave height f is the wave frequency and f p is the peak wave frequency γ is known as spectral peak enhancement coefficient which is considered to be 3 3 in this paper and b exp f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 where σ 0 07 for f f p otherwise σ 0 09 for f f p each test lasted for 250 300 s the range of the tested parameters including both wave characteristics and geometric factors are presented in table 1 h m0 is the spectral wave height and t p is the peak wave period water depth d was 4 m and it was remained unchanged in all the tests dr represents front wall draft of the owc to be comparable with similar studies some non dimensional parameters including ratio of the front wall draft to water depth wave height to front wall draft and slot ratio are introduced it is noted that slot ratio is defined as the ratio of slot area to chamber roof area multiplied by 100 3 theoretical background this section includes two subsections a brief explanation of sloshing phenomenon is presented in the first part and then an abridged description for incident and reflected wave separation is illustrated in the second part 3 1 sloshing prior to presenting results a brief description of sloshing phenomenon occurring inside the owc chamber is explained in this part sloshing is a nonlinear phenomenon which is possible to happen at closed tanks therefore wave owc interaction may cause sloshing in owc chamber sloshing gets in the way of chambers piston type oscillation consequently results in almost zero chamber pressure this zero pressure is rooted in negligible change in the air volume which is trapped in the chamber hence sloshing should be avoided in designing procedure of owcs for removing sloshing effect completely chamber length must be very small in comparison to incident wavelength this is the case where rigid piston behavior is governing however for capturing incident wave energy there is always an optimum ratio for chamber length to incident wavelength for a closed tank like an owc chamber sloshing modes can be depicted using fig 5 sloshing modes can be determined using the following relation k l n π where k is wave number l is chamber length and n represents the nth mode rabinovich 2009 all odd modes are asymmetric while even modes are symmetric the fundamental mode occurs when the incident wavelength is twice the chamber length other modes have wavelengths equal to one half one third one forth and so on of the wavelength of the fundamental mode rabinovich 2009 considering that chamber net length was 0 78 m and being constant during the tests first and second mode of sloshing can be seen at frequency of 1 hz and 1 4 hz respectively another point which should be considered is that for regular incident waves the possibility of detecting sloshing energy content in the inner chamber fluctuation spectrum is much less than that of irregular waves this is due to the fact that for incident waves of random type the wave owc interaction leads to higher energy transfer between different wave frequencies rather than what may be detected in regular incident waves considering the abovementioned points spectral analysis can be employed for studying different modes of sloshing and its corresponding energy a brief definition of spectrum density is presented in the following paragraph based on liu and frigaard 1999 the spectrum density shows the distribution of wave energy over different frequencies it provides a frequency decomposition in harmonics which their behavior is interested any surface elevation measurement contains a series of data with constant interval sampling rate if the sampling frequency is f s then the time between two consecutive measurements will be 1 f s assuming that n data sampling has been recorded then the duration of a test would be t d n 1 f s to convert an irregular surface elevation η t into a spectrum it is needed to decompose the irregular wave into its linear components this can be done using fourier series 3 η t a 0 2 i 1 n 1 a i cos 2 π i t d t b i sin 2 π i t d t 2 i 0 n 1 a i cos ω i t b i sin ω i t where ω i is the angular frequency a and b are fourier coefficients given by 4 a i 1 t d 0 t d η t cos ω i t d t b i 1 t d 0 t d η t sin ω i t d t where i 0 1 2 n 1 the eq 3 can be rewritten as what follows 5 η t i 0 n 1 2 c i cos ω i t δ i where 2 c i 2 a i 2 b i 2 represents the amplitude and δ i is the random phase now the spectral density can be defined as 6 s f 2 c i 2 2 δ f 2 a i 2 b i 2 δ f where δ f is the frequency bandwidth it should be noted that applying fft leads to real and complex aliasing parts to solve the aliasing after fourier analysis the concept of nyquist frequency known also as cut off frequency which is equal to f s 2 is used it assumes that there is no linear components in irregular wave time series whose frequency is greater than nyquist frequency 3 2 reflection coefficient and reflection function separating incident and reflected waves are explained in detail by faraci et al 2014 however the mathematical background is presented in the following paragraph briefly wave surface elevation can be defined as the composition of linear incident and reflected wave components in its complex form it is as follows 7 η n n n a i n e i ω n t k n x a r n e i ω n t k n x f o r n 0 where a in and a rn are the complex parameters indicating incident and reflected components respectively their absolute values represent the amplitude t is time x is wave propagation direction subscript n shows nth harmonic component ω n is angular frequency defined as ω n 2 π n t d where in the aforementioned relation t d represents the total test duration k n is the wave number after applying fourier transformation on water surface elevation measured by each probe called as m it can be written as function of a complex parameter f n m 8 η m n n n f n m e i ω n now from eq 7 the following relation can be obtained 9 f n m a i n e i k n x m a r n e i k n x m where x m represents the location of the probe m this method can be applied for each of the probes for 3 probes which is the case in this study method described by mansard and funke 1980 based on least square method can be employed to solve the unknowns as stated before absolute values of a in and a rn are correspondent to incident and reflected wave amplitude for the nth harmonic respectively therefore reflection function cr f for each wave frequency component can be determined as 10 c r f a r n a i n and total wave reflection coefficient can be obtained using eq 11 11 c r n n 1 n 2 a r n 2 n n 1 n 2 a i n 2 where n 1 and n 2 are the lower and the upper limits of the spectral range which were used to obtain reflection value 4 results and discussion 4 1 inner chamber water fluctuation water fluctuation inside the chamber can be discussed at two frequencies the primary energy content will be stored at frequencies equal to incident peak wave frequency wave owc interaction causes the energy content inside the chamber to be transferred into the higher frequencies the energy content corresponding to higher frequencies can be treated as sloshing energy although the energy content associated with sloshing frequencies is less than the energy corresponding to lower frequencies sloshing influences on extracting wave energy and forces acting on owc walls therefore it should be considered in designing owcs in what follows sloshing energy content influenced by wave period wave height slot size and front wall draft is examined first then analyzing of primary energy content is presented following the sloshing phenomenon discussion 4 1 1 sloshing induced water fluctuation inside the chamber as mentioned earlier sloshing modes depend on the ratio of wavelength to chamber length hence wavelength or wave period must be the most important factor in evaluating sloshing fig 6 shows inner chamber spectra for four different relative depths kd it should be noted that kd is a non dimensional parameter which is the product of the wave number k 2 π l p and the water depth d where l p stands for peak wavelength the measured spectra for both of the wgs are shown it should be noted that wave height h m0 15 cm front wall draft dr 20 cm and slot size s 1 cm were all unchanged for evaluation of wave period effect it is clearly visible that for incident waves of shorter periods kd 6 29 sloshing energy at frequency of 1 hz is significant which is correspondent to sloshing mode 1 higher sloshing modes in short period waves had lower energy content for mid wave periods sloshing energy content is decreased on the other hand for long incident waves such as what can be detected at kd 2 6 sloshing energy at frequency of 1 4 hz is noticeable which is correspondent to sloshing mode 2 wave height effect on sloshing energy content inside the chamber is shown in fig 7 as can be expected the more the wave height increases the more energy content in the chamber boosts this was detectable both at peak and sloshing frequencies the bar chart shown in fig 8 provides detailed information on total energy stored in the chamber due to water fluctuation and sloshing induced energy content for three different wave height conditions the bar chart accentuate the increasing amount of sloshing energy by increasing incident wave height the ratio of sloshing energy to total energy denoted as es was approximately between 0 03 and 0 05 the largest ratio es 0 05 was detected at h m0 30 cm h m0 dr 1 5 slot size impact on sloshing energy content is similar to wave height effect in another word greater slot sizes or lower damping effects by power take off pto system cause more water fluctuation inside the chamber and consequently the energy content inside the chamber corresponding to sloshing frequency increases see fig 9 fig 10 depicts the total energy stored in the chamber due to water fluctuation and sloshing induced energy content influenced by slot ratio although the amount of sloshing energy increased by increasing slot ratio es defined as the ratio of sloshing energy to total energy decreased by increasing slot ratio in fact for slot ratio of 0 64 es was almost 0 2 while for slot ratio 1 28 and 1 92 it reached to 0 17 and 0 13 respectively this shows that for short period waves it is generally better to tune the device by lower damping ratios or higher slot ratios this is in agreement with previous findings kamath et al 2015b the effects of draft variation on sloshing energy content is shown in time series plots instead of presenting them in frequency domain in another word the sloshing frequency is filtered to isolate sloshing induced inner chamber water fluctuations fig 11 it is clearly evident that fluctuation corresponding to sloshing frequency decreased by increasing draft one can detect that for time instant 245 250 s sloshing induced free surface fluctuation for dr d 0 05 was approximately 7 cm while at the same time it reached to approximately 1 cm for dr d 0 1 similar to previous analyzes a bar chart including sloshing energy content and total energy content induced by water fluctuation inside the chamber is presented in fig 12 according to fig 12 es calculated for dr d 0 05 is approximately 0 1 while it reached to 0 07 and 0 03 for dr d 0 075 and dr d 0 1 respectively again highlighting the effect of increasing draft on reducing sloshing energy content this reduction in sloshing energy due to increasing front wall draft can be attributed to the less energy transferred to the owc chamber it is worth mentioning that whenever the amount of total energy transferred to the chamber is equal for different values of dr which is the case for long period waves see fig 16 the dr corresponding to less sloshing energy will yield higher efficiency zabihi et al 2019 4 1 2 total free surface fluctuation inside the chamber to evaluate total free surface fluctuation inside the chamber r defined as the ratio of the spectral wave height inside the chamber to incident spectral wave height r h m 0 i n s i d e h m 0 i n c i d e n t is plotted against relative depth kd for different tests fig 13 shows the effect of incident wave height on r values it should be noted that these tests are performed for a constant dr of 20 cm dr d 0 05 it is obvious that increasing wave height leaded to decrease of the r values except for h m0 dr 1 5 where r values were significantly greater than the other h m0 dr values which had been tested regarding fig 13 it is notable that h m0 dr 1 5 and kd 6 leads to breaking waves since wave breaking changes energy balance of offshore owc devices the wave characteristics were selected based upon non breaking waves although in offshore wave condition the breaking limit is introduced using wave height to wavelength ratio that is 0 14 practically the ratio is limited to 0 1 therefore to avoid breaking waves occurrence peak wave steepness was limited to h m0 l p 0 062 figs 14 and 15 show the effect of slot ratio on r as can be seen for both of the wave heights higher damping caused by lower slot ratios leaded to lower r values however it can be concluded that by decreasing damping which is equivalent to increasing slot ratio the difference between r values gets smaller for example according to fig 14 the maximum difference between r values for slot ratio 1 92 and 1 28 reaches to 18 at kd 6 29 while there is a much more difference between r values corresponding to slot ratio 1 28 and 0 64 the maximum difference gets to 64 at kd 4 97 fig 16 indicates the effect of front wall draft variation on r values for a constant slot ratio of 1 28 and unchanged incident wave height of 15 cm it is evident that for low frequency waves the impact of front wall draft is negligible and can be ignored as all the draft value tested showed similar r values highlighting that approximately equal amount of energy has been transferred in to the chamber in long period waves however the discrepancy between r values was more conspicuous for incident waves of higher frequency in that case the more the front wall draft increased the less energy transferred into the system and consequently r values decreased now by considering figs 11 and 16 it can be concluded that for long period waves where the amount of energy transferred in to the system is almost equal the larger front wall draft which causes lower sloshing will lead to higher energy capture 4 2 reflection by fixed offshore owc as stated before reflection response of an owc will influence on both energy efficiency and wave forces analysis in this section wave reflection from the fixed offshore owc model see figs 1 and 2 is analyzed and the effects of front wall draft slot size and spectral wave height are illustrated fig 17 shows variation of the wave reflection versus kd for three draft values fig 17 indicates that wave reflection has a decreasing trend as incident peak wave period increases the reason can be attributed to the greater ratio of wavelength to chamber length which causes the energy to be transmitted more rather than to be reflected from another angle the larger front wall draft is the greater reflection coefficient is this is due to the fact that larger dr blocks the incoming wave energy and performs like a seawall preventing the energy to be transmitted it is clearly visible that the effect of wave period on wave reflection is much more than the effect of front wall draft as reflection coefficient increased by almost 100 when kd rose from 2 61 to 6 29 fig 18 shows the effect of different slot ratios on reflection coefficient for h m0 15 and 22 cm respectively as it can be seen slot ratio has negligible impact on reflection however reflection coefficient increased slightly as slot ratio decreased so that for the lowest slot ratio sr 0 64 reflection was higher this issue arises from higher damping caused by slot ratio 0 64 which decreases the energy transferred to the owc with more energy halted at the owc entrance increase in wave reflection is acceptable another point which should be considered is that for longer wavelengths kd 2 61 and 3 34 changing in slot ratio has a greater impact on reflection coefficient so that with increasing kd kd 6 29 and 7 16 the reflection coefficients are almost equal for different slot ratios it should be mentioned that maximum increase in wave reflection for low frequency waves was bounded to approximately 0 04 for the both wave heights fig 18 accentuate again that wave reflection is strongly dependent to incident wave period rather than slot size for further evaluation of the wave height impact on reflection response of an offshore owc variation of reflection coefficient against kd is plotted in fig 19 for more wave height values no significant difference can be found in reflection coefficient caused by increasing h m0 dr 1 1 1 5 moreover cr values associated with h m0 dr 0 75 were almost equal to what was obtained for h m0 dr 1 1 1 5 especially for kd 5 lowering wave height to h m0 10 cm h m0 dr 0 5 brought about a bigger difference in reflection coefficients especially at lower frequency waves as at kd 3 34 cr value is approximately 0 04 less than cr values for h m0 30 cm h m0 dr 1 5 regarding the reflection responses obtained in this study the following point should be considered that is the problem investigated in this paper is a 3d problem as stated before elhanafi et al 2017e numerically found that conducting a test in narrow bounded flumes can cause an overestimation in energy efficiency significantly especially for shorter wavelengths this means that dealing with structures where diffraction is of great importance it is necessary to apply 3d models frostick et al 2011 in fact in comparison with 3d wide wave tanks narrow wave flumes reflect more energy especially for short period waves he and huang 2014 moreover in narrow wave flumes while a part of the energy not allowed to be transmitted is reflected the remaining part enters the owc chamber which can be noticed as higher free surface fluctuation inside the chamber conversely in 3d models which is a more similar condition to the real sea state the wave scattering phenomena results in reduction of the absorbed energy due to this change in energy conversion chain the reflection responses obtained in this study are different from what was obtained in narrow wave flumes however the results of reflection are more reliable as they have been obtained from more realistic condition for a more profound analyze spectral reflection is plotted for some cases spectral reflection cr f has the merit of presenting reflection coefficients for each incident wave frequency fig 20 shows the impact of slot size on spectral reflection against relative length l l of the owc chamber defined as the ratio of chamber length l to wavelength l note that what is meant by length is the dimension of the owc device which is in parallel with the incident wavelength moreover l stands for wavelength for each wave component in spectral analysis hence it is different from l p which is the peak wavelength in a series of irregular waves as it is shown the lower slot ratio is the greater spectral reflection coefficient is in each frequency component it is vividly clear that spectral reflection coefficients for both slot ratios reach their minimum values for 0 08 l l 0 30 without being affected by slot ratio spectral reflection coefficient versus relative chamber length is plotted for evaluation of other factors such as draft dr relative depth kd and wave height h m0 and their effects on reflection are demonstrated through figs 21 23 the general trend of spectral reflection variation against l l influenced by aforementioned factors is similar to each other they all include a range of zero reflection which is corresponding to 0 1 l l 0 35 approximately however considering fig 22 it is possible to detect that relative depth which is influenced by incident peak wave period can change the zero reflection range slightly as for the largest tested kd kd 6 29 zero reflection range starts from 0 09 and for the lowest kd kd 2 61 the aforementioned range begins from l l 0 05 to recapitulate regardless of spectral reflection values influenced by different factors the general trend of spectral reflection variation against l l is independent of wave height slot size and draft value and by isolating kd impact it is evident that by increasing kd zero reflection range decreases and it begins from larger l l outside the range of 0 1 l l 0 35 and for greater l l values approximately 0 4 l l 0 5 spectral reflection coefficients were greater than 1 this behavior is previously detected and discussed by viviano et al 2016 in bottom fixed owcs it is probably due to energy transfer between wave frequencies it is clear that wave energy conversion in an owc system strongly depends on water and air motion as irregular waves are inherently variable in time domain their interaction with owc affect air intake and outflow when incident wave is not in phase with air flow inside the chamber its pressure immediately adjusts but it takes a longer time for air frequency to be adjusted hence those wave frequencies which are in phase with air flow and actually are around peak frequencies would be converted to pneumatic energy and those which are not in phase with air motion are not capable to get into the chamber the latter wave frequencies are those frequencies which have greater reflection amplitude rather than their incident amplitude leading to reflection values greater than 1 viviano et al 2016 it should be kept in mind that cr values computed by eq 11 always yield a value lower than 1 because it considers the ratio between the incident and reflected energy and satisfies the conservation of energy faraci et al 2014 on the other hand as spectral components characterized by cr f 1 are insignificant they have no influence on total cr computed by eq 11 5 conclusion this paper addressed the inner chamber fluctuation and reflection response of a fixed offshore owc experimentally to perform such a hydrodynamic investigation a 1 15 scale model of an offshore owc was built by plexiglass material in addition to different wave height and period conditions geometric front wall draft and damping effects were also examined all the tests were performed by introducing jonswap wave spectrum into the wave maker the remarkable points of this study are summarized in the following paragraphs inner chamber fluctuation was studied in sloshing frequencies and the effects of relative depth wave height slot size and front wall draft were clarified it was shown that the first mode of sloshing is significant in short period incident waves kd 6 29 while the second mode is pronounced in long period waves kd 2 6 increasing wave height and slot size brought about an increase in sloshing energy content stored in the chamber while increasing draft decreased the amount of sloshing energy content while sloshing energy inside the chamber increased by increasing slot size es value defined as the ratio of sloshing energy content to the total stored energy inside the chamber due to water fluctuation decreased this was not the case for wave height as increasing wave height boosted the sloshing energy and es simultaneously decreasing es value by increasing slot size highlights the importance of tuning short period waves with larger slot sizes the free surface fluctuation inside the chamber was analyzed based on r variation defined as the ratio of the spectral wave height inside the chamber to incident spectral wave height by decreasing damping the difference between r values got smaller the maximum difference between r values for slot ratio 1 92 and 1 28 was 18 while it was 64 for r values corresponding to slot ratio 1 28 and 0 64 increasing wave height leaded to decrease of the r values for h m0 dr 1 1 but for greater values of h m0 dr r increases for low frequency waves where kd 4 03 draft variation had no significant impact on r but this was not the case for high frequency waves where lower draft values brought about higher r values reflection of the tested model was considerably influenced by kd the difference between reflection coefficients reached to 100 when kd increased from 2 61 to 6 29 front wall draft was the second important factor affecting reflection as it prevents energy transfer by blocking the incident wave draft change increased reflection by 25 slot size and wave height impact on reflection coefficients were most detectable at lower frequency waves such as kd 4 03 regardless of spectral reflection coefficient influenced by different factors the general trend of spectral reflection variation versus l l was independent of wave height slot size and draft value and there was a range of zero reflection which was corresponding to 0 1 l l 0 30 approximately by isolating kd impact it was shown that by increasing kd zero reflection range decreased and it started from larger l l of particular interest for future research could be the evaluation of applying sloshing barriers effect or the impact of changing an individual owc into double or triple chambers on efficiency of the owc device credit authorship contribution statement milad zabihi conceptualization formal analysis investigation software

reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps continuum damage mechanical cdm behavior axial tension hashin yeh criterion ramberg osgood curve 1 introduction composite materials have been used to build pipes for oil exploration in the field of ocean engineering due to practical advantages such as good corrosion resistance good thermal insulation and light weight martins et al 2013 bai et al 2014 toh et al 2018 among various composite pipes reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps received considerable attention from the engineers and researchers until now rtps have been used as water injection pipes oil gathering pipes and gas export pipes in some shallow water areas of the middle east and southeast asia for years which held out a cheerful application prospect dalmolen et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 the liner and the coating made of homogenous materials such as pe pa and pvdf are used to resist the corrosion from the transported fluids and saline seawater as main load bearing layers laminates normally are made of polymer matrix and reinforced fibers which wound in different angles bai et al 2015 yu et al 2015 as the exploration of oil and gas moves into deep water prediction on the load bearing capacity and stiffness characteristics of rtps are becoming more important lekhnitskii 1981 proposed the theory of elasticity of an anisotropic body which provided a basis for numerous theoretical research including studies on the bending stiffness the axial stiffness and the prediction of stress field jolicoeur and cardou 1994 zhang and hoa 2012 sun et al 2014a sun et al 2014b proposed the homogenization assumption in which rtps are assumed as homogenized pipes because of this rtps can be described by nine homogenized elastic constants which improves the efficiency of evaluating rtps a lot by summarizing a large number of previous experimental and theoretical work nasa sp 8007 1986 gave many classical formulae to predict the load bearing capacity of orthotropic cylinders subjected to axial compression bending torsion and lateral pressure however there is no any relatively complete analytical model to predict the mechanical response of rtps under ultimate tension including the elastic stiffness the first ply failure load the cdm and plastic behavior for experimental research on rtps under axial loads khalifa et al 2012 conducted tensile test on four specimens made of glass fiber and vinyl ester resin according to astm d 2105 01 standard 2007 the test loading rate was determined as 10 mm min meanwhile acoustic emission and scanning electron microscope were used to identify the damage mode it divided the damage process into four steps matrix cracking microscopic cracks to fiber matrix interface propagation in the matrix and fiber failure and also verified that acoustic emission is a reliable method to observe the behavior of rtps özbek et al 2019 performed quasi static compression tests on the basalt glass and basalt glass fiber reinforced pipes and identified three distinct failure mode including transverse shearing lamina bending and local buckling the discussion about the energy absorption capability illustrated that composite pipes can be used to improve crashworthiness of structures betts et al 2019 conducted compression and tension tests on filament wound glass fiber reinforced polymer pipes which were verified by an analytical model based on existing methods experiments can give accurate results but would cost a lot on some special designed testing devices for numerical simulation ren et al 2013 conducted abaqus explicit quasi static analyses on unbonded flexible risers to predict the axial stiffness compared with previous experimental results it had high accuracy liu and wang 2020 used the same numerical method to predict the homogenized axial moduli of rtps which agreed well with analytical results compared with experimental research numerical simulation can give accurate results with a lower cost and provide a much simpler way to observe stress field when composite laminates are under ultimate loads the nonlinear response related to continuum damage mechanical cdm behavior would play a key role on determining the life of marine structures hashin and rotem 1973 hashin 1980 divided the damage mode of composite materials into tensile fiber mode tensile matrix mode compressive fiber mode and compressive matrix mode according to stress conditions yeh and kim 1994 yeh and chern 1998 proposed a similar formula to evaluate the delamination of adjacent composite laminates based on hashin and yeh s work a nonlinear stiffness degradation model in the open literatures zhang et al 2013 yao et al 2019 he et al 2019 was developed and used to simulate the cdm behavior of composite sheets which coincided with experimental results because of accessible concept and high accuracy the hashin yeh failure criterion and this nonlinear degradation model were widely used to evaluate the damage condition of composites in open literatures this research focuses on the linear and nonlinear mechanical behavior of rtps under axial tension to predict the cdm response an analytical model is proposed by combing the existing homogenization method failure criteria and material degradation models in a cyclic program according to the existing homogenization method stress distributions are obtained by replacing original rtp models with homogenized pipes as the homogenization method ignores the effect of cross sectional curvature on damage sequences a stress correction factor is defined to take it into account once corrected stresses of homogenous layers satisfy von mises criterion ramberg osgood curve is used to update elastic constants of isotropic materials for composite laminates a nonlinear stiffness degradation model is adopted to update the stiffness matrix if hashin yeh failure criterion is satisfied to verify the proposed model quasi static uniaxial tension tests and numerical simulation calling a vumat subroutine were conducted to observe the stress field the proposed model was found to give accurate prediction on stiffness characteristics and stress field and have functions including identifying damage location predicting failure mode and analyzing damage propagation furthermore the effects of winding angles are studied which showed that dominant failure mode would change from tensile fiber to tensile matrix as winding angles increase 2 the analytical cdm model normally rtps are made of many cylindrical fiber reinforced laminates as shown in fig 2 all layers are bonded together so voids and delamination are not considered in the elastic phase of the theoretical model the cross sectional feature of a rtp can be described by the internal radius of the ith layer r i the winding angle of fibers in the ith layer ϕ i the number of layers n the internal radius of rtps a and the external radius b 2 1 transformation for material matrix of cylindrical anisotropy due to three mutually perpendicular planes of material symmetry as shown in fig 3 the stress strain relations of an orthotropic material can be described by the general hook s law as zhang

v 32 can be obtained by the following equation 3 v j k e j v k j e k where j k can be replaced by 1 2 3 the compliance matrix c is the inverse of the stiffness matrix and can be expressed as kim et al 2017 4 c s 1 to construct the theoretical rtp model the compliance matrix of each layer should be unified under the cylindrical coordinate system as shown in fig 2 therefore the transformation of the compliance matrix from the principal material coordinate system to the cylindrical coordinate system can be expressed as zhang and hoa 2014 5 c t i t i t c t i where the transformation matrix is given as 6 t i 0 sin 2 ϕ i cos 2 ϕ i 2 sin ϕ i cos ϕ i 0 0 0 cos 2 ϕ i sin 2 ϕ i 2 sin ϕ i cos ϕ i 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 sin ϕ i cos ϕ i 0 0 0 0 cos ϕ i sin ϕ i 0 sin ϕ i cos ϕ i sin ϕ i cos ϕ i sin 2 ϕ i cos 2 ϕ i 0 0 in the analytical model the liner and coating are also included for liner and coating which are made of isotropic materials the abovementioned stress strain relationship is also applicable because isotropic materials can be considered to have numerous symmetric planes through a point daniel and ishai 2006 as a result the winding angles of liner and coating are seen as zero 2 2 stress analysis of rtps under axial tension to analyze the stress distribution of rtps under axial tension sun et al 2014a 2014b proposed the homogenization method which is based on the transformation of material matrix this method replaces the complex cross sections with homogenized cross sections which means that all strains and stresses are thought to be continuous because of this assumption the stress of each layer can be calculated by a coefficient matrix ф i and the homogenized stress sun et al 2014a 7 σ i φ i σ in eq 7 the coefficient matrix ф i is calculated by the compliance matrix in section 2 1 and details of the coefficient matrix ф i can be found in appendix a according to the mechanics of materials liu 2011 when the homogenized pipe is under the uniaxial stress state as shown in fig 4 the homogenized stresses including σ θ σ r τ θz τ rz and τ rθ are considered as zero the homogenized axial stress σ z can be calculated as 8 σ z f a e z ε z where f denotes the axial force a is the area of the cross section e z a is the elastic stiffness ε z denotes the homogenized axial strain namely the elongation by building the equilibrium equation in the axial hoop and radial directions sun et al 2014a obtained the homogenized axial elastic modulus e z 9 e z i 1 n a i d 33 i d 23 i i 1 n t i d 23 i i 1 n t i d 22 i where the solution of d 22 i d 23 i and d 33 i can be found in appendix a as shown in fig 2 a i and t i are the area ratio and the thickness ratio of the ith layer sun et al 2014a on the other hand because of the relationship between local stresses and the homogenized stress expressed by eq 7 the stress distribution in each layer can be calculated as sun et al 2014a 10 σ r i σ r 0 σ θ i d 22 i h 23 d 23 i h 33 σ z σ z i d 23 i h 23 d 33 i h 33 σ z τ θ z i d 24 i h 23 d 34 i h 33 σ z τ r z i τ r z 0 τ r θ i τ r θ 0 where h 23 and h 33 are the elements of the homogenized pipes and take the form as follows 11 h 23 1 i 1 n a i d 23 i d 33 i i 1 n t i d 22 i i 1 n t i d 23 i h 33 1 i 1 n a i d 33 i d 23 i i 1 n t i d 23 i i 1 n t i d 22 i as the existing homogenization method could not take the effect of cross sectional curvature into account the stresses predicted by eq 10 are identical for different layers when winding angles are the same actually the slight difference on stress distribution would determine the first damage location and the damage sequence because of this a stress correction factor is introduced into the existing homogenization method 12 p i r i 1 r i b a therefore when predicting the stress distribution of each layer by eq 10 σ z p i is used to replace σ z once the stresses of each layer are obtained the strains of each layer could be calculated as 13 ε r i ε θ i ε z i γ θ z i γ r z i γ

66 i σ r i σ θ i σ z i τ θ z i τ r z i τ r θ i where as expressed by eq 5 ct i is the compliance matrix of the ith layer in the cylindrical coordinate system 2 3 failure criteria for orthotropic and isotropic layers for isotropic materials von mises criterion liu 2011 was used to detect the plastic change of the liner and coating it takes the following form liu 2011 14 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 6 τ 12 2 τ 13 2 τ 23 2 2 σ y 2 where σ y is the yield stress once von mises criterion is satisfied the material comes into the plastic phase on the other hand for fiber reinforced laminates hashin yeh failure criterion hashin and rotem 1973 hashin 1980 yeh and kim 1994 yeh and chern 1998 is used to predict the damage of composite materials due to the conceptual simplicity the failure mode based criterion was widely used to evaluate the failure of composite structures by running a user defined subroutine in numerical simulation it showed good correlation with experimental studies for composite sheets zhang et al 2013 yao et al 2019 he et al 2019 this failure criterion includes five different failure modes fiber tensile failure mode hashin 1980 15 r f t 2 σ 1 x t 2 τ 12 x 12 2 τ 13

strength the transverse compressive strength and the out of plane tensile strength respectively x 12 x 13 and x 23 are shear strengths the damage occurs once the failure factor r i i ft fc mt mc and ld exceeds one hashin 1980 yeh and kim 1994 before von mises criterion and hashin yeh failure criterion are applied on failure evaluation the stress should be transformed to the principal material coordinate system as stresses predicted by eq 10 are still under cylindrical coordinate system according to the transformation relation shown in section 2 1 the stress matrix obtained by eq 10 should multiply the transformation matrix t i as the radial stress σ r i and the shear stresses τ r z i τ r θ i of each lamina equal 0 the stresses σ 3 i τ 13 i τ 23 i would be equal to 0 after transformation because of this the delamination failure factor r ld would always be 0 which means that delamination is not a dominant failure mode during the tension process 2 4 material plasticity and gradual stiffness degradation for the liner and coating material plasticity should be considered when rtps are under excessive axial tension in order to incorporate the plastic effect into the analytical model ramberg osgood curve ramberg and osgood 1943 besseling 1958 de sousa et al 2012 is used to approximate the strain stress relationship of isotropic materials it takes a simple form as 20 ε σ e 1 c 1 σ σ y c 2 in eq 20 c 1 and c 2 are parameters which are normally determined by experiments ramberg and osgood 1943 because of relatively high accuracy and ease of use it is widely used to describe the strain stress relationship of isotropic materials when materials come into the plastic phase the tangent modulus is not constant in the proposed model according to eq 20 the tangent modulus in the kth step is calculated as 21 e t σ k σ k 1 ε k ε k 1 where e t is the tangent modulus σ k and ε k are the von mises stress and the strain calculated by eq 20 in the kth step respectively for composite laminates the failure factor r i calculated in section 2 3 can reflect the damage condition because of this they are used to construct the nonlinear gradual stiffness degradation model and describe the change of material zhang et al 2013 he et al 2019 22 d i 1 1 r i k r i 1 k 1 i f t f c m t m c l d where d i is the damage factor k is a constant which could reflect the nonlinearity of the degradation model when it is greater than 1 however in the study it was determined as 1 according to the open literature zhang et al 2013 actually different failure modes may take place simultaneously to determine the main failure mode damage parameters are defined zhang et al 2013 23 w 1 max 0 0 d f w 2 max 0 0 d f d m w 3 m a x 0 0 d f d d w 4 max 0 0 d f d m w 5 m a x 0

change of damage parameters is nonlinear during the calculation because of the complexity of stress field and winding angles therefore damage parameters are used to update the stiffness matrix of the corresponding layer in the principal material coordinate system when damage occurs and the damaged stiffness matrix is defined as he et al 2013 24 s d a m a g e 1 w 1 s 11 s 12 s 13 0 0 0 s 21 1 w 2 s

predict the progressive failure of rtps under axial tension successive iteration and hoop are used to simulate the quasi static loading process the tension would be loaded in a slow way by controlling the strain increment the flowchart of the calculation procedure is shown in fig 5 which includes material plasticity failure evaluation and stiffness degradation at first geometric and material parameters are inputted to establish the original stiffness matrix in the principle material coordinate system then the damage state matrix the initial axial strain strain increment and the maximum strain are defined to prepare for iterations and hoop when iterations start the compliance matrix of each layer in the principal material coordinate system can be obtained by eq 4 they are used to establish the global compliance matrix in the cylindrical coordinate system next h 23 and h 33 are calculated by the global compliance matrix as a result the stress distribution of each layer are predicted according to eq 10 and transformed to the principal material coordinate system the calculation comes into the material plasticity phase once the liner or coating satisfy von mises criterion as shown in fig 5 the plastic change is outputted meanwhile the stress of the yield layer is used to calculate the tangent modulus by the ramberg osgood curve then the tangent modulus would replace the elastic modulus of the yield layer in the next circle for fiber reinforced laminates failure factors are calculated if the failure factor exceeds one the failure location is recorded and checked whether it belongs to the damage state matrix if it belongs to the damage state matrix it means that this damage occurs before otherwise damage information is outputted if the failure factor is less than 1 the failure factor is reset as zero subsequently damage parameters are calculated to update the stiffness matrix finally iterations and hoop would stop once the axial strain exceeds the maximum 3 axial tension test axial tension test was performed on two rtp specimens to verify the cdm model developed in the present paper the specimens were produced by weihai nacheon pipeline co ltd which consisted of liner coating and four composite laminates coating and liner are made of pe and composite laminates are made of glass fiber pe tapes the winding angles of fibers in adjacent layer are 55 55 the internal diameter is 47 5 mm other geometrical and material parameters are listed in table 1 and table 2 the details of the experimental setup are shown in fig 6 the ends of test pieces were fixed by clamping joints which were connected to the microcomputer controlled electro hydraulic servo horizontal tension machine during the test the left end was stationary while the right could only translate along the longitudinal direction when the test started the tension force and the displacement of the right joint could be recorded automatically by the tension machine the test was repeated twice at a loading rate of 10 mm min which meets the loading requirement of astm d 2105 01 standard 2007 in the preliminary test the slip between joints and the test piece led to bigger displacement which made the tested stiffness smaller because of this the axial strain was recorded by setting strain gages outside of specimens to obtain the real stiffness 4 numerical simulation as composite layers are in the middle of liner and coating it is difficult to observe the stress field during the experiment process compared with experimental methods numerical simulation provides a simple and effective way to understand stress distribution of composites 4 1 finite element model in the present paper the commercial software abaqus dassault systèmes 2010 was used to conduct explicit quasi static analyses and predict the continuum damage mechanical response of rtps under axial tension as shown in fig 7 the finite element model includes liner composite laminates and coating they were all simulated by c3d8r 8 node liner brick elements with reduced integration because this element type is good at dealing with nonlinear problems such as contact plasticity and large deformation bai et al 2016 liu and wang 2019a 2019b the length of the finite element model was selected as 1000 mm 4 2 boundary condition and damage evaluation as shown in fig 7 two reference points were created at the center of both cross sections and kinematically coupled with all nodes on the corresponding cross section rp1 was fixed and rp2 was free in the axial direction the boundary condition is identical to that of the experiment the axial tension could be delivered to the top cross section uniformly by loading on rp2 ren 2015 the failure evaluation and stiffness degradation of composite laminates were executed by a user defined vumat subroutine dassault systèmes 2010 in which hashin yeh failure criterion and damaged stiffness matrix was compiled with fortran code this vumat subroutine was widely used to predict the failure of composite sheets and showed good correlation with experimental studies details of the subroutine can be found in open literatures yao et al 2019 he et al 2019 for the liner and coating the plastic parameters were provided by the specimen manufacturer to ensure the accuracy of results the loading rate during the simulation process were slow enough to control the energy ratio allke allie less than 5 and reduce the inertial effect 5 results and discussion 5 1 the comparison of different methods the comparison of different methods is shown in fig 8 it is clear to see that rtps firstly comes into the elastic phase so the first part of the tension strain curve is linear it means that the elastic stiffness keeps constant in the elastic phase so the winding angle change during the loading process has few influences on the elastic stiffness and could be ignored when the tension increases to a critical point the first ply failure fpf occurs the numerical and analytical results showed the fpf mode is tensile matrix which occurs on the outermost composite lamina then rtps come into the continuum damage phase the experimental and analytical results showed that the stiffness of rtps would drop rapidly after the first ply failure the tensile matrix failure mode would occur on the third and the second composite laminates successively as the tension increases the damage condition becomes worse then tensile fiber and tensile matrix failure mode simultaneously take place on the innermost composite lamina finally tensile fiber occurs on the third the fourth and the second composite laminates in sequence as the tension increases the damage condition in each layer would get worse the comparison of the elastic stiffness and the fpf tension are listed in table 3 for the elastic stiffness both numerical and analytical results are greater than experimental results and the differences are in an acceptable range the specimen 2 was bent slightly in the axial direction before the test starts meanwhile due to the limit of clamping technology it is inevitable that the slip between clamping joints and specimen would occur during the tension loading therefore the obtained displacement would be relatively larger at the beginning of test which leads to a smaller observed elastic stiffness for the fpf tension the numerical result is more close to experimental results while the analytical result has a difference about 10 as a whole both numerical and analytical models can give accurate prediction on the elastic stiffness and the fpf tension particularly for the mechanical behavior of rtps during the cdm phase the analytical model can give more close prediction compared with the numerical model therefore the effectiveness of the proposed cdm model is verified as shown in fig 8 the numerical result showed a different trend after the first ply failure takes place the reason is that the stress strain relationship of liner and coating used in the numerical model is a bilinear curve when von mises criterion is satisfied the tangent moduli of the liner and coating is used to replace the elastic moduli in another word for the part between fpf and plastic change shown in fig 8 only progressive failure of composite laminates is considered on the other hand for the analytical model ramberg osgood curve is used to simulate the plasticity of isotropic layers therefore in the analytical model the elastic moduli of isotropic materials would decrease slowly as the tension rises even when rtps are still in the elastic phase the plasticity of isotropic layers and progressive failure of composite laminates are considered at the same time in the analytical model from fig 8 it is clear to see that the analytical model is more close to experimental results it showed that an appropriate plasticity model is important to predict the cdm response of rtps 5 2 the comparison of stresses as expressed in section 2 3 the evaluation of damage condition is based on the accurate prediction of stress field therefore the accuracy of stress prediction is significant to the cdm model to verify the proposed model further in this section the stresses of each layer predicted by the proposed model and the numerical model are compared when this rtp is under the tension of 5 kn as described by eq 10 σ θ i σ z i and τ θ z i are mainly discussed because other stresses of each layer equal 0 fig 9 shows the stress path through the thickness which is used to output stresses from the innermost layer to the outermost layer the comparison of hoop axial and shear stress obtained by analytical and numerical models is shown in fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 respectively the extremely agreement between analytical and numerical results demonstrated the proposed model has high accuracy on stress prediction compared with the axial and shear stress the hoop stress is trivial from fig 10 the hoop stress of liner and coating is positive while that of composite laminates is negative it means that the isotropic layers are stretched in hoop direction and composite laminates are compressed when rtps are under axial tension the axial stresses of composite laminates are much higher than that of liner and coating which illustrates that composite laminates are main load bearing layers at this time as the winding angles of isotropic layers are considered as 0 the shear stresses of liner and coating equal 0 besides the shear stresses of adjacent composite laminates are in the same level and different directions due to the opposite winding angles 5 3 the effects of winding angles as the winding angles would have an effect on the orientation of material orthotropy the stiffness characteristics the stress distribution and the fpf tension would also be influenced in this section to study the effects of winding angles this rtp model was reconstructed with different winding angles ranging from 0 to 90 as shown in fig 13 and table 4 analytical and numerical results coincide with a difference close to 1 which also verifies the reliability of the proposed cdm model it can be concluded that the elastic stiffness would decrease as winding angles rise the main reason is that the elastic modulus of composite materials in 1 direction in the principal material coordinate system would contribute a lot to the homogenized axial elastic modulus when the winding angles are close to 0 the elastic stiffness would drop slowly and keep constant basically once the winding angles exceed 60 fig 14 shows the axial stress distribution of rtps with different winding angles when they are under the tension of 5 kn it is clear to see that composite laminates would bear more loads when winding angles are smaller it is because the fibers of composite laminates would contribute more to the axial stiffness at this time as the winding angles increase the axial stress of liner and coating would rise slowly when the winding angles exceed 60 the axial stress are in the same level no matter for isotropic and orthotropic layers table 5 gives the initial tension of failure mode for composite laminates firstly there is no delamination failure mode for all rtps as the delamination failure factor r ld would always be 0 at second compressive matrix failure mode would take place even when rtps are under axial tension for rtps with winding angles less than 30 tensile fiber is the dominant failure mode after tensile fiber failure mode occurs the progressive failure process has different cdm patterns because of the effects of winding angles for example the damage sequence for rtps with 20 winding angles could be described as tensile fiber failure mode occurs from the outermost composite lamina to the innermost composite lamina then compressive matrix failure mode takes place from the outermost composite lamina to the innermost composite lamina however for rtps with 30 winding angles tensile fiber failure mode occurs on the outermost lamina at first then tensile fiber and compressive matrix failure mode appear on the same lamina simultaneously which spread from the third lamina to the innermost lamina when winding angles are greater than 40 the dominant failure mode transforms into tensile matrix for rtps with winding angles close to 90 tensile fiber would not happen before rtps fail completely due to tensile matrix failure mode and the plasticity of isotropic layers 6 conclusions this work investigates the mechanical response of rtps under axial tension by analytical experimental and numerical methods in the present paper an analytical cdm model is proposed to predict the linear and nonlinear behavior of rtps by executing the existing homogenization method failure criteria and material degradation models in an iterative and cyclic way stress distributions are obtained by using the existing homogenization method as the homogenization method ignores the effect of cross sectional curvature on damage sequences a stress correction factor is defined to take it into account once corrected stresses of homogenous layers satisfy von mises criterion ramberg osgood curve is used to update elastic constants of isotropic materials for composite laminates a nonlinear stiffness degradation model is adopted to update the stiffness matrix if hashin yeh failure criterion is satisfied in order to validate the proposed model quasi static uniaxial tension tests were conducted on two rtp specimens produced by weihai nacheon pipeline co ltd besides numerical simulation calling a vumat subroutine were conducted to predict the stress field in 3d composite laminates the proposed model was found to give accurate prediction on stiffness characteristics and could be used to identify damage location predict failure mode and analyze damage propagation the extremely agreement of stresses predicted by numerical and analytical models illustrated that the proposed model has high accuracy on predicting the stress field the stress comparison showed that isotropic layers are stretched in hoop direction and composite laminates are compressed as the winding angles of adjacent composite laminates are in opposite directions the shear stresses of composite laminates are relatively high the effects of winding angles are also studied the elastic stiffness would decrease as the winding angles rise once winding angles exceed 60 it keeps constant basically meanwhile composite laminates would bear more loads when the winding angles are smaller as for the failure mode compressive matrix would take place even when rtps are under axial tension once winding angles exceed 40 the dominant failure mode changes from tensile fiber to tensile matrix last but not least as the homogenization method is accurate on the prediction of stress filed it could be also applied on other loading cases such as internal pressure external pressure and bending far reaching research on these loading cases will be carried

reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps continuum damage mechanical cdm behavior axial tension hashin yeh criterion ramberg osgood curve 1 introduction composite materials have been used to build pipes for oil exploration in the field of ocean engineering due to practical advantages such as good corrosion resistance good thermal insulation and light weight martins et al 2013 bai et al 2014 toh et al 2018 among various composite pipes reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps received considerable attention from the engineers and researchers until now rtps have been used as water injection pipes oil gathering pipes and gas export pipes in some shallow water areas of the middle east and southeast asia for years which held out a cheerful application prospect dalmolen et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 the liner and the coating made of homogenous materials such as pe pa and pvdf are used to resist the corrosion from the transported fluids and saline seawater as main load bearing layers laminates normally are made of polymer matrix and reinforced fibers which wound in different angles bai et al 2015 yu et al 2015 as the exploration of oil and gas moves into deep water prediction on the load bearing capacity and stiffness characteristics of rtps are becoming more important lekhnitskii 1981 proposed the theory of elasticity of an anisotropic body which provided a basis for numerous theoretical research including studies on the bending stiffness the axial stiffness and the prediction of stress field jolicoeur and cardou 1994 zhang and hoa 2012 sun et al 2014a sun et al 2014b proposed the homogenization assumption in which rtps are assumed as homogenized pipes because of this rtps can be described by nine homogenized elastic constants which improves the efficiency of evaluating rtps a lot by summarizing a large number of previous experimental and theoretical work nasa sp 8007 1986 gave many classical formulae to predict the load bearing capacity of orthotropic cylinders subjected to axial compression bending torsion and lateral pressure however there is no any relatively complete analytical model to predict the mechanical response of rtps under ultimate tension including the elastic stiffness the first ply failure load the cdm and plastic behavior for experimental research on rtps under axial loads khalifa et al 2012 conducted tensile test on four specimens made of glass fiber and vinyl ester resin according to astm d 2105 01 standard 2007 the test loading rate was determined as 10 mm min meanwhile acoustic emission and scanning electron microscope were used to identify the damage mode it divided the damage process into four steps matrix cracking microscopic cracks to fiber matrix interface propagation in the matrix and fiber failure and also verified that acoustic emission is a reliable method to observe the behavior of rtps özbek et al 2019 performed quasi static compression tests on the basalt glass and basalt glass fiber reinforced pipes and identified three distinct failure mode including transverse shearing lamina bending and local buckling the discussion about the energy absorption capability illustrated that composite pipes can be used to improve crashworthiness of structures betts et al 2019 conducted compression and tension tests on filament wound glass fiber reinforced polymer pipes which were verified by an analytical model based on existing methods experiments can give accurate results but would cost a lot on some special designed testing devices for numerical simulation ren et al 2013 conducted abaqus explicit quasi static analyses on unbonded flexible risers to predict the axial stiffness compared with previous experimental results it had high accuracy liu and wang 2020 used the same numerical method to predict the homogenized axial moduli of rtps which agreed well with analytical results compared with experimental research numerical simulation can give accurate results with a lower cost and provide a much simpler way to observe stress field when composite laminates are under ultimate loads the nonlinear response related to continuum damage mechanical cdm behavior would play a key role on determining the life of marine structures hashin and rotem 1973 hashin 1980 divided the damage mode of composite materials into tensile fiber mode tensile matrix mode compressive fiber mode and compressive matrix mode according to stress conditions yeh and kim 1994 yeh and chern 1998 proposed a similar formula to evaluate the delamination of adjacent composite laminates based on hashin and yeh s work a nonlinear stiffness degradation model in the open literatures zhang et al 2013 yao et al 2019 he et al 2019 was developed and used to simulate the cdm behavior of composite sheets which coincided with experimental results because of accessible concept and high accuracy the hashin yeh failure criterion and this nonlinear degradation model were widely used to evaluate the damage condition of composites in open literatures this research focuses on the linear and nonlinear mechanical behavior of rtps under axial tension to predict the cdm response an analytical model is proposed by combing the existing homogenization method failure criteria and material degradation models in a cyclic program according to the existing homogenization method stress distributions are obtained by replacing original rtp models with homogenized pipes as the homogenization method ignores the effect of cross sectional curvature on damage sequences a stress correction factor is defined to take it into account once corrected stresses of homogenous layers satisfy von mises criterion ramberg osgood curve is used to update elastic constants of isotropic materials for composite laminates a nonlinear stiffness degradation model is adopted to update the stiffness matrix if hashin yeh failure criterion is satisfied to verify the proposed model quasi static uniaxial tension tests and numerical simulation calling a vumat subroutine were conducted to observe the stress field the proposed model was found to give accurate prediction on stiffness characteristics and stress field and have functions including identifying damage location predicting failure mode and analyzing damage propagation furthermore the effects of winding angles are studied which showed that dominant failure mode would change from tensile fiber to tensile matrix as winding angles increase 2 the analytical cdm model normally rtps are made of many cylindrical fiber reinforced laminates as shown in fig 2 all layers are bonded together so voids and delamination are not considered in the elastic phase of the theoretical model the cross sectional feature of a rtp can be described by the internal radius of the ith layer r i the winding angle of fibers in the ith layer ϕ i the number of layers n the internal radius of rtps a and the external radius b 2 1 transformation for material matrix of cylindrical anisotropy due to three mutually perpendicular planes of material symmetry as shown in fig 3 the stress strain relations of an orthotropic material can be described by the general hook s law as zhang

v 32 can be obtained by the following equation 3 v j k e j v k j e k where j k can be replaced by 1 2 3 the compliance matrix c is the inverse of the stiffness matrix and can be expressed as kim et al 2017 4 c s 1 to construct the theoretical rtp model the compliance matrix of each layer should be unified under the cylindrical coordinate system as shown in fig 2 therefore the transformation of the compliance matrix from the principal material coordinate system to the cylindrical coordinate system can be expressed as zhang and hoa 2014 5 c t i t i t c t i where the transformation matrix is given as 6 t i 0 sin 2 ϕ i cos 2 ϕ i 2 sin ϕ i cos ϕ i 0 0 0 cos 2 ϕ i sin 2 ϕ i 2 sin ϕ i cos ϕ i 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 sin ϕ i cos ϕ i 0 0 0 0 cos ϕ i sin ϕ i 0 sin ϕ i cos ϕ i sin ϕ i cos ϕ i sin 2 ϕ i cos 2 ϕ i 0 0 in the analytical model the liner and coating are also included for liner and coating which are made of isotropic materials the abovementioned stress strain relationship is also applicable because isotropic materials can be considered to have numerous symmetric planes through a point daniel and ishai 2006 as a result the winding angles of liner and coating are seen as zero 2 2 stress analysis of rtps under axial tension to analyze the stress distribution of rtps under axial tension sun et al 2014a 2014b proposed the homogenization method which is based on the transformation of material matrix this method replaces the complex cross sections with homogenized cross sections which means that all strains and stresses are thought to be continuous because of this assumption the stress of each layer can be calculated by a coefficient matrix ф i and the homogenized stress sun et al 2014a 7 σ i φ i σ in eq 7 the coefficient matrix ф i is calculated by the compliance matrix in section 2 1 and details of the coefficient matrix ф i can be found in appendix a according to the mechanics of materials liu 2011 when the homogenized pipe is under the uniaxial stress state as shown in fig 4 the homogenized stresses including σ θ σ r τ θz τ rz and τ rθ are considered as zero the homogenized axial stress σ z can be calculated as 8 σ z f a e z ε z where f denotes the axial force a is the area of the cross section e z a is the elastic stiffness ε z denotes the homogenized axial strain namely the elongation by building the equilibrium equation in the axial hoop and radial directions sun et al 2014a obtained the homogenized axial elastic modulus e z 9 e z i 1 n a i d 33 i d 23 i i 1 n t i d 23 i i 1 n t i d 22 i where the solution of d 22 i d 23 i and d 33 i can be found in appendix a as shown in fig 2 a i and t i are the area ratio and the thickness ratio of the ith layer sun et al 2014a on the other hand because of the relationship between local stresses and the homogenized stress expressed by eq 7 the stress distribution in each layer can be calculated as sun et al 2014a 10 σ r i σ r 0 σ θ i d 22 i h 23 d 23 i h 33 σ z σ z i d 23 i h 23 d 33 i h 33 σ z τ θ z i d 24 i h 23 d 34 i h 33 σ z τ r z i τ r z 0 τ r θ i τ r θ 0 where h 23 and h 33 are the elements of the homogenized pipes and take the form as follows 11 h 23 1 i 1 n a i d 23 i d 33 i i 1 n t i d 22 i i 1 n t i d 23 i h 33 1 i 1 n a i d 33 i d 23 i i 1 n t i d 23 i i 1 n t i d 22 i as the existing homogenization method could not take the effect of cross sectional curvature into account the stresses predicted by eq 10 are identical for different layers when winding angles are the same actually the slight difference on stress distribution would determine the first damage location and the damage sequence because of this a stress correction factor is introduced into the existing homogenization method 12 p i r i 1 r i b a therefore when predicting the stress distribution of each layer by eq 10 σ z p i is used to replace σ z once the stresses of each layer are obtained the strains of each layer could be calculated as 13 ε r i ε θ i ε z i γ θ z i γ r z i γ

isotropic layers for isotropic materials von mises criterion liu 2011 was used to detect the plastic change of the liner and coating it takes the following form liu 2011 14 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 6 τ 12 2 τ 13 2 τ 23 2 2 σ y 2 where σ y is the yield stress once von mises criterion is satisfied the material comes into the plastic phase on the other hand for fiber reinforced laminates hashin yeh failure criterion hashin and rotem 1973 hashin 1980 yeh and kim 1994 yeh and chern 1998 is used to predict the damage of composite materials due to the conceptual simplicity the failure mode based criterion was widely used to evaluate the failure of composite structures by running a user defined subroutine in numerical simulation it showed good correlation with experimental studies for composite sheets zhang et al 2013 yao et al 2019 he et al 2019 this failure criterion includes five different failure modes fiber tensile failure mode hashin 1980 15 r f t 2 σ 1 x t 2 τ 12 x 12 2 τ 13

ld exceeds one hashin 1980 yeh and kim 1994 before von mises criterion and hashin yeh failure criterion are applied on failure evaluation the stress should be transformed to the principal material coordinate system as stresses predicted by eq 10 are still under cylindrical coordinate system according to the transformation relation shown in section 2 1 the stress matrix obtained by eq 10 should multiply the transformation matrix t i as the radial stress σ r i and the shear stresses τ r z i τ r θ i of each lamina equal 0 the stresses σ 3 i τ 13 i τ 23 i would be equal to 0 after transformation because of this the delamination failure factor r ld would always be 0 which means that delamination is not a dominant failure mode during the tension process 2 4 material plasticity and gradual stiffness degradation for the liner and coating material plasticity should be considered when rtps are under excessive axial tension in order to incorporate the plastic effect into the analytical model ramberg osgood curve ramberg and osgood 1943 besseling 1958 de sousa et al 2012 is used to approximate the strain stress relationship of isotropic materials it takes a simple form as 20 ε σ e 1 c 1 σ σ y c 2 in eq 20 c 1 and c 2 are parameters which are normally determined by experiments ramberg and osgood 1943 because of relatively high accuracy and ease of use it is widely used to describe the strain stress relationship of isotropic materials when materials come into the plastic phase the tangent modulus is not constant in the proposed model according to eq 20 the tangent modulus in the kth step is calculated as 21 e t σ k σ k 1 ε k ε k 1 where e t is the tangent modulus σ k and ε k are the von mises stress and the strain calculated by eq 20 in the kth step respectively for composite laminates the failure factor r i calculated in section 2 3 can reflect the damage condition because of this they are used to construct the nonlinear gradual stiffness degradation model and describe the change of material zhang et al 2013 he et al 2019 22 d i 1 1 r i k r i 1 k 1 i f t f c m t m c l d where d i is the damage factor k is a constant which could reflect the nonlinearity of the degradation model when it is greater than 1 however in the study it was determined as 1 according to the open literature zhang et al 2013 actually different failure modes may take place simultaneously to determine the main failure mode damage parameters are defined zhang et al 2013 23 w 1 max 0 0 d f w 2 max 0 0 d f d m w 3 m a x 0 0 d f d d w 4 max 0 0 d f d m w 5 m a x 0 0 d f d d w 6 m a x 0 0 d f d d d f m a x 0 0 d f t d f c d m m a x 0 0 d m t d m c d d m a x 0 0 d l d this definition shows that the main failure mode is the most severely damaged one actually the change of damage parameters is nonlinear during the calculation because of the complexity of stress field and winding angles therefore damage parameters are used to update the stiffness matrix of the corresponding layer in the principal material coordinate system when damage occurs and the damaged stiffness matrix is defined as he et al 2013 24 s d a m a g e 1 w 1 s 11 s 12 s 13 0 0 0 s 21 1 w 2 s 22 s 23 0 0 0 s 31 s 32 1 w 3 s 33 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 w 4 s 44 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 w 5 s 55 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 w 6 s 66 2 5 cdm model formulation a strain based matlab programme is executed to build the cdm model and predict the progressive failure of rtps under axial tension successive iteration and hoop are used to simulate the quasi static loading process the tension would be loaded in a slow way by controlling the strain increment the flowchart of the calculation procedure is shown in fig 5 which includes material plasticity failure evaluation and stiffness degradation at first geometric and material parameters are inputted to establish the original stiffness matrix in the principle material coordinate system then the damage state matrix the initial axial strain strain increment and the maximum strain are defined to prepare for iterations and hoop when iterations start the compliance matrix of each layer in the principal material coordinate system can be obtained by eq 4 they are used to establish the global compliance matrix in the cylindrical coordinate system next h 23 and h 33 are calculated by the global compliance matrix as a result the stress distribution of each layer are predicted according to eq 10 and transformed to the principal material coordinate system the calculation comes into the material plasticity phase once the liner or coating satisfy von mises criterion as shown in fig 5 the plastic change is outputted meanwhile the stress of the yield layer is used to calculate the tangent modulus by the ramberg osgood curve then the tangent modulus would replace the elastic modulus of the yield layer in the next circle for fiber reinforced laminates failure factors are calculated if the failure factor exceeds one the failure location is recorded and checked whether it belongs to the damage state matrix if it belongs to the damage state matrix it means that this damage occurs before otherwise damage information is outputted if the failure factor is less than 1 the failure factor is reset as zero subsequently damage parameters are calculated to update the stiffness matrix finally iterations and hoop would stop once the axial strain exceeds the maximum 3 axial tension test axial tension test was performed on two rtp specimens to verify the cdm model developed in the present paper the specimens were produced by weihai nacheon pipeline co ltd which consisted of liner coating and four composite laminates coating and liner are made of pe and composite laminates are made of glass fiber pe tapes the winding angles of fibers in adjacent layer are 55 55 the internal diameter is 47 5 mm other geometrical and material parameters are listed in table 1 and table 2 the details of the experimental setup are shown in fig 6 the ends of test pieces were fixed by clamping joints which were connected to the microcomputer controlled electro hydraulic servo horizontal tension machine during the test the left end was stationary while the right could only translate along the longitudinal direction when the test started the tension force and the displacement of the right joint could be recorded automatically by the tension machine the test was repeated twice at a loading rate of 10 mm min which meets the loading requirement of astm d 2105 01 standard 2007 in the preliminary test the slip between joints and the test piece led to bigger displacement which made the tested stiffness smaller because of this the axial strain was recorded by setting strain gages outside of specimens to obtain the real stiffness 4 numerical simulation as composite layers are in the middle of liner and coating it is difficult to observe the stress field during the experiment process compared with experimental methods numerical simulation provides a simple and effective way to understand stress distribution of composites 4 1 finite element model in the present paper the commercial software abaqus dassault systèmes 2010 was used to conduct explicit quasi static analyses and predict the continuum damage mechanical response of rtps under axial tension as shown in fig 7 the finite element model includes liner composite laminates and coating they were all simulated by c3d8r 8 node liner brick elements with reduced integration because this element type is good at dealing with nonlinear problems such as contact plasticity and large deformation bai et al 2016 liu and wang 2019a 2019b the length of the finite element model was selected as 1000 mm 4 2 boundary condition and damage evaluation as shown in fig 7 two reference points were created at the center of both cross sections and kinematically coupled with all nodes on the corresponding cross section rp1 was fixed and rp2 was free in the axial direction the boundary condition is identical to that of the experiment the axial tension could be delivered to the top cross section uniformly by loading on rp2 ren 2015 the failure evaluation and stiffness degradation of composite laminates were executed by a user defined vumat subroutine dassault systèmes 2010 in which hashin yeh failure criterion and damaged stiffness matrix was compiled with fortran code this vumat subroutine was widely used to predict the failure of composite sheets and showed good correlation with experimental studies details of the subroutine can be found in open literatures yao et al 2019 he et al 2019 for the liner and coating the plastic parameters were provided by the specimen manufacturer to ensure the accuracy of results the loading rate during the simulation process were slow enough to control the energy ratio allke allie less than 5 and reduce the inertial effect 5 results and discussion 5 1 the comparison of different methods the comparison of different methods is shown in fig 8 it is clear to see that rtps firstly comes into the elastic phase so the first part of the tension strain curve is linear it means that the elastic stiffness keeps constant in the elastic phase so the winding angle change during the loading process has few influences on the elastic stiffness and could be ignored when the tension increases to a critical point the first ply failure fpf occurs the numerical and analytical results showed the fpf mode is tensile matrix which occurs on the outermost composite lamina then rtps come into the continuum damage phase the experimental and analytical results showed that the stiffness of rtps would drop rapidly after the first ply failure the tensile matrix failure mode would occur on the third and the second composite laminates successively as the tension increases the damage condition becomes worse then tensile fiber and tensile matrix failure mode simultaneously take place on the innermost composite lamina finally tensile fiber occurs on the third the fourth and the second composite laminates in sequence as the tension increases the damage condition in each layer would get worse the comparison of the elastic stiffness and the fpf tension are listed in table 3 for the elastic stiffness both numerical and analytical results are greater than experimental results and the differences are in an acceptable range the specimen 2 was bent slightly in the axial direction before the test starts meanwhile due to the limit of clamping technology it is inevitable that the slip between clamping joints and specimen would occur during the tension loading therefore the obtained displacement would be relatively larger at the beginning of test which leads to a smaller observed elastic stiffness for the fpf tension the numerical result is more close to experimental results while the analytical result has a difference about 10 as a whole both numerical and analytical models can give accurate prediction on the elastic stiffness and the fpf tension particularly for the mechanical behavior of rtps during the cdm phase the analytical model can give more close prediction compared with the numerical model therefore the effectiveness of the proposed cdm model is verified as shown in fig 8 the numerical result showed a different trend after the first ply failure takes place the reason is that the stress strain relationship of liner and coating used in the numerical model is a bilinear curve when von mises criterion is satisfied the tangent moduli of the liner and coating is used to replace the elastic moduli in another word for the part between fpf and plastic change shown in fig 8 only progressive failure of composite laminates is considered on the other hand for the analytical model ramberg osgood curve is used to simulate the plasticity of isotropic layers therefore in the analytical model the elastic moduli of isotropic materials would decrease slowly as the tension rises even when rtps are still in the elastic phase the plasticity of isotropic layers and progressive failure of composite laminates are considered at the same time in the analytical model from fig 8 it is clear to see that the analytical model is more close to experimental results it showed that an appropriate plasticity model is important to predict the cdm response of rtps 5 2 the comparison of stresses as expressed in section 2 3 the evaluation of damage condition is based on the accurate prediction of stress field therefore the accuracy of stress prediction is significant to the cdm model to verify the proposed model further in this section the stresses of each layer predicted by the proposed model and the numerical model are compared when this rtp is under the tension of 5 kn as described by eq 10 σ θ i σ z i and τ θ z i are mainly discussed because other stresses of each layer equal 0 fig 9 shows the stress path through the thickness which is used to output stresses from the innermost layer to the outermost layer the comparison of hoop axial and shear stress obtained by analytical and numerical models is shown in fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 respectively the extremely agreement between analytical and numerical results demonstrated the proposed model has high accuracy on stress prediction compared with the axial and shear stress the hoop stress is trivial from fig 10 the hoop stress of liner and coating is positive while that of composite laminates is negative it means that the isotropic layers are stretched in hoop direction and composite laminates are compressed when rtps are under axial tension the axial stresses of composite laminates are much higher than that of liner and coating which illustrates that composite laminates are main load bearing layers at this time as the winding angles of isotropic layers are considered as 0 the shear stresses of liner and coating equal 0 besides the shear stresses of adjacent composite laminates are in the same level and different directions due to the opposite winding angles 5 3 the effects of winding angles as the winding angles would have an effect on the orientation of material orthotropy the stiffness characteristics the stress distribution and the fpf tension would also be influenced in this section to study the effects of winding angles this rtp model was reconstructed with different winding angles ranging from 0 to 90 as shown in fig 13 and table 4 analytical and numerical results coincide with a difference close to 1 which also verifies the reliability of the proposed cdm model it can be concluded that the elastic stiffness would decrease as winding angles rise the main reason is that the elastic modulus of composite materials in 1 direction in the principal material coordinate system would contribute a lot to the homogenized axial elastic modulus when the winding angles are close to 0 the elastic stiffness would drop slowly and keep constant basically once the winding angles exceed 60 fig 14 shows the axial stress distribution of rtps with different winding angles when they are under the tension of 5 kn it is clear to see that composite laminates would bear more loads when winding angles are smaller it is because the fibers of composite laminates would contribute more to the axial stiffness at this time as the winding angles increase the axial stress of liner and coating would rise slowly when the winding angles exceed 60 the axial stress are in the same level no matter for isotropic and orthotropic layers table 5 gives the initial tension of failure mode for composite laminates firstly there is no delamination failure mode for all rtps as the delamination failure factor r ld would always be 0 at second compressive matrix failure mode would take place even when rtps are under axial tension for rtps with winding angles less than 30 tensile fiber is the dominant failure mode after tensile fiber failure mode occurs the progressive failure process has different cdm patterns because of the effects of winding angles for example the damage sequence for rtps with 20 winding angles could be described as tensile fiber failure mode occurs from the outermost composite lamina to the innermost composite lamina then compressive matrix failure mode takes place from the outermost composite lamina to the innermost composite lamina however for rtps with 30 winding angles tensile fiber failure mode occurs on the outermost lamina at first then tensile fiber and compressive matrix failure mode appear on the same lamina simultaneously which spread from the third lamina to the innermost lamina when winding angles are greater than 40 the dominant failure mode transforms into tensile matrix for rtps with winding angles close to 90 tensile fiber would not happen before rtps fail completely due to tensile matrix failure mode and the plasticity of isotropic layers 6 conclusions this work investigates the mechanical response of rtps under axial tension by analytical experimental and numerical methods in the present paper an analytical cdm model is proposed to predict the linear and nonlinear behavior of rtps by executing the existing homogenization method failure criteria and material degradation models in an iterative and cyclic way stress distributions are obtained by using the existing homogenization method as the homogenization method ignores the effect of cross sectional curvature on damage sequences a stress correction factor is defined to take it into account once corrected stresses of homogenous layers satisfy von mises criterion ramberg osgood curve is used to update elastic constants of isotropic materials for composite laminates a nonlinear stiffness degradation model is adopted to update the stiffness matrix if hashin yeh failure criterion is satisfied in order to validate the proposed model quasi static uniaxial tension tests were conducted on two rtp specimens produced by weihai nacheon pipeline co ltd besides numerical simulation calling a vumat subroutine were conducted to predict the stress field in 3d composite laminates the proposed model was found to give accurate prediction on stiffness characteristics and could be used to identify damage location predict failure mode and analyze damage propagation the extremely agreement of stresses predicted by numerical and analytical models illustrated that the proposed model has high accuracy on predicting the stress field the stress comparison showed that isotropic layers are stretched in hoop direction and composite laminates are compressed as the winding angles of adjacent composite laminates are in opposite directions the shear stresses of composite laminates are relatively high the effects of winding angles are also studied the elastic stiffness would decrease as the winding angles rise once winding angles exceed 60 it keeps constant basically meanwhile composite laminates would bear more loads when the winding angles are smaller as for the failure mode compressive matrix would take place even when rtps are under axial tension once winding angles exceed 40 the dominant failure mode changes from tensile fiber to tensile matrix last but not least as the homogenization method is accurate on the prediction of stress filed it could be also applied on other loading cases such as internal pressure external pressure and bending far reaching research on these loading cases will be carried

21068,cruise ships have large and long superstructures which are almost extending the whole ship length with discontinuous characteristics such as side shell recess and many window openings the superstructure effectiveness on hull girder longitudinal strength is a complicated but unavoidable issue in ship design stage this paper has carried out a collapse experiment of steel model with

experiment results then the superstructure effectiveness is analyzed to revise the increment iterative to be applicable for ultimate strength evaluation for cruise ships at last the combination action of bending moment and shear force is studied and a new combination formula is proposed the conclusions in this paper will be useful for ship design rules amendment and safety assessment for cruise

configurations with large superstructures almost extending the whole ship length and ship width which will bring in new design problems the superstructures are the most important part for the attraction of passengers in order to satisfy the travel and relaxation need at the sea more cabins with balconies atriums through several decks theatres and dining halls with wide space in the superstructures the sides are penetrated by many window openings door openings balconies opening and longitudinal bulkhead recess for lifeboat arrangement which will reduce the shear stiffness within the plane based on loading manuals of cruise ships the still water bending moment is in hogging conditions for most cases due to a low deadweight requirement or a uniform loading at each deck with a low block ship coefficient bajic 2015 the hogging condition under still water and wave moment will be the critical design case this paper will deal with the issues of hogging condition in following analysis from the view of load carrying capacity the bending moment can be carried by both the main hull and the superstructures the hull girder can be seemed as a beam with various cross section characteristics for real combinations of open and closed cross section zanic and prebeg 2005 the longitudinal stress of superstructures is lower than that of expected from classic beam theory biot et al 2006 the interaction between main hull and superstructure becomes complicated the superstructures can not bend as fully consistent with main hull and therefore the superstructures effectiveness on longitudinal strength is reduced fricke and gerlach 2015 the superstructures will bear a larger part of longitudinal loads after the optimal design with a lower neutral axis toward outer bottom romanoff et al 2013 the influence of superstructures on longitudinal strength should consider several main parameters including side shell openings side recess distribution longitudinal bulkhead and transverse supporting structures the whole ship 3d fe analysis is considered sufficient for the complicated global response issc 1997 including superstructures effectiveness shear lag in superstructure s decks and shear force transfer between hull and superstructures the longitudinal strength of cruise ship with multi layer superstructure decks was analyzed by a whole ship fem to study the interaction between main hull and superstructures zanic et al 2009 from elastic state to limit state the effect of superstructure on hull girder strength may be changed as the variation of the force transfer path due to local buckling and local yielding failure the ultimate strength of hull girder may be overestimated when no considering the change of the superstructure effectiveness shi and gao 2018 the superstructure influence on hull girder ultimate strength can also be analyzed by the model experiment method there are model experiment reports about stiffened panels box girders and scaled single deck ships shi and wang 2012a however the collapse experiment with superstructures has no report now for commons ships with a single deck the hull girder ultimate strength can be analyzed by the incremental iterative method initially proposed by smith 1977 the cross section is assumed to bend under an assumption of rigid boundary conditions and the neutral axis position of the cross section is the main parameter as a function of the curvature however this method has not considered the shear lag effect due to longitudinal bulkheads and side shells parmasto 2012 and the superstructure effectiveness to the contribution of main hull strength for actual ships the vertical bending moments and the vertical shear forces exist at the same time along ship length the ratio of the bending moment and the shear force varies for the different loading conditions although the position at the maximum bending moment usually has the shear force close to zero yao et al 2004 there are some cross sections with large bending moment and large shear force such as the position within 1 4 1 2 ship length the combination of shear force and bending moment will change the progressive failure mode and ultimate strength naar 2006 the effect of the vertical shear force on the bending ultimate strength should consider two factors 1 the combination of shear stress and axial compression stress on structural members kitarović et al 2010 2 the increase of longitudinal stress due to shear induced warping deformation at the cross section žanić and kitarović 2015 for the double side arrangement such as oil tankers the vertical shear forces have a little influence on the bending ultimate strength because the side shell has sufficient strength to withstand the shear deformation alfred mohammed et al 2016 but the single side structures in cruise ships are more prone to shear loads and also the side shell openings and recess in cruise ships will reduce shear stiffness to have significant effect on the hull superstructure interaction parmasto 2012 this paper tries to solve the problems about the superstructures on hull girder ultimate strength for cruise ships including the superstructure effectiveness the applicability of increment iterative method on ultimate strength evaluation for cruise ships and the combined action of bending moment and shear force firstly a collapse experiment of steel model with superstructures under hogging conditions is provided and nonlinear fe analysis method is validated by the experiment results then superstructure effectiveness is analyzed in detail and the increment iterative method is revised at last the combination action of bending moment and shear force on hull girder ultimate strength is studied 2 collapse experiment of steel model with superstructures ultimate strength analysis of marine structures mainly deals with the progressive failure procedure of structural members including plates stiffeners with attached plating stiffened panels and even a whole hull girder and gives an estimation of the maximum load bearing capacity under assigned load conditions hull girder ultimate strength evaluation is one of the critical requirements in ship classification rules such as common structure rules iacs 2016 the hull girder failure should be avoided to provide enough structural redundancy for ship navigation in harsh sea state there are several methods used for hull girder ultimate strength evaluation including incremental iterative method nonlinear finite element and simple empirical formulas these methods are established based on cross check with experimental results on actual ships or scaled models at present there is still no test report about ultimate strength of cruise ship with large superstructures perforated by large openings and side shell recess in order to study the superstructure contribution on bucking and yielding interaction it is needed to carry out ultimate strength experiment on a new model to reflect the special characteristics of superstructures for cruise ships 2 1 experiment model design the experiment model is designed based on the scantlings of one actual cruise ship at mid ship two lays of superstructures are considered in the experiment model in order to facilitate the model construction with thin plate the discontinuous characteristics by large windows and side shell recess are fully reflected in the experiment model the principal dimensions including model width model height window opening height and side shell recess due to lifeboat layout are reduced by one similar scale approximately equal to 16 7 as shown in table 1 the neutral axis height is used to show the material distribution at deck and at bottom which is also satisfied the similar scale 16 7 the same mild steel as actual cruise ship is used in the experiment model therefore the experiment model can be seemed as one scaled model of the cruise ship under hogging conditions the bottom structures of hull girder are in compression and the deck structures are in tension for ultimate strength analysis of hull girder the bottom structures are the critical region to control the progressive failure procedure generally the plate between the longitudinal stiffeners has a lower buckling strength than that of the stiffeners after the plate buckling the stiffened panels will also have some post buckling strength reverse so the ultimate strength of stiffened panels in the experiment model should be close to that of the actual cruise ship which can be predicted by the existing empirical formulas an empirical formula for predicting the axial ultimate strength was derived based on numerous model collapse test data of longitudinally stiffened panels paik and thayamballi 1997 since the ultimate strength of columns must be less than the elastic column buckling strength the empirical formula is given by 1 σ u σ y 1 0 995 0 936 λ 2 0 170 β 2 0 188 λ 2 β 2 0 067 λ 4 1 λ 2 another empirical formula for axial ultimate strength was proposed zhang and khan 2009 based on extensive non linear fe analyses of stiffened panels which was validated by 58 experimental results the empirical formula is given by 2 σ u σ y 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 for λ 2 and take β 1 0 if β 1 0 based on eq 1 and eq 2 the ultimate strength of stiffened panels at bottom and side shell summarized in table 2 although a little slight different results are given by the two empirical formulas a similar trend between cruise ship and experiment model can be obtained the ultimate strength of these stiffened panels in the experiment model is close to the actual cruise ship the bottom structure has a lower strength that the side shell therefore the buckling is expected to occur firstly on bottom structures under hogging conditions and then gradually propagates to side shell the cross section of the actual cruise ship and experiment model are shown in fig 1 for the experimental model the bottom and side shell have 4 mm plate and other decks have 2 mm plate the longitudinal stiffener at bottom and side shell is fb70 4 and other longitudinal stiffeners are fb40 2 in the transverse direction the longitudinal structures are supported by frames fb70 6 at bottom and side shell and fb40 6 at other positions pillars φ25 4 of every second web frame support at side shell between deck 1 and deck 2 in the length direction the experiment model is divided to three parts the middle part is the experiment region with a length 3000 mm and the two side loading parts are used to apply bending moment the whole length of the experiment model is 5500 mm the longitudinal stiffeners are kept continuous and the same scantlings along the whole model in order to assure the failure collapse occurs at the middle the web frame space at the two sides is shortened by a half and their plate thickness is increased by 4 mm two bulkheads with 6 mm plate are designed at two end sections of the experiment model to simulate the closed wall of cruise ship and another two bulkheads are located at two ends of the middle part to facilitate applying vertical forces 2 2 experiment procedure the experiment model is fabricated by one small ship yard as the requirements of shipbuilding quality standards iacs 2017 to control the fairness and alignment of structural members the structural members are cut from steel plates by a laser cutting machine almost without any deformation the initial deformation is mainly induced by the welding assembly the maximum value based on measurement is about 2 mm at the middle part the experiment model are placed on two rigid support seats with a round bar at the top face as shown in fig 2 the superstructures are downward and the bottom is upward to apply two vertical forces f 1 and f 2 by hydraulic devices the strain gauges a1 a10 are pasted at bottom and side shell as shown in fig 1 to measure the longitudinal strain variation in the experiment procedure the two forces f 1 and f 2 are the kept the same value and increased by the same step to ensure the middle part under pure hogging condition the hogging moment at the mid ship can be calculated by m mid 1200 mm f 1 at first two times of small vertical force are applied to test the availability of experiment facility and release some of the welding residual stress then the vertical forces are increased step by step until the hull girder presents large deformation and the vertical forces cannot be increased anymore the bending moment corresponding to the maximum vertical forces is the ultimate strength of the hull girder 2 3 experiment results as the vertical forces increase there is some noise coming out from the deformation of structural members the strain gauges show that the experiment model present different strains at the bottom as shown in fig 3 the strain gauges at the middle plate such as a4 present stress change from compression to tension when the bottom panel is under compression that is because the a4 position occurs buckling deformation and the local bending deformation induces a tension stress at outer surface of the plate the values of strain gauges a1 and a7 at the intersection of bottom and side shell where has a bigger stiffness to prevent local buckling under compression are increased almost linearly as the bending moment increases up to 300 knm the nonlinear phenomenon become obvious for large bending moment that is a small increase of bending moment will induce a big increase of strains at a1 and a7 this is a symbol for approaching the limit state of hull girder under vertical bending the values of strain gauges a8 a10 at side shell have lower stress at the early stage when the bending moment is small as local bucking deformation increases at bottom more regions at side shell presents a higher compression stress which means that the collapse deformation expands upwards from bottom to side shell when the bending moment reach up to 436 5knm the hydraulic devices continue to increase their vertical displacement but the bending moment can not increase anymore as the vertical displacement increase from 20 mm to 40 mm the bending moment show a slight reduction as shown in fig 4 the ultimate strength of this experiment model is m u exp 436 5knm the failure mode is shown in fig 5 including a whole view and a local view the experiment model presents a whole collapse deformation with an amplitude of more than 45 mm at the mid ship from the local view the bottom and side shell present a buckling deformation concave convex deformation under axial compression at the plate between stiffeners up to a maximum of 20 mm the superstructures at the mid ship present bending deformation as the main hull under deck 1 the superstructures of the experiment model are still effective as the increase of local yielding failure and no tension crack occurs even at the limit state 2 4 comparison of model experiment and fe analysis the model experiment is valuable to analyze the complicated issues about ultimate strength of large superstructures however this method has still some limitations such as high cost and limited loading conditions fe analysis can be an efficient supplement to the model experiment it is noted that the critical factors in fe analysis should be firstly studied and validated by the experiment results to obtain a reasonable simulation of nonlinear large deformation and elastic plastic response the commercial software abaqus is used to carry out fe analysis shi and wang 2012b in the ff model x axis is defined along model length y axis is defined along model width and z axis is defined along model height owing to the y symmetry of model and loading conditions only the left half of the experiment model is fabricated the window openings side shell recess and pillar support are also simulated in the fe model the boundary conditions are similar as the experiment with constraint of uz displacement at intersection of two end bulkheads and deck 3 one point at the intersection of longitudinal section in center plane and upper deck is applied with constraint of ux displacement to prevent rigid movement the material of experiment model is mild steel its stress strain curve is measured by tensile test on standard specimens the elastic modulus is e 2 06 105 mpa yield strength σ y 261 mpa and ultimate tensile strength σ u 384 mpa the shell element s4r has been used for modeling steel plates which is suitable for large strain analysis a suitable mesh density should be found to balance the calculation efficient and cpu time as the general requirements in ship rules making such as iacs technical background document iacs 2014 the plate width between stiffeners should be divided by no less than 6 elements the stiffener height should be divided by no less than 3 elements and the element length and width ratio should be less than 2 0 in this paper the meshing density is 10 elements in plate width between stiffeners the mesh size is about 20 mm in both its length and width directions the effect of initial imperfection on ultimate strength is very complicated when the shape of initial imperfection is explicitly different from the limit failure mode the ultimate strength will be increased tagg and rahim 2004 generally the shape as 1st buckling mode can reduce the ultimate strength which is selected as the initial imperfection shape in the following analysis as shown in fig 6 based on measures of the experiment model the magnitude of initial imperfection reaches up to 2 mm in this paper the magnitude of initial imperfection is separately assumed to be 1 mm 2 mm and 3 mm in order to analyze the effect of initial imperfection on ultimate strength the results of ultimate strength are summarized in table 4 compared with fe model without any initial imperfection the models with 1 mm 2 mm and 3 mm initial imperfection will reduce the ultimate strength separately by 13 6 15 6 and 16 0 fig 5 also compares with the failure mode by the experiment and fe analysis which shows a similar buckling deformation at the bottom and side shell under compression the welding residual stresses also have some influence on ultimate strength which can be simulated by thermal elastoplastic analysis shi and wang 2012a the material expansion factor is set as 1 35 10 5 c as shown in table 3 based on the magnitude of compression stress in the plate neighboring the weld seam the residual stress can be divided into three levels paik 2018 as following 3 σ r 0 05 σ y for slight level 0 15 σ y for average level 0 30 σ y for severe level the residual stress can be simulated by changing heat temperature at the weld seams three steps are defined in the fe analysis 1st step increase the temperature on the weld seams to a higher value to produce tension stress at their neighboring plates due to heating expansion 2nd step reduce the temperature down to the room temperature to produce compression stress due to internal force balance 3rd step increase the vertical forces f 1 and f 2 until the model collapses based on several attempts the heating temperature on weld seams is defined as 600 c to produce the longitudinal compression stress of 0 30 σ y on the plate nearby weld seams the welding residual stress distribution in longitudinal direction is shown in fig 7 the weld seams present tension stress and their neighboring plates present compression stress the effect of welding residual stress on ultimate strength is summarized in table 4 compared with fe model with initial imperfection of 2 mm the residual stress of 0 30 σ y reduces the ultimate strength by 2 5 when comparing the curve of bending moment versus vertical displacement as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the model with residual stress has a closer curve as the model experiment the residual stress has a bigger influence on reducing the bending stiffness and the initial imperfection has a bigger influence on reducing the ultimate strength and triggering the most dangerous failure mode by comparing the several fe results and the experiment results it proves that the ff modeling method with 2 mm buckling mode as initial imperfection and 0 30 σ y compression stress as residual stress is reasonable for ultimate strength analysis for the following sections 3 influence of superstructures on hull girder ultimate strength 3 1 superstructures effectiveness owing to enough support stiffness from the transverse frames and transverse bulkheads the superstructures of experiment model presents a hogging bend deformation as the main hull under deck 1 by extracting the longitudinal stress of each deck plate elements from the fe analysis as shown in fig 8 the superstructure bending deformation is not fully consistent with the main hull although the deck 1 can be seemed as the main deck in ship design rules the stress of deck 1 is lower than the superstructure decks when the bending moment is lower the experiment model is still in elastic state the longitudinal stresses for main hull almost comply with a linear distribution and the longitudinal stress for deck 2 and deck 3 is a little lower than the linear assumed stress it shows that the superstructures are partially effective for hull girder bending strength as the bending moment increases the stiffened panels at bottom present buckling collapse and more loads will be transferred to the side shell due to local bending deformation induced by buckling failure some of bottom structures can not withstand more compression stress and even present tension stress at the limit state the longitudinal stresses are also plotted in fig 8 when the bottom panels reaches up to the buckling strength their longitudinal stress will not increase as the outer bending moment increase more stress will be withstood by the lower part of side shell as shown fig 8 at 80 mm bl the superstructure effectiveness η can be defined as the ratio between actual longitudinal stress and linearly assumed stress based on beam theory 4 η σ s σ s where σ s average longitudinal stress of superstructure plates obtained by fe analysis σ d average longitudinal stress of main deck plates obtained by fe analysis σ b average longitudinal stress of bottom plates obtained by fe analysis h distance between superstructure deck and main deck h distance between main deck and base line σ s linearly assumed stress of superstructure plates σ s 1 h h σ d σ b σ d σ d from elastic state to limit state the bottom compression stresses have not increased a lot due to local buckling failure but the tension stresses at the main deck deck 1 have increased significantly by using eq 4 the superstructure effectiveness is about 64 2 69 6 for this experiment model as shown in table 5 the higher the deck locates the lower superstructure effectiveness it have 3 2 revision of increment iterative method the increment iterative method initially proposed by smith 1977 has been accepted as one of main method to evaluate hull girder ultimate strength in classification society rules such as common structure rules iacs 2016 the cross section of hull girder is assumed to remain plane during each bending moment increment however this assumption cannot be full satisfied for cruise ships with partially effective superstructures it needs to revise this method to be applicable to ships with large superstructures in essence the increment iterative method divides the cross section of hull girder into a set of independent elements these elements have specialized stress strain curves based on theory analysis or empirical statistics when the curvature is increased step by step the failure mechanisms of each element can be found by equilibrium of axial force and bending moment the procedure is to be repeated until the maximum value of bending moment is reached that is the hull girder ultimate strength based on the independent characteristics of each element the superstructure effectiveness defined in sec3 1 can be introduced in the increment iterative method the stress strain curves are adopted as iacs common structure rules the scantlings of superstructures are reduced according to the value of superstructure effectiveness at each deck or an average value of the whole superstructures the superstructure effectiveness is set as η ealstic equal to that at elastic state calculated in table s 5 and i e 69 6 for deck 2 and 64 2 for deck 3 the ultimate strength m u rev calculated by the revised increment iterative method is compared well with the experiment results as shown in table 6 in order to show the influence of superstructure effectiveness six different values including 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 are also assumed for the average effectiveness of the whole superstructures it shows that the fully effective superstructure will overestimate the ultimate strength by 31 4 compared with the experiment results when the superstructure effectiveness is assumed to be 60 it will give a good estimation of ultimate strength the superstructure effectiveness 60 is recommended to apply in the concept design stage of cruise ship with the similar configuration as the model in this paper when there is enough information of ship drawings it had better to carry out the whole ship fem to obtain more precise value of superstructure effectiveness it should be noted that the discontinuous superstructures should be deducted according to effective area and then the remaining part are reduced again by the superstructure effectiveness in order to validate the proposed method the actual cruise ship with 2 layers of superstructures in fig 1 a and the cruise ship with 6 layers of superstructures in fig 9 are chosen to calculate ultimate strength by the revised increment iterative method the superstructure effectiveness is assumed to be 60 for each deck in superstructures table 7 shows the comparison of the ultimate strength m u rev by the revised increment iterative method and m u fe by the fe analysis method as described in sec2 4 the results show that the revised increment iterative method can give a good estimation of ultimate strength of actual cruise ship 3 3 combination action of bending moment and shear force in actual loading conditions the cruise ship is under combination of vertical bending moment and shear force in some cross sections along ship length the value of bending moment and shear force are both very high the collapse of hull girder will be induced by the combination of bending moment and shear force however in the model experiment it is difficult to apply the bending moment and shear force at the same time to obtain the collapse deformation at the expected position therefore it needs to use fe analysis to study the interaction of bending moment and shear force on collapse mechanism of experiment model with superstructures the shear force can be applied in the fe model as uniformly distributed load on two transverse frames one force is upwards and another force is downwards fujikubo et al 2015 however the applied shear force will induce bending moment in the long hull girder another method for preventing bending moments due to shear is used in this paper because of reduced shear capacity of superstructures by the side shell opening and recess most of the shear forces will be carried by the side shell of main hull therefore the shear force is applied to the side shell as distributed line load along the four edges as shown in fig 10 the moments induced by vertical shear force and horizontal shear force have the same magnitude but an opposite direction it is easy to control the ratio of bending moment and shear force at mid ship to facilitate any combination of these two loads in the fe analysis only the vertical forces f 1 f 2 are applied to simulate the pure bending condition at mid ship as in sec 2 4 the ultimate strength of the experiment model under pure bending is m u pure 429 1 knm only the shear forces τ 1 2 5 τ 2 are applied simulate the pure shear condition at mid ship the ultimate strength of the experiment model under pure shear is f u pure 420 7 kn in the combination action of bending and shear two loading steps are defined as following 1 increase the bending moment or shear force to a fixed ratio of its maximum value such as 40 m u pure or 70 f u pure 2 keep the bending moment or shear force unchanged and increase the shear force or bending moment until the model reaches collapse under combination loads the failure modes under combination action of bending moment and shear force at middle part of experiment model are shown in fig 11 under pure bending condition the bottom panel present buckling collapse at the longitudinal and its attached plate under pure shear condition the side shell of main hull presents large deformation along diagonal direction which leads to an incline deformation on the widow opening the shear deformation in the superstructures is similar as that in actual cruise ships calculated by issc 2006 under combination of two loads compression buckling at bottom and shear buckling at side shell simultaneously occur and the superstructures are bearing larger stresses at top deck and opening corner all the fe results under combination of vertical bending moment and shear force for experiment model with superstructures are summarized in fig 12 it is clear that the shear force has a great influence on reducing bending ultimate strength when shear force reaches up to more than 50 f u pure based on the fe results a new simple formula in eq 5 is proposed to predict the ultimate strength of cruise ship with large superstructures 5 m u m u p u r e 4 f u f u p u r e 4 1 where m u pure is the ultimate strength under pure bending condition f u pure is the ultimate strength under pure shear condition m u f u is the ultimate strength under combination of bending and shear in order to validate the proposed eq 5 the actual cruise ship as shown in fig 1 a is chosen to calculate the ultimate strength under combination action of bending and shear by repeating the same procedure described in this section the comparison between the proposed equation and fe results of actual cruise ship is also shown in fig 12 the results show that the proposed equation can be applicable to actual cruise ships 4 conclusions cruise ships have large superstructures with lots of window openings and side shell recess for lifeboat arrangement at present there is lack of a simple evaluation method to know about the influence of superstructures on hull girder ultimate strength this paper has carried out a collapse experiment of steel model with superstructures and then used the nonlinear fe analysis method to study the influence of superstructures on hull girder ultimate strength the main conclusions are summarized as following 1 the experiment model with superstructures designed in this paper can reflect the discontinuous characteristics and principal dimensions of one actual cruise ship the stiffened panels at bottom and side shell has almost the same ultimate strength and progressive collapse sequences as the cruise ship 2 the experiment results show that the bottom and side shell present a concave convex buckling deformation at the plate between stiffeners the superstructures bend accordingly as the main hull deformation with local yielding failure and no crack occurs at the limit state 3 the fe analysis method in this paper has been validated by the experiment results the initial imperfection has a bigger influence on reducing the ultimate strength and the residual stress has a bigger influence on reducing the bending stiffness 4 the superstructure effectiveness is about 64 2 69 6 for the experiment model the higher the deck locates the lower superstructure effectiveness it have 5 the revised increment iterative method by reducing the scantlings as superstructure effectiveness at elastic state can give a good result about ultimate strength compared with the experiment results 6 under combination of bending moment and shear force compression buckling at bottom and shear buckling at side shell simultaneously occur a new simple formula has been proposed to predict the combined ultimate strength of cruise ship with large superstructures it should be noted that this paper has carried out the analysis of superstructure effectiveness based on one simplified test model and more cruise ships are needed to be analyzed in the future to find a general rule about the effect of large superstructures on ultimate strength

21068,cruise ships have large and long superstructures which are almost extending the whole ship length with discontinuous characteristics such as side shell recess and many window openings the superstructure effectiveness on hull girder longitudinal strength is a complicated but unavoidable issue in ship design stage this paper has carried out a collapse experiment of steel model with superstructures which is designed based on one actual cruise ship critical factors including initial imperfections and welding residual stress used in nonlinear fe analysis have been validated by the experiment results then the superstructure effectiveness is analyzed to revise the increment iterative to be applicable for ultimate strength evaluation for cruise ships at last the combination action of bending moment and shear force is studied and a new combination formula is proposed the conclusions in this paper will be useful for ship design rules amendment and safety assessment for cruise

configurations with large superstructures almost extending the whole ship length and ship width which will bring in new design problems the superstructures are the most important part for the attraction of passengers in order to satisfy the travel and relaxation need at the sea more cabins with balconies atriums through several decks theatres and dining halls with wide space in the superstructures the sides are penetrated by many window openings door openings balconies opening and longitudinal bulkhead recess for lifeboat arrangement which will reduce the shear stiffness within the plane based on loading manuals of cruise ships the still water bending moment is in hogging conditions for most cases due to a low deadweight requirement or a uniform loading at each deck with a low block ship coefficient bajic 2015 the hogging condition under still water and wave moment will be the critical design case this paper will deal with the issues of hogging condition in following analysis from the view of load carrying capacity the bending moment can be carried by both the main hull and the superstructures the hull girder can be seemed as a beam with various cross section characteristics for real combinations of open and closed cross section zanic and prebeg 2005 the longitudinal stress of superstructures is lower than that of expected from classic beam theory biot et al 2006 the interaction between main hull and superstructure becomes complicated the superstructures can not bend as fully consistent with main hull and therefore the superstructures effectiveness on longitudinal strength is reduced fricke and gerlach 2015 the superstructures will bear a larger part of longitudinal loads after the optimal design with a lower neutral axis toward outer bottom romanoff et al 2013 the influence of superstructures on longitudinal strength should consider several main parameters including side shell openings side recess distribution longitudinal bulkhead and transverse supporting structures the whole ship 3d fe analysis is considered sufficient for the complicated global response issc 1997 including superstructures effectiveness shear lag in superstructure s decks and shear force transfer between hull and superstructures the longitudinal strength of cruise ship with multi layer superstructure decks was analyzed by a whole ship fem to study the interaction between main hull and superstructures zanic et al 2009 from elastic state to limit state the effect of superstructure on hull girder strength may be changed as the variation of the force transfer path due to local buckling and local yielding failure the ultimate strength of hull girder may be overestimated when no considering the change of the superstructure effectiveness shi and gao 2018 the superstructure influence on hull girder ultimate strength can also be analyzed by the model experiment method there are model experiment reports about stiffened panels box girders and scaled single deck ships shi and wang 2012a however the collapse experiment with superstructures has no report now for commons ships with a single deck the hull girder ultimate strength can be analyzed by the incremental iterative method initially proposed by smith 1977 the cross section is assumed to bend under an assumption of rigid boundary conditions and the neutral axis position of the cross section is the main parameter as a function of the curvature however this method has not considered the shear lag effect due to longitudinal bulkheads and side shells parmasto 2012 and the superstructure effectiveness to the contribution of main hull strength for actual ships the vertical bending moments and the vertical shear forces exist at the same time along ship length the ratio of the bending moment and the shear force varies for the different loading conditions although the position at the maximum bending moment usually has the shear force close to zero yao et al 2004 there are some cross sections with large bending moment and large shear force such as the position within 1 4 1 2 ship length the combination of shear force and bending moment will change the progressive failure mode and ultimate strength naar 2006 the effect of the vertical shear force on the bending ultimate strength should consider two factors 1 the combination of shear stress and axial compression stress on structural members kitarović et al 2010 2 the increase of longitudinal stress due to shear induced warping deformation at the cross section žanić and kitarović 2015 for the double side arrangement such as oil tankers the vertical shear forces have a little influence on the bending ultimate strength because the side shell has sufficient strength to withstand the shear deformation alfred mohammed et al 2016 but the single side structures in cruise ships are more prone to shear loads and also the side shell openings and recess in cruise ships will reduce shear stiffness to have significant effect on the hull superstructure interaction parmasto 2012 this paper tries to solve the problems about the superstructures on hull girder ultimate strength for cruise ships including the superstructure effectiveness the applicability of increment iterative method on ultimate strength evaluation for cruise ships and the combined action of bending moment and shear force firstly a collapse experiment of steel model with superstructures under hogging conditions is provided and nonlinear fe analysis method is validated by the experiment results then superstructure effectiveness is analyzed in detail and the increment iterative method is revised at last the combination action of bending moment and shear force on hull girder ultimate strength is studied 2 collapse experiment of steel model with superstructures ultimate strength analysis of marine structures mainly deals with the progressive failure procedure of structural members including plates stiffeners with attached plating stiffened panels and even a whole hull girder and gives an estimation of the maximum load bearing capacity under assigned load conditions hull girder ultimate strength evaluation is one of the critical requirements in ship classification rules such as common structure rules iacs 2016 the hull girder failure should be avoided to provide enough structural redundancy for ship navigation in harsh sea state there are several methods used for hull girder ultimate strength evaluation including incremental iterative method nonlinear finite element and simple empirical formulas these methods are established based on cross check with experimental results on actual ships or scaled models at present there is still no test report about ultimate strength of cruise ship with large superstructures perforated by large openings and side shell recess in order to study the superstructure contribution on bucking and yielding interaction it is needed to carry out ultimate strength experiment on a new model to reflect the special characteristics of superstructures for cruise ships 2 1 experiment model design the experiment model is designed based on the scantlings of one actual cruise ship at mid ship two lays of superstructures are considered in the experiment model in order to facilitate the model construction with thin plate the discontinuous characteristics by large windows and side shell recess are fully reflected in the experiment model the principal dimensions including model width model height window opening height and side shell recess due to lifeboat layout are reduced by one similar scale approximately equal to 16 7 as shown in table 1 the neutral axis height is used to show the material distribution at deck and at bottom which is also satisfied the similar scale 16 7 the same mild steel as actual cruise ship is used in the experiment model therefore the experiment model can be seemed as one scaled model of the cruise ship under hogging conditions the bottom structures of hull girder are in compression and the deck structures are in tension for ultimate strength analysis of hull girder the bottom structures are the critical region to control the progressive failure procedure generally the plate between the longitudinal stiffeners has a lower buckling strength than that of the stiffeners after the plate buckling the stiffened panels will also have some post buckling strength reverse so the ultimate strength of stiffened panels in the experiment model should be close to that of the actual cruise ship which can be predicted by the existing empirical formulas an empirical formula for predicting the axial ultimate strength was derived based on numerous model collapse test data of longitudinally stiffened panels paik and thayamballi 1997 since the ultimate strength of columns must be less than the elastic column buckling strength the empirical formula is given by 1 σ u σ y 1 0 995 0 936 λ 2 0 170 β 2 0 188 λ 2 β 2 0 067 λ 4 1 λ 2 another empirical formula for axial ultimate strength was proposed zhang and khan 2009 based on extensive non linear fe analyses of stiffened panels which was validated by 58 experimental results the empirical formula is given by 2 σ u σ y 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 for λ 2 and take β 1 0 if β 1 0 based on eq 1 and eq 2 the ultimate strength of stiffened panels at bottom and side shell summarized in table 2 although a little slight different results are given by the two empirical formulas a similar trend between cruise ship and experiment model can be obtained the ultimate strength of these stiffened panels in the experiment model is close to the actual cruise ship the bottom structure has a lower strength that the side shell therefore the buckling is expected to occur firstly on bottom structures under hogging conditions and then gradually propagates to side shell the cross section of the actual cruise ship and experiment model are shown in fig 1 for the experimental model the bottom and side shell have 4 mm plate and other decks have 2 mm plate the longitudinal stiffener at bottom and side shell is fb70 4 and other longitudinal stiffeners are fb40 2 in the transverse direction the longitudinal structures are supported by frames fb70 6 at bottom and side shell and fb40 6 at other positions pillars φ25 4 of every second web frame support at side shell between deck 1 and deck 2 in the length direction the experiment model is divided to three parts the middle part is the experiment region with a length 3000 mm and the two side loading parts are used to apply bending moment the whole length of the experiment model is 5500 mm the longitudinal stiffeners are kept continuous and the same scantlings along the whole model in order to assure the failure collapse occurs at the middle the web frame space at the two sides is shortened by a half and their plate thickness is increased by 4 mm two bulkheads with 6 mm plate are designed at two end sections of the experiment model to simulate the closed wall of cruise ship and another two bulkheads are located at two ends of the middle part to facilitate applying vertical forces 2 2 experiment procedure the experiment model is fabricated by one small ship yard as the requirements of shipbuilding quality standards iacs 2017 to control the fairness and alignment of structural members the structural members are cut from steel plates by a laser cutting machine almost without any deformation the initial deformation is mainly induced by the welding assembly the maximum value based on measurement is about 2 mm at the middle part the experiment model are placed on two rigid support seats with a round bar at the top face as shown in fig 2 the superstructures are downward and the bottom is upward to apply two vertical forces f 1 and f 2 by hydraulic devices the strain gauges a1 a10 are pasted at bottom and side shell as shown in fig 1 to measure the longitudinal strain variation in the experiment procedure the two forces f 1 and f 2 are the kept the same value and increased by the same step to ensure the middle part under pure hogging condition the hogging moment at the mid ship can be calculated by m mid 1200 mm f 1 at first two times of small vertical force are applied to test the availability of experiment facility and release some of the welding residual stress then the vertical forces are increased step by step until the hull girder presents large deformation and the vertical forces cannot be increased anymore the bending moment corresponding to the maximum vertical forces is the ultimate strength of the hull girder 2 3 experiment results as the vertical forces increase there is some noise coming out from the deformation of structural members the strain gauges show that the experiment model present different strains at the bottom as shown in fig 3 the strain gauges at the middle plate such as a4 present stress change from compression to tension when the bottom panel is under compression that is because the a4 position occurs buckling deformation and the local bending deformation induces a tension stress at outer surface of the plate the values of strain gauges a1 and a7 at the intersection of bottom and side shell where has a bigger stiffness to prevent local buckling under compression are increased almost linearly as the bending moment increases up to 300 knm the nonlinear phenomenon become obvious for large bending moment that is a small increase of bending moment will induce a big increase of strains at a1 and a7 this is a symbol for approaching the limit state of hull girder under vertical bending the values of strain gauges a8 a10 at side shell have lower stress at the early stage when the bending moment is small as local bucking deformation increases at bottom more regions at side shell presents a higher compression stress which means that the collapse deformation expands upwards from bottom to side shell when the bending moment reach up to 436 5knm the hydraulic devices continue to increase their vertical displacement but the bending moment can not increase anymore as the vertical displacement increase from 20 mm to 40 mm the bending moment show a slight reduction as shown in fig 4 the ultimate strength of this experiment model is m u exp 436 5knm the failure mode is shown in fig 5 including a whole view and a local view the experiment model presents a whole collapse deformation with an amplitude of more than 45 mm at the mid ship from the local view the bottom and side shell present a buckling deformation concave convex deformation under axial compression at the plate between stiffeners up to a maximum of 20 mm the superstructures at the mid ship present bending deformation as the main hull under deck 1 the superstructures of the experiment model are still effective as the increase of local yielding failure and no tension crack occurs even at the limit state 2 4 comparison of model experiment and fe analysis the model experiment is valuable to analyze the complicated issues about ultimate strength of large superstructures however this method has still some limitations such as high cost and limited loading conditions fe analysis can be an efficient supplement to the model experiment it is noted that the critical factors in fe analysis should be firstly studied and validated by the experiment results to obtain a reasonable simulation of nonlinear large deformation and elastic plastic response the commercial software abaqus is used to carry out fe analysis shi and wang 2012b in the ff model x axis is defined along model length y axis is defined along model width and z axis is defined along model height owing to the y symmetry of model and loading conditions only the left half of the experiment model is fabricated the window openings side shell recess and pillar support are also simulated in the fe model the boundary conditions are similar as the experiment with constraint of uz displacement at intersection of two end bulkheads and deck 3 one point at the intersection of longitudinal section in center plane and upper deck is applied with constraint of ux displacement to prevent rigid movement the material of experiment model is mild steel its stress strain curve is measured by tensile test on standard specimens the elastic modulus is e 2 06 105 mpa yield strength σ y 261 mpa and ultimate tensile strength σ u 384 mpa the shell element s4r has been used for modeling steel plates which is suitable for large strain analysis a suitable mesh density should be found to balance the calculation efficient and cpu time as the general requirements in ship rules making such as iacs technical background document iacs 2014 the plate width between stiffeners should be divided by no less than 6 elements the stiffener height should be divided by no less than 3 elements and the element length and width ratio should be less than 2 0 in this paper the meshing density is 10 elements in plate width between stiffeners the mesh size is about 20 mm in both its length and width directions the effect of initial imperfection on ultimate strength is very complicated when the shape of initial imperfection is explicitly different from the limit failure mode the ultimate strength will be increased tagg and rahim 2004 generally the shape as 1st buckling mode can reduce the ultimate strength which is selected as the initial imperfection shape in the following analysis as shown in fig 6 based on measures of the experiment model the magnitude of initial imperfection reaches up to 2 mm in this paper the magnitude of initial imperfection is separately assumed to be 1 mm 2 mm and 3 mm in order to analyze the effect of initial imperfection on ultimate strength the results of ultimate strength are summarized in table 4 compared with fe model without any initial imperfection the models with 1 mm 2 mm and 3 mm initial imperfection will reduce the ultimate strength separately by 13 6 15 6 and 16 0 fig 5 also compares with the failure mode by the experiment and fe analysis which shows a similar buckling deformation at the bottom and side shell under compression the welding residual stresses also have some influence on ultimate strength which can be simulated by thermal elastoplastic analysis shi and wang 2012a the material expansion factor is set as 1 35 10 5 c as shown in table 3 based on the magnitude of compression stress in the plate neighboring the weld seam the residual stress can be divided into three levels paik 2018 as following 3 σ r 0 05 σ y for slight level 0 15 σ y for average level 0 30 σ y for severe level the residual stress can be simulated by changing heat temperature at the weld seams three steps are defined in the fe analysis 1st step increase the temperature on the weld seams to a higher value to produce tension stress at their neighboring plates due to heating expansion 2nd step reduce the temperature down to the room temperature to produce compression stress due to internal force balance 3rd step increase the vertical forces f 1 and f 2 until the model collapses based on several attempts the heating temperature on weld seams is defined as 600 c to produce the longitudinal compression stress of 0 30 σ y on the plate nearby weld seams the welding residual stress distribution in longitudinal direction is shown in fig 7 the weld seams present tension stress and their neighboring plates present compression stress the effect of welding residual stress on ultimate strength is summarized in table 4 compared with fe model with initial imperfection of 2 mm the residual stress of 0 30 σ y reduces the ultimate strength by 2 5 when comparing the curve of bending moment versus vertical displacement as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the model with residual stress has a closer curve as the model experiment the residual stress has a bigger influence on reducing the bending stiffness and the initial imperfection has a bigger influence on reducing the ultimate strength and triggering the most dangerous failure mode by comparing the several fe results and the experiment results it proves that the ff modeling method with 2 mm buckling mode as initial imperfection and 0 30 σ y compression stress as residual stress is reasonable for ultimate strength analysis for the following sections 3 influence of superstructures on hull girder ultimate strength 3 1 superstructures effectiveness owing to enough support stiffness from the transverse frames and transverse bulkheads the superstructures of experiment model presents a hogging bend deformation as the main hull under deck 1 by extracting the longitudinal stress of each deck plate elements from the fe analysis as shown in fig 8 the superstructure bending deformation is not fully consistent with the main hull although the deck 1 can be seemed as the main deck in ship design rules the stress of deck 1 is lower than the superstructure decks when the bending moment is lower the experiment model is still in elastic state the longitudinal stresses for main hull almost comply with a linear distribution and the longitudinal stress for deck 2 and deck 3 is a little lower than the linear assumed stress it shows that the superstructures are partially effective for hull girder bending strength as the bending moment increases the stiffened panels at bottom present buckling collapse and more loads will be transferred to the side shell due to local bending deformation induced by buckling failure some of bottom structures can not withstand more compression stress and even present tension stress at the limit state the longitudinal stresses are also plotted in fig 8 when the bottom panels reaches up to the buckling strength their longitudinal stress will not increase as the outer bending moment increase more stress will be withstood by the lower part of side shell as shown fig 8 at 80 mm bl the superstructure effectiveness η can be defined as the ratio between actual longitudinal stress and linearly assumed stress based on beam theory 4 η σ s σ s where σ s average longitudinal stress of superstructure plates obtained by fe analysis σ d average longitudinal stress of main deck plates obtained by fe analysis σ b average longitudinal stress of bottom plates obtained by fe analysis h distance between superstructure deck and main deck h distance between main deck and base line σ s linearly assumed stress of superstructure plates σ s 1 h h σ d σ b σ d σ d from elastic state to limit state the bottom compression stresses have not increased a lot due to local buckling failure but the tension stresses at the main deck deck 1 have increased significantly by using eq 4 the superstructure effectiveness is about 64 2 69 6 for this experiment model as shown in table 5 the higher the deck locates the lower superstructure effectiveness it have 3 2 revision of increment iterative method the increment iterative method initially proposed by smith 1977 has been accepted as one of main method to evaluate hull girder ultimate strength in classification society rules such as common structure rules iacs 2016 the cross section of hull girder is assumed to remain plane during each bending moment increment however this assumption cannot be full satisfied for cruise ships with partially effective superstructures it needs to revise this method to be applicable to ships with large superstructures in essence the increment iterative method divides the cross section of hull girder into a set of independent elements these elements have specialized stress strain curves based on theory analysis or empirical statistics when the curvature is increased step by step the failure mechanisms of each element can be found by equilibrium of axial force and bending moment the procedure is to be repeated until the maximum value of bending moment is reached that is the hull girder ultimate strength based on the independent characteristics of each element the superstructure effectiveness defined in sec3 1 can be introduced in the increment iterative method the stress strain curves are adopted as iacs common structure rules the scantlings of superstructures are reduced according to the value of superstructure effectiveness at each deck or an average value of the whole superstructures the superstructure effectiveness is set as η ealstic equal to that at elastic state calculated in table s 5 and i e 69 6 for deck 2 and 64 2 for deck 3 the ultimate strength m u rev calculated by the revised increment iterative method is compared well with the experiment results as shown in table 6 in order to show the influence of superstructure effectiveness six different values including 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 are also assumed for the average effectiveness of the whole superstructures it shows that the fully effective superstructure will overestimate the ultimate strength by 31 4 compared with the experiment results when the superstructure effectiveness is assumed to be 60 it will give a good estimation of ultimate strength the superstructure effectiveness 60 is recommended to apply in the concept design stage of cruise ship with the similar configuration as the model in this paper when there is enough information of ship drawings it had better to carry out the whole ship fem to obtain more precise value of superstructure effectiveness it should be noted that the discontinuous superstructures should be deducted according to effective area and then the remaining part are reduced again by the superstructure effectiveness in order to validate the proposed method the actual cruise ship with 2 layers of superstructures in fig 1 a and the cruise ship with 6 layers of superstructures in fig 9 are chosen to calculate ultimate strength by the revised increment iterative method the superstructure effectiveness is assumed to be 60 for each deck in superstructures table 7 shows the comparison of the ultimate strength m u rev by the revised increment iterative method and m u fe by the fe analysis method as described in sec2 4 the results show that the revised increment iterative method can give a good estimation of ultimate strength of actual cruise ship 3 3 combination action of bending moment and shear force in actual loading conditions the cruise ship is under combination of vertical bending moment and shear force in some cross sections along ship length the value of bending moment and shear force are both very high the collapse of hull girder will be induced by the combination of bending moment and shear force however in the model experiment it is difficult to apply the bending moment and shear force at the same time to obtain the collapse deformation at the expected position therefore it needs to use fe analysis to study the interaction of bending moment and shear force on collapse mechanism of experiment model with superstructures the shear force can be applied in the fe model as uniformly distributed load on two transverse frames one force is upwards and another force is downwards fujikubo et al 2015 however the applied shear force will induce bending moment in the long hull girder another method for preventing bending moments due to shear is used in this paper because of reduced shear capacity of superstructures by the side shell opening and recess most of the shear forces will be carried by the side shell of main hull therefore the shear force is applied to the side shell as distributed line load along the four edges as shown in fig 10 the moments induced by vertical shear force and horizontal shear force have the same magnitude but an opposite direction it is easy to control the ratio of bending moment and shear force at mid ship to facilitate any combination of these two loads in the fe analysis only the vertical forces f 1 f 2 are applied to simulate the pure bending condition at mid ship as in sec 2 4 the ultimate strength of the experiment model under pure bending is m u pure 429 1 knm only the shear forces τ 1 2 5 τ 2 are applied simulate the pure shear condition at mid ship the ultimate strength of the experiment model under pure shear is f u pure 420 7 kn in the combination action of bending and shear two loading steps are defined as following 1 increase the bending moment or shear force to a fixed ratio of its maximum value such as 40 m u pure or 70 f u pure 2 keep the bending moment or shear force unchanged and increase the shear force or bending moment until the model reaches collapse under combination loads the failure modes under combination action of bending moment and shear force at middle part of experiment model are shown in fig 11 under pure bending condition the bottom panel present buckling collapse at the longitudinal and its attached plate under pure shear condition the side shell of main hull presents large deformation along diagonal direction which leads to an incline deformation on the widow opening the shear deformation in the superstructures is similar as that in actual cruise ships calculated by issc 2006 under combination of two loads compression buckling at bottom and shear buckling at side shell simultaneously occur and the superstructures are bearing larger stresses at top deck and opening corner all the fe results under combination of vertical bending moment and shear force for experiment model with superstructures are summarized in fig 12 it is clear that the shear force has a great influence on reducing bending ultimate strength when shear force reaches up to more than 50 f u pure based on the fe results a new simple formula in eq 5 is proposed to predict the ultimate strength of cruise ship with large superstructures 5 m u m u p u r e 4 f u f u p u r e 4 1 where m u pure is the ultimate strength under pure bending condition f u pure is the ultimate strength under pure shear condition m u f u is the ultimate strength under combination of bending and shear in order to validate the proposed eq 5 the actual cruise ship as shown in fig 1 a is chosen to calculate the ultimate strength under combination action of bending and shear by repeating the same procedure described in this section the comparison between the proposed equation and fe results of actual cruise ship is also shown in fig 12 the results show that the proposed equation can be applicable to actual cruise ships 4 conclusions cruise ships have large superstructures with lots of window openings and side shell recess for lifeboat arrangement at present there is lack of a simple evaluation method to know about the influence of superstructures on hull girder ultimate strength this paper has carried out a collapse experiment of steel model with superstructures and then used the nonlinear fe analysis method to study the influence of superstructures on hull girder ultimate strength the main conclusions are summarized as following 1 the experiment model with superstructures designed in this paper can reflect the discontinuous characteristics and principal dimensions of one actual cruise ship the stiffened panels at bottom and side shell has almost the same ultimate strength and progressive collapse sequences as the cruise ship 2 the experiment results show that the bottom and side shell present a concave convex buckling deformation at the plate between stiffeners the superstructures bend accordingly as the main hull deformation with local yielding failure and no crack occurs at the limit state 3 the fe analysis method in this paper has been validated by the experiment results the initial imperfection has a bigger influence on reducing the ultimate strength and the residual stress has a bigger influence on reducing the bending stiffness 4 the superstructure effectiveness is about 64 2 69 6 for the experiment model the higher the deck locates the lower superstructure effectiveness it have 5 the revised increment iterative method by reducing the scantlings as superstructure effectiveness at elastic state can give a good result about ultimate strength compared with the experiment results 6 under combination of bending moment and shear force compression buckling at bottom and shear buckling at side shell simultaneously occur a new simple formula has been proposed to predict the combined ultimate strength of cruise ship with large superstructures it should be noted that this paper has carried out the analysis of superstructure effectiveness based on one simplified test model and more cruise ships are needed to be analyzed in the future to find a general rule about the effect of large superstructures on ultimate strength

21069,burst pressure prediction of pipelines with interacting defects is essential in the integrity assessment of steel pipelines a series of evaluation criteria have been proposed to predict the burst pressure however the burst pressure is not accurately estimated by the existing evaluation methods for some defect distribution cases especially for circumferentially aligned defects in this study a new evaluation method of burst pressure is established by developing a reliable calculation expression of the effective defect depth a burst pressure study is performed by considering the effects of the defect distribution defect size and circumferential spacing between two adjacent defects based on finite element analysis then the detailed expression of effective depth of circumferentially aligned defects with different sizes is obtained full scale burst tests for corroded pipelines are conducted to validate the accuracy of the new evaluation method the predictions of burst capacity by the new method used for the pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects are in good agreement with experimental results for varying defect sizes and pipeline steel grades finally

attack which poses tremendous challenge to the pipeline strength since it results in a reduction in the pipe wall thickness the corrosion defects on the surface of the pipeline can exist independently or intensively each corrosion defect introduces disturbances in the pipeline stress and strain fields that spread out beyond the border of the defect when the areas of influence of adjacent defects are overlapping the defects are called interacting defects the failure behavior of interacting defects is much more complex than that of isolated defects the interaction between adjacent defects has a significant influence on the failure mode and loading capacity of corroded pipelines li et al 2016 mondal and dhar 2017 sun and cheng 2018 resulting in the decrease of internal pressure bearing capacity which is usually lower than the burst pressure induced by isolated defects benjamin et al 2005 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the integrity of the corroded pipeline by taking into account the interaction effect of adjacent defects the interaction mechanism between adjacent defects is complex which is affected by the location size and spacing of defects li et al 2016 mondal and dhar 2017 and chen et al 2015 studied the limit spacing of adjacent defects with different arrangements and sizes and proposed the judgment method of interaction defects sun and cheng 2019a 2019b and chouchaoui and pick 1994 1996 analyzed the failure modes of circumferentially aligned defects and axially aligned defects respectively and their results showed that the failure modes of adjacent defects with different arrangements are different the finite element fe method is widely used in the burst pressure analysis of adjacent defects de andrade et al 2006 carried out a comparison between the burst pressures predicted by the fe analysis and measured in the laboratory burst tests of pipelines containing interacting corrosion defects and the applicability of the fe method was verified a case study on the failure behavior of four colonies of corrosion defects using solid fe models was conducted by benjamin et al 2006a b and the difference in the failure modes of adjacent defects with different spacing was illustrated chen et al 2015 investigated the failure behavior and burst pressure of x80 pipelines with interacting corrosion defects based on nonlinear fe method and then an assessment procedure for predicting the burst pressure was developed elder soares et al 2019 studied the integrity of pipelines with interacting corrosion defects under combined internal pressure and thermal loads using the fe modelling a large number of burst tests for adjacent defects under internal pressure have been carried out by petrobras including adjacent defects composed of identical sizes benjamin et al 2005 2006a b and different sizes benjamin et al 2016a 2016b which provided the database of tests for the study of burst pressure of corroded pipelines in the past few decades considerable research has been conducted on the failure assessment methods of corroded pipelines and several codes have been established for evaluating the residual strength for interacting corrosion defects the level 2b method presents a relatively reliable burst pressure prediction benjamin et al 2005 2006a b 2007 benjamin and cunha 2007 li et al 2011 2012 which include the dnv rp f101 2015 method and the mixed type of interaction method mti benjamin et al 2007 considering the effects of defect length width and depth on burst pressure li et al 2011 proposed a new level 2b method to predict the burst pressure of pipeline with interacting defects in general level 2b evaluation methods for interacting defects are to transform the interaction defects into equivalent single corrosion defect and take the length of full wall thickness pipe that separates longitudinally spaced defects as the length of the equivalent single defect the main difference between the level 2b evaluation methods is the calculation approach of effective depth the arrangement and distribution of defects are bound to affect the evaluation result of level 2b hence it is necessary to classify the colony of corrosion defects in the beginning of the nineties kiefner and vieth 1990a defined three basic types of interaction of corrosion defects three types of interacting defects are shown in fig 1 the type 1 interacting defects are separated circumferentially while their individual profile overlaps when projected onto the longitudinal plane through the wall thickness the type 2 interacting defects are longitudinally aligned and their individual profiles are separated by a length of full wall thickness pipe the type 3 interacting defects represents the colony of irregular shaped corrosion defects composed of shallow and deep defects the research results indicated that the failure modes of interacting defects with different types were distinguishing chouchaoui and pick 1994 1996 sun and cheng 2019a 2019b circumferentially aligned defects are a special defect arrangement of type 1 interacting defects for this type of defect arrangement the projection of adjacent defects onto the longitudinal plane of the pipe are completely overlapped due to the same length of each defect therefore the changes of the number and circumferential spacing of adjacent defects do not affect the effective length causing the burst pressure of pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects not being accurately evaluated by the existing level 2b evaluation methods in this study the characteristics and effective depth of the circumferentially aligned defects are investigated and a more accurate burst pressure evaluation method is developed further study shows that the proposed evaluation method can also predict a satisfactory result for various types of defect arrangement the paper is organized as follows section 2 summarizes the differences of existing evaluation methods for pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects section 3 proposes a new effective depth expression and calculation method of failure pressure the numerical analysis of corroded pipeline is carried out in section 4 based on the fe modelling in section 5 the detailed effective depth expression of circumferentially aligned defects is determined according to the fe analysis section 6 outlines the validation and applicability analysis of the new failure pressure assessment method section 7 summarizes the conclusion of the study 2 comparison of evaluation methods for circumferentially aligned defects for interacting defects defect n to defect m as shown in fig 2 the effective depth of axial projection d n m a x i and circumferential projection d n m c i r are defined as follow respectively 1 d n m a x i s a p l n m d n m c i r s c p w n m 2 l n m l m i n i m 1 l i s l i w n m w m i n i m 1 w i s c i where s a p and s c p are the area of axial and circumferential projection respectively l n m and w n m are the effective length and effective width l i and w i are the length and width of each defect respectively s l i and s c i are the longitudinal and circumferential spacing respectively in the case of overlapping defects s l i and s c i are negative the differences among the three commonly used level 2b evaluation methods i e dnv rp f101 2015 method mixed type of interaction method mti benjamin et al 2007 and the evaluation method proposed by li et al 2011 are tabulated in table 1 for the circumferentially aligned defects the axial length l i of each defect is identical the axial projection range of each defect is consistent and s li l i thus l n m l m i n i m 1 l i s l i i n i m 1 s l i i n i m l i l i i n m in addition the axial projection of each defect coincides with that of the deepest defect and d n m a x i s a p l n m max d i l i l i max d i i n m the effective defect depths of the three level 2b evaluation methods are given respectively as 3 d n m d n v s a p l n m d n m a x i max d i i n m d n m m t i i n i m d i l i w i l n m w n m i n i m d i w i w n m d n m c i r d n m l i 1 2 d n m c i r d n m a x i 1 2 d n m c i r max d i i n m based on the characteristic of circumferentially aligned defects as the number of defect increases the effective length l n m remains unchanged and the effective width w n m increases however the influence of w n m on the burst pressure is generally not significant leis and stephens 1997 which is neglected by most of the codes therefore the effective depth d n m is the key factor for burst pressure evaluation of circumferentially aligned defects for the circumferentially aligned defects d n m a x i max d i i n m d n m c i r thus d n m m t i d n m c i r max d i d n m l i 1 2 d n m c i r max d i max d i d n m d n v max d i it is noted that the effective depths of all evaluation methods are not greater than the maximum depth of adjacent defects resulting in the evaluation result of the burst pressure being not less than the corresponding result for an isolated defect with the maximum depth in other words the existing three evaluation methods overestimate the bearing capacity of the pipeline with interacting corrosion defects by ignoring the interaction between adjacent defects which is extremely dangerous for structural safety assessment 3 proposal of a new effective depth expression based on eq 3 it can be seen that the effective depth of circumferentially aligned defects can be denoted by one or combination of axial effective depth d n m a x i and circumferential effective depth d n m c i r due to d n m m t i d n m c i r therefore in this study d n m a x i and d n m c i r are chosen as the independent variables in the new expression of effective depth d nm as 4 d n m k f d n m a x i d n m c i r b where f d n m a x i d n m c i r is a function with independent variables d n m a x i and d n m c i r k is the coefficient that characterizes the interaction between adjacent defects b is a constant term and in view of d n m a x i d n m c i r 0 d nm 0 thus the constant term b should be zero for the interaction between adjacent defects it is mainly affected by the spacing and size of defects li et al 2016 f d n m a x i d n m c i r represents the effect of spacing on the effective depth and the effect of defect size on the interaction between adjacent defects is determined by the parameter k therefore k is a dimensionless function of the maximum length width and minimum depth of the single defect in adjacent defects and its expression is given as 5 k g min d i t max l i d t max w i π d where g min d i t max l i d t max w i π d is a function with independent variables min d i max l i and max w i t and d are wall thickness and outer diameter of the pipe respectively it can be seen from eqs 4 and 5 that the effective depth of circumferentially aligned defects can be expressed as follows 6 d n m g min d i t max l i d t max w i π d f d n m a x i d n m c i r the true value of the effective depth needs to be determined in order to obtain the detailed expression forms of the two functions in eq 6 herein the evaluation method of dnv rp f101 2015 is adopted to ensure the burst pressure of the equivalent defect and then calculate the d nm as follows 7 p f 2 t σ u d t 1 d n m t 1 d n m t q n m p 0 1 d n m t 1 d n m t q n m 8 d n m p 0 p f p 0 t p f t q n m 9 q n m 1 0 31 l n m d t 2 where p f is the burst pressure of circumferentially aligned defects σ u is the engineering tensile strength p 0 is the burst pressure of defect free pipeline q n m is the length correction factor of equivalent defect it can be noted that the d n m can be obtained from eq 8 as long as the p f is known hence the fe analysis is used to determine the p f values for the pipeline with adjacent defects in different sizes and arrangements 4 numerical analysis of corroded pipeline 4 1 numerical modelling procedures to investigate the effect of circumferential spacing of colonies of defects on burst pressure the fe model of steel pipeline with a pair of circumferential corrosion defects were established which were developed based on the general purpose fe software program ansys the failure behavior and limit strength of corroded pipelines are analyzed by using the fe method as p f p 0 is a dimensionless parameter independent of the steel grade su et al 2016 sun et al 2020 it can be seen from eq 8 that the d n m is also independent of the steel grade therefore the steel pipeline made of api 5l x80 benjamin et al 2005 2006a b is selected in this study and its true stress strain curve can be approximated by the ramberg osgood model benjamin et al 2006a b de andrade et al 2006 as follows 10 ε t r u e σ t r u e e 0 0788174 σ t r u e σ u t r u e 12 642026 where ε true and σ ture are the true strain and stress respectively σ u ture denotes the true ultimate tensile strength and σ u ture 718 2 mpa e is the young s modulus with the value being 200 gpa the true stress strain curve in eq 10 is plotted in the following see fig 3 the outside diameter d and wall thickness t of the pipeline are 458 8 mm and 8 1 mm respectively the fe models are established using hexahedron solid element with 20 nodes solid45 due to symmetry only one quarter of the specimen is modeled as shown in fig 4 the defect is chamfered to minimize the effect of stress concentration the shape of the area of metal loss is postulated as rectangular with smooth edges the edge is chamfered made with a small radius of 3 5 mm the defect is divided into four layers along the thickness direction and the number of elements for the part away from the corroded region is reduced to one element through thickness the minimum thickness of the element is 0 6 mm and the maximum thickness is 8 1 mm a mesh convergence study is carried out to confirm that the mesh of fe model is sufficiently fine fine mesh is applied within and around the corroded area where stress concentration is expected coarser mesh is applied where uniform stress is expected an appropriate gradient between coarse and fine mesh is also considered the circumferential and axial dimensions of the elements in the defect part are about 2 67 mm and 2 80 mm respectively a typical finite element mesh used in this study is shown in fig 4 a and b in the present fe analysis the internal pressure is incrementally applied to the internal surface of the pipeline model and the axial force due to the end cap effect induced by the internal pressure is simultaneously applied to the pipe wall at the cut off boundary of the model due to the symmetry of this issue symmetric displacement boundary conditions are employed in the x y plane and x z plane the end of the pipe is only allowed to move in the z direction all the boundary conditions are illustrated in the fig 4 c the full newton raphson approach is used to solve the set of nonlinear equilibrium equations the failure criterion known as ligament stress criterion batte et al 1997 is adopted to determine the burst pressure of the corroded pipe where the failure is attained when the minimum von mises stress in the ligament exceeds the true ultimate tensile strength of the material benjamin et al 2006a b de andrade et al 2006 this criterion has been employed in the nonlinear fe analysis of corroded tubular specimens made of api 5l x80 steel benjamin et al 2006a b de andrade et al 2006 and the satisfactory results obtained verified the validity of the ligament stress criterion in the failure prediction 4 2 validation of fe model before the fe model is employed for failure analysis it is necessary to confirm the accuracy of the proposed model a series of full scale burst tests of api 5l x80 pipelines subject to internal pressure were performed by benjamin et al 2005 2006a b among these tests the specimens labeled as idts 2 interactive defect tubular specimen single defect idts 4 two defects aligned circumferentially and idts 6 two longitudinally aligned defects and two circumferentially aligned defects arranged in a rhombus shape were selected to validate the fe model the comparison of local failure behaviors is presented in fig 5 it can be seen that the failure position predicted by fe analysis is very similar to the actual one in the laboratory test table 2 tabulates quantitative comparisons in the burst pressure of the tubular pipe where p fem and p t are the burst pressures predicted by the fe analysis and laboratory test respectively the average error between these two sets of values is approximately 2 0 further demonstrating the accuracy of the fe model 4 3 description of the parametric study based on asme b31g 1984 criterion and modified b31g criterion kiefner and vieth 1990a 1990b the defects with defect length range of l d t 20 20 l d t 50 and l d t 50 are defined as short corrosion defect long corrosion defect and extremely long corrosion defect respectively table 3 presents the geometric characteristics of the basic cases and colony cases with circumferentially aligned defects the basic cases are pipe segments containing only one defect basic 1c and 2c are short corrosion defects basic 3c and 4c are long corrosion defects basic 5c is extremely long corrosion defect colony 1c to colony 5c are adjacent defects composed of two basic 1c to basic 5c defects respectively colony 6c are composed of four basic 1c defects arranged in a rhombus shape fig 6 show sketches which represent the top views of the colony 1c to 6c in these sketches the defects are drawn on the pipe external surface represented as a flat surface colony 6c is a kind of special circumferential aligned defects in which the two longitudinally aligned defects remain unchanged only the circumferential spacing s c changes in the different calculation cases in this analysis the values of d t are set to 0 3 0 5 and 0 67 which represent shallow corrosion defect moderate corrosion defect and severe corrosion defect respectively defect widths of 31 9 mm and 72 1 mm are adopted herein to study the effect of defect width on the burst pressure 4 4 fe analysis results the burst pressures p f b c of the five basic cases were listed in table 4 appendix a presents the burst pressures of the colony 1c to colony 5c and the corresponding burst pressure ratio p f p f b c the level of interaction between the adjacent defects in colony 1c to 6c can be detected by p f p f b c and it is assumed that there is no interaction when the p f p f b c is equal to or greater than 0 99 the smaller the ratio the more significant the interaction effect on burst pressure of pipelines is appendix a presents the burst pressures of the pipeline with colonies of circumferentially aligned defects it can be seen that the level of interaction between adjacent defects is mainly related to the circumferential spacing defect depth and length it is noted from fig 7 that the level of interaction gradually reduces with the increasing circumferential spacing for adjacent defects with the same defect length and circumferential spacing fig 7 a the level of interaction diminishes as the defect depth decreases taking the cases of ca2143 and ca2243 1 1 the definition of the nomenclature ca is shown in the note of appendix a as examples the ratio p f p f b c increases from 0 886 to 0 927 as the defect depth decreases from 5 39 mm to 4 05 mm the same result can be observed by comparing the burst pressures of other cases of colony 1c and colony 2c and cases of colony 3c and colony 4c 1 the defect length shows different results by comparing with the case of defect depth the level of interaction of adjacent defects with the same defect depth and circumferential spacing diminishes as the length of the defects increases fig 7 b for ca2128 and ca2328 the ratio p f p f b c increases from 0 875 to 0 889 with the defect length increasing from 39 6 mm to 272 63 mm the similar variation trend can also be obtained in the comparison of other cases of colony 1c and colony 3c and cases of colony 3c and colony 5c 5 determination of effective depth of circumferentially aligned defects 5 1 comparison of different effective depths herein the circumferentially adjacent defects cases with interaction are considered and the cases without interaction are removed as listed in appendix b the three basic effective depths i e d n m m t i d n m c i r and d n m a x i are calculated and listed in appendix b the actual effective depth d n m is determined by using eq 2 and eqs 7 9 fig 8 illustrates the comparison of different effective depths of circumferentially adjacent defects with interaction it can be noted that the effective depth of axial projection d n m a x i keeps constant for same type of adjacent defects ca21 ca22 ca23 ca24 or ca41 because only the change of circumferential spacing is considered in this analysis for the case of circumferentially aligned defects ca21 ca22 ca23 and ca24 the effective depth of circumferential projection d n m c i r and the volume effective depth d n m m t i are identical and the actual effective depth d n m is greater than the other three effective depths for most cases hence the existing evaluation methods over estimate the burst pressure of the pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects however for the colony of defects arranged in rhombus shape ca41 the comparison results are not consistent with those of circumferentially aligned defects ca21 ca22 ca23 and ca24 a similar variation trend between the d n m and d n m c i r can be observed for the ca41 cases and the value of d n m is slightly smaller than that of d n m c i r in the cases of ca21 ca22 ca23 and ca24 the d n m a x i is much larger than the d n m c i r and d n m m t i while an opposite situation is noted for most of the ca41 cases besides as l n m is greater than l for ca41 case according to eqs 1 and 3 the value of d n m c i r is larger than that of d n m m t i therefore the circumferentially aligned defects cases and circumferential adjacent defects cases arranged in a rhombus shape should be considered separately 5 2 correlation and error analysis of effective depth in order to get the accurate description method of effective depth it is necessary to analyze the correlation and error between the actual effective depth and different effective depth definitions the following six distinct definitions are selected for correlation analysis 1 the axial effective depth d n m a x i model of dnv rp f101 interaction 2015 2 the circumferential effective depth d n m c i r 3 the average of d n m c i r and d n m a x i d 1 2 the model of li et al 2011 method 4 the volume effective depth d n m m t i the model of mti benjamin et al 2007 5 the minimum of d n m a x i and d n m c i r d m i n 6 the maximum of d n m a x i and d n m c i r d max these six effective depth definitions include the models of effective depth for level 2b evaluation methods axial and circumferential effective depth and their extreme value which contain all the reference indexes that may affect the model of effective depth table 5 shows the comparison of correlation coefficients between different reference indexes and the actual effective depth including the cases from circumferentially aligned defects rhombic defects and all defects arrangements respectively it can be seen that the correlation coefficient obtained varies with the distribution of defects for the case of all defects arrangements the reference indexes with a correlation greater than 90 are d max and d n m a x i for the case of rhombic defects the reference indexes with a correlation greater than 90 are d n m m t i d 1 2 d max and d n m c i r for the case of circumferentially aligned defects the reference indexes with a correlation greater than 90 are d 1 2 d max and d n m a x i besides it can also be noted that the correlation between the same reference index and the actual effective depth are not consistent for different distribution modes for example the reference index d n m c i r was highly correlated with the actual effective depth of the rhombic defects however a low level correlation is observed for the case of all defects arrangements and a moderate correlation with the case of circumferentially aligned defects for another reference index d n m m t i the correlation between d n m m t i and the actual effective depth of the circumferentially aligned defects is much lower than that of rhombic defects according to the analysis in section 5 1 the change trend of the actual effective depth of the circumferentially aligned defects and rhombic defects are distinguishing resulting in the difference of the correlation for same reference index in two defect distribution modes table 6 presents the comparison of average error of burst pressure of circumferential adjacent defects predicted by different reference indexes it can be seen that the error distribution and correlation distribution of reference indexes are not consistent for the circumferential adjacent defects for example the reference index d n m m t i is highly correlated with the actual effective depth of rhombic defects 0 9027 but the error in predicting burst pressure is large 30 and for different distribution of defects the error of the same reference index is different for example the error in predicting burst pressure of rhombic defects by using reference indexes d m i n d 1 2 and d n m c i r is controlled within 10 while the error is more than 30 when they are used in predicting burst pressure of circumferentially aligned defects it is also shown that the circumferentially aligned defects and rhombic defects should be considered separately 5 3 effective depth fitting of circumferentially aligned defects the factors that affect the effective depth of circumferential adjacent defects with different distribution are different resulting in the discrepancy in the fitting results of effective depth herein the effective depth of standard circumferentially aligned defects is considered and the corresponding expression is developed by least square fitting then the effective depth expression is proved to be available for various defect distributions not just limited to the case of circumferential aligned defects according to tables 5 and 6 the reference index d n m a x i is selected as the independent variable of f d n m a x i d n m c i r in eq 4 due to its high correlation and small error with the actual effective depth 11 f d n m a x i d n m c i r d n m a x i it can be seen from figs 7 and 8 that the two main factors affecting the interaction of circumferentially aligned defects are defect length and depth the effects of the two factors are discussed in the following respectively 5 3 1 defect length a there is no interaction for extremely long corrosion defect i e l 50 d t b for circumferentially aligned defects with the same depth of single defect the circumferential limit spacing 100 mm of cases ca23 composed of long defect is less than that 144 mm of case ca21 composed of short defect moreover for the cases with the same circumferential spacing p f p f b c of ca23 is greater than that of ca21 it can be seen that with the increase of length of single defect that composes the circumferentially aligned defects the interaction between circumferential adjacent defects gradually decreases 5 3 2 defect depth for the cases composed of short defects ca21 ca22 the circumferential limit spacing 144 mm of ca21 composed of defect with d t 0 67 is larger than that 100 mm of ca22 composed of defect with d t 0 5 moreover for the adjacent defects with the same circumferential spacing p f p f b c of ca21 is smaller than that of ca22 the same trend can be found in the case composed of long defects ca23 ca24 it can be seen that with the increase of depth of single defect that composes the circumferentially aligned defects the interaction of circumferential adjacent defects increases gradually therefore k is the function of the maximum defect length and depth of composing the circumferentially aligned defects and different evolution tendencies are observed for varying defect length thus it is more proper to represent k by the form of piecewise function besides k gradually tends to unity as the interaction between adjacent defects weakens based on the analyses mentioned in the above the effective depth is obtained by using least square fitting method as follows 12 d n m k d n m a x i k 0 14 min d i t 1 max l i d t 20 0 075 min d i t 1 20 max l i d t 50 1 50 max l i d t by substituting eq 12 into eq 7 the burst pressure of corroded pipe with circumferentially aligned defects can be obtained the evaluation procedure of predicting the burst pressure in corroded pipelines is shown in fig 9 6 validation and applicability analysis of new evaluation method 6 1 validation of the new evaluation method chouchaoui and pick 1994 and benjamin et al 2005 2006a b carried out a series of burst tests on the pipelines with circumferentially aligned corrosion defects however in their experimental tests the low and high strength pipeline steels x46 and x80 are considered respectively and the shape of each defect in the circumferentially aligned defects of these specimens is identical in order to enrich the burst pressure database of corroded pipelines and verify the accuracy of the new evaluation method more fully the burst test for corroded pipelines with circumferentially aligned defects made of different defect sizes was carried out for medium strength pipeline steel x52 as shown in fig 10 burst tests on five specimens containing single defect or circumferentially aligned defects were performed the nominal diameter and wall thickness of the pipeline were 357 mm and 10 mm and the mean yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were 387 89 mpa and 578 49 mpa respectively the detailed parameter values of each specimen were tabulated in table 7 fpts0 burst pressure test specimen fpts was the basic case with a single defect the defect distributions from fpts1 to fpts4 were circumferentially aligned in fpts1 the defects were composed of identical size which was used to analyze the interaction between the same defects the width of the defects in fpts2 was different which was used to analyze the influence of defect width on the interaction of circumferentially aligned defects one of the defects in fpts3 was severe corrosion defect and the other was moderate corrosion defect representing the influence of defect depth on the defect interaction the s c of fpts4 was different from that of fpts1 which was employed to analyze the influence of circumferential spacing the defects were machined by spark erosion and chamfered table 7 also lists the actual burst pressures of fpts1 to fpts4 and it can be seen that p t p 0 0 99 for all the specimens demonstrating the presence of the interaction in the circumferentially aligned defects the comparisons of the error in predicting burst pressure via different evaluation methods are given in table 8 for the three level 2b evaluation methods the error of mti method benjamin et al 2007 regarding the volume effective depth or circumferential effective depth as effective depth is the largest with the average value and standard deviation being 20 32 and 0 146424 respectively the dnv rp f101 2015 method which adopts the axial effective depth as the effective depth is the most accurate method relative to the level 2b evaluation methods the new evaluation method developed in this study is the most reliable for various pipeline steel grades and defect dimensions by observing the average mean and standard deviation being only one third of those of the dnv rp f101 2015 method 6 2 applicability analysis of the new evaluation method although the new evaluation method is proposed based on the case of circumferentially aligned defects it shows good applicability equally for other cases of adjacent defects the arrangements of other adjacent defects i e axially aligned defects and randomly distributed defects are selected to verify the general applicability of this method the tests of pipelines with axially aligned defects were carried by chouchaoui and pick 1996 and benjamin 2005 2006a b respectively moreover benjamin 2016a also studied the burst pressure of pipelines with randomly distributed defects with different defect sizes the comparison of error of different evaluation methods is shown in table 9 it can be noted that the average value and standard deviation of error in predicting burst pressure of axially aligned defects by the new evaluation method are the smallest in comparison with other methods for randomly distributed defects the error of the new method is larger than that of dnv rp f101 2015 and mti method benjamin et al 2007 while the difference is not significant in comparison with dnv rp f101 2015 method the average error of the new evaluation method is only increased by 2 85 in predicting the burst pressure of randomly distributed defects therefore the validity of the new evaluation method in predicting the burst pressure of circumferentially aligned defects is greatly improved and the accuracy for other defect distribution modes remains almost flat or slightly degraded in general the new evaluation method is more reliable and accurate in predicting the burst pressure of corroded pipelines by comparing with other methods the application ranges of the new evaluation method denoted by eqs 7 and 12 are summarized in the following the new evaluation method is available for the case of thin walled pipeline with d t 20 which is commonly used in the oil or gas transportation the parametric study employed herein includes all possible defect lengths i e short corrosion defect long corrosion defect and extremely long corrosion defect therefore the evaluation method is suitable for all defect length as d i t 90 the effective depth of adjacent defects d nm is greater than the pipe wall thickness t based on eq 12 inducing a negative failure pressure therefore the applicable range of the evaluation method for defect depth is 0 d i t 90 however for the corroded pipeline the pipeline will be replaced as the corrosion depth is greater than 80 of the pipe wall thickness hence it does not affect the application of the evaluation method in the failure pressure prediction of corroded pipeline 7 conclusions an improved evaluation method of predicting the burst pressure of corroded pipeline is proposed in this study the following conclusions can be made 1 for the circumferentially aligned defect the effective depths given by all existing evaluation methods are not greater than the maximum depth of singe defect resulting in overestimating the bearing capacity of the pipeline with interacting defects which is extremely dangerous for structural safety assessment 2 the interaction between circumferentially aligned defects mainly depends on the defect length depth and circumferential spacing the interaction between adjacent defects is weakened with the increase of defect length and circumferential spacing or the decrease of defect depth 3 the accuracy of the new evaluation method in predicting the burst pressure of pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects is greatly improved by comparing with other methods and for defects with other distribution modes such as axially aligned defects and randomly distributed defects the accuracy remains almost flat or slightly degraded therefore the proposed evaluation method is more reliable and suitable for the evaluation of burst pressure of corroded pipelines especially the case of adjacent defects with

21069,burst pressure prediction of pipelines with interacting defects is essential in the integrity assessment of steel pipelines a series of evaluation criteria have been proposed to predict the burst pressure however the burst pressure is not accurately estimated by the existing evaluation methods for some defect distribution cases especially for circumferentially aligned defects in this study a new evaluation method of burst pressure is established by developing a reliable calculation expression of the effective defect depth a burst pressure study is performed by considering the effects of the defect distribution defect size and circumferential spacing between two adjacent defects based on finite element analysis then the detailed expression of effective depth of circumferentially aligned defects with different sizes is obtained full scale burst tests for corroded pipelines are conducted to validate the accuracy of the new evaluation method the predictions of burst capacity by the new method used for the pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects are in good agreement with experimental results for varying defect sizes and pipeline steel grades finally the proposed evaluation method is verified equally applicable to various defect distribution modes keywords pipeline circumferentially aligned defects effective depth evaluation method burst pressure

attack which poses tremendous challenge to the pipeline strength since it results in a reduction in the pipe wall thickness the corrosion defects on the surface of the pipeline can exist independently or intensively each corrosion defect introduces disturbances in the pipeline stress and strain fields that spread out beyond the border of the defect when the areas of influence of adjacent defects are overlapping the defects are called interacting defects the failure behavior of interacting defects is much more complex than that of isolated defects the interaction between adjacent defects has a significant influence on the failure mode and loading capacity of corroded pipelines li et al 2016 mondal and dhar 2017 sun and cheng 2018 resulting in the decrease of internal pressure bearing capacity which is usually lower than the burst pressure induced by isolated defects benjamin et al 2005 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the integrity of the corroded pipeline by taking into account the interaction effect of adjacent defects the interaction mechanism between adjacent defects is complex which is affected by the location size and spacing of defects li et al 2016 mondal and dhar 2017 and chen et al 2015 studied the limit spacing of adjacent defects with different arrangements and sizes and proposed the judgment method of interaction defects sun and cheng 2019a 2019b and chouchaoui and pick 1994 1996 analyzed the failure modes of circumferentially aligned defects and axially aligned defects respectively and their results showed that the failure modes of adjacent defects with different arrangements are different the finite element fe method is widely used in the burst pressure analysis of adjacent defects de andrade et al 2006 carried out a comparison between the burst pressures predicted by the fe analysis and measured in the laboratory burst tests of pipelines containing interacting corrosion defects and the applicability of the fe method was verified a case study on the failure behavior of four colonies of corrosion defects using solid fe models was conducted by benjamin et al 2006a b and the difference in the failure modes of adjacent defects with different spacing was illustrated chen et al 2015 investigated the failure behavior and burst pressure of x80 pipelines with interacting corrosion defects based on nonlinear fe method and then an assessment procedure for predicting the burst pressure was developed elder soares et al 2019 studied the integrity of pipelines with interacting corrosion defects under combined internal pressure and thermal loads using the fe modelling a large number of burst tests for adjacent defects under internal pressure have been carried out by petrobras including adjacent defects composed of identical sizes benjamin et al 2005 2006a b and different sizes benjamin et al 2016a 2016b which provided the database of tests for the study of burst pressure of corroded pipelines in the past few decades considerable research has been conducted on the failure assessment methods of corroded pipelines and several codes have been established for evaluating the residual strength for interacting corrosion defects the level 2b method presents a relatively reliable burst pressure prediction benjamin et al 2005 2006a b 2007 benjamin and cunha 2007 li et al 2011 2012 which include the dnv rp f101 2015 method and the mixed type of interaction method mti benjamin et al 2007 considering the effects of defect length width and depth on burst pressure li et al 2011 proposed a new level 2b method to predict the burst pressure of pipeline with interacting defects in general level 2b evaluation methods for interacting defects are to transform the interaction defects into equivalent single corrosion defect and take the length of full wall thickness pipe that separates longitudinally spaced defects as the length of the equivalent single defect the main difference between the level 2b evaluation methods is the calculation approach of effective depth the arrangement and distribution of defects are bound to affect the evaluation result of level 2b hence it is necessary to classify the colony of corrosion defects in the beginning of the nineties kiefner and vieth 1990a defined three basic types of interaction of corrosion defects three types of interacting defects are shown in fig 1 the type 1 interacting defects are separated circumferentially while their individual profile overlaps when projected onto the longitudinal plane through the wall thickness the type 2 interacting defects are longitudinally aligned and their individual profiles are separated by a length of full wall thickness pipe the type 3 interacting defects represents the colony of irregular shaped corrosion defects composed of shallow and deep defects the research results indicated that the failure modes of interacting defects with different types were distinguishing chouchaoui and pick 1994 1996 sun and cheng 2019a 2019b circumferentially aligned defects are a special defect arrangement of type 1 interacting defects for this type of defect arrangement the projection of adjacent defects onto the longitudinal plane of the pipe are completely overlapped due to the same length of each defect therefore the changes of the number and circumferential spacing of adjacent defects do not affect the effective length causing the burst pressure of pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects not being accurately evaluated by the existing level 2b evaluation methods in this study the characteristics and effective depth of the circumferentially aligned defects are investigated and a more accurate burst pressure evaluation method is developed further study shows that the proposed evaluation method can also predict a satisfactory result for various types of defect arrangement the paper is organized as follows section 2 summarizes the differences of existing evaluation methods for pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects section 3 proposes a new effective depth expression and calculation method of failure pressure the numerical analysis of corroded pipeline is carried out in section 4 based on the fe modelling in section 5 the detailed effective depth expression of circumferentially aligned defects is determined according to the fe analysis section 6 outlines the validation and applicability analysis of the new failure pressure assessment method section 7 summarizes the conclusion of the study 2 comparison of evaluation methods for circumferentially aligned defects for interacting defects defect n to defect m as shown in fig 2 the effective depth of axial projection d n m a x i and circumferential projection d n m c i r are defined as follow respectively 1 d n m a x i s a p l n m d n m c i r s c p w n m 2 l n m l m i n i m 1 l i s l i w n m w m i n i m 1 w i s c i where s a p and s c p are the area of axial and circumferential projection respectively l n m and w n m are the effective length and effective width l i and w i are the length and width of each defect respectively s l i and s c i are the longitudinal and circumferential spacing respectively in the case of overlapping defects s l i and s c i are negative the differences among the three commonly used level 2b evaluation methods i e dnv rp f101 2015 method mixed type of interaction method mti benjamin et al 2007 and the evaluation method proposed by li et al 2011 are tabulated in table 1 for the circumferentially aligned defects the axial length l i of each defect is identical the axial projection range of each defect is consistent and s li l i thus l n m l m i n i m 1 l i s l i i n i m 1 s l i i n i m l i l i i n m in addition the axial projection of each defect coincides with that of the deepest defect and d n m a x i s a p l n m max d i l i l i max d i i n m the effective defect depths of the three level 2b evaluation methods are given respectively as 3 d n m d n v s a p l n m d n m a x i max d i i n m d n m m t i i n i m d i l i w i l n m w n m i n i m d i w i w n m d n m c i r d n m l i 1 2 d n m c i r d n m a x i 1 2 d n m c i r max d i i n m based on the characteristic of circumferentially aligned defects as the number of defect increases the effective length l n m remains unchanged and the effective width w n m increases however the influence of w n m on the burst pressure is generally not significant leis and stephens 1997 which is neglected by most of the codes therefore the effective depth d n m is the key factor for burst pressure evaluation of circumferentially aligned defects for the circumferentially aligned defects d n m a x i max d i i n m d n m c i r thus d n m m t i d n m c i r max d i d n m l i 1 2 d n m c i r max d i max d i d n m d n v max d i it is noted that the effective depths of all evaluation methods are not greater than the maximum depth of adjacent defects resulting in the evaluation result of the burst pressure being not less than the corresponding result for an isolated defect with the maximum depth in other words the existing three evaluation methods overestimate the bearing capacity of the pipeline with interacting corrosion defects by ignoring the interaction between adjacent defects which is extremely dangerous for structural safety assessment 3 proposal of a new effective depth expression based on eq 3 it can be seen that the effective depth of circumferentially aligned defects can be denoted by one or combination of axial effective depth d n m a x i and circumferential effective depth d n m c i r due to d n m m t i d n m c i r therefore in this study d n m a x i and d n m c i r are chosen as the independent variables in the new expression of effective depth d nm as 4 d n m k f d n m a x i d n m c i r b where f d n m a x i d n m c i r is a function with independent variables d n m a x i and d n m c i r k is the coefficient that characterizes the interaction between adjacent defects b is a constant term and in view of d n m a x i d n m c i r 0 d nm 0 thus the constant term b should be zero for the interaction between adjacent defects it is mainly affected by the spacing and size of defects li et al 2016 f d n m a x i d n m c i r represents the effect of spacing on the effective depth and the effect of defect size on the interaction between adjacent defects is determined by the parameter k therefore k is a dimensionless function of the maximum length width and minimum depth of the single defect in adjacent defects and its expression is given as 5 k g min d i t max l i d t max w i π d where g min d i t max l i d t max w i π d is a function with independent variables min d i max l i and max w i t and d are wall thickness and outer diameter of the pipe respectively it can be seen from eqs 4 and 5 that the effective depth of circumferentially aligned defects can be expressed as follows 6 d n m g min d i t max l i d t max w i π d f d n m a x i d n m c i r the true value of the effective depth needs to be determined in order to obtain the detailed expression forms of the two functions in eq 6 herein the evaluation method of dnv rp f101 2015 is adopted to ensure the burst pressure of the equivalent defect and then calculate the d nm as follows 7 p f 2 t σ u d t 1 d n m t 1 d n m t q n m p 0 1 d n m t 1 d n m t q n m 8 d n m p 0 p f p 0 t p f t q n m 9 q n m 1 0 31 l n m d t 2 where p f is the burst pressure of circumferentially aligned defects σ u is the engineering tensile strength p 0 is the burst pressure of defect free pipeline q n m is the length correction factor of equivalent defect it can be noted that the d n m can be obtained from eq 8 as long as the p f is known hence the fe analysis is used to determine the p f values for the pipeline with adjacent defects in different sizes and arrangements 4 numerical analysis of corroded pipeline 4 1 numerical modelling procedures to investigate the effect of circumferential spacing of colonies of defects on burst pressure the fe model of steel pipeline with a pair of circumferential corrosion defects were established which were developed based on the general purpose fe software program ansys the failure behavior and limit strength of corroded pipelines are analyzed by using the fe method as p f p 0 is a dimensionless parameter independent of the steel grade su et al 2016 sun et al 2020 it can be seen from eq 8 that the d n m is also independent of the steel grade therefore the steel pipeline made of api 5l x80 benjamin et al 2005 2006a b is selected in this study and its true stress strain curve can be approximated by the ramberg osgood model benjamin et al 2006a b de andrade et al 2006 as follows 10 ε t r u e σ t r u e e 0 0788174 σ t r u e σ u t r u e 12 642026 where ε true and σ ture are the true strain and stress respectively σ u ture denotes the true ultimate tensile strength and σ u ture 718 2 mpa e is the young s modulus with the value being 200 gpa the true stress strain curve in eq 10 is plotted in the following see fig 3 the outside diameter d and wall thickness t of the pipeline are 458 8 mm and 8 1 mm respectively the fe models are established using hexahedron solid element with 20 nodes solid45 due to symmetry only one quarter of the specimen is modeled as shown in fig 4 the defect is chamfered to minimize the effect of stress concentration the shape of the area of metal loss is postulated as rectangular with smooth edges the edge is chamfered made with a small radius of 3 5 mm the defect is divided into four layers along the thickness direction and the number of elements for the part away from the corroded region is reduced to one element through thickness the minimum thickness of the element is 0 6 mm and the maximum thickness is 8 1 mm a mesh convergence study is carried out to confirm that the mesh of fe model is sufficiently fine fine mesh is applied within and around the corroded area where stress concentration is expected coarser mesh is applied where uniform stress is expected an appropriate gradient between coarse and fine mesh is also considered the circumferential and axial dimensions of the elements in the defect part are about 2 67 mm and 2 80 mm respectively a typical finite element mesh used in this study is shown in fig 4 a and b in the present fe analysis the internal pressure is incrementally applied to the internal surface of the pipeline model and the axial force due to the end cap effect induced by the internal pressure is simultaneously applied to the pipe wall at the cut off boundary of the model due to the symmetry of this issue symmetric displacement boundary conditions are employed in the x y plane and x z plane the end of the pipe is only allowed to move in the z direction all the boundary conditions are illustrated in the fig 4 c the full newton raphson approach is used to solve the set of nonlinear equilibrium equations the failure criterion known as ligament stress criterion batte et al 1997 is adopted to determine the burst pressure of the corroded pipe where the failure is attained when the minimum von mises stress in the ligament exceeds the true ultimate tensile strength of the material benjamin et al 2006a b de andrade et al 2006 this criterion has been employed in the nonlinear fe analysis of corroded tubular specimens made of api 5l x80 steel benjamin et al 2006a b de andrade et al 2006 and the satisfactory results obtained verified the validity of the ligament stress criterion in the failure prediction 4 2 validation of fe model before the fe model is employed for failure analysis it is necessary to confirm the accuracy of the proposed model a series of full scale burst tests of api 5l x80 pipelines subject to internal pressure were performed by benjamin et al 2005 2006a b among these tests the specimens labeled as idts 2 interactive defect tubular specimen single defect idts 4 two defects aligned circumferentially and idts 6 two longitudinally aligned defects and two circumferentially aligned defects arranged in a rhombus shape were selected to validate the fe model the comparison of local failure behaviors is presented in fig 5 it can be seen that the failure position predicted by fe analysis is very similar to the actual one in the laboratory test table 2 tabulates quantitative comparisons in the burst pressure of the tubular pipe where p fem and p t are the burst pressures predicted by the fe analysis and laboratory test respectively the average error between these two sets of values is approximately 2 0 further demonstrating the accuracy of the fe model 4 3 description of the parametric study based on asme b31g 1984 criterion and modified b31g criterion kiefner and vieth 1990a 1990b the defects with defect length range of l d t 20 20 l d t 50 and l d t 50 are defined as short corrosion defect long corrosion defect and extremely long corrosion defect respectively table 3 presents the geometric characteristics of the basic cases and colony cases with circumferentially aligned defects the basic cases are pipe segments containing only one defect basic 1c and 2c are short corrosion defects basic 3c and 4c are long corrosion defects basic 5c is extremely long corrosion defect colony 1c to colony 5c are adjacent defects composed of two basic 1c to basic 5c defects respectively colony 6c are composed of four basic 1c defects arranged in a rhombus shape fig 6 show sketches which represent the top views of the colony 1c to 6c in these sketches the defects are drawn on the pipe external surface represented as a flat surface colony 6c is a kind of special circumferential aligned defects in which the two longitudinally aligned defects remain unchanged only the circumferential spacing s c changes in the different calculation cases in this analysis the values of d t are set to 0 3 0 5 and 0 67 which represent shallow corrosion defect moderate corrosion defect and severe corrosion defect respectively defect widths of 31 9 mm and 72 1 mm are adopted herein to study the effect of defect width on the burst pressure 4 4 fe analysis results the burst pressures p f b c of the five basic cases were listed in table 4 appendix a presents the burst pressures of the colony 1c to colony 5c and the corresponding burst pressure ratio p f p f b c the level of interaction between the adjacent defects in colony 1c to 6c can be detected by p f p f b c and it is assumed that there is no interaction when the p f p f b c is equal to or greater than 0 99 the smaller the ratio the more significant the interaction effect on burst pressure of pipelines is appendix a presents the burst pressures of the pipeline with colonies of circumferentially aligned defects it can be seen that the level of interaction between adjacent defects is mainly related to the circumferential spacing defect depth and length it is noted from fig 7 that the level of interaction gradually reduces with the increasing circumferential spacing for adjacent defects with the same defect length and circumferential spacing fig 7 a the level of interaction diminishes as the defect depth decreases taking the cases of ca2143 and ca2243 1 1 the definition of the nomenclature ca is shown in the note of appendix a as examples the ratio p f p f b c increases from 0 886 to 0 927 as the defect depth decreases from 5 39 mm to 4 05 mm the same result can be observed by comparing the burst pressures of other cases of colony 1c and colony 2c and cases of colony 3c and colony 4c 1 the defect length shows different results by comparing with the case of defect depth the level of interaction of adjacent defects with the same defect depth and circumferential spacing diminishes as the length of the defects increases fig 7 b for ca2128 and ca2328 the ratio p f p f b c increases from 0 875 to 0 889 with the defect length increasing from 39 6 mm to 272 63 mm the similar variation trend can also be obtained in the comparison of other cases of colony 1c and colony 3c and cases of colony 3c and colony 5c 5 determination of effective depth of circumferentially aligned defects 5 1 comparison of different effective depths herein the circumferentially adjacent defects cases with interaction are considered and the cases without interaction are removed as listed in appendix b the three basic effective depths i e d n m m t i d n m c i r and d n m a x i are calculated and listed in appendix b the actual effective depth d n m is determined by using eq 2 and eqs 7 9 fig 8 illustrates the comparison of different effective depths of circumferentially adjacent defects with interaction it can be noted that the effective depth of axial projection d n m a x i keeps constant for same type of adjacent defects ca21 ca22 ca23 ca24 or ca41 because only the change of circumferential spacing is considered in this analysis for the case of circumferentially aligned defects ca21 ca22 ca23 and ca24 the effective depth of circumferential projection d n m c i r and the volume effective depth d n m m t i are identical and the actual effective depth d n m is greater than the other three effective depths for most cases hence the existing evaluation methods over estimate the burst pressure of the pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects however for the colony of defects arranged in rhombus shape ca41 the comparison results are not consistent with those of circumferentially aligned defects ca21 ca22 ca23 and ca24 a similar variation trend between the d n m and d n m c i r can be observed for the ca41 cases and the value of d n m is slightly smaller than that of d n m c i r in the cases of ca21 ca22 ca23 and ca24 the d n m a x i is much larger than the d n m c i r and d n m m t i while an opposite situation is noted for most of the ca41 cases besides as l n m is greater than l for ca41 case according to eqs 1 and 3 the value of d n m c i r is larger than that of d n m m t i therefore the circumferentially aligned defects cases and circumferential adjacent defects cases arranged in a rhombus shape should be considered separately 5 2 correlation and error analysis of effective depth in order to get the accurate description method of effective depth it is necessary to analyze the correlation and error between the actual effective depth and different effective depth definitions the following six distinct definitions are selected for correlation analysis 1 the axial effective depth d n m a x i model of dnv rp f101 interaction 2015 2 the circumferential effective depth d n m c i r 3 the average of d n m c i r and d n m a x i d 1 2 the model of li et al 2011 method 4 the volume effective depth d n m m t i the model of mti benjamin et al 2007 5 the minimum of d n m a x i and d n m c i r d m i n 6 the maximum of d n m a x i and d n m c i r d max these six effective depth definitions include the models of effective depth for level 2b evaluation methods axial and circumferential effective depth and their extreme value which contain all the reference indexes that may affect the model of effective depth table 5 shows the comparison of correlation coefficients between different reference indexes and the actual effective depth including the cases from circumferentially aligned defects rhombic defects and all defects arrangements respectively it can be seen that the correlation coefficient obtained varies with the distribution of defects for the case of all defects arrangements the reference indexes with a correlation greater than 90 are d max and d n m a x i for the case of rhombic defects the reference indexes with a correlation greater than 90 are d n m m t i d 1 2 d max and d n m c i r for the case of circumferentially aligned defects the reference indexes with a correlation greater than 90 are d 1 2 d max and d n m a x i besides it can also be noted that the correlation between the same reference index and the actual effective depth are not consistent for different distribution modes for example the reference index d n m c i r was highly correlated with the actual effective depth of the rhombic defects however a low level correlation is observed for the case of all defects arrangements and a moderate correlation with the case of circumferentially aligned defects for another reference index d n m m t i the correlation between d n m m t i and the actual effective depth of the circumferentially aligned defects is much lower than that of rhombic defects according to the analysis in section 5 1 the change trend of the actual effective depth of the circumferentially aligned defects and rhombic defects are distinguishing resulting in the difference of the correlation for same reference index in two defect distribution modes table 6 presents the comparison of average error of burst pressure of circumferential adjacent defects predicted by different reference indexes it can be seen that the error distribution and correlation distribution of reference indexes are not consistent for the circumferential adjacent defects for example the reference index d n m m t i is highly correlated with the actual effective depth of rhombic defects 0 9027 but the error in predicting burst pressure is large 30 and for different distribution of defects the error of the same reference index is different for example the error in predicting burst pressure of rhombic defects by using reference indexes d m i n d 1 2 and d n m c i r is controlled within 10 while the error is more than 30 when they are used in predicting burst pressure of circumferentially aligned defects it is also shown that the circumferentially aligned defects and rhombic defects should be considered separately 5 3 effective depth fitting of circumferentially aligned defects the factors that affect the effective depth of circumferential adjacent defects with different distribution are different resulting in the discrepancy in the fitting results of effective depth herein the effective depth of standard circumferentially aligned defects is considered and the corresponding expression is developed by least square fitting then the effective depth expression is proved to be available for various defect distributions not just limited to the case of circumferential aligned defects according to tables 5 and 6 the reference index d n m a x i is selected as the independent variable of f d n m a x i d n m c i r in eq 4 due to its high correlation and small error with the actual effective depth 11 f d n m a x i d n m c i r d n m a x i it can be seen from figs 7 and 8 that the two main factors affecting the interaction of circumferentially aligned defects are defect length and depth the effects of the two factors are discussed in the following respectively 5 3 1 defect length a there is no interaction for extremely long corrosion defect i e l 50 d t b for circumferentially aligned defects with the same depth of single defect the circumferential limit spacing 100 mm of cases ca23 composed of long defect is less than that 144 mm of case ca21 composed of short defect moreover for the cases with the same circumferential spacing p f p f b c of ca23 is greater than that of ca21 it can be seen that with the increase of length of single defect that composes the circumferentially aligned defects the interaction between circumferential adjacent defects gradually decreases 5 3 2 defect depth for the cases composed of short defects ca21 ca22 the circumferential limit spacing 144 mm of ca21 composed of defect with d t 0 67 is larger than that 100 mm of ca22 composed of defect with d t 0 5 moreover for the adjacent defects with the same circumferential spacing p f p f b c of ca21 is smaller than that of ca22 the same trend can be found in the case composed of long defects ca23 ca24 it can be seen that with the increase of depth of single defect that composes the circumferentially aligned defects the interaction of circumferential adjacent defects increases gradually therefore k is the function of the maximum defect length and depth of composing the circumferentially aligned defects and different evolution tendencies are observed for varying defect length thus it is more proper to represent k by the form of piecewise function besides k gradually tends to unity as the interaction between adjacent defects weakens based on the analyses mentioned in the above the effective depth is obtained by using least square fitting method as follows 12 d n m k d n m a x i k 0 14 min d i t 1 max l i d t 20 0 075 min d i t 1 20 max l i d t 50 1 50 max l i d t by substituting eq 12 into eq 7 the burst pressure of corroded pipe with circumferentially aligned defects can be obtained the evaluation procedure of predicting the burst pressure in corroded pipelines is shown in fig 9 6 validation and applicability analysis of new evaluation method 6 1 validation of the new evaluation method chouchaoui and pick 1994 and benjamin et al 2005 2006a b carried out a series of burst tests on the pipelines with circumferentially aligned corrosion defects however in their experimental tests the low and high strength pipeline steels x46 and x80 are considered respectively and the shape of each defect in the circumferentially aligned defects of these specimens is identical in order to enrich the burst pressure database of corroded pipelines and verify the accuracy of the new evaluation method more fully the burst test for corroded pipelines with circumferentially aligned defects made of different defect sizes was carried out for medium strength pipeline steel x52 as shown in fig 10 burst tests on five specimens containing single defect or circumferentially aligned defects were performed the nominal diameter and wall thickness of the pipeline were 357 mm and 10 mm and the mean yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were 387 89 mpa and 578 49 mpa respectively the detailed parameter values of each specimen were tabulated in table 7 fpts0 burst pressure test specimen fpts was the basic case with a single defect the defect distributions from fpts1 to fpts4 were circumferentially aligned in fpts1 the defects were composed of identical size which was used to analyze the interaction between the same defects the width of the defects in fpts2 was different which was used to analyze the influence of defect width on the interaction of circumferentially aligned defects one of the defects in fpts3 was severe corrosion defect and the other was moderate corrosion defect representing the influence of defect depth on the defect interaction the s c of fpts4 was different from that of fpts1 which was employed to analyze the influence of circumferential spacing the defects were machined by spark erosion and chamfered table 7 also lists the actual burst pressures of fpts1 to fpts4 and it can be seen that p t p 0 0 99 for all the specimens demonstrating the presence of the interaction in the circumferentially aligned defects the comparisons of the error in predicting burst pressure via different evaluation methods are given in table 8 for the three level 2b evaluation methods the error of mti method benjamin et al 2007 regarding the volume effective depth or circumferential effective depth as effective depth is the largest with the average value and standard deviation being 20 32 and 0 146424 respectively the dnv rp f101 2015 method which adopts the axial effective depth as the effective depth is the most accurate method relative to the level 2b evaluation methods the new evaluation method developed in this study is the most reliable for various pipeline steel grades and defect dimensions by observing the average mean and standard deviation being only one third of those of the dnv rp f101 2015 method 6 2 applicability analysis of the new evaluation method although the new evaluation method is proposed based on the case of circumferentially aligned defects it shows good applicability equally for other cases of adjacent defects the arrangements of other adjacent defects i e axially aligned defects and randomly distributed defects are selected to verify the general applicability of this method the tests of pipelines with axially aligned defects were carried by chouchaoui and pick 1996 and benjamin 2005 2006a b respectively moreover benjamin 2016a also studied the burst pressure of pipelines with randomly distributed defects with different defect sizes the comparison of error of different evaluation methods is shown in table 9 it can be noted that the average value and standard deviation of error in predicting burst pressure of axially aligned defects by the new evaluation method are the smallest in comparison with other methods for randomly distributed defects the error of the new method is larger than that of dnv rp f101 2015 and mti method benjamin et al 2007 while the difference is not significant in comparison with dnv rp f101 2015 method the average error of the new evaluation method is only increased by 2 85 in predicting the burst pressure of randomly distributed defects therefore the validity of the new evaluation method in predicting the burst pressure of circumferentially aligned defects is greatly improved and the accuracy for other defect distribution modes remains almost flat or slightly degraded in general the new evaluation method is more reliable and accurate in predicting the burst pressure of corroded pipelines by comparing with other methods the application ranges of the new evaluation method denoted by eqs 7 and 12 are summarized in the following the new evaluation method is available for the case of thin walled pipeline with d t 20 which is commonly used in the oil or gas transportation the parametric study employed herein includes all possible defect lengths i e short corrosion defect long corrosion defect and extremely long corrosion defect therefore the evaluation method is suitable for all defect length as d i t 90 the effective depth of adjacent defects d nm is greater than the pipe wall thickness t based on eq 12 inducing a negative failure pressure therefore the applicable range of the evaluation method for defect depth is 0 d i t 90 however for the corroded pipeline the pipeline will be replaced as the corrosion depth is greater than 80 of the pipe wall thickness hence it does not affect the application of the evaluation method in the failure pressure prediction of corroded pipeline 7 conclusions an improved evaluation method of predicting the burst pressure of corroded pipeline is proposed in this study the following conclusions can be made 1 for the circumferentially aligned defect the effective depths given by all existing evaluation methods are not greater than the maximum depth of singe defect resulting in overestimating the bearing capacity of the pipeline with interacting defects which is extremely dangerous for structural safety assessment 2 the interaction between circumferentially aligned defects mainly depends on the defect length depth and circumferential spacing the interaction between adjacent defects is weakened with the increase of defect length and circumferential spacing or the decrease of defect depth 3 the accuracy of the new evaluation method in predicting the burst pressure of pipeline with circumferentially aligned defects is greatly improved by comparing with other methods and for defects with other distribution modes such as axially aligned defects and randomly distributed defects the accuracy remains almost flat or slightly degraded therefore the proposed evaluation method is more reliable and suitable for the evaluation of burst pressure of corroded pipelines especially the case of adjacent defects with
