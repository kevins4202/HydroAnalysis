major source of greenhouse gas emissions with 5 20 of co2 and 80 90 of n2o emissions in the atmosphere arising from agriculture in china luo et al 2017 the north china plain ncp occupies an agricultural area of approximately 300 000 km2 accounting for 23 of the total cropland area in china ding et al 2007 the winter wheat summer maize rotation is the most popular double cropping system in this area and it produces 20 9 of wheat and 35 6 of maize yields in china nbsprc 2016 in the north china plain maintaining and increasing crop productivity requires substantial irrigation 90 690 mm

consequently excessive fertilizer stimulates co2 and n2o emissions ding et al 2007 li et al 2018 recycling biogas slurry bgs a source of both nutrient and irrigation water could replace some of applied fertilizer while maintaining food productivity by returning nutrients and water to the soil for plant growth the reuse of slurry from manures is a cost effective method that provides essential nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for plant growth kotzerke et al 2008 during fermentation the nh4 content of the biogas slurry increases while the c n ratio and odor decrease in comparison to animal manures used as sources of organic material terhoeven urselmans et al 2009 consequently higher plant yields have been observed in some cases after biogas slurry application due to the high content of nh4 content of biogas slurry möller et al 2008 however excessive application of this slurry may lead to water pollution via runoff and leaching and to gaseous emissions of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide zhao et al 2006 abubaker et al 2015 heintze et al 2017 however the environmental impacts of bgs irrigation are poorly understood previous studies mostly focused on the influence of synthetic fertilizer use on emissions of co2 and n2o from agricultural soils few studies have addressed the impacts of bgs irrigation on co2 and n2o emissions from wheat maize rotations additionally current research mostly focused on the effect of bgs use on crop growth and water use efficiency bhattarai et al 2006 chen et al 2011 niu et al 2013 only a few studies have addressed the

et al 2011b the chamber 30 20 20 cm was inserted 5 cm into the soil and was located at the same position for every measurement during the entire wheat maize growing season the gas samples were collected in a syringe at 10 min intervals 0 10 20 and 30 min after the chambers were closed co2 and n2o flux measurements were conducted from 9 00 11 00 from december 3rd 2014 to september 21st 2016 the gaseous emissions were measured after 1 3 7 days of bgs irrigation and then continuous sampling once or twice per week during the crop growing seasons the co2 and n2o concentrations were simultaneously analyzed with a gas chromatograph thermo trace 1300 usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and an electron capture detector ecd the carrier gases were a mixture of 95 argon and 5 methane the temperatures of injector detector and the packed column were mainly at 100 c 300 c and 65 c respectively the co2 and n2o fluxes were determined from each plot using the following closed chamber equation rolston 1986 1 f ρ v a δc δt 273 273 t where f indicates the co2 kg ha 1 d 1 flux and n2o flux g ha 1 d 1 ρ is the gas density under a standardized state kg m 3 v is

treatment year and growing stage and six continuous variables time days after treatment nh4 n no3 n doc air temperature and wfps as independent variables in addition another continuous variable namely time was incorporated into the correlation structure of the model which is 0 for the previous day of the treatment 1 for one day after treatment 2 for the other day of treatment another variable time was derived from this variable by keeping all the 0 s 1 s and 2 s and changing all the other values to 2 which was treated as a categorical independent variable and was included in the model there were five growing stages in total including wintering w jointing j heading h and filling f for wheat and summer s for corn there were five categories for treatment namely ck cf bsl bsm and bsh linear models were built with corar1 correlation structure using the function gls function in r package nlme pinheiro et al 2017 for the time the air temperature and wfps included both linear and quadratic

maize growing periods fig 2 a during the wheat growing period from october to june of the following year the co2 flux increased from march to may and then decreased until the wheat harvest except on several days during cycle 2 2015 2016 fig 2a during the maize growing period from june to late september the co2 fluxes evidently increased from july to august overall the cumulative co2 fluxes in the cf treatment were higher than the treatments with low and medium bgs irrigation rate but lower than the treatment with a high bgs irrigation rate despite the differences in co2 emissions between the bgs treatments and fertilizer treatment cf the differences were not statistically significant table 2 for all the treatments the n2o emission fluxes showed evident inter annual and seasonal variations fig 2b the n2o was significantly higher in 2016 than in 2015 fig 4g p 0 01 the highest n2o fluxes occurred in the summer 6 61 5 25 5 45 and 6 34 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in 2015 versus 8 24 10 95 12 59 and 13 54 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in 2016 under cf bsl bsm bsh treatments in addition the extremely high n2o emissions persisted for only one day and then decreased gradually negative n2o fluxes 3 01 0 77 were occasionally observed during december of 2015 the n2o fluxes also differed significantly across growing stages fig 4f p 0 05 the n2o levels at the wheat jointing stage and in summer maize were higher than they were in the other stages the bgs irrigation increased the n2o emissions dramatically and the n2o in the bgs treatments was significantly higher than that of the ck table 2 however there was no significant difference among these bgs treatments table 2 3 2 soil properties and temperatures the soil properties also showed seasonal variations especially for soil doc fig 3 the soil nh4 n tended to increase after the first bgs irrigation early december and it is the major form of soil n during this period fig 3 a the soil no3 n tended to increase in july in 2015 after the later three bgs irrigation times fig 3 b more variations in the soil no3 n occurred in 2016 than in 2015 especially for the cf t2 and t3 fig 3 a overall the soil nh4 n levels in the bgs treatments were higher than they were in the cf treatment table 2 however the difference between the cf bsl and bsm treatments was not statistically significant by contrast the soil nh4 n in the bsh treatment was significantly higher than it was in the fertilizer treatment and in the other bgs treatments the soil no3 n in the cf treatment was significantly greater than that it was in low bgs irrigation treatments but not significantly greater than in high bgs irrigation treatments in the statistics table 2 the soil doc content also changed seasonally with evident variations occurring in 2016 a significantly higher soil doc content occurred in the bgs treatments compared with the fertilizer treatment table 2 in addition the soil doc content was positively correlated with the bgs irrigation content the variations in soil moisture were strongly influenced by precipitation and irrigation the precipitation during the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were 367 and 408 mm respectively the annual mean air temperature were 12 9 and 12 7 c in the 2015 and 2016 wheat maize rotation years respectively the air temperature during the 2015 and 2016 wheat seasons were 11 53 and 11 91 c respectively whereas corresponding values during the maize season were 25 39 and 24 75 c respectively 3 3 responses of co2 and n2o to independent variables for n2o except the air temperature all the other variables were significant p 0 05 the n2o increased with nh4 n no3 n air temperature wfps and doc fig 4 the treatment was significant p 0 05 the n2o in ck was significantly lower than it was in the other treatments there was no significant difference between the other treatments the growing stage was also significant p 0 05 the n2o in j and s were higher than they were in the other stages the n2o was significantly higher in 2016 than in 2015 p 0 01 the time was also significant p 0 01 the n2o on the day of treatment was higher than it was on the other days for co2 the wfps doc and air temperature were significant p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively the co2 decreased as wfps and air temperature increased and it increased as doc increased fig 5 a c treatment growing stage and time were also significant p 0 01 p 0 001 and p 0 001 respectively the co2 in the ck was significantly lower than it was in the cf and t3 fig 5c winter showed significantly lower co2 than the other stages fig 5d the co2 on the day of treatment was significantly higher than it was on the other days and the co2 during the previous day of treatment was significantly lower than it was on the other days fig 5e the nh4 n no3 n and year were not significant p 0 1 3 4 grain yield nue gwp and ghgi across treatments both the yields of wheat and maize in the ck treatment were slightly lower compared with the other treatments the annual yields were not significantly different among the cf and bsm and bsh treatments table 3 the fertilizer application cf and bgs irrigation treatments had no significant effects on gwp whereas bgs irrigation resulted in a 5 33 increase in ghgi compared with the conventional fertilizer treatment table 3 the nitrogen use efficiency was significantly increased by 11 31 under bsl and 15 27 under bsm compared to cf fig 6 there was no significant difference between the bsh and cf fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling co2 emissions higher annual co2 emission in the bsh compared with the bsm bsl and cf treatments were likely correlated with the higher doc concentrations resulting from the bgs added to the soil schlesinger 2000 organic matter is the primary source of co2 evolution from the soil singh et al 1999 gattinger et al 2012 and co2 was positively correlated with the soil organic carbon content because more c provides more sources and more reaction sites for microbial decomposition shah et al 2016 the addition of c to the soil for 96 increased doc content might be responsible for the higher co2 emission in the bsh compared to the bsm and bsl treatments similar results were reported in that the application of organic fertilizer might result in an increase in co2 production from the soil singh et al 1999 hui et al reported that the application of large quantities of n 600 kg n ha 1 could result in higher soil respiration previous studies found that soil respiration was controlled by the temperature and soil water content gaumont guay et al 2006 mancinelli et al 2015 ren et al 2017 for example barbera et al 2015 and maucieri et al 2014 found a positive correlation between the temperature and co2 emission and they proposed higher co2 fluxes in the summer compared with other seasons during the winter period co2 emissions were the lowest for the entire year but they were the highest during the maize season when bgs was applied to the soil the wfps increased and consequently the soil evaporation increased which then resulted in higher soil respiration mancinelli et al 2010 4 2 factors influencing n2o emissions in this study different n rates did not lead to significant differences in n2o fluxes in the cf bsl bsm and bsh treatments but they were remarkably higher compared with the ck treatment this finding indicated that the application of n and water may be considered a possible indicator of nitrification and denitrification rates ludwig et al 2001 ye et al 2018 in the present study the n2o emission flux range 3 0 to 15 3 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in cycle 1 and 0 4 13 5 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in cycle 2 was consistent with the n2o emission flux range estimated in drought stricken areas in china 0 5 14 4 g n2o n ha 1 d 1in song et al 1996 3 0 19 1 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in sun et al 2012 the negative n2o flux 3 01 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 was ascribed to the relatively low n availability and the low application rate of the easily decomposable organic c did not result in a favorable environment for denitrification cai et al 2013 the n2o emissions usually increased and reached a maximum on the third day during the wheat wintering period fig 2b which was characterized by periods of cold temperatures sanz cobena et al 2017 the increased soil temperature led to higher emissions and higher soil respiration rates which provided positive feedback for microbial metabolism thus the n2o emissions increased rapidly and they reached a maximum on the first day and then decreased gradually during the jointing heading and filling stages many studies have suggested that n fertilizer application was the most direct factor influencing soil n2o emissions which was also dependent on the soil temperature and moisture cuello et al 2015 in general the soil moisture was considered an important control parameter for the emissions of n2o which were higher both with and without n fertilization under irrigation in the wheat maize system simojoki and jaakkola 2000 sänger et al found that n2o emissions depend particularly on the wfps and rainfall at the time of fertilization during which the wfps ranged from 40 to 90 it has been demonstrated that the primary mechanism of n2o emission was nitrification at wfps levels of 30 70 but denitrification dominates at wfps levels of 70 90 chintala et al 2015 in the present study the n2o flux observed during either the wheat or maize growing season had approximately wfps levels of 30 70 indicating that the n2o emissions were primarily governed by nitrification schlesinger 2000 huang et al 2004 the higher rainfall in 2016 compared with 2015 may explain why the n2o emissions were significantly higher in 2016 than that in 2015 the temperature is the key factor influencing seasonal variations in n2o emissions rashti et al 2015 it was reported in many studies that soil temperatures above 10 c horváth et al 2010 ma et al 2010 were conductive to producing n2o emissions the most suitable temperature for n2o emissions observed in this study was 25 c the soil moisture and temperature affected the activity of nitrifiers and denitrifiers the production of substrates and the transport of the produced n2o within the soil matrix liu et al 2017 in the present study treatment induced n2o n losses ranged from 0 19 to 0 46 in 2014 2015 and from 0 22 to 0 35 in 2015 2016 which are much lower than the default value of 1 suggested by ipcc 2013 as well as other studies linquist et al 2012 liu et al 2014 similar results were also found in previous studies heintze et al 2017 htun et al 2017 4 3 cumulative ghg emissions gwp and ghgi under bgs irrigation gwp can provide a thorough understanding of the effects of agricultural practices including the effect of bgs irrigation on climate change gwp coefficients of 1 for co2 and 265 for n2o over a 100 year horizon ipcc 2014 were used to choose a reasonable fertilizer pattern the gwp of various treatments in the wheat maize system varied from 4229 kg co2 equivalent ha 1 in the unfertilized sample to 6153 52 kg co2 equivalent ha 1 with bgs irrigation during two consecutive years the increase in gwp after the bgs irrigation ranged from 5 bsl to 33 bsh in 2014 2016 increasing crop yields could efficiently decrease the ghgi cui et al 2013 based on the estimation of the wheat maize rotation there was no significant difference in the ghgi between the bsm and cf therefore using bgs irrigation as a recycled fertilizer not only increased grain yield but also reduced climatic impacts 4 4 influence of bgs irrigation on ghg emission and n use efficiency in this study the co2 emission fluxes caused by bgs were lower than reported in previous studies pan ying et al 2014 this discrepancy likely occurred because the soil doc content i e 104 mg kg 1 in this study was lower than the average value in the eastern part of china 159 mg kg 1 zhang et al 2011a this result indicated that a higher doc content would increase the co2 emissions in this study the co2 emission fluxes under bgs irrigation showed a significant positive relationship with the soil doc p 0 05 bgs may affect the biological properties and organic carbon mineralization of the soil and thus promote co2 emissions the bgs supply easily decomposes organic c that both sustains denitrification and induces anaerobiosis by stimulating biological o2 demand in addition the n2o flux showed a significant positive correlation p 0 01 with the soil nh4 n and no3 n contents likely because bgs is rich in ammonia n and nitrate n several previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of no3 to soil increased the n2o n2 ratio swerts et al 1997 soil no3 n is the substrate for denitrifying microorganisms and it directly affects the intensity of soil denitrification additionally the soil c n ratio may be indirectly related to the soil microbial activity and thereby affect the soil nitrification and denitrification processes and thus n2o emission frimpong and baggs 2010 gregorutti and caviglia 2017 the increased nue under bgs irrigation was likely due to the addition of bgs reducing n2o gas emissions and thereafter it increased the available n for plants case et al 2015 thus increasing the n uptake and utilization by plants improved the nue under bgs irrigation and reduced the cost by decreasing nutrient loss in addition the application of bgs increased the biomass accumulation water holding capacity and aggregation stability resulting in reduced n2o emission and improving the nutrient use efficiency shiratsuchi et al 2006 wei et al 2018 5 conclusion reducing environmental risks while increasing crop productivity is a huge challenge and it requires reductions in the fertilizer application rate the reuse of biogas slurry bgs could be a good option since it is not only an important source of nutrients which could replace some of the applied fertilizer but it is also a source of irrigation water in this study we investigated the n use efficiency of bgs irrigation and its environmental impacts by quantifying ghg emissions gwp and ghgi of bgs irrigation bgs irrigation can be used successfully in the wheat maize double cropping system as an alternative source of nutrients instead of fertilizer because it can increase the nue but it does not have environmental consequences in this study the bgs irrigation did not change the patterns and fluxes of co2 and n2o emission most of the bgs treatments increased the nue but did not increase the gwp and ghgi compared to conventional fertilizer treatment the results also provide important information for proper bgs reuse according to the ghgi and nutrient use efficiency results bsm is recommended as an improved recycling management practice

major source of greenhouse gas emissions with 5 20 of co2 and 80 90 of n2o emissions in the atmosphere arising from agriculture in china luo et al 2017 the north china plain ncp occupies an agricultural area of approximately 300 000 km2 accounting for 23 of the total cropland area in china ding et al 2007 the winter wheat summer maize rotation is the most popular double cropping system

consequently excessive fertilizer stimulates co2 and n2o emissions ding et al 2007 li et al 2018 recycling biogas slurry bgs a source of both nutrient and irrigation water could replace some of applied fertilizer while maintaining food productivity by returning nutrients and water to the soil for plant growth the reuse of slurry from manures is a cost effective method that provides essential nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for plant growth kotzerke et al 2008 during fermentation the nh4 content of the biogas slurry increases while the c n ratio and odor decrease in comparison to animal manures used as sources of organic material terhoeven urselmans et al 2009 consequently higher plant yields have been observed in some cases after biogas slurry application due to the high content of nh4 content of biogas slurry möller et al 2008 however excessive application of this slurry may lead to water pollution via runoff and leaching and to gaseous emissions of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide zhao et al 2006 abubaker et al 2015 heintze et al 2017 however the environmental impacts of bgs irrigation are poorly understood previous studies mostly focused on the influence of synthetic fertilizer use on emissions of co2 and n2o from agricultural soils few studies have addressed the impacts of bgs irrigation on co2 and n2o emissions from wheat maize rotations additionally current research mostly focused on the effect of bgs use on crop growth and water use efficiency bhattarai et al 2006 chen et al 2011 niu et al 2013 only a few studies have addressed the comprehensive influence of bgs on atmospheric quality soil properties and nitrogen use efficiency nue niu et al 2013 shah et al 2016 yang et al 2018 here we investigated the global warming potential gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi of bgs irrigation by quantifying the n2o and co2 emissions under different bgs irrigation rates in a two year wheat maize rotation field trial in the north china plain in addition the nue was also evaluated the primary objective of this study was to explore the impacts of bgs irrigation on ghg emissions and nue specifically three objectives are defined i to identify the critical factors influencing greenhouse gases ii to explore the nue under bgs conditions and iii to investigate the gwp and ghgi of bgs and its environmental impacts 2 materials and

et al 2011b the chamber 30 20 20 cm was inserted 5 cm into the soil and was located at the same position for every measurement during the entire wheat maize growing season the gas samples were collected in a syringe at 10 min intervals 0 10 20 and 30 min after the chambers were closed co2 and n2o flux measurements were conducted from 9 00 11 00 from december 3rd 2014 to september 21st 2016 the gaseous emissions were measured after 1 3 7 days of bgs irrigation and then continuous sampling once or twice per week during the crop growing seasons the co2 and n2o concentrations were simultaneously analyzed with a gas chromatograph thermo trace 1300 usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and an electron capture detector ecd the carrier gases were a mixture of 95 argon and 5 methane the temperatures of injector detector and the packed column were mainly at 100 c 300 c and 65 c respectively the co2 and n2o fluxes were determined from each plot using the following closed chamber equation rolston 1986 1 f ρ v a δc δt 273 273 t where f indicates the co2 kg ha 1 d 1 flux and n2o flux g ha 1 d 1 ρ is the gas density under a standardized state kg m 3 v is the volume of the chamber m3 a is the chamber area m2 δc δt is the time interval and t is the temperature c the cumulative co2 and n2o emissions during the wheat maize growing seasons were

elementar toc instrument germany varion 2 6 data analysis the wheat and maize data were combined into one dataset the n2o and co2 were used as dependent variables with three categorical variables treatment year and growing stage and six continuous variables time days after treatment nh4 n no3 n doc air temperature and wfps as independent variables in addition another continuous variable namely time was incorporated into the correlation structure of the model which is 0 for the previous day of the treatment 1 for one day after treatment 2 for the other day of treatment another variable time was derived from this variable by keeping all the 0 s 1 s and 2 s and changing all the other values to 2 which was treated as a categorical independent variable and was included in the model there were five growing stages in total including wintering w jointing j heading h and filling f for wheat and summer s for corn there were five categories for treatment namely ck cf bsl bsm and bsh linear models were built with corar1 correlation structure using the function gls function in r package nlme pinheiro et al 2017 for the time the air temperature and wfps included both linear and quadratic

maize growing periods fig 2 a during the wheat growing period from october to june of the following year the co2 flux increased from march to may and then decreased until the wheat harvest except on several days during cycle 2 2015 2016 fig 2a during the maize growing period from june to late september the co2 fluxes evidently increased from july to august overall the cumulative co2 fluxes in the cf treatment were higher than the treatments with low and medium bgs irrigation rate but lower than the treatment with a high bgs irrigation rate despite the differences in co2 emissions between the bgs treatments and fertilizer treatment cf the differences were not statistically significant table 2 for all the treatments the n2o emission fluxes showed evident inter annual and seasonal variations fig 2b the n2o was significantly higher in 2016 than in 2015 fig 4g p 0 01 the highest n2o fluxes occurred in the summer 6 61 5 25 5 45 and 6 34 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in 2015 versus 8 24 10 95 12 59 and 13 54 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in 2016 under cf bsl bsm bsh treatments in addition the extremely high n2o emissions persisted for only one day and then decreased gradually negative n2o fluxes 3 01 0 77 were occasionally observed during december of 2015 the n2o fluxes also differed significantly across growing stages fig 4f p 0 05 the n2o levels at the wheat jointing stage and in summer maize were higher than they were in the other stages the bgs irrigation increased the n2o emissions dramatically and the n2o in the bgs treatments was significantly higher than that of the ck table 2 however there was no significant difference among these bgs treatments table 2 3 2 soil properties and temperatures the soil properties also showed seasonal variations especially for soil doc fig 3 the soil nh4 n tended to increase after the first bgs irrigation early december and it is the major form of soil n during this period fig 3 a the soil no3 n tended to increase in july in 2015 after the later three bgs irrigation times fig 3 b more variations in the soil no3 n occurred in 2016 than in 2015 especially for the cf t2 and t3 fig 3 a overall the soil nh4 n levels in the bgs treatments were higher than they were in the cf treatment table 2 however the difference between the cf bsl and bsm treatments was not statistically significant by contrast the soil nh4 n in the bsh treatment was significantly higher than it was in the fertilizer treatment and in the other bgs treatments the soil no3 n in the cf treatment was significantly greater than that it was in low bgs irrigation treatments but not significantly greater than in high bgs irrigation treatments in the statistics table 2 the soil doc content also changed seasonally with evident variations occurring in 2016 a significantly higher soil doc content occurred in the bgs treatments compared with the fertilizer treatment table 2 in addition the soil doc content was positively correlated with the bgs irrigation content the variations in soil moisture were strongly influenced by precipitation and irrigation the precipitation during the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were 367 and 408 mm respectively the annual mean air temperature were 12 9 and 12 7 c in the 2015 and 2016 wheat maize rotation years respectively the air temperature during the 2015 and 2016 wheat seasons were 11 53 and 11 91 c respectively whereas corresponding values during the maize season were 25 39 and 24 75 c respectively 3 3 responses of co2 and n2o to independent variables for n2o except the air temperature all the other variables were significant p 0 05 the n2o increased with nh4 n no3 n air temperature wfps and doc fig 4 the treatment was significant p 0 05 the n2o in ck was significantly lower than it was in the other treatments there was no significant difference between the other treatments the growing stage was also significant p 0 05 the n2o in j and s were higher than they were in the other stages the n2o was significantly higher in 2016 than in 2015 p 0 01 the time was also significant p 0 01 the n2o on the day of treatment was higher than it was on the other days for co2 the wfps doc and air temperature were significant p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively the co2 decreased as wfps and air temperature increased and it increased as doc increased fig 5 a c treatment growing stage and time were also significant p 0 01 p 0 001 and p 0 001 respectively the co2 in the ck was significantly lower than it was in the cf and t3 fig 5c winter showed significantly lower co2 than the other stages fig 5d the co2 on the day of treatment was significantly higher than it was on the other days and the co2 during the previous day of treatment was significantly lower than it was on the other days fig 5e the nh4 n no3 n and year were not significant p 0 1 3 4 grain yield nue gwp and ghgi across treatments both the yields of wheat and maize in the ck treatment were slightly lower compared with the other treatments the annual yields were not significantly different among the cf and bsm and bsh treatments table 3 the fertilizer application cf and bgs irrigation treatments had no significant effects on gwp whereas bgs irrigation resulted in a 5 33 increase in ghgi compared with the conventional fertilizer treatment table 3 the nitrogen use efficiency was significantly increased by 11 31 under bsl and 15 27 under bsm compared to cf fig 6 there was no significant difference between the bsh and cf fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling co2 emissions higher annual co2 emission in the bsh compared with the bsm bsl and cf treatments were likely correlated with the higher doc concentrations resulting from the bgs added to the soil schlesinger 2000 organic matter is the primary source of co2 evolution from the soil singh et al 1999 gattinger et al 2012 and co2 was positively correlated with the soil organic carbon content because more c provides more sources and more reaction sites for microbial decomposition shah et al 2016 the addition of c to the soil for 96 increased doc content might be responsible for the higher co2 emission in the bsh compared to the bsm and bsl treatments similar results were reported in that the application of organic fertilizer might result in an increase in co2 production from the soil singh et al 1999 hui et al reported that the application of large quantities of n 600 kg n ha 1 could result in higher soil respiration previous studies found that soil respiration was controlled by the temperature and soil water content gaumont guay et al 2006 mancinelli et al 2015 ren et al 2017 for example barbera et al 2015 and maucieri et al 2014 found a positive correlation between the temperature and co2 emission and they proposed higher co2 fluxes in the summer compared with other seasons during the winter period co2 emissions were the lowest for the entire year but they were the highest during the maize season when bgs was applied to the soil the wfps increased and consequently the soil evaporation increased which then resulted in higher soil respiration mancinelli et al 2010 4 2 factors influencing n2o emissions in this study different n rates did not lead to significant differences in n2o fluxes in the cf bsl bsm and bsh treatments but they were remarkably higher compared with the ck treatment this finding indicated that the application of n and water may be considered a possible indicator of nitrification and denitrification rates ludwig et al 2001 ye et al 2018 in the present study the n2o emission flux range 3 0 to 15 3 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in cycle 1 and 0 4 13 5 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in cycle 2 was consistent with the n2o emission flux range estimated in drought stricken areas in china 0 5 14 4 g n2o n ha 1 d 1in song et al 1996 3 0 19 1 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 in sun et al 2012 the negative n2o flux 3 01 g n2o n ha 1 d 1 was ascribed to the relatively low n availability and the low application rate of the easily decomposable organic c did not result in a favorable environment for denitrification cai et al 2013 the n2o emissions usually increased and reached a maximum on the third day during the wheat wintering period fig 2b which was characterized by periods of cold temperatures sanz cobena et al 2017 the increased soil temperature led to higher emissions and higher soil respiration rates which provided positive feedback for microbial metabolism thus the n2o emissions increased rapidly and they reached a maximum on the first day and then decreased gradually during the jointing heading and filling stages many studies have suggested that n fertilizer application was the most direct factor influencing soil n2o emissions which was also dependent on the soil temperature and moisture cuello et al 2015 in general the soil moisture was considered an important control parameter for the emissions of n2o which were higher both with and without n fertilization under irrigation in the wheat maize system simojoki and jaakkola 2000 sänger et al found that n2o emissions depend particularly on the wfps and rainfall at the time of fertilization during which the wfps ranged from 40 to 90 it has been demonstrated that the primary mechanism of n2o emission was nitrification at wfps levels of 30 70 but denitrification dominates at wfps levels of 70 90 chintala et al 2015 in the present study the n2o flux observed during either the wheat or maize growing season had approximately wfps levels of 30 70 indicating that the n2o emissions were primarily governed by nitrification schlesinger 2000 huang et al 2004 the higher rainfall in 2016 compared with 2015 may explain why the n2o emissions were significantly higher in 2016 than that in 2015 the temperature is the key factor influencing seasonal variations in n2o emissions rashti et al 2015 it was reported in many studies that soil temperatures above 10 c horváth et al 2010 ma et al 2010 were conductive to producing n2o emissions the most suitable temperature for n2o emissions observed in this study was 25 c the soil moisture and temperature affected the activity of nitrifiers and denitrifiers the production of substrates and the transport of the produced n2o within the soil matrix liu et al 2017 in the present study treatment induced n2o n losses ranged from 0 19 to 0 46 in 2014 2015 and from 0 22 to 0 35 in 2015 2016 which are much lower than the default value of 1 suggested by ipcc 2013 as well as other studies linquist et al 2012 liu et al 2014 similar results were also found in previous studies heintze et al 2017 htun et al 2017 4 3 cumulative ghg emissions gwp and ghgi under bgs irrigation gwp can provide a thorough understanding of the effects of agricultural practices including the effect of bgs irrigation on climate change gwp coefficients of 1 for co2 and 265 for n2o over a 100 year horizon ipcc 2014 were used to choose a reasonable fertilizer pattern the gwp of various treatments in the wheat maize system varied from 4229 kg co2 equivalent ha 1 in the unfertilized sample to 6153 52 kg co2 equivalent ha 1 with bgs irrigation during two consecutive years the increase in gwp after the bgs irrigation ranged from 5 bsl to 33 bsh in 2014 2016 increasing crop yields could efficiently decrease the ghgi cui et al 2013 based on the estimation of the wheat maize rotation there was no significant difference in the ghgi between the bsm and cf therefore using bgs irrigation as a recycled fertilizer not only increased grain yield but also reduced climatic impacts 4 4 influence of bgs irrigation on ghg emission and n use efficiency in this study the co2 emission fluxes caused by bgs were lower than reported in previous studies pan ying et al 2014 this discrepancy likely occurred because the soil doc content i e 104 mg kg 1 in this study was lower than the average value in the eastern part of china 159 mg kg 1 zhang et al 2011a this result indicated that a higher doc content would increase the co2 emissions in this study the co2 emission fluxes under bgs irrigation showed a significant positive relationship with the soil doc p 0 05 bgs may affect the biological properties and organic carbon mineralization of the soil and thus promote co2 emissions the bgs supply easily decomposes organic c that both sustains denitrification and induces anaerobiosis by stimulating biological o2 demand in addition the n2o flux showed a significant positive correlation p 0 01 with the soil nh4 n and no3 n contents likely because bgs is rich in ammonia n and nitrate n several previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of no3 to soil increased the n2o n2 ratio swerts et al 1997 soil no3 n is the substrate for denitrifying microorganisms and it directly affects the intensity of soil denitrification additionally the soil c n ratio may be indirectly related to the soil microbial activity and thereby affect the soil nitrification and denitrification processes and thus n2o emission frimpong and baggs 2010 gregorutti and caviglia 2017 the increased nue under bgs irrigation was likely due to the addition of bgs reducing n2o gas emissions and thereafter it increased the available n for plants case et al 2015 thus increasing the n uptake and utilization by plants improved the nue under bgs irrigation and reduced the cost by decreasing nutrient loss in addition the application of bgs increased the biomass accumulation water holding capacity and aggregation stability resulting in reduced n2o emission and improving the nutrient use efficiency shiratsuchi et al 2006 wei et al 2018 5 conclusion reducing environmental risks while increasing crop productivity is a huge challenge and it requires reductions in the fertilizer application rate the reuse of biogas slurry bgs could be a good option since it is not only an important source of nutrients which could replace some of the applied fertilizer but it is also a source of irrigation water in this study we investigated the n use efficiency of bgs irrigation and its environmental impacts by quantifying ghg emissions gwp and ghgi of bgs irrigation bgs irrigation can be used successfully in the wheat maize double cropping system as an alternative source of nutrients instead of fertilizer because it can increase the nue but it does not have environmental consequences in this study the bgs irrigation did not change the patterns and fluxes of co2 and n2o emission most of the bgs treatments increased the nue but did not increase the gwp and ghgi compared to conventional fertilizer treatment the results also provide important information for proper bgs reuse according to the ghgi and nutrient use efficiency results bsm is recommended as an improved recycling management practice

11261,xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china has seen the successful application of drip irrigation to wheat production to cope with the extreme shortage of fresh water resources however the cost is high with one drip tube serving only four rows of wheat plants in the current irrigation pattern here performances of irrigation patterns differing in ratios of drip t ube to plant r ows tr were compared in a field experiment in the growth seasons of spring wheat in 2014 and 2015 three ratios were set one tube served four tr4 as control five tr5 and six tr6 rows of plants row spacing 15 cm respectively variations in grain yield and water use efficiency wue were observed between different wheat rows r1 r2 and r3 indicated the 1st 2nd and 3rd rows close to the drip tube respectively grain yield declined in all the rows as the tr ratio increased with more obvious yield decrease in r3 and r2 than in r1 the ratios of the yield decrease to the decrease in received irrigation water riw in r3 and r2 were not proportionally lower relative to r1 the range of yield decrease was much smaller than the range of riw decrease in r3 and r2 this was because the decreases in the leaf area index and in the relative water content in the flag leaf of plants were less than that in riw in r3 and r2 relative to r1 and because of the compensation effect of the enhanced contribution of the redistributed dry matter stored in the vegetative organs before anthesis being translocated into the grains after anthesis in the plants of r3 and r2 this mechanism would be helpful for developing new and economical drip irrigation patterns for wheat production with a higher tr ratio abbreviations tr drip tube to plant rows wue water use efficiency riw received irrigation water ls lateral spacing

tube to wheat row ratio spatial variation spring wheat yield 1 introduction the shortage of fresh water resources has become a serious concern in the world especially in the agricultural areas savary et al 2005 xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china is a typical arid semi arid agricultural area with very limited fresh water resources sivamani et al 2000 with an annual rainfall of only around 150 mm vs annual evaporation of higher than 1700 mm deng et al 2006 this scarce fresh water resources seriously affects wheat the most important food crop in xinjiang shen et al 2013 over the whole season of its growth the solution to this problem is reasonably to develop water saving irrigation systems drip irrigation is one of the most water saving irrigation systems with very high water use efficiency wue morison et al 2008 and fertilizer use efficiency mansour 2013 to date drip irrigation systems have been well accepted in productions of fruits collins et al 2010 el sayed and el hagarey 2014 and other cash crops kirda et al 2007 and the low density and large size crops such as cotton jaredr et al 2008 ning et al 2015 and corn coelho and or 1999 lamm and trooien 2003 however an irrigation system that is both water saving and fertilizer saving is seldom applied to high density and small size crops such as wheat bozkurt et al 2006 for which one of the major reasons is that the cost is high due to the use of more drip tubes in the much narrower space between the wheat rows is it possible to have one drip tube serve more than four rows of wheat as is currently practiced in xinjiang however this will increase the risk of heterogeneity of plant growth and grain yield due to the uneven spatial distribution of both water and nutrition in soil of rows differently distant from the drip tube the evenness of water distribution in soil of the drip irrigation systems is highly dependent on the lateral spacing or strip width between the drip tubes on drip irrigation strategies such as irrigation frequency or interval between irrigations water amount and pressure for each irrigation and outlet design of the drip tube wang et al 2006 payero et al 2008 wang et al 2013 drip irrigation is a localized humid irrigation pattern in the form of point source or linear source du et al 2008 increasing lateral spacing will inevitably lead to a decrease in water supply in soil bulk distant from the drip tube chen et al 2015 and excessive lateral spacing has been reported to reduce corn production in the mediterranean region of turkey bozkurt et al 2006 in addition to the spatial unevenness of soil water supply the uneven water loss due to differential evapotranspiration of plants and soil bulk differently distant from the drip tube worsens the spatial unevenness of soil water status meanwhile movement of the nutritional elements usually relies on the behavior of soil water status li et al 2004 these will result in large variations in growth and yield performance within plants in different distances from the drip tube chen et al 2015 this is one of the reasons why farmers grow only two rows of wheat plants on each side of the drip tube one tube serving four rows of plants in total or a ratio of tube to rows of four tr4 in the current drip irrigation system for wheat in xinjiang based on this tr4 the effects of different irrigation methods on growth and development productivity and wue of wheat plants have been investigated wang et al 2006 payero et al 2008 wang et al 2013 nevertheless it is necessary to develop economical patterns with a high tr ratio however as is mentioned above the plants distant from the drip tube in the higher tr patterns receive much less water and produce much less grains than the plants adjacent to the drip tube chen et al 2015 on the other hand it is well known that moderate water deficit benefits grain yield because plants will manage with less water consumption kang et al 2003 this raises the possibility that one drip tube serves more than four rows of wheat plants with a smaller range of yield loss of the plants distant from the drip tube thereafter it is necessary to identify the relationships between wheat crop performance and the spatial availability of soil water as affected by the rows differentially distant from the drip tube in the wheat drip irrigation system with higher tr dry matter accumulation is the base of grain yield in cereals fan et al 2015 moreover the dry matter redistribution namely those photo assimilates being synthesized and stored in the vegetative organs before anthesis that can be redistributed to grains during filling and play a very important role in maintaining grain yield stability in temporal cereal crops including wheat niu et al 1998 the contribution of the redistributed dry matter to grain yield is greater in deficit irrigation than in conventional irrigation gallagher et al 1976 scott and dennis 1976 for instance moderate water deficit improves redistribution of photosynthates from vegetative organs to grains and increases the harvest index of wheat yang et al 2001 deficit irrigation at grain filling stage stimulates the redistribution of dry matter accumulated before anthesis from vegetative organs to grains hocking 1994 plaut et al 2004 this provides the possibility of reducing the variations in growth and yield performance between plant rows under high tr ratio drip irrigation system to test the irrigation patterns proposed above we extended the current drip irrigation system for wheat from tr4 to tr5 and tr6 to observe the variations in growth and grain yield of plants between the rows differently distant from the drip tube as affected by varied soil water supply in a field experiment the results would be significant in establishing lower cost drip irrigation systems for crop production in areas with scarce fresh water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the

water in the soil bulk of each row was then calculated by the volumetric water content times the bulk volume the total amount of received irrigation water riw of the six times irrigation in all the soil layers of each row was calculated by the sum of the differences in amount of water between the end of each irrigation and the day just before next irrigation the change in stored soil water of the soil profile before sowing and right after harvest were determined to calculate the crop evapotranspiration etc the etc was determined using the soil water balance method eq 5 according to huang et al 2005 and chen et al 2015 5 etc p i u s d δs where etc was crop evapotranspiration from sowing to harvest of wheat p was precipitation i was the net infiltration of irrigation water u was upward flow of shallow ground water into the root zone s was surface runoff d was downward drainage out of the root zone and δs was the change in stored soil water of the soil profile here s and d were ignored since no intense rainfall occurred to lead to a runoff and the local groundwater table was very low and no drainage occurred in normal years the water use efficiency wue was calculated as grain yield kg divided by etc mm according to huang et al 2005 the relative water content in the flag leaf at anthesis was measured on the third day after the irrigation according to the method of smart 1974 2 2 3 root dry matter and root sap collection roots were collected according to reynolds et al 2007 with modification at anthesis the soil bulk of 15 cm in width 15 cm in length and 100 cm in depth was collected at each row the soil bulks were pre soaked in water in metal containers then the mixture of soil roots and debris were carefully washed to collect root by pouring the mixture into a sieve 0 25 mm2 mesh the mixture in the sieve was further suspended in a water bath and shaken continuously until the roots were free of soil the root samples were then manually collected and dried at 85 c to get the dry mass root sap was collected according to yang et al 2002 with melioration in order to better adapt to the wheat sap collection ten stems of each plot were cut at about 4 cm above the soil surface at 8 00 a m pre weighed and sterilized degreasing cotton was put in a 1 5 ml pre weighted centrifuge tube and was used to cover the incision of each stem to collect the root sap during the collection the tube was sealed with fresh keeping film the collection lasted for 4 h and the tubes were taken and put together and weighed to obtain the root sap exudation rate expressed as mg stem 1 h 1 2 2 4 economic benefit calculation the economic benefit was roughly assessed using eq 6 6 economic benefit us ha 1 grain yield kg ha 1 0 385 us kg 1 straw kg ha 1 0 008 us

included the sale cost 0 062 us and manual work cost 0 385 us water consumption seed cost fertilizer and pesticide cost were the same among different irrigation patterns and all of them merged into other inputs at the time of the statistics 2 3 statistical analysis all data were submitted to one way analysis of variance anova to compare the differences among drip irrigation patterns and among different wheat rows using the software statistical product and service solutions spss inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion to reduce the cost of drip irrigation system for wheat by using less drip tubes we extended the lateral spacing ls or the row number of plants served by individual drip tubes from four rows tr4 ls of 60 cm to five rows tr5 ls of 75 cm and six rows tr6 ls of 90 cm in a field experiment the reduction in grain yield and received irrigation water of the distant rows in relation to the first row adjacent to the drip tube were compared 3 1 grain yield water use efficiency and economic benefit the grain yield of the distant row s was lower than the adjacent row of r1 in all the drip irrigation patterns table 3 even in the pattern with the narrowest lateral spacing of tr4 the grain yield of r2 was lower than that of r1 though the difference was insignificant the widened lateral spacing resulted in increased variations in grain yield between r1 and the distant rows of r2 and r3 in tr4 the yield decrease of r2 in relation to r1 was only 1 75 and 3 37 in 2014 and 2015 respectively in tr5 the decrease was 2 50 4 13 and 9 18 12 9 for r2 and r3 respectively and in tr6 the decrease was 4 08 4 77 and 13 8 16 0 respectively thus much more grain yield was lost in the most distant row r3 as a result of much less water received whilst the yield loss of r2 was much less in both tr5 and tr6 furthermore the grain yield of r1 was very similar among the three drip irrigation patterns thus the grain yield reductions of tr5 and tr6 in relation to tr4 were then mainly related to the lowered grain yield in r2 and r3 especially r3 in addition the yield loss of the distant rows was larger in tr6 than in tr5 due to the sharp drop of grain yield of r3 the average grain yield of all the rows was the lowest in tr6 followed by tr5 in both years table 3 this was confirmed by the final grain yield table 4 extending the tr ratio reduced grain yield with the same amount of irrigation water here in relation to tr4 the grain yield of tr5 was 3 11 and 3 39 lower than tr4 in 2014 and 2015 respectively and in tr6 the yield reduction was by 9 96 and 8 52 in 2014 and 2015 respectively besides the yield reduction of the distant rows was mostly ascribed to the decreases in the number of ears and grain number per ear and to the 1000 kernel weight table 3 in addition the crop evapotranspiration etc was higher in tr6 and tr5 than in tr4 table 4 in terms of the reduction in grain yield the water use efficiency wue of tr6 and tr5 was also lower in comparison with tr4 namely the wheat plants in r2 and r3 suffered less grain yield loss although they received much less water this might be a potential approach to further increase the number of rows served by individual drip tubes so as to reduce the cost of the current wheat drip irrigation pattern here tr5 showed the highest economic benefit in the three lateral spacing patterns because of the lower bypass cost and drip lateral cost of tr5 than tr4 and higher income for higher grain yield and larger straw biomass in tr5 than in tr6 table 5 notably the input cost including those of irrigation water seed fertilizer and pesticide were the same in all the irrigation systems in the high tr systems the irrigation and fertigation strategies could be further improved to reduce the cost and the row space could be further narrowed to decrease the yield reduction in the distant rows to get more economic benefit nonetheless further experiments are needed to optimize the high tr drip irrigation system which is more water saving and beneficial 3 2 soil water status and amount of received irrigation water riw the amount of riw varied among the rows differently distant from the drip tube and the range of variation depended on variation in lateral spacing fig 3 it was not surprising that in the three irrigation patterns r1 received the highest amount of irrigation water while r2 received relatively less water and r3 received the lowest amount of water in the tr5 and tr6 especially in the upper soil layers of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm the tr6 showed the highest average value of riw between rows in the surface soil layer of 0 20 cm whereas the tr4 showed the highest in the soil layers of 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm the variation in the average value of riw among the four soil layers was the lowest in the tr4 but it was much higher in tr6 and was similar between tr5 and tr6 as indicated by the coefficient of variation c v here the amounts of riw in r2 and r3 were around 5 7 19 l m 1 and 35 45 l m 1 less than r1 respectively accordingly in relation to r1 the percentage of the reduced riw was around 9 3 24 and 48 57 less in r2 and r3 respectively fig 3 evidently the reduction in the grain yield in r2 and r3 in relation to r1 was much less than the reduction in received irrigation water as was shown in fig 6 large difference in riw between the rows resulted in differential spatial distribution of soil water status in different irrigation patterns as shown in fig 3 right after irrigation the upper soil layers were wetter in tr6 than in tr5 followed by tr4 fig 4 along with plant growth however water loss from soil due to evapotranspiration increased very fast the soil water loss in tr5 and tr6 was much faster than in tr4 in all the soil layers it is very interesting that in the early growth stages from the 3rd or the 4th irrigations corresponding to the booting or the anthesis stage the soil water content in the distant rows in tr5 and tr6 reduced more than that in tr4 from the very end of the given irrigation event indicating a short term drought stress to the wheat plants of the distant rows in the late stages from the 4th or the 5th irrigations corresponding to the anthesis or the beginning of milking stage the time point at which soil moisture of the distant rows in tr5 and tr6 was lower than tr4 was much earlier than in the early stages starting from a few days after the full irrigation this could be related to the much greater water loss resulting from the enhanced transpiration due to the enlarged canopy and from the improved evaporation because of the increase in air temperature specifically the duration to the next irrigation was prolonged indicating that the wheat plants of r2 and r3 suffered more severe drought stress there is no doubt that the wheat plants of r2 and r3 experienced several soil water status cycling patterns of full watering dry re watering induced by the six times of irrigation this pattern of water cycle in r2 and r3 in relation to r1 was very similar to the events of drought priming and drought stress drought primed plants in vegetative organs have been reported to have essentially improved the tolerance to post anthesis drought stress and resulted in much less grain yield loss than the non primed plants of wheat wang et al 2014 thus the moderate drought stimulated wheat plants in r2 and r3 in the early growth stages could contribute to the less grain yield reduction in the tr5 and tr6 table 3 the above trend was more obvious in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers fig 3 the plants of the distant rows frequently suffered soil water deficit in relation to the adjacent row since anthesis or the beginning of the milking stage these results indicated that since anthesis wheat plants had grown very fast the surface soil layer 0 20 cm evaporation dominated in the water loss and the water in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers were consumed more than the deep soil layers due to the distribution of functional roots asseng et al 1998 fang et al 2017 and probably due to the higher water availability which suggested that the fluctuations of water content in the distant rows after anthesis were more violent in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers where plants had more roots to efficiently uptake more available water than the deep soil layers li et al 2001 this would result in different plant water status dry matter accumulation and redistribution water use efficiency and grain yield fig 4 tables 4 and 6 3 3 flag leaf water status and leaf area index lai the grain yield loss was accompanied by the reduction in dry matter accumulation lai and leaf water status it has been observed that drought stress limits leaf expansion curtails transpiration rates thereby sustaining higher leaf water status li et al 2007 reduced received irrigation water and wide fluctuations of water status in soil of the distant row s resulted in low water status in the flag leaf fig 5 here the relative water content in the flag leaf of r2 was insignificantly lower than r1 in the same drip irrigation system however the relative water content in the flag leaf of r3 was significantly lower than r2 and r1 in tr5 and tr6 in addition the relative water content in the flag leaf was the lowest in tr6 followed by tr5 which indicated that the widened lateral spacing reduced water status and resulted in water deficit in wheat plants especially in the plants of the rows distant from the drip tube accordingly the growth of wheat plants was depressed due to the water deficit under widened lateral spacing at least in terms of lai at anthesis fig 5 large leaf area improves the crop canopy light interception and contributes to improvement of biomass and yield lai is the basic parameter for describing the crop population quality which could reflect the crop productivity and often positively correlates with grain yield nielsen et al 2012 here tr4 showed higher lai than tr5 and tr6 in addition under the same lateral spacing systems lai was insignificantly lower in r2 than r1 but it was significantly lower in r3 than in r2 in both tr5 and tr6 drought priming an earlier moderate drought event at vegetative stages have been reported to essentially improve the tolerance to post anthesis drought stress by better maintenance of plant water status in wheat wang et al 2015 here the reduction in the relative flag leaf water content in r2 and r3 in relation to r1 was ca 0 46 2 5 and 3 0 5 9 respectively accompanied by lai reduction of ca 2 2 2 3 and 6 8 11 respectively it was notable that both the reductions in lai and leaf water status of the wheat rows were much lower than their riw 3 4 dry matter accumulation and redistribution the dry matter of grains is mostly derived from the photo assimilates synthesized by leaves and other green organs of wheat liu et al 2016 and grain yield is closely related to the accumulation of dry matter moll et al 1994 the variations in received irrigation water and thereafter the soil water status had imposed the plants at different levels of drought stress which affected the accumulation and redistribution of dry matter among the rows differently distant from the drip tube dry matter accumulations at maturity dma m were similar to each other between r1 and r2 in tr4 but were the highest in r1 and the lowest in r3 with significant difference among the rows in tr5 and tr6 table 6 dry matter accumulations of r1 at both anthesis and maturity were similar to each other among the drip irrigation patterns in 2014 but it was lower in tr5 and tr6 than tr4 in 2015 due to the sharp decrease in dry matter accumulation of r2 and r3 in relation to r1 the total dry matter accumulation was the lowest for tr6 and the highest for tr4 with significant difference among the drip irrigation patterns the reduction of dma m was only 1 04 7 12 in r2 and it was 10 0 15 3 in r3 in relation to r1 which was also much less than the reduction of received irrigation water in the corresponding rows this could be one explanation for the much less grain loss than the reduction of received irrigation water in rows distant from the drip tube the photo assimilates temporally stored in the vegetative organs such as in the stems in the form of water soluble carbohydrates wsc can be further redistributed into grains during grain filling when the capacity of the photosynthetic organ declines contributing to the final grain yield niu et al 1998 chen et al 2011 the temporary stored photosynthates are particularly important in maintenance of grain yield under abiotic stresses including drought saint pierre et al 2010 the redistribution of dry matter from vegetative organs between anthesis and maturity dmr also varied among different rows and drip irrigation patterns table 6 the absolute value of dmr was insignificantly lower in r2 than r1 in tr4 and tr5 but in tr6 the difference became significant in addition dmr was significantly lower in r3 than in r2 in tr5 and tr6 in both years in relation to r1 dmr of r2 was 0 710 0 930 3 11 3 37 and 4 35 4 36 lower in tr4 tr5 and tr6 respectively however the percentages of dmr of r3 were 7 23 7 31 and 9 75 11 9 in tr5 and tr6 respectively thus the average of dmr was similar between tr5 and tr6 but it was significantly higher in tr4 than tr5 and tr6 the rate of dmr to grains dmr r varied among different rows and drip irrigation patterns the absolute value of dmr r was insignificantly higher in r2 than r1 in tr4 and tr5 but in tr6 the difference became significant the dmr r of r3 was significantly higher than r1 in tr5 and tr6 the dmr r of r2 was 0 970 1 97 2 61 3 32 and 3 63 3 90 higher than r1 in tr4 tr5 and tr6 respectively moreover the dmr r of r3 was 5 42 6 14 and 6 07 7 00 higher than r1 in tr5 and tr6 respectively earlier studies have shown that moderate drought priming in the early period of growth can alleviate reduction in grain yield because drought priming alleviates the decrease in the amount of dry matter translocated after anthesis and increases the rate of dry matter translocation thus alleviating the decrease of dry matter supply capacity after anthesis li et al 2014 wang et al 2014 2015 we found that there was much less dmr loss than the reduction of received irrigation water in rows distant from the drip tube the dmr r of distant row s was higher than that of the adjacent row due to the drought priming of the distant row s in the early growth stage under the drip irrigation condition which was the main contribution to less reduction in yield the average of dmr r was similar between tr5 and tr6 but it was significantly higher in tr5 and tr6 than tr4 meanwhile the contribution of dmr to grains dmr c of r1 was insignificantly lower than r2 in the three drip irrigation patterns except for tr6 in 2015 it was insignificantly lower in r2 than r3 in tr5 and tr6 except for tr6 in 2014 it has been reported that the contribution of pre anthesis assimilate translocated to grains is very high under the moderate drought treatment liu et al 2016 here though the absolute amount of the dmr of r2 and r3 was lower than r1 the dmr r and the dmr c were much higher in r2 and r3 than in r1 table 6 the varied accumulation and redistribution of dry matter among the rows and drip irrigation patterns could finally affect the harvest index hi in general hi was the highest in r3 and the lowest in r1 with the exception that hi was similar between r1 and r2 in tr4 table 6 in tr5 hi was significantly higher in r3 than in r2 and it was higher in r2 than in r1 in 2014 but it was insignificant among rows in 2015 in tr6 hi was significantly higher in r3 than in r1 in both years thus the improved redistribution of the pre anthesis synthesized dry matter to the grains and the enhanced hi also contributed to the less grain yield loss of the distant rows in the present study 3 5 root dry matter and root sap exudation rate root is an important organ for plant water and nutrients uptake both root biomass and activity play important roles under water deficit conditions he et al 2014 fang et al 2017 here the root dry matter of the wheat plants adjacent to the drip tube was much more than that of the distant rows in tr5 and tr6 and the average value among the three irrigation patterns were significantly different table 7 the root sap exudation rate showed the similar trend for root dry matter again it was observed that the decreases of both biomass and sap exudation rate of root in r3 and r2 rows were much lower than the corresponding decrease of riw thus the less reduction in root production and activity in the distant rows could also contribute to the less grain yield loss 4 conclusions increasing the number of rows from four of the current wheat drip irrigation system to five and six served by individual drip tubes reduced the usage of drip tubes but caused less grain yield reduction which was mainly ascribed to the yield reduction of the rows distant from the drip tube especially the most distant row of r3 however the grain yield reduction was much less than the decrease of water received in the distant rows this could be explained by the less depression on dry matter accumulation and lai and enhanced redistribution of the temporally stored dry matter in vegetative organs to grains the present experiment provided potential approaches to the use of less drip tubes by extending the lateral spacing in combination with other practices such as modifying the irrigation strategy the row space which requires further investigation acknowledgments we appreciate the kind revision of english language by prof feirong gu from

11261,xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china has seen the successful application of drip irrigation to wheat production to cope with the extreme shortage of fresh water resources however the cost is high with one drip tube serving only four rows of wheat plants in the current irrigation pattern here performances of irrigation patterns differing in ratios of drip t ube to plant r ows tr were compared in a field experiment in the growth seasons of spring wheat in 2014 and 2015 three ratios were set one tube served four tr4 as control five tr5 and six tr6 rows of plants row spacing 15 cm respectively variations in grain yield and water use efficiency wue were observed between different wheat rows r1 r2 and r3 indicated the 1st 2nd and 3rd rows close to the drip tube respectively grain yield declined in all the rows as the tr ratio increased with more obvious yield decrease in r3 and r2 than in r1 the ratios of the yield decrease to the decrease in received irrigation water riw in r3 and r2 were not proportionally lower relative to r1 the range of yield decrease was much smaller than the range of riw decrease in r3 and r2 this was because the decreases in the leaf area index and in the relative water content in the flag leaf of plants were less than that in riw in r3 and r2 relative to r1 and because of the compensation effect of the enhanced contribution of the redistributed dry matter stored in the vegetative organs before anthesis being translocated into the grains after anthesis in the plants of r3 and r2 this mechanism would be helpful for developing new

tube to wheat row ratio spatial variation spring wheat yield 1 introduction the shortage of fresh water resources has become a serious concern in the world especially in the agricultural areas savary et al 2005 xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china is a typical arid semi arid agricultural area with very limited fresh water resources sivamani et al 2000 with an annual rainfall of only around 150 mm vs annual evaporation of higher than 1700 mm deng et al 2006 this scarce fresh water resources seriously affects wheat the most important food crop in xinjiang shen et al 2013 over the whole season of its growth the solution to this problem is reasonably to develop water saving irrigation systems drip irrigation is one of the most water saving irrigation systems with very high water use efficiency wue morison et al 2008 and fertilizer use efficiency mansour 2013 to date drip irrigation systems have been well accepted in productions of fruits collins et al 2010 el sayed and el hagarey 2014 and other cash crops kirda et al 2007 and the low density and large size crops such as cotton jaredr et al 2008 ning et al 2015 and corn coelho and or 1999 lamm and trooien 2003 however an irrigation system that is both water saving and fertilizer saving is seldom applied to high density and small size crops such as wheat bozkurt et al 2006 for which one of the major reasons is that the cost is high due to the use of more drip tubes in the much narrower space between the wheat rows is it possible to have one drip tube serve more than four rows of wheat as is currently practiced in xinjiang however this will increase the risk of heterogeneity of plant growth and grain yield due to the uneven spatial distribution of both water and nutrition in soil of rows differently distant from the drip tube the evenness of water distribution in soil of the drip irrigation systems is highly dependent on the lateral spacing or strip width between the drip tubes on drip irrigation strategies such as irrigation frequency or interval between irrigations water amount and pressure for each irrigation and outlet design of the drip tube wang et al 2006 payero et al 2008 wang et al 2013 drip irrigation is a localized humid irrigation pattern in the form of point source or linear source du et al 2008 increasing lateral spacing will inevitably lead to a decrease in water supply in soil bulk distant from the drip tube chen et al 2015 and excessive lateral spacing has been reported to reduce corn production in the mediterranean region of turkey bozkurt et al 2006 in addition to the spatial unevenness of soil water supply the uneven water loss due to differential evapotranspiration of plants and soil bulk differently distant from the drip tube worsens the spatial unevenness of soil water status meanwhile movement of the nutritional elements usually relies on the behavior of soil water status li et al 2004 these will result in large variations in growth and yield performance within plants in different distances from the drip tube chen et al 2015 this is one of the reasons why farmers grow only two rows of wheat plants on each side of the drip tube one tube serving four rows of plants in total or a ratio of tube to rows of four tr4 in the current drip irrigation system for wheat in xinjiang based on this tr4 the effects of different irrigation methods on growth and development productivity and wue of wheat plants have been investigated wang et al 2006 payero et al 2008 wang et al 2013 nevertheless it is necessary to develop economical patterns with a high tr ratio however as is mentioned above the plants distant from the drip tube in the higher tr patterns receive much less water and produce much less grains than the plants adjacent to the drip tube chen et al 2015 on the other hand it is well known that moderate water deficit benefits grain yield because plants will manage with less water consumption kang et al 2003 this raises the possibility that one drip tube serves more than four rows of wheat plants with a smaller range of yield loss of the plants distant from the drip tube thereafter it is necessary to identify the relationships between wheat crop performance and the spatial availability of soil water as affected by the rows differentially distant from the drip tube in the wheat drip irrigation system with higher tr dry matter accumulation is the base of grain yield in cereals fan et al 2015 moreover the dry matter redistribution namely those photo assimilates being synthesized and stored in the vegetative organs before anthesis that can be redistributed to grains during filling and play a very important role in maintaining grain yield stability in temporal cereal crops including wheat niu et al 1998 the contribution of the redistributed dry matter to grain yield is greater in deficit irrigation than in conventional irrigation gallagher et al 1976 scott and dennis 1976 for instance moderate water deficit improves redistribution of photosynthates from vegetative organs to grains and increases the harvest index of wheat yang et al 2001 deficit irrigation at grain filling stage stimulates the redistribution of dry matter accumulated before anthesis from vegetative organs to grains hocking 1994 plaut et al 2004 this provides the possibility of reducing the variations in growth and yield performance between plant rows under high tr ratio drip irrigation system to test the irrigation patterns proposed above we extended the current drip irrigation system for wheat from tr4 to tr5 and tr6 to observe the variations in growth and grain yield of plants between the rows differently distant from the drip tube as affected by varied soil water supply in a field experiment the results would be significant in establishing lower cost drip irrigation systems for crop production in areas with scarce fresh water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the field experiment was conducted in the two growth seasons of spring wheat in 2014 and 2015 at the agronomy experiment station of shihezi university 44 27 n 86 01 e of xinjiang uyghur autonomous region

were shown in fig 1 the physical and chemical properties of the soil profile average of the two years at the experimental site before sowing were shown in table 1 the soil at the 0 20 cm depth contained 65 8 mg kg 1 available nitrogen 25 4 mg kg 1 olsen pof and 145 mg kg 1 available potassium the sowing dates were 2 april 2014 and 27 march 2015 the plot size was 3 6 m in width and 6 0 m in

irrigation patterns with different ratios of drip t ube to r ows tr of wheat plants and corresponding differential drip l ateral s pacing ls or differential width strips were applied i e one drip tube served four rows tr4 ls 60 cm five rows tr5 ls 75 cm and six rows tr6 ls 90 cm respectively the 1st 2nd and 3rd rows close to the drip tube were named r1 r2 and r3 respectively for investigation of the spatial variations in grain yield between different rows under different tr patterns the schematic diagram of the tr patterns was shown in fig 2 the total irrigation water amount and total nitrogen rate were 4500 m3 ha 1 and 300 kg ha 1 for all treatments respectively the timing and amount of each irrigation and of nitrogen fertilization followed previous studies and locally recommended protocols as shown in table 2 liu et al 2013 jin et al 2014 in addition a dose of 105 kg ha 1 p2o5 and k2o was applied to the soil before sowing the emitter discharge rate was 2 6 l h 1 the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 was used to indicate the growth stages for each irrigation 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 biomass leaf area index lai and grain yield uniform spikes flowering on the same day were tagged for sampling twenty plants were harvested at both anthesis and maturity stages and the plants were separated into leaves stems and sheathes and spikes at anthesis and into leaves stems and

na usa the leaf area index lai was then calculated according to li et al 2010 at the physiological maturity spikes in each row 2 m in length in the central strips of the plots were separately counted to get the ear number of each row r1 and r2 for tr4 while r1 r2 and r3 for tr5 and tr6 at unit of ears m 2 at maturity 50 culms from each row were collected for measurements of grain number per ear gn and 1000 kernel weight tkw in addition plants of each row 2 m in length in the central strips of the plots were separately harvested and threshed grains from the rows of the same category were put together to calculate the yield of each row at unit of g m 2 the overall grain yield kg ha 1 was the sum of the production of grain yield multiplying the fraction of soil area of each row 2 2 2 water status of soil and leaf crop evapotranspiration etc and water use efficiency wue special tubes for profile probe type pr2 delta t devices cambridge england were pre embedded in the soil of each row for monitoring the water contents in soil at the depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm respectively at the given timings soil samples were separately drilled at the layers of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm from the soil surface respectively the soil water content in each layer was measured for correction of the soil water status data collected by the pr2 the given amount of water in the soil bulk of each row was then calculated by the volumetric water content times the bulk volume the total amount of received irrigation water riw of the six times irrigation in all the soil layers of each row was calculated by the sum of the differences in amount of water between the end of each irrigation and the day just before next irrigation the change in stored soil water of the soil profile before sowing and right after harvest were determined to calculate the crop evapotranspiration etc the etc was determined using the soil water balance method eq 5 according to huang et al 2005 and chen et al 2015 5 etc p i u s d δs where etc was crop evapotranspiration from sowing to harvest of wheat p was precipitation i was the net infiltration of irrigation water u was upward flow of shallow ground water into the root zone s was surface runoff d was downward drainage out of the root zone and δs was the change in stored soil water of the soil profile here s and d were ignored since no intense rainfall occurred to lead to a runoff and the local groundwater table was very low and no drainage occurred in normal years the water use efficiency wue was calculated as grain yield kg divided by etc mm according to huang et al 2005 the relative water content in the flag leaf at anthesis was measured on the third day after the irrigation according to the method of smart 1974 2 2 3 root dry matter and root sap collection roots were collected according to reynolds et al 2007 with modification at anthesis the soil bulk of 15 cm in width 15 cm in length and 100 cm in depth was collected at each row the soil bulks were pre soaked in water in metal containers then the mixture of soil roots and debris were carefully washed to collect root by pouring the mixture into a sieve 0 25 mm2 mesh the mixture in the sieve was further suspended in a water bath and shaken continuously until the roots were free of soil the root samples were then manually collected and dried at 85 c to get the dry mass root sap was collected according to yang et al 2002 with melioration in order to better adapt to the wheat sap collection ten stems of each plot were cut at about 4 cm above the soil surface at 8 00 a m pre weighed and sterilized degreasing cotton was put in a 1 5 ml pre weighted centrifuge tube and was used to cover the incision of each stem to collect the root sap during the collection the tube was sealed with fresh keeping film the collection lasted for 4 h and the tubes were taken and put together and weighed to obtain the root sap exudation rate expressed as mg stem 1 h 1 2 2 4 economic benefit calculation the economic benefit was roughly assessed using eq 6 6 economic benefit us ha 1 grain yield kg ha 1 0 385 us kg 1 straw kg ha 1 0 008 us

included the sale cost 0 062 us and manual work cost 0 385 us water consumption seed cost fertilizer and pesticide cost were the same among different irrigation patterns and all of them merged into other inputs at the time of the statistics 2 3 statistical analysis all data were submitted to one way analysis of variance anova to compare the differences among drip irrigation patterns and among different wheat rows using the software statistical product and service solutions spss inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion to reduce the cost of drip irrigation system for wheat by using less drip tubes we extended the lateral spacing ls or the row number of plants served by individual drip tubes from four rows tr4 ls of 60 cm to five rows tr5 ls of 75 cm and six rows tr6 ls of 90 cm in a field experiment the reduction in grain yield and received irrigation water of the distant rows in relation to the first row adjacent to the drip tube were compared 3 1 grain yield water use efficiency and economic benefit the grain yield of the distant row s was lower than the adjacent row of r1 in all the drip irrigation patterns table 3 even in the pattern with the narrowest lateral spacing of tr4 the grain yield of r2 was lower than that of r1 though the difference was insignificant the widened lateral spacing resulted in increased variations in grain yield between r1 and the distant rows of r2 and r3 in tr4 the yield decrease of r2 in relation to r1 was only 1 75 and 3 37 in 2014 and 2015 respectively in tr5 the decrease was 2 50 4 13 and 9 18 12 9 for r2 and r3 respectively and in tr6 the decrease was 4 08 4 77 and 13 8 16 0 respectively thus much more grain yield was lost in the most distant row r3 as a result of much less water received whilst the yield loss of r2 was much less in both tr5 and tr6 furthermore the grain yield of r1 was very similar among the three drip irrigation patterns thus the grain yield reductions of tr5 and tr6 in relation to tr4 were then mainly related to the lowered grain yield in r2 and r3 especially r3 in addition the yield loss of the distant rows was larger in tr6 than in tr5 due to the sharp drop of grain yield of r3 the average grain yield of all the rows was the lowest in tr6 followed by tr5 in both years table 3 this was confirmed by the final grain yield table 4 extending the tr ratio reduced grain yield with the same amount of irrigation water here in relation to tr4 the grain yield of tr5 was 3 11 and 3 39 lower than tr4 in 2014 and 2015 respectively and in tr6 the yield reduction was by 9 96 and 8 52 in 2014 and 2015 respectively besides the yield reduction of the distant rows was mostly ascribed to the decreases in the number of ears and grain number per ear and to the 1000 kernel weight table 3 in addition the crop evapotranspiration etc was higher in tr6 and tr5 than in tr4 table 4 in terms of the reduction in grain yield the water use efficiency wue of tr6 and tr5 was also lower in comparison with tr4 namely the wheat plants in r2 and r3 suffered less grain yield loss although they received much less water this might be a potential approach to further increase the number of rows served by individual drip tubes so as to reduce the cost of the current wheat drip irrigation pattern here tr5 showed the highest economic benefit in the three lateral spacing patterns because of the lower bypass cost and drip lateral cost of tr5 than tr4 and higher income for higher grain yield and larger straw biomass in tr5 than in tr6 table 5 notably the input cost including those of irrigation water seed fertilizer and pesticide were the same in all the irrigation systems in the high tr systems the irrigation and fertigation strategies could be further improved to reduce the cost and the row space could be further narrowed to decrease the yield reduction in the distant rows to get more economic benefit nonetheless further experiments are needed to optimize the high tr drip irrigation system which is more water saving and beneficial 3 2 soil water status and amount of received irrigation water riw the amount of riw varied among the rows differently distant from the drip tube and the range of variation depended on variation in lateral spacing fig 3 it was not surprising that in the three irrigation patterns r1 received the highest amount of irrigation water while r2 received relatively less water and r3 received the lowest amount of water in the tr5 and tr6 especially in the upper soil layers of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm the tr6 showed the highest average value of riw between rows in the surface soil layer of 0 20 cm whereas the tr4 showed the highest in the soil layers of 40 60 cm and 60 100 cm the variation in the average value of riw among the four soil layers was the lowest in the tr4 but it was much higher in tr6 and was similar between tr5 and tr6 as indicated by the coefficient of variation c v here the amounts of riw in r2 and r3 were around 5 7 19 l m 1 and 35 45 l m 1 less than r1 respectively accordingly in relation to r1 the percentage of the reduced riw was around 9 3 24 and 48 57 less in r2 and r3 respectively fig 3 evidently the reduction in the grain yield in r2 and r3 in relation to r1 was much less than the reduction in received irrigation water as was shown in fig 6 large difference in riw between the rows resulted in differential spatial distribution of soil water status in different irrigation patterns as shown in fig 3 right after irrigation the upper soil layers were wetter in tr6 than in tr5 followed by tr4 fig 4 along with plant growth however water loss from soil due to evapotranspiration increased very fast the soil water loss in tr5 and tr6 was much faster than in tr4 in all the soil layers it is very interesting that in the early growth stages from the 3rd or the 4th irrigations corresponding to the booting or the anthesis stage the soil water content in the distant rows in tr5 and tr6 reduced more than that in tr4 from the very end of the given irrigation event indicating a short term drought stress to the wheat plants of the distant rows in the late stages from the 4th or the 5th irrigations corresponding to the anthesis or the beginning of milking stage the time point at which soil moisture of the distant rows in tr5 and tr6 was lower than tr4 was much earlier than in the early stages starting from a few days after the full irrigation this could be related to the much greater water loss resulting from the enhanced transpiration due to the enlarged canopy and from the improved evaporation because of the increase in air temperature specifically the duration to the next irrigation was prolonged indicating that the wheat plants of r2 and r3 suffered more severe drought stress there is no doubt that the wheat plants of r2 and r3 experienced several soil water status cycling patterns of full watering dry re watering induced by the six times of irrigation this pattern of water cycle in r2 and r3 in relation to r1 was very similar to the events of drought priming and drought stress drought primed plants in vegetative organs have been reported to have essentially improved the tolerance to post anthesis drought stress and resulted in much less grain yield loss than the non primed plants of wheat wang et al 2014 thus the moderate drought stimulated wheat plants in r2 and r3 in the early growth stages could contribute to the less grain yield reduction in the tr5 and tr6 table 3 the above trend was more obvious in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers fig 3 the plants of the distant rows frequently suffered soil water deficit in relation to the adjacent row since anthesis or the beginning of the milking stage these results indicated that since anthesis wheat plants had grown very fast the surface soil layer 0 20 cm evaporation dominated in the water loss and the water in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers were consumed more than the deep soil layers due to the distribution of functional roots asseng et al 1998 fang et al 2017 and probably due to the higher water availability which suggested that the fluctuations of water content in the distant rows after anthesis were more violent in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers where plants had more roots to efficiently uptake more available water than the deep soil layers li et al 2001 this would result in different plant water status dry matter accumulation and redistribution water use efficiency and grain yield fig 4 tables 4 and 6 3 3 flag leaf water status and leaf area index lai the grain yield loss was accompanied by the reduction in dry matter accumulation lai and leaf water status it has been observed that drought stress limits leaf expansion curtails transpiration rates thereby sustaining higher leaf water status li et al 2007 reduced received irrigation water and wide fluctuations of water status in soil of the distant row s resulted in low water status in the flag leaf fig 5 here the relative water content in the flag leaf of r2 was insignificantly lower than r1 in the same drip irrigation system however the relative water content in the flag leaf of r3 was significantly lower than r2 and r1 in tr5 and tr6 in addition the relative water content in the flag leaf was the lowest in tr6 followed by tr5 which indicated that the widened lateral spacing reduced water status and resulted in water deficit in wheat plants especially in the plants of the rows distant from the drip tube accordingly the growth of wheat plants was depressed due to the water deficit under widened lateral spacing at least in terms of lai at anthesis fig 5 large leaf area improves the crop canopy light interception and contributes to improvement of biomass and yield lai is the basic parameter for describing the crop population quality which could reflect the crop productivity and often positively correlates with grain yield nielsen et al 2012 here tr4 showed higher lai than tr5 and tr6 in addition under the same lateral spacing systems lai was insignificantly lower in r2 than r1 but it was significantly lower in r3 than in r2 in both tr5 and tr6 drought priming an earlier moderate drought event at vegetative stages have been reported to essentially improve the tolerance to post anthesis drought stress by better maintenance of plant water status in wheat wang et al 2015 here the reduction in the relative flag leaf water content in r2 and r3 in relation to r1 was ca 0 46 2 5 and 3 0 5 9 respectively accompanied by lai reduction of ca 2 2 2 3 and 6 8 11 respectively it was notable that both the reductions in lai and leaf water status of the wheat rows were much lower than their riw 3 4 dry matter accumulation and redistribution the dry matter of grains is mostly derived from the photo assimilates synthesized by leaves and other green organs of wheat liu et al 2016 and grain yield is closely related to the accumulation of dry matter moll et al 1994 the variations in received irrigation water and thereafter the soil water status had imposed the plants at different levels of drought stress which affected the accumulation and redistribution of dry matter among the rows differently distant from the drip tube dry matter accumulations at maturity dma m were similar to each other between r1 and r2 in tr4 but were the highest in r1 and the lowest in r3 with significant difference among the rows in tr5 and tr6 table 6 dry matter accumulations of r1 at both anthesis and maturity were similar to each other among the drip irrigation patterns in 2014 but it was lower in tr5 and tr6 than tr4 in 2015 due to the sharp decrease in dry matter accumulation of r2 and r3 in relation to r1 the total dry matter accumulation was the lowest for tr6 and the highest for tr4 with significant difference among the drip irrigation patterns the reduction of dma m was only 1 04 7 12 in r2 and it was 10 0 15 3 in r3 in relation to r1 which was also much less than the reduction of received irrigation water in the corresponding rows this could be one explanation for the much less grain loss than the reduction of received irrigation water in rows distant from the drip tube the photo assimilates temporally stored in the vegetative organs such as in the stems in the form of water soluble carbohydrates wsc can be further redistributed into grains during grain filling when the capacity of the photosynthetic organ declines contributing to the final grain yield niu et al 1998 chen et al 2011 the temporary stored photosynthates are particularly important in maintenance of grain yield under abiotic stresses including drought saint pierre et al 2010 the redistribution of dry matter from vegetative organs between anthesis and maturity dmr also varied among different rows and drip irrigation patterns table 6 the absolute value of dmr was insignificantly lower in r2 than r1 in tr4 and tr5 but in tr6 the difference became significant in addition dmr was significantly lower in r3 than in r2 in tr5 and tr6 in both years in relation to r1 dmr of r2 was 0 710 0 930 3 11 3 37 and 4 35 4 36 lower in tr4 tr5 and tr6 respectively however the percentages of dmr of r3 were 7 23 7 31 and 9 75 11 9 in tr5 and tr6 respectively thus the average of dmr was similar between tr5 and tr6 but it was significantly higher in tr4 than tr5 and tr6 the rate of dmr to grains dmr r varied among different rows and drip irrigation patterns the absolute value of dmr r was insignificantly higher in r2 than r1 in tr4 and tr5 but in tr6 the difference became significant the dmr r of r3 was significantly higher than r1 in tr5 and tr6 the dmr r of r2 was 0 970 1 97 2 61 3 32 and 3 63 3 90 higher than r1 in tr4 tr5 and tr6 respectively moreover the dmr r of r3 was 5 42 6 14 and 6 07 7 00 higher than r1 in tr5 and tr6 respectively earlier studies have shown that moderate drought priming in the early period of growth can alleviate reduction in grain yield because drought priming alleviates the decrease in the amount of dry matter translocated after anthesis and increases the rate of dry matter translocation thus alleviating the decrease of dry matter supply capacity after anthesis li et al 2014 wang et al 2014 2015 we found that there was much less dmr loss than the reduction of received irrigation water in rows distant from the drip tube the dmr r of distant row s was higher than that of the adjacent row due to the drought priming of the distant row s in the early growth stage under the drip irrigation condition which was the main contribution to less reduction in yield the average of dmr r was similar between tr5 and tr6 but it was significantly higher in tr5 and tr6 than tr4 meanwhile the contribution of dmr to grains dmr c of r1 was insignificantly lower than r2 in the three drip irrigation patterns except for tr6 in 2015 it was insignificantly lower in r2 than r3 in tr5 and tr6 except for tr6 in 2014 it has been reported that the contribution of pre anthesis assimilate translocated to grains is very high under the moderate drought treatment liu et al 2016 here though the absolute amount of the dmr of r2 and r3 was lower than r1 the dmr r and the dmr c were much higher in r2 and r3 than in r1 table 6 the varied accumulation and redistribution of dry matter among the rows and drip irrigation patterns could finally affect the harvest index hi in general hi was the highest in r3 and the lowest in r1 with the exception that hi was similar between r1 and r2 in tr4 table 6 in tr5 hi was significantly higher in r3 than in r2 and it was higher in r2 than in r1 in 2014 but it was insignificant among rows in 2015 in tr6 hi was significantly higher in r3 than in r1 in both years thus the improved redistribution of the pre anthesis synthesized dry matter to the grains and the enhanced hi also contributed to the less grain yield loss of the distant rows in the present study 3 5 root dry matter and root sap exudation rate root is an important organ for plant water and nutrients uptake both root biomass and activity play important roles under water deficit conditions he et al 2014 fang et al 2017 here the root dry matter of the wheat plants adjacent to the drip tube was much more than that of the distant rows in tr5 and tr6 and the average value among the three irrigation patterns were significantly different table 7 the root sap exudation rate showed the similar trend for root dry matter again it was observed that the decreases of both biomass and sap exudation rate of root in r3 and r2 rows were much lower than the corresponding decrease of riw thus the less reduction in root production and activity in the distant rows could also contribute to the less grain yield loss 4 conclusions increasing the number of rows from four of the current wheat drip irrigation system to five and six served by individual drip tubes reduced the usage of drip tubes but caused less grain yield reduction which was mainly ascribed to the yield reduction of the rows distant from the drip tube especially the most distant row of r3 however the grain yield reduction was much less than the decrease of water received in the distant rows this could be explained by the less depression on dry matter accumulation and lai and enhanced redistribution of the temporally stored dry matter in vegetative organs to grains the present experiment provided potential approaches to the use of less drip tubes by extending the lateral spacing in combination with other practices such as modifying the irrigation strategy the row space which requires further investigation acknowledgments we appreciate the kind revision of english language by prof feirong gu from

11262,agricultural nitrogen n and phosphorus p emissions to water bodies remain largely unknown in china mainly due to the lack of reliable data sources and quantification tools in this study we constructed a grid based nufer nutrient flow in food chains environment and resources use model in order to quantify a high resolution agricultural n and p emissions to water bodies in haihe basin in 2012 based on data collected from county level statistics farm interview and spatial data of topography climate soil texture and land use we also explored the mitigation strategies in 2030 via scenario analysis the results showed that total agricultural n emission to water bodies in haihe basin was 1079 gg n in 2012 of which cropland contributed 54 total agricultural p emission to water bodies was 208 gg p livestock contributed 78 there were large spatial variations in agricultural n and p emissions overall the plain areas accounted for around 80 of the total agricultural n and p emissions to water in 2012 the highest n and p emission intensities were 10 t n km 2 and 2 t p km 2 respectively n and p emissions were significantly related to anthropogenic factors such as the livestock density and cropland in the plain areas whereas in mountainous areas both anthropogenic and natural factors e g slope deviation and soil texture significantly affected n and p emissions our scenario analysis suggests that agricultural n and p emissions can be reduced by up to 45 and 77 respectively for n and p in 2030 via improved agricultural and environmental policies technologies and managements the prohibition of direct animal manure discharge to the water system seems to be the most effective measure to mitigate the emissions our study provided a high resolution agricultural n and p emissions to the water bodies of haihe basin and identified the most effective options to reduce these emissions in highly intensified agricultural areas keywords crop livestock system nitrogen phosphorus water pollution nufer haihe basin 1 introduction crop and livestock production has been intensified in china over the last decades however the nitrogen n and phosphorus p use efficiencies were relatively low due to sub optimal management bai et al 2013 2014 ma et al 2013 excessive n and p losses from agriculture have caused a series of environmental pollutions in china such as pm2 5 pollution wu et al 2016 enhanced n deposition liu et al 2013 groundwater quality degradation xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 and surface water eutrophication le et al 2010 strokal et al 2016 haihe basin hb the most intensive agricultural production base in the northern china is facing serious air and water problems for instance annual mean pm2 5 concentration in 2012 has reached 60 mg m3 zhao

drinking water 50 mg l set by who and the eu zheng et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the eutrophication and algal blooms often occurred in the surface waters zhang et al 2015 rong et al 2016 in 2014 the surface water quality of nearly 50 of the monitored areas was graded as v or worse i e the water can only be used for agricultural and other general purposes such as irrigating crops trees and flowers in the cities according to the surface water environmental quality standard gb 3838 2002 mep 2014 intensive cropping systems and inefficient flood irrigation zhang et al 2003a further exacerbated the water pollution in this region as yet high resolution agricultural n and p emissions to the water system of the hb are not available which limit the exploration of efficient and effective mitigation options a quantitative understanding of agricultural nutrient emissions and their sources is key to mitigating emissions to water bodies many studies have attempted to address this issue via model simulations for example swat the soil and water assessment tool and annagnps annualized agricultural non point source pollution model are the two popular models simulating watershed outputs from nonpoint and point nutrient sources baginska et al 2003 grizzetti et al 2003 however these models require large amount of detailed information which constrains their application global news 2 nutrient export from watersheds mayorga et al 2010 a basin scale model that requires fewer parameters can be used to estimate n and p exports to rivers and seas worldwide while the low spatial resolution and lack of current parameters limit its application recently the nufer model was used to quantify n and p losses from food chain to water bodies for china at national and provincial levels ma et al 2010 bai et al 2016 as yet agricultural n and p emissions to water bodies of the hb and their spatial patterns have not been systematically quantified especially not in high resolution the driving force of these spatial variations in the emissions has not been investigated the lack of quantitative understanding limits the exploration of mitigation options and potentials hence the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the n and p emissions from crop and livestock production systems to water system in the hb using the developed grid based nufer model 2 to identify the driving factors for the spatial variations of n and p emissions and 3 to explore effective mitigation options for reducing agricultural n and p emissions via the scenario analysis 2 material and methods the haihe basin is located in the northern china it encompasses the two municipalities beijing and tianjin most of hebei province the eastern part of shanxi province the northern parts of henan and shandong provinces and small parts of inner mongolia and liaoning province fig s1 in the supplementary information si it covers more than 300 counties and is generally divided into fifteen sub basins seen fig 3 the total area of the hb is 3 2 105 km2 feeding 11 of the national population and contributing 14 of china s total gross domestic production gdp in 2012 the hb is an important base for agricultural production it provided 10 of grain yield 20 of milk 10 of meat and 21 of eggs in china in 2012 according to the statistical yearbooks of individual provinces or some prefectures we did not include the contributions of small parts from inner mongolia and liaoning province because their contributions to the agricultural production were marginal compared to the other major parts of the hb agricultural n and p emissions to water include emissions from cropland and livestock farms mainly via surface runoff erosion and leaching or direct manure discharge to quantify the n and p emissions to water we constructed a grid based nufer model based on ma et al 2010 and bai et al 2016 the main improvements in the grid based nufer model were following 1 the model considered detailed chemical fertilizer types urea ammonium bicarbonate ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate diammonium phosphate compound fertilizer and other fertilization methods basal and top dressing and livestock manure management systems liquid and solid subsystems for dairy cattle beef cattle and pig farms based on a comprehensive farm interview covering 400 individual farms in 11 typical counties in the hb zhao et al 2017b 2

activity data were derived from a variety of local statistical yearbooks these activity data included population rural income the cultivated area the sown area of each crop animal numbers agricultural inputs such as the amount of chemical fertilizer application and crop and livestock products the parameters such as the n and p contents of chemical fertilizers and products the application rate of each crop specific chemical fertilizer and livestock manure management were acquired from published literature governmental statistical yearbooks and face to face interviews the spatial data of topography soil texture and land use were provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn fig s2 spatial interpolation methods applied by resdc were used to estimate the spatial distribution of annual mean temperature and annual precipitation fig s2 2 3 driving forces analysis the agricultural production was mainly driven by anthropogenic factors which was also affected by natural factors in topography complication areas based on the available data for counties a range of parameters including annual precipitation annual mean temperature elevation slope soil texture and rural income were examined for their quantitative relationships with n and p emissions to water at the whole basin level we further explored the natural slope and soil texture and anthropogenic driving factors planting structure and livestock density meaning the ratio of livestock unit and arable land area in hill and plain areas respectively many models could be used to quantify the importance of driving forces for example linear and nonlinear models univariate and multivariate regression models and so on a univariate linear regression model was used to do the analysis gu et al 2013 significant levels were set at p 0 05 the regression and statistical analysis was conducted using spss statistical package for the social science statistical software v19 0 2 4 scenarios six scenarios namely business as usual bau consuming and wasting less cwl importing more food imf producing more and better pmb pmb cwl and pmb cwl imf used by zhao et al 2017a were applied to estimate possible impacts of population human diet food import and agricultural production technique and management changes between 2012 and 2030 on the agricultural production and agricultural n and p emissions to water bodies in the hb region the detailed information of these scenarios could be seen in table s5 future changes in population human diet and agricultural production technique and management related to the six scenarios were shown below 1 projected population growth rate for the whole of china by united nations 2015 was used in the hb 2 the recommendations of the chinese dietary guidelines 2007 will be fully adopted driven by the rapid increase of income especially in rural areas and human health awareness growth 3 the adoption of integrated soil crop system management issm technology chen et al 2014 was benefit to raising crop productivity without fertilizer application increase 4 livestock feeding management was expected to be improved and therefore increase livestock productivity 5 livestock manure management in animal housing manure storage treatment and application stages would be improved which contributes to the reduction of manure losses and synthetic fertilizer application 3 results 3 1 agricultural n and p emissions in the haihe basin in 2012 total agricultural n emission to water courses in the hb was estimated at 1079 gg n yr 1 in 2012 of which 54 was from cropland and 46 came from livestock farms fig 2 a nitrate no3 leaching from cropland was the largest source of n emission 45 followed by direct discharge of livestock manure to surface waters 37 the pig and dairy farms as two large sources contributed 34 and 19 to the total manure n discharge respectively fig s3 the estimated total agricultural p emission to water system was 208 gg p yr 1 in 2012 78 of which were from direct discharge of livestock manure fig 2b the pig production was the largest source of manure p discharge 34 followed by laying poultry production 22 fig s3 p losses from cropland were mainly via the soil erosion runoff fig 2b there were large spatial heterogeneities in agricultural n and p emissions figs 3 and 4 the plain areas contributed 76 of the total agricultural n emission of which one half was from the cropland and another half from livestock farms the highest intensity of n emission occurred in the regions where livestock farms were concentrated at sub basin scale the highest average emission intensity was 10 t n km 2 and the largest amount of n emission accounted for 21 of the total agricultural n emission fig 5 a the spatial pattern of agricultural p emission figs 4 and 5b was similar to that of n emission the highest average emission intensity was 2 t p km 2 fig 5b direct discharge of livestock manure was the dominant source contributing more than 73 of the agricultural p emission for each sub basin fig 5 the spatial overlay analysis of agricultural n and p emissions shows that high n and p emissions mainly occurred in the piedmont of taihang mountain and the south area of the hb other high emission zones were dominated by n emission fig 6 the prominent problem faced by the other plain areas was the high n emission 3 2 driving forces of agricultural n and p emissions the statistical analysis at county level shows that the spatial variations of n and p emissions in the whole basin were significantly related to natural and socioeconomic factors the relationships between the n p emission to water and the elevation and deviation of the slope were significantly negative while positive relationships were found between the emissions and share of loam soil and rural income fig 7 this indicated that high n and p emission densities mainly occurred in loam soil of the plain areas in the plain areas the spatial variations of n and p emissions were mainly affected by anthropogenic factors including the livestock density and the proportion of wheat and vegetable area whereas in the mountainous areas both anthropogenic and natural factors played significant roles figs 8 and 9 for the spatial variation of n emission laying poultry and beef cattle productions were the most significant factors in the hb while the deviation of the slopes had also significant impact on the spatial variation of n emission in the hill regions fig 8 the anthropogenic factors of p emission were similar to those of n emission in the plain and hill regions while the significant natural factor of p emission was the proportion of loam soil fig 9 3 3 agricultural n and p emissions in 2030 under the different scenarios in general agricultural n and p emissions in the hb would increase during 2012 2030 with the human population growth and rural diet shift to more livestock products however there would also be a large potential of n and p emissions reduction if the technology and management measures were improved especially livestock manure direct discharge was prohibited fig 2 under the bau scenario the agricultural n emission in the hb would increase by 33 in 2030 relative to 2012 fig 2 livestock production subsystem n emission from which would increase by 63 would be the dominant source of n emission in 2030 agricultural p emission to water would increase by 58 fig 2 the increase of food imports imf scenario and human diet optimization in parallel with the reduction of food waste cwl scenario would benefit to the reduction of n and p emissions compared to bau scenario however n and p emissions in 2030 under these scenarios would be still slightly higher than those in 2012 fig 2 improvements in technology and management measures pmb scenario could reduce the agricultural n and p emissions by 45 and 77 in 2030 relative to 2012 respectively the prohibition of livestock manure direct discharge would contribute the largest reduction of n and p emissions the combination of different strategies could further reduce the agricultural n and p emissions fig 2 for instance the average n and p emission densities in all sub basins in 2030 under the pmb cwl scenario would be lower than 3 t n km 2 and 1 t p km 2 than those in 2012 respectively fig 5c d 4 discussion this study quantified the agricultural n and p emissions to the water system of the hb from 2012 to 2030 in high resolution explored their driving forces and further assessed mitigation options and potentials in 2012 n leaching in cropland and direct discharge of livestock manure n were the main pathways of agricultural n emission whereas direct discharge of livestock manure was the dominant source of agricultural p emission technology and management measures pmb scenario improvement especially complete prohibition of direct livestock manure discharge would be the key measures to mitigate the agricultural n and p emissions to the water system 4 1 uncertainty of the results our results showed that crop and livestock production contributed almost equally to n emission whereas for p emission livestock production was the largest source which was in line with the results of zhu 2011 however the shares of crop production subsystem for n emission and of livestock production subsystem for p emission were all higher than those estimated by zhu 2011 this might be explained by the differences in parameters and in agricultural structure between 2007 and 2012 our parameters were collected from published literature or face to face farm interviews and were determined based on detailed information on fertilization and livestock manure management such as fertilizer types fertilization patterns soil properties manure systems liquid and solid and their parameters on direct manure discharge for the crop production system the amount of n leaching the main pathway of n losses accounted for 9 1 of the total n inputs this proportion was higher than that 5 5 estimated by zhu 2011 similar to the result 8 9 of the farmland at the piedmont of taihang zhang et al 2003b while a little lower than those estimated by li et al 2012 10 6 and xu et al 2013 12 6 18 2 our estimation of n erosion runoff accounted for 1 8 of the total n inputs which was similar to that estimated by zhu 2011 1 5 these confirm that our estimation is reasonable for the livestock production system we estimated that the direct discharge of manure accounted for 33 of the total n excretion and 43 of p excretion in the hb in 2012 the results were higher than that 21 for n 6 for p in 2007 estimated by zhu 2011 while slightly higher than the averages 28 for n 39 for p in china in 2010 reported by bai et al 2016 there are several possible reasons first we updated the parameters of livestock manure direct discharge based on the data of farm interview in the north china plain zhao et al 2017b which produced more accurate estimations second the hb is one of the regions with the most intensive livestock production in china and the manure management is not yet optimal compared to the other regions there are inevitable uncertainties in our results due to the variations of the parameters used e g nutrient contents of crop products and emission factors the uncertainties of statistical data and the spatial variations of crop and livestock production the variations of n and p contents in crop products were not well known due to the diversity of variety and management limited number of farm surveyed may lead to bias in the n and p excretion rates and livestock manure direct discharge rates bai et al 2016 zhao et al 2017b we estimated the amount of each crop specific chemical fertilizer application based on the total amount of chemical fertilizer application and the ratios of crop specific chemical fertilizer application rates further survey experiment and model simulation at farm and field scales might help to make more confirm conclusions 4 2 driving forces of agricultural water pollution considering the complex topography and soil conditions in the hb positive relationship between agricultural nutrient emissions and rural income was also affected by natural factors such as slope soil texture and so on fig 7 agricultural n and p emissions were negatively related to elevation and the deviation of slope while positively related to share of loam soil topographic and soil conditions lead to more intensive crop production in the plain areas than the hill areas in order to pursue economic interest excessive n and p fertilizer inputs were common in the north china plain zhu and chen 2002 vitousek et al 2009 for the plain areas n and p emissions were positively related to the proportion of wheat and vegetable area and livestock densities winter wheat summer maize rotation and vegetable were the dominant cropping systems n and p fertilizer rates in winter wheat system were all higher than maize system cui et al 2010 ma et al 2011 n and p inputs from manures and fertilizers in vegetable system were exceptionally high zhu and chen 2002 yan et al 2013 meanwhile livestock manure management was not improved with the rapid expand of livestock production especially industrialized animal production bai et al 2017 large amount of manure was directly discharged to the surface water and contributed to the high n and p emissions 4 3 water pollution risk from agricultural n and p emissions the agricultural n leaching would pose side effects on the groundwater quality in the hb the estimated average n leaching intensity of crop livestock system 3 4 t n km 2 yr 1 in the hb in 2012 was 2 folds of that in the eu 27 in 2000 velthof et al 2009 if no measure is applied the agricultural n leaching intensity would become higher in 2030 than that in 2012 the groundwater table is deep in the hb particularly in the piedmont plain li and ding 2012 therefore n might not immediately contaminate the groundwater via leaching however n leached below crop root zone is difficult to be reused again and the denitrification is low wang et al 2017 therefore n leached below crop root zone may finally pollute the groundwater following the vertical flow of irrigation water most of agricultural n and p emissions to surface water bodies in the hb were via direct livestock manure discharge the estimated mean discharge densities of manure n 23 kg ha of agricultural land 1 and p 9 kg ha of agricultural land 1 were all higher in the hb than in 2010 in china 11 kg n ha of agricultural land 1 4 kg p ha of agricultural land 1 bai et al 2016 this partly explains the severity of rive pollution in the hb almost all major rivers in the plain regions in the hb are drying up and becoming ephemeral streams xia and zhang 2008 so discharged manure n and p might be mainly concentrated in rivers of the hb and further pollute groundwater with the infiltration of river waters therefore bohai sea mainly affected by the low plain in the hb if the agricultural production technology and management remain the same as 2012 agricultural nutrient pollution in water bodies of the hb will increase in the coming years this can mainly be attributed to the development of industrial landless livestock farms where the direct manure discharge was the major pathway of n and p losses bai et al 2016 zhao et al 2017b the major driver is the increasing demand for livestock products with the population growth and human diet shift toward more meat consumption 4 4 implications for future nutrient management the results with or without optimization clearly showed that there would be large potential to decrease the n and p losses to the water system in which the improvement of technology and management would play the dominant role fig 2 however full adaptation of issm technology improvement of livestock diet n and p levels and full prohibition of direct discharge of animal manure are the premise in the plain areas of the hb the crop production mainly depends on the flood irrigation by pumping groundwater contributing to nutrient leaching and water resource waste and over fertilization appropriately reducing synthetic fertilizer application would significantly decrease n losses without threatening food security chen et al 2016 therefore our estimate of n leaching reduction is relatively conservative because pmb scenario does not consider water saving irrigation and reducing fertilizer application to cereal crops it still needs great efforts from stakeholder including government researchers and farmers to disseminate the improved measures issm in order to fully realizing the target of pmb scenario more reduction of nutrient losses can be implemented if the infrastructure of water saving irrigation such as sprinkle irrigation is enforced and over fertilization is decreased our results showed that the prohibition of direct manure discharge would greatly reduce n and p losses to surface waters meanwhile replace chemical fertilizer via manure application to crops however livestock production in the hb is intensifying whereas manure management is not improved synchronously meanwhile the separation of crop and livestock production is more often the case the infrastructure and equipment of manure cleaning storage and treatment should be enforced further the transportation facilities should be also improved to facilitate the recycle of manure although the scenarios revealed a large potential of agricultural n and p losses reduction the spatial variations of agricultural n and p losses to the water system were not considered spatially specific scenario analysis may provide better insights to the crop livestock system optimization in the hb 5 conclusion we further improved and constructed a grid based nufer model which allows the quantification of agricultural n and p emissions to the water bodies of the haihe basin in high resolution the relationships between emissions and human activities and natural factors were analyzed overall agricultural n and p emissions to the water system were estimated as 1079 gg n yr 1 and 208 gg p yr 1 in 2012 in the haihe basin respectively the emissions have large spatial variations between plain and mountainous areas high n and p emission intensities mainly occurred in the plain areas and the emissions were mainly related to anthropogenic factors while in the mountainous areas both anthropogenic and natural factors contributed to the spatial variations of n and p emissions the results of scenario analysis suggest that there are large potentials to reduce n and p emissions to the water system in the future importantly both human activities and natural factors must be considered when disseminating and applying the new knowledge the results of our study provide a guidance for optimizing nutrient and water management in the

11262,agricultural nitrogen n and phosphorus p emissions to water bodies remain largely unknown in china mainly due to the lack of reliable data sources and quantification tools in this study we constructed a grid based nufer nutrient flow in food chains environment and resources use model in order to quantify a high resolution agricultural n and p emissions to water bodies in haihe basin in 2012 based on data collected from county level statistics farm interview and spatial data of topography climate soil texture and land use we also explored the mitigation strategies in 2030 via scenario analysis the results showed that total agricultural n emission to water bodies in haihe basin was 1079 gg n in 2012 of which cropland contributed 54 total agricultural p emission to water bodies was 208 gg p livestock contributed 78 there were large spatial variations in agricultural n and p emissions overall the plain areas accounted for around 80 of the total agricultural n and p emissions to water in 2012 the highest n and p emission intensities were 10 t n km 2 and 2 t p km 2 respectively n and p emissions were significantly related to anthropogenic factors such as the livestock density and cropland in the plain areas whereas in mountainous areas both anthropogenic and natural factors e g slope deviation and soil texture significantly affected n and p emissions our scenario analysis suggests that agricultural n and p emissions can be reduced by up to 45 and 77 respectively for n and p in 2030 via improved agricultural and environmental policies technologies and managements the prohibition of direct animal manure discharge to the water system seems to be the most effective measure to mitigate the emissions our study provided a high resolution agricultural n and p emissions to the water bodies of haihe basin and identified the most effective options to reduce these emissions in highly intensified agricultural areas keywords crop livestock system nitrogen phosphorus water pollution nufer haihe basin 1 introduction crop and livestock production has been intensified in china over the last decades however the nitrogen n and phosphorus p use efficiencies were relatively low due to sub optimal management bai et al 2013 2014 ma et al 2013 excessive n and p losses from agriculture have caused a series of environmental pollutions in china such as pm2 5 pollution wu et al 2016 enhanced n deposition liu et al 2013 groundwater quality degradation xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 and surface water eutrophication le et al 2010 strokal et al 2016 haihe basin hb the most intensive agricultural production base in the northern china is facing serious air and water problems for instance annual mean pm2 5 concentration in 2012 has reached 60 mg m3 zhao et al 2017a which imposes serious risks to the human health the monitored groundwater nitrate n concentration reached 113 mg l zhang et al 2004 significantly higher than the limit for nitrate in drinking water 50 mg l set by who and the eu zheng et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the eutrophication and algal blooms often occurred in the surface waters zhang et al 2015 rong et al 2016 in 2014 the surface water quality of nearly 50 of the monitored areas was graded as v or worse i e the water can only be used for agricultural and other general purposes such as irrigating crops trees and flowers in the cities according to the surface water environmental quality standard gb 3838 2002 mep 2014 intensive cropping systems and inefficient flood irrigation zhang et al 2003a further exacerbated the water pollution in this region as yet high resolution agricultural n and p emissions to the water system of the hb are not available which limit the exploration of efficient and effective mitigation options a quantitative understanding of agricultural nutrient emissions and their sources is key to mitigating emissions to water bodies many studies have attempted to address this issue via model simulations for example swat the soil and water assessment tool and annagnps annualized agricultural non point source pollution model are the two popular models simulating watershed outputs from nonpoint and point nutrient sources baginska et al 2003 grizzetti et al 2003 however these models require large amount of detailed information which constrains their application global news 2 nutrient export from watersheds mayorga et al 2010 a basin scale model that requires fewer parameters can be used to estimate n and p exports to rivers and seas worldwide while the low spatial resolution and lack of current parameters limit its application recently the nufer model was used to quantify n and p losses from food chain to water bodies for china at national and provincial levels ma et al 2010 bai et al 2016 as yet agricultural n and p emissions to water bodies of the hb and their spatial patterns have not been systematically quantified especially not in high resolution the driving force of these spatial variations in the emissions has not been investigated the lack of quantitative understanding limits the exploration of mitigation options and potentials hence the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the n and p emissions from crop and livestock production systems to water system in the hb using the developed grid based nufer model 2 to identify the driving factors for the spatial variations of n and p emissions and 3 to explore effective mitigation options for reducing agricultural n and p emissions via the scenario analysis 2 material and methods the haihe basin is located in the northern china it encompasses the two municipalities beijing and tianjin most of hebei province the eastern part of shanxi province the northern parts of henan and shandong provinces and small parts of inner mongolia and liaoning province fig s1 in the supplementary information si it covers more than 300 counties and is generally divided into fifteen sub basins seen fig 3 the total area of the hb is 3 2 105 km2 feeding 11 of the national population and contributing 14 of china s total gross domestic production gdp in 2012 the hb is an important base for agricultural production it provided 10 of grain yield 20 of milk 10 of meat and 21 of eggs in china in 2012 according to the statistical yearbooks of individual provinces or some prefectures we did not include the contributions of small parts from inner mongolia and liaoning province because their contributions to the agricultural production were marginal compared to the other major parts of the hb agricultural n and p emissions to water include emissions from cropland and livestock farms mainly via surface runoff erosion and leaching or direct manure discharge to quantify the n and p emissions to water we constructed a grid based nufer model based on ma et al 2010 and bai et al 2016 the main improvements in the grid based nufer model were following 1 the model considered detailed chemical fertilizer types urea ammonium bicarbonate ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate diammonium phosphate compound fertilizer and other fertilization methods basal and top dressing and livestock manure management systems liquid and solid subsystems for dairy cattle beef cattle and pig farms based on a comprehensive farm interview covering 400 individual farms in 11 typical counties in the hb zhao et al 2017b 2

estimated at 1079 gg n yr 1 in 2012 of which 54 was from cropland and 46 came from livestock farms fig 2 a nitrate no3 leaching from cropland was the largest source of n emission 45 followed by direct discharge of livestock manure to surface waters 37 the pig and dairy farms as two large sources contributed 34 and 19 to the total manure n discharge respectively fig s3 the estimated total agricultural p emission to water system was 208 gg p yr 1 in 2012 78 of which were from direct discharge of livestock manure fig 2b the pig production was the largest source of manure p discharge 34 followed by laying poultry production 22 fig s3 p losses from cropland were mainly via the soil erosion runoff fig 2b there were large spatial heterogeneities in agricultural n and p emissions figs 3 and 4 the plain areas contributed 76 of the total agricultural n emission of which one half was from the cropland and another half from livestock farms the highest intensity of n emission occurred in the regions where livestock farms were concentrated at sub basin scale the highest average emission intensity was 10 t n km 2 and the largest amount of n emission accounted for 21 of the total agricultural n emission fig 5 a the spatial pattern of agricultural p emission figs 4 and 5b was similar to that of n emission the highest average emission intensity was 2 t p km 2 fig 5b direct discharge of livestock manure was the dominant source contributing more than 73 of the agricultural p emission for each sub basin fig 5 the spatial overlay analysis of agricultural n and p emissions shows that high n and p emissions mainly occurred in the piedmont of taihang mountain and the south area of the hb other high emission zones were dominated by n emission fig 6 the prominent problem faced by the other plain areas was the high n emission 3 2 driving forces of agricultural n and p emissions the statistical analysis at county level shows that the spatial variations of n and p emissions in the whole basin were significantly related to natural and socioeconomic factors the relationships between the n p emission to water and the elevation and deviation of the slope were significantly negative while positive relationships were found between the emissions and share of loam soil and rural income fig 7 this indicated that high n and p emission densities mainly occurred in loam soil of the plain areas in the plain areas the spatial variations of n and p emissions were mainly affected by anthropogenic factors including the livestock density and the proportion of wheat and vegetable area whereas in the mountainous areas both anthropogenic and natural factors played significant roles figs 8 and 9 for the spatial variation of n emission laying poultry and beef cattle productions were the most significant factors in the hb while the deviation of the slopes had also significant impact on the spatial variation of n emission in the hill regions fig 8 the anthropogenic factors of p emission were similar to those of n emission in the plain and hill regions while the significant natural factor of p emission was the proportion of loam soil fig 9 3 3 agricultural n and p emissions in 2030 under the different scenarios in general agricultural n and p emissions in the hb would increase during 2012 2030 with the human population growth and rural diet shift to more livestock products however there would also be a large potential of n and p emissions reduction if the technology and management measures were improved especially livestock manure direct discharge was prohibited fig 2 under the bau scenario the agricultural n emission in the hb would increase by 33 in 2030 relative to 2012 fig 2 livestock production subsystem n emission from which would increase by

higher than those in 2012 fig 2 improvements in technology and management measures pmb scenario could reduce the agricultural n and p emissions by 45 and 77 in 2030 relative to 2012 respectively the prohibition of livestock manure direct discharge would contribute the largest reduction of n and p emissions the combination of different strategies could further reduce the agricultural n and p emissions fig 2 for instance the average n and p emission densities in all sub basins in 2030 under the pmb cwl scenario would be lower than 3 t n km 2 and 1 t p km 2 than those in 2012 respectively fig 5c d 4 discussion this study quantified the agricultural n and p emissions to the water system of the hb from 2012 to 2030 in high resolution explored their driving forces and further assessed mitigation options and potentials in 2012 n leaching in cropland and direct discharge of livestock manure n were the main pathways of agricultural n emission whereas direct discharge of livestock manure was the dominant source of agricultural p emission technology and management measures pmb scenario improvement especially complete prohibition of direct livestock manure discharge would be the key measures to mitigate the agricultural n and p emissions to the water system 4 1 uncertainty of the results our results showed that crop and livestock production contributed almost equally to n emission whereas for p emission livestock production was the largest source which was in line with the results of zhu 2011 however the shares of crop production subsystem for n emission and of livestock production subsystem for p emission were all higher than those estimated by zhu 2011 this might be explained by the differences in parameters and in agricultural structure between 2007 and 2012 our parameters were collected from published literature or face to face farm interviews and were determined based on detailed information on fertilization and livestock manure management such as fertilizer types fertilization patterns soil properties manure systems liquid and solid and their parameters on direct manure discharge for the crop production system the amount of n leaching the main pathway of n losses accounted for 9 1 of the total n inputs this proportion was higher than that 5 5 estimated by zhu 2011 similar to the result 8 9 of the farmland at the piedmont of taihang zhang et al 2003b while a little lower than those estimated by li et al 2012 10 6 and xu et al 2013 12 6 18 2 our estimation of n erosion runoff accounted for 1 8 of the total n inputs which was similar to that estimated by zhu 2011 1 5 these confirm that our estimation is reasonable for the livestock production system we estimated that the direct discharge of manure accounted for 33 of the total n excretion and 43 of p excretion in the hb in 2012 the results were higher than that 21 for n 6 for p in 2007 estimated by zhu 2011 while slightly higher than the averages 28 for n 39 for p in china in 2010 reported by bai et al 2016 there are several possible reasons first we updated the parameters of livestock manure direct discharge based on the data of farm interview in the north china plain zhao et al 2017b which produced more accurate estimations second the hb is one of the regions with the most intensive livestock production in china and the manure management is not yet optimal compared to the other regions there are inevitable uncertainties in our results due to the variations of the parameters used e g nutrient contents of crop products and emission factors the uncertainties of statistical data and the spatial variations of crop and livestock production the variations of n and p contents in crop products were not well known due to the diversity of variety and management limited number of farm surveyed may lead to bias in the n and p excretion rates and livestock manure direct discharge rates bai et al 2016 zhao et al 2017b we estimated the amount of each crop specific chemical fertilizer application based on the total amount of chemical fertilizer application and the ratios of crop specific chemical fertilizer application rates further survey experiment and model simulation at farm and field scales might help to make more confirm conclusions 4 2 driving forces of agricultural water pollution considering the complex topography and soil conditions in the hb positive relationship between agricultural nutrient emissions and rural income was also affected by natural factors such as slope soil texture and so on fig 7 agricultural n and p emissions were negatively related to elevation and the deviation of slope while positively related to share of loam soil topographic and soil conditions lead to more intensive crop production in the plain areas than the hill areas in order to pursue economic interest excessive n and p fertilizer inputs were common in the north china plain zhu and chen 2002 vitousek et al 2009 for the plain areas n and p emissions were positively related to the proportion of wheat and vegetable area and livestock densities winter wheat summer maize rotation and vegetable were the dominant cropping systems n and p fertilizer rates in winter wheat system were all higher than maize system cui et al 2010 ma et al 2011 n and p inputs from manures and fertilizers in vegetable system were exceptionally high zhu and chen 2002 yan et al 2013 meanwhile livestock manure management was not improved with the rapid expand of livestock production especially industrialized animal production bai et al 2017 large amount of manure was directly discharged to the surface water and contributed to the high n and p emissions 4 3 water pollution risk from agricultural n and p emissions the agricultural n leaching would pose side effects on the groundwater quality in the hb the estimated average n leaching intensity of crop livestock system 3 4 t n km 2 yr 1 in the hb in 2012 was 2 folds of that in the eu 27 in 2000 velthof et al 2009 if no measure is applied the agricultural n leaching intensity would become higher in 2030 than that in 2012 the groundwater table is deep in the hb particularly in the piedmont plain li and ding 2012 therefore n might not immediately contaminate the groundwater via leaching however n leached below crop root zone is difficult to be reused again and the denitrification is low wang et al 2017 therefore n leached below crop root zone may finally pollute the groundwater following the vertical flow of irrigation water most of agricultural n and p emissions to surface water bodies in the hb were via direct livestock manure discharge the estimated mean discharge densities of manure n 23 kg ha of agricultural land 1 and p 9 kg ha of agricultural land 1 were all higher in the hb than in 2010 in china 11 kg n ha of agricultural land 1 4 kg p ha of agricultural land 1 bai et al 2016 this partly explains the severity of rive pollution in the hb almost all major rivers in the plain regions in the hb are drying up and becoming ephemeral streams xia and zhang 2008 so discharged manure n and p might be mainly concentrated in rivers of the hb and further pollute groundwater with the infiltration of river waters therefore bohai sea mainly affected by the low plain in the hb if the agricultural production technology and management remain the same as 2012 agricultural nutrient pollution in water bodies of the hb will increase in the coming years this can mainly be attributed to the development of industrial landless livestock farms where the direct manure discharge was the major pathway of n and p losses bai et al 2016 zhao et al 2017b the major driver is the increasing demand for livestock products with the population growth and human diet shift toward more meat consumption 4 4 implications for future nutrient management the results with or without optimization clearly showed that there would be large potential to decrease the n and p losses to the water system in which the improvement of technology and management would play the dominant role fig 2 however full adaptation of issm technology improvement of livestock diet n and p levels and full prohibition of direct discharge of animal manure are the premise in the plain areas of the hb the crop production mainly depends on the flood irrigation by pumping groundwater contributing to nutrient leaching and water resource waste and over fertilization appropriately reducing synthetic fertilizer application would significantly decrease n losses without threatening food security chen et al 2016 therefore our estimate of n leaching reduction is relatively conservative because pmb scenario does not consider water saving irrigation and reducing fertilizer application to cereal crops it still needs great efforts from stakeholder including government researchers and farmers to disseminate the improved measures issm in order to fully realizing the target of pmb scenario more reduction of nutrient losses can be implemented if the infrastructure of water saving irrigation such as sprinkle irrigation is enforced and over fertilization is decreased our results showed that the prohibition of direct manure discharge would greatly reduce n and p losses to surface waters meanwhile replace chemical fertilizer via manure application to crops however livestock production in the hb is intensifying whereas manure management is not improved synchronously meanwhile the separation of crop and livestock production is more often the case the infrastructure and equipment of manure cleaning storage and treatment should be enforced further the transportation facilities should be also improved to facilitate the recycle of manure although the scenarios revealed a large potential of agricultural n and p losses reduction the spatial variations of agricultural n and p losses to the water system were not considered spatially specific scenario analysis may provide better insights to the crop livestock system optimization in the hb 5 conclusion we further improved and constructed a grid based nufer model which allows the quantification of agricultural n and p emissions to the water bodies of the haihe basin in high resolution the relationships between emissions and human activities and natural factors were analyzed overall agricultural n and p emissions to the water system were estimated as 1079 gg n yr 1 and 208 gg p yr 1 in 2012 in the haihe basin respectively the emissions have large spatial variations between plain and mountainous areas high n and p emission intensities mainly occurred in the plain areas and the emissions were mainly related to anthropogenic factors while in the mountainous areas both anthropogenic and natural factors contributed to the spatial variations of n and p emissions the results of scenario analysis suggest that there are large potentials to reduce n and p emissions to the water system in the future importantly both human activities and natural factors must be considered when disseminating and applying the new knowledge the results of our study provide a guidance for optimizing nutrient and water management in the

11263,chinese intensive greenhouse vegetable systems are characterized by high input of water and nutrients which are not sustainable there is an urgent need to explore smart and practical strategies to convert the high input low output systems to optimal input output ones this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different catch crops on reducing nitrate leaching in the vegetable greenhouse during the summer fallow season a two year field experiment with three catch crops i e sweet corn sc amaranth a and sweet sorghum sg and no catch crop ck were conducted in vegetable greenhouse in dingzhou city hebei province china the measured soil water content and inorganic nitrogen n content in soil profile biomass and crop n uptake were used to validate the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model soil water movement and nitrate leaching were simulated the results showed that the catch crops decreased the water drainage by 18 2 29 0 and nitrate leaching by 23 3 42 3 respectively compared with ck the water drainage reduction ranked as sc sg a while the nitrate leaching reduction was a sc sg the biomass was sc sg a while the crop n uptake was sc a sg sweet corn could absorb the residual nitrate in the deep soil layers due to the long root system while amaranth could absorb most residual nitrate in the surface soil amaranth showed greater n uptake capacity than sweet corn and the nitrate was mainly accumulated in the surface soil planting amaranth as summer catch crop reduced nitrate leaching in the vegetable greenhouses our study provides a guideline for selecting effective catch crops in intensive vegetable greenhouses in north china keywords greenhouse vegetable field catch crop nitrate leaching n uptake soil crop system model 1 introduction the greenhouse vegetable cultivation has developed rapidly in china because of its whole year production and high income in the past 30 years the vegetable acreage of china has increased from 3 3 million ha in 1978 to 22 million ha in 2015 national bureau of statistics of china 2016 however these high input low output systems were not sustainable due to large nutrient loss especially nitrogen n loss and contamination of groundwater li et al 2013a investigated 13 intensive agricultural areas in the peri urban areas of beijing and found that groundwater was contaminated by nitrate i e about 26 of study areas exceeded the standard for drinking water quality nitrate content 10 mg n l 1 zhang et al 2010 investigated intensive agricultural areas in shandong province north china and reported that the nitrate content of shallow groundwater under the vegetable greenhouses reached to 25 3 279 6 mg l 1 the average content is 121 6 mg l 1 and 87 of the samples exceeded the standards for drinking water quality pang et al 2013 found that the groundwater pollution under the vegetable fields was more severe than the cropland in the north china plain ncp the average of nitrate content is 86 8 mg l 1 and even reached up to 258 0 mg l 1 in some areas which seriously threats to the human health overuse of the fertilizer especially the n fertilizers were mainly reported in intensive production systems fertilizer n input in vegetable field is about seven times more than that in cropland ju et al 2007 fertilizer n inputs in some greenhouses even reached 1000 kg n ha 1 song et al 2009 min et al 2011b sun et al 2012 2013 due to shallow root of vegetables the excessive fertilizer n inputs had led to the low n use efficiency and large n accumulation in soil or loss to the environment zhou et al 2016 reported that the amounts of residual n in greenhouse reached 1269 114 kg n ha 1 hence there is a greater potential risk of n leaching from a greenhouse system than that of cropland in china and an urgent need to explore strategies to convert such high input low output systems to optimal input output ones in ncp the summer season is from june to september characterized with high temperature and large amounts of precipitation 70 of annual precipitation occurs in the summer the temperature may reach 50 c in the greenhouse which is not optimal for vegetable growth in such cases farmers often open the roof and spare the land as fallow in the summer given large amounts of residual nitrate in the soil profile after harvest high temperature also enhances the mineralization of organic n in the soil accelerating the accumulation of the inorganic n in the soil profile trindade et al 2001 when heavy rainfall occurs the nitrate was prone to leaching out of soil profile and caused the groundwater nitrate contamination li et al 2007 so the summer season is the main period for nitrate leaching in ncp it is necessary to explore effective measures to reduce soil nitrate leaching in the greenhouse during the summer fallow season many studies reported that the catch crops could effectively reduce the water drainage and nitrate leaching for example plaza bonilla et al 2015 evaluated the effects of different leguminous catch crops on water drainage through a three year crop rotation experiments in france it found that leguminous catch crops could reduce the water drainage from an annual average of 737 mm to 544 mm sapkota et al 2012 reported that fodder radish decreased n leaching by 79 compared with the fallow treatment constantin et al 2012 assessed the long term effects of catch crops mustard and ryegrass on n dynamics in arable farming and found that catch crops reduced n leaching by 33 55 hansen et al 2015 pointed out the fodder radish as the catch crop could effectively reduce the nitrate leaching from 44 kg n ha 1 in the fallow treatment to 5 kg n ha 1 in denmark guo et al 2018 found sweet corn as summer catch crop significantly reduces n leaching by 12 6 compared to the fallow treatment in protected vegetable production systems in north china some studies also found sweet corn could decrease the nitrate leaching by about 30 4 compared with the fallow treatment in the tai lake region min et al 2011a lu et al 2013 wortman 2016 reported that cover crops reduced potential n loss by 26 compared to weedy fallow carey et al 2017 found the oats as catch crop could decrease the n leaching by 25 compared with the ryegrass using a lysimeter method in new zealand wang et al 2011 compared the effects of four kinds of catch crops on reducing n leaching based on pot experiment in lanzhou city and found that the waxy corn pea amaranth and oat could reduce n leaching rate by 100 96 82 and 58 respectively compared with the ck treatment the processes of soil n transformation are very complicated weather and soil properties can affect the crop uptake of water and n the traditional field experimental method did not consider the effects of various uncertain environmental variables on crop growth and nitrate leaching the simulation model provides a quantitative tool to evaluate the effects of catch crops on the processes of soil water movement and n transport in the last decades many process based models had been used to simulate water consumption n fates and crop growth in agricultural systems jones et al 2003 keating et al 2003 kersebaum et al 2007 however the performance of these models in the chinese context was not satisfactory due to various field management practices in the highly intensive agricultural production systems in north china such as conservation tillage double cropping system high planting density film mulching and intensive water and fertilizer inputs recently liang et al 2016a developed the soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns model and the model had been successfully applied to analyze and evaluate the effects of various field management practices on soil water dynamic fates of n and crop growth in north china li et al 2015a liang et al 2016a 2016b according to the survey ye et al 2010 the average cumulative n amount of 0 100 cm soil profile in greenhouse vegetable field in dingzhou hebei province reached to 815 0 kg n ha 1 which is 12 3 times of the cropland which exists a great potential risk of groundwater pollution by nitrate leaching currently most studies on nitrate leaching were conducted via field experiments few studies combined modeling approach to evaluate the effects of catch crops on nitrate leaching under high soil residual nitrate conditions therefore the objectives of this study were i to calibrate and validate the whcns model using the data of two year experiment with three catch crops in typical vegetable greenhouse in north china ii to evaluate the effects of these catch crops on reducing n leaching and water drainage during the summer fallow season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in south district of dingzhou city hebei province china 38 8 n 115 4 e the soil texture is sandy loam the average altitude is 43 6 m and average annual sunshine time is 2427 4 h it is a typical warm temperate and semi

properties of the soil profile in the greenhouse were shown in table 1 2 2 experiment design and measurements the greenhouse was used to plant cucumbers from january to june every year after the harvest of cucumbers the cover of the greenhouse was removed as common practices the experiment consisted of four treatments no catch crop planted during the fallow season ck and three catch crops treatments i e sweet corn zeamays l sc amaranth amaranthus spp a and sweet sorghum sorghum linn sg the catch crops were planted from june 21 to september 28 in 2008 and from june 28 to october 10 in 2009 respectively the plant densities were 6 7 plants m2 for sc 10 plants m2 for a and sg because of the drought in 2009 the plants were irrigated with 60 mm water before sowing in order to assure seed emergence all other treatments were neither irrigated nor fertilized during the catch crop growth period the area of each plot was 4 m long and 2 m wide with three duplicates and 1 m protection distance was arranged between the treatments a soil profile pit was excavated to 1 m and soil samples of each soil textural layer were collected before catch crops sowing in 2008 soil bulk density saturated water content field capacity wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity for each layer were measured table 1 during the crop growth period soil samples of each plot from 0 to 100 cm at 20 cm intervals in the soil profile were collected every 15 days soil water content was measured by oven drying for at least 24 h at 105 c fresh soil samples were extracted with 0 01 mol l 1 cacl2 to determine the content of no3 n by a continuous flow analyzer traacs 2000 bran and luebbe norderstedt germany when catch crops were harvested sweet corn had fully ripened while sweet sorghum was not fully grown ripened yet amaranth was still growing vigorously five plants were randomly sampled from each plot to measure the dry weight and n content of plant 2 3 whcns model the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model was used to simulate soil water movement n transport and crop growth in this study the model integrates the key processes governing water movement c and n cycles

the vertical scope of microbial activity in soil could be set in the whcns model such as the soil n transformation processes mineralization immobilization nitrification and denitrification is considered within it in such a case the range of soil microbial activity set over the 0 30 cm soil profile the parameters for n transformation draw upon the default values of the daisy model hansen et al 1990 according to the local conditions the maximum nitrification rate was set as v n 50 g m 3 d 1 a half saturation constant for nitrification kn 100 g m 3 an empirical proportionality factor for denitrification kd 1 one order kinetic coefficient for ammonia volatilization kv 0 5 d 1 the initial c n ratio of residues and various organic matter distribution coefficients were given in jensen et al 2005 and liang et al 2016b 2 4 3 crop parameters the basic crop parameters for crop modeling were listed in table 2 the partition coefficients were calibrated to match with measured values of dry matter weight 2 4 4 meteorological data meteorological data including solar radiation minimum and maximum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed used for modeling evapotranspiration and crop development were obtained from the dingzhou weather station located 5 km away from the study site precipitation was measured locally 2 5 model evaluation statistics three statistical indices including normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and index of agreement d were used to evaluate model performance the three deviation statistics are calculated using the following equations 3 n r m s e 100 o i 1 n p i o i 2 n 4 n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 5 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where pi is the simulated value oi is the measured value o is the mean of the measured value n is the number of values li et al 2015b reported that an nrmse 15 represented good agreement 15 30 moderate agreement and 30 poor agreement nse ranged from to 1 the agreement index d ranged from 0 to 1 the closer the values of nse and d were to 1 the better the model performed van liew and garbrecht 2003 had suggested that when nse 0 36 and d 0 7 the model performed well 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the measured soil water content nitrate content crop biomass and crop n uptake were used to calibrate the model the trial and error method was used to adjust the model parameters until the simulated values agreed well with the measured data in the process of calibration the soil hydraulics parameters were taken from the measured values in table 1 the simulated and measured soil water content and nitrate content at different depths in four treatments were presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively soil water content changed more frequently at the top soil layer than those in the deeper layers fig 1 the simulated soil water content agreed well with the measured values the nrmse ranged from 7 8 to 13 0 and less than 15 table 3 nse values ranged from 0 39 to 0 58 and greater than 0 36 d values ranged from 0 84 to 0 89 and all greater than 0 7 which suggested the simulated soil water contents were all in good agreement with the measured values fig 2 illustrates that the soil nitrate content changed frequently in 0 60 cm upper soil layer while it in the 60 100 cm deeper soil layer changed slowly because the mineralization of organic matters and micro organisms mainly occurred at the surface soil 0 30 cm the nrmse values ranged from 13 3 to 27 8 the nse values ranged from 0 45 to 0 69 and the d values ranged from 0 84 to 0 91 which indicated that the simulated soil nitrate content agreed well with the measured values the measured biomass and n uptake in 2008 for sweet corn amaranth and sweet sorghum were close to the observed values their nrmses were all below 5 3 table 3 which suggested that the simulations were all in good agreement with the measured values after the model calibration the soil and crop parameters were all fixed and the measured dataset in 2009 was used to validate the model the soil water contents at different depths in 2009 were shown in fig 3 overall the pattern and trend of the soil water content in 2009 were similar as those in 2008 the soil water contents in the upper layers fluctuated more frequently than the deeper soil layers except for a few points most of the simulated values were in good agreement with the measured data from the statistical results in table 3 it was seen that the nrmses ranged from 5 6 to 10 2 and were less than 15 nse values ranged from 0 50 to 0 73 and were greater than 0 36 d values ranged from 0 88 to 0 93 and were all greater than 0 7 so the simulated soil water contents agreed well with the measured values the soil nitrate content at the upper layers changed more frequently than deeper soil layers fig 4 except for a few points the simulated nitrate content matched well with the measured values the statistical results indicated that the nrmses ranged from 17 7 to 23 1 the nse values ranged from 0 58 to 0 87 and d values ranged from 0 88 to 0 97 table 3 which all suggested that simulated soil n content agreed well with the observed values the average nrmse values for crop biomass and n uptake were 5 9 and 5 9 respectively their coefficients of determination r2 were 0 98 and 0 96 respectively fig 5 in general the simulated soil water content nitrate crop biomass and n uptake all agreed well with the measured values the whcns model could be used to simulate the water dynamic and fate of n in summer fallow season 3 2 dynamics in water drainage and n leaching the water drainage and n leaching mainly occurred at two periods the early stage of the crop growth and the rainy season late august fig 6 due to the irrigation in 2009 the water drainage and n leaching during the early stage were obviously larger than those in 2008 during the early stage of crop growth before august 10th due to the low crop cover and high temperature the water drainage and n leaching with catch crops were larger than that of ck as shown in fig 6 water drainage and n leaching were strongly related to precipitation and its patterns indicated that the precipitation and its patterns were the main factors leading to water drainage and n leaching in 2008 water drainage and n leaching started to increase in all treatments because of a heavy rainfall 44 mm on august 11th and n leaching peaked on august 13th with 75 mm of precipitation fig 6a whereas in 2009 n leaching peaked on june 26th due to the irrigation before sowing fig 6b the order of accumulative n leaching rate was ck sg sc a in both years although the total precipitation in 2008 was larger than that in 2009 the precipitation occurred dispersedly so the n leaching were also dispersedly the total precipitation in 2009 was relatively smaller but the precipitation was more concentrated the leaching rate increases as the precipitation occurred compared to ck the amounts of water drainage in catch crop treatments decreased by 20 1 25 3 in 2008 and by 16 2 34 9 in 2009 the n leaching rates decreased by 23 7 42 5 in 2008 and by 22 4 41 6 in 2009 fig 7 illustrates the accumulative n leaching rate in four treatments in 2008 and 2009 there were significant differences between three catch crops in accumulative n leaching because of different n uptake capacity and crop development however the differences were small before mid august in 2008 due to less rainfall in previous weeks after the heavy rain 75 mm on august 13th the accumulative n leaching rate of ck was higher than catch crop treatments fig 7a before august 23th in 2009 the accumulative n leaching rate of ck was significantly lower than catch crop treatments but significantly higher than other catch crops treatments after august 27th the phenomenon was likely due to the precipitation distribution patterns 3 3 water drainage and water balance table 4 shows the results of water balance in 0 100 cm soil profile under four treatments simulated by whcns in 2008 and 2009 except for one irrigation before sowing in 2009 there was no irrigation during the growing period of catch crops in both two years i e precipitation was the main source of water input since there was no catch crop planted in ck water consumption in ck was then equal to evaporation e which was 306 1 mm in 2008 and 345 6 mm in 2009 the evapotranspiration eta of three catch crop treatments were in the range of 353 6 371 8 mm in 2008 402 6 422 6 mm in 2009 which was significantly higher than that in ck the order of soil evaporation in 2008 was ck sg sc a while as ck sc sg a in 2009 transpiration t ranked as a sg sc ck in both years there was no significant differences between the two years in eta but t was significantly higher in 2009 water drainage in ck were 200 mm in 2008 and 182 3 mm in 2009 there were no significant differences among three catch crop treatments in water drainage in both years due to similar water management and weather conditions there was no runoff in 2008 and little runoff in 2009 the water input was 475 8 mm in 2008 and 432 9 mm in 2009 water drainage in 2008 ranked as ck a sc sg and as ck a sg sc in 2009 overall sweet corn had the least water drainage among all treatments 3 4 nitrogen fate and n balance table 5 listed the n fate and n balance under four treatments simulated by whcns in 2008 and 2009 since there was no fertilizer application in both years the main input of n were soil residual n and organic n mineralization the initial n contents of the four treatments were the same in 2008 but the initial n contents in 2009 were different due to different n fate in previous vegetable growth period from 2008 to 2009 the mineralization did not change significantly the main outputs of the ck treatment were n leaching while it was crop uptake and n leaching for the catch crop treatments the n leaching accounted for 32 1 47 5 of the total outputs while the crop uptake accounted for 47 2 60 8 of total outputs the n leaching in both years ranked the same as ck sg sc a the n leaching rate of both ck and catch crop treatments decreased from 2008 to 2009 it could be seen that the catch crops had strong absorbability of n table 5 the order of n uptake was sc a sg ck in 2008 while it was a sc sg ck in 2009 the different order for both years due to the lower planting density of amaranth in 2008 there were no significant differences between sweet corn and amaranth in n uptake and no significant differences among all the treatments in denitrification and ammonia volatilization 4 discussion in this study we calibrated and validated the whcns model using the data of a two year greenhouse experiment the results showed that the model simulation performed well in simulating sweet corn amaranth and sweet sorghum further we investigated the effects of three common catch crops used in the north china for intensive greenhouse vegetable system our results showed that catch crops significantly decreased the water drainage and nitrate leaching at the same time our study provides quantitative insights in n leaching influenced by catch crop in typical chinese greenhouse production systems n losses remain large in most greenhouse systems in china due to high input and sub optimal management 4 1 effects of different catch crops on n leaching in fallow season many studies suggested that there were two main controlling mechanisms of n leaching by catch crops one was that the catch crops can absorb residual n from the soil profile through its network structure of root thus reducing the nitrate leaching thorup kristensen and nielsen 1998 the other was that through crop transpiration like a pump pumping water and n in the deeper soil layer to the upper soil layer avoiding the n leaching out of the root zone thorup kristensen and nielsen 1998 tarkalson et al 2006 the ideal catch crops need to have some traits such as short growth period rapid growth rates high biomass and strong absorbability of soil mineral n thorup kristensen et al 2003 wang et al 2011 found that the catch crops could reduce the n leaching rate from 58 to 100 compared with the fallow treatment carey et al 2017 reported that planting oats as catch crop could decrease the n leaching by 25 compared with the ryegrass compared to chicory and perennial ryegrass fodder radish was more suitable as catch crops on reducing nitrate leaching in denmark sapkota et al 2012 hansen et al 2015 nitrate leaching had been reported that decreased by 29 94 in systems with non leguminous catch crops and by 6 48 with leguminous catch crops when compared with bare fallow systems sainju 1997 for the vegetable system in china due to the high soil residual mineral n non leguminous catch crop is more suitable sweet corn with deeper root was usually planted as summer catch crop in china some studies reported that sweet corn as the catch crop could significantly reduce the soil n leaching by 21 64 compared with the ck treatment ren et al 2006 min et al 2011a lu et al 2013 guo et al 2018 in this study we found that the catch crops absorbed the amount of soil residual n in 2008 ranged from 149 5 to 205 5 kg n ha 1 while it ranged from 131 5 to 243 0 kg n ha 1 in 2009 table 5 the residual n in 0 1 m soil profile decreased by 14 2 44 0 in 2008 and 53 1 91 5 in 2009 respectively the n leaching rate of ck treatment was significantly higher than catch crop planting treatments compared with the ck treatment catch crops planting could significantly reduce nitrate leaching from 271 6 kg n ha 1 to 156 0 207 3 kg n ha 1 in 2008 and from 97 3 kg n ha 1 to 56 8 75 5 kg n ha 1 in 2009 our results were in agreement with the above studies 4 2 effects of different catch crops on n uptake in fallow season the ability of n absorption and controlling n leaching effects of the catch crops had a close relationship with crop species root length and crop root distribution etc vos et al 1998 tosti et al 2014 valkama et al 2015 couëdel et al 2018 kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 used the deep point 15n injection method to study the effect of ryegrass fodder radish and winter rye on n uptake and found the root length density had a positive correlation with 15n absorption valkama et al 2015 reported that compared to control groups with no catch crops non legume catch crops mainly ryegrass species reduced n leaching loss by 50 on average and soil nitrated n or inorganic n by 35 in autumn alvarez et al 2017 proposed residual mineral n decreased after cover crops by 30 regardless if the cover crop species was or was not legume or not couëdel et al 2018 reported that compared to bare soil crucifer legume mixtures and crucifer sole cover crops provided the same level of nitrate catch crop service by reducing soil mineral n by an average of 59 while legume sole cover crops reduced it by at least 35 in this study the sweet corn had the maximum n uptake in 2008 reaching to 205 5 kg ha 1 the amaranth had the maximum in 2009 reaching to 243 0 kg ha 1 the least n leaching rate in 2008 and 2009 was the amaranth 150 5 kg ha 1 in 2008 and 56 5 kg ha 1 in 2009 as shown in table 6 the sweet corn with deep root mainly absorbed the nitrate from 0 to 100 cm soil profile the absorbed n from 0 to 30 cm accounted for 73 9 of the total n uptake while the amaranth with shallow root mainly absorbed the nitrate almost all from 0 to 30 cm soil depth the uptake scope of sweet sorghum was mainly concentrated in 0 60 cm soil layer the absorbed n from 0 to 30 cm accounted for 89 3 of the total n uptake some studies reported that the sweet corn as catch crop had better preventing effect of n leaching than catch crop with shallow root thorup kristensen 2001 guo et al 2018 however in this study we found that amaranth was more effective than sweet corn in reducing nitrate leaching this may be due to two reasons first the residual nitrate was mainly accumulated in the surface soil after the harvest of vegetable crops amaranth had stronger n uptake capacity than sweet corn in the 0 30 cm soil layer second the planting density of amaranth was 1 5 times of sweet corn hence the transpiration of amaranth is 30 mm greater than that of sweet corn in addition amaranth is a popular vegetable for local people the price of amaranth was higher than that of sweet corn and sweet sorghum thus planting amaranth as catch crop in the fallow season would be one of the most economic and effective measures to reduce the risk of nitrate leaching in the greenhouse vegetable field in the study areas 4 3 effects of the initial accumulative n and precipitation condition on n leaching in fallow season it was reported that the initial accumulative soil n content had a significant effect on soil n leaching wang et al 2010 found that the higher the initial n content in the soil the larger n leaching rate in cropland liang et al 2016b evaluated the effects of catch crop on reducing n leaching in fallow season which based on the previous greenhouse vegetable with three fertilization treatments ck no fertilization n1 380 kg n ha 1 n2 260 kg n ha 1 in beijing suburbs the results showed that the order of average n leaching rate from 2008 to 2010 followed the order of n1 treatment 184 8 kg ha 1 n2 treatment 151 8 kg ha 1 ck treatment 97 1 kg ha 1 the main reason lied in the higher initial accumulative soil n with higher fertilization in the present study the n leaching in 2008 was significantly higher than that in 2009 which was related to the decrease of initial n accumulation in the soil the initial accumulative n content in 2008 was 530 9 kg ha 1 while it was 264 0 359 4 kg ha 1 in 2009 which was significantly lower than that of 2008 our results agreed with these findings a large number of studies reported that the n leaching was closely related to the precipitation liang et al 2011 found that the n leaching was associated with the precipitation during the entire wheat growing season in tai lake region the maximum leaching rate and precipitation occurred almost on the same day li et al 2013b reported that the n leaching rate increased as the precipitation increased in quzhou city hebei province in the winter wheat growing period when the precipitation exceeded 200 mm the n leaching rate was 4 0 times greater than that under 100 150 mm precipitation condition and 2 2 times greater than that under 150 200 mm precipitation condition in the summer maize growing season when the precipitation was over 450 mm the n leaching rate was 4 2 times greater than that under 350 450 mm precipitation condition in this study the precipitation of 2008 was 475 8 mm while it is 372 9 mm in 2009 and the leaching rate of each treatment in 2008 was larger than that in 2009 the result was consistent with the above findings in this study we used the whcns model to simulate the n uptake of three catch crops our results would be better verified if there were measured data of n uptake from different soil depths normally the isotope technique could be used to distinguish the n uptake from different soil depths nevertheless n leaching is also related with other factors such as climate tillage soil texture fertilization soil residual n content and its distribution in soil profile etc gaines and gaines 1994 thorup kristensen et al 2003 valkama et al 2015 which should be considered in future studies as well 5 conclusions we successfully calibrated and validated the whcns model using the data of a two year field experiment in dingzhou hebei province the results showed that the simulated soil water content the inorganic content crop biomass and n uptake matched well with the measured data the whcns model could be a useful tool for evaluating the effects of catch crops on nitrate leaching during the summer fallow seasons catch crops could effectively absorb the residual n decrease the water drainage and control the n leaching during the summer fallow seasons compared with ck the catch crops significantly decreased drainage by 18 2 29 0 due to evapotranspiration the amount of water drainage ranked as ck a sg sc catch crops also decreased n leaching by 23 3 42 3 the amount of n leaching ranked as ck sg sc a the nitrate was mainly accumulated in the surface soil after vegetable harvested amaranth with shallow root was more effective than sweet corn with deep root in reducing n leaching hence planting amaranth in the summer fallow season would be an effective and economic measure to reduce the risk of nitrate leaching in greenhouse vegetable field in north china acknowledgements the study was funded by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfd0800102 and 2016yfd0201202 and program for changjiang scholars and innovative research team in university irt0412 
11263,chinese intensive greenhouse vegetable systems are characterized by high input of water and nutrients which are not sustainable there is an urgent need to explore smart and practical strategies to convert the high input low output systems to optimal input output ones this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different catch crops on reducing nitrate leaching in the vegetable greenhouse during the summer fallow season a two year field experiment with three catch crops i e sweet corn sc amaranth a and sweet sorghum sg and no catch crop ck were conducted in vegetable greenhouse in dingzhou city hebei province china the measured soil water content and inorganic nitrogen n content in soil profile biomass and crop n uptake were used to validate the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model soil water movement and nitrate leaching were simulated the results showed that the catch crops decreased the water drainage by 18 2 29 0 and nitrate leaching by 23 3 42 3 respectively compared with ck the water drainage reduction ranked as sc sg a while the nitrate leaching reduction was a sc sg the biomass was sc sg a while the crop n uptake was sc a sg sweet corn could absorb the residual nitrate in the deep soil layers due to the long root system while amaranth could absorb most residual nitrate in the surface soil amaranth showed greater n uptake capacity than sweet corn and the nitrate was mainly accumulated in the surface soil planting amaranth as summer catch crop reduced nitrate leaching in the vegetable greenhouses our study provides a guideline for selecting effective catch crops in intensive vegetable greenhouses in north china keywords greenhouse vegetable field catch crop nitrate leaching n uptake soil crop system model 1 introduction the greenhouse vegetable cultivation has developed rapidly in china because of its whole year production and high income in the past 30 years the vegetable acreage of china has increased from 3 3 million ha in 1978 to 22 million ha in 2015 national bureau of statistics of china 2016 however these high input low output systems were not sustainable due to large nutrient loss especially nitrogen n loss and contamination of groundwater li et al 2013a investigated 13 intensive agricultural areas in the peri urban areas of beijing and found that groundwater was contaminated by nitrate i e about 26 of study areas exceeded the standard for drinking water quality nitrate content 10 mg n l 1 zhang et al 2010 investigated intensive agricultural areas in shandong province north china and reported that the nitrate content of shallow groundwater under the vegetable greenhouses reached to 25 3 279 6 mg l 1 the average content is 121 6 mg l 1 and 87 of the samples exceeded the standards for drinking water quality pang et al 2013 found that the groundwater pollution under the vegetable fields was more severe than the cropland in the north china plain ncp the average of nitrate content is 86 8 mg l 1 and even reached up to 258 0 mg l 1 in some areas which seriously threats to the human health overuse of the fertilizer especially the n fertilizers were mainly reported in intensive production systems fertilizer n input in vegetable field is about seven times more than that in cropland ju et al 2007 fertilizer n inputs in some greenhouses even reached 1000 kg n ha 1 song et al 2009 min et al 2011b sun et al 2012 2013 due to shallow root of vegetables the excessive fertilizer n inputs had led to the low n use efficiency and large n accumulation in soil or loss to the environment zhou et al 2016 reported that the amounts of residual n in greenhouse reached 1269 114 kg n ha 1 hence there is a greater potential risk of n leaching from a greenhouse system than that of cropland in china and an urgent need to explore strategies to convert such high input low output systems to optimal input output ones in ncp the summer season is from june to september characterized with high temperature and large amounts of precipitation 70 of annual precipitation occurs in the summer the temperature may reach 50 c in the greenhouse which is not optimal for vegetable growth in such cases farmers often open the roof and spare the land as fallow in the summer given large amounts of residual nitrate in the soil profile after harvest high temperature also enhances the mineralization of organic n in the soil accelerating the accumulation of the inorganic n in the soil profile trindade et al 2001 when heavy rainfall occurs the nitrate was prone to leaching out of soil profile and caused the groundwater nitrate contamination li et al 2007 so the summer season is the main period for nitrate leaching in ncp it is necessary to explore effective measures to reduce soil nitrate leaching in the greenhouse during the summer fallow season many studies reported that the catch crops could effectively reduce the water drainage and nitrate leaching for example plaza bonilla et al 2015 evaluated the effects of different leguminous catch crops on water drainage through a three year crop rotation experiments in france it found that leguminous catch crops could reduce the water drainage from an annual average of 737 mm to 544 mm sapkota et al 2012 reported that fodder radish decreased n leaching by 79 compared with the fallow treatment constantin et al 2012 assessed the long term effects of catch crops mustard and ryegrass on n dynamics in arable farming and found that catch crops reduced n leaching by 33 55 hansen et al 2015 pointed out the fodder radish as the catch crop could effectively reduce the nitrate leaching from 44 kg n ha 1 in the fallow treatment to 5 kg n ha 1 in denmark guo et al 2018 found sweet corn as summer catch crop significantly reduces n leaching by 12 6 compared to the fallow treatment in protected vegetable production systems in north china some studies also found sweet corn could decrease the nitrate leaching by about 30 4 compared with the fallow treatment in the tai lake region min et al 2011a lu et al 2013 wortman 2016 reported that cover crops reduced potential n loss by 26 compared to weedy fallow carey et al 2017 found the oats as catch crop could decrease the n leaching by 25 compared with the ryegrass using a lysimeter method in new zealand wang et al 2011 compared the effects of four kinds of catch crops on reducing n leaching based on pot experiment in lanzhou city and found that the waxy corn pea amaranth and oat could reduce n leaching rate by 100 96 82 and 58 respectively compared with the ck treatment the processes of soil n transformation are very complicated weather and soil properties can affect the crop uptake of water and n the traditional field experimental method did not consider the effects of various uncertain environmental variables on crop growth and nitrate leaching the simulation model provides a quantitative tool to evaluate the effects of catch crops on the processes of soil water movement and n transport in the last decades many process based models had been used to simulate water consumption n fates and crop growth in agricultural systems jones et al 2003 keating et al 2003 kersebaum et al 2007 however the performance of these models in the chinese context was not satisfactory due to various field management practices in the highly intensive agricultural production systems in north china such as conservation tillage double cropping system high planting density film mulching and intensive water and fertilizer inputs recently liang et al 2016a developed the soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns model and the model had been successfully applied to analyze and evaluate the effects of various field management practices on soil water dynamic fates of n and crop growth in north china li et al 2015a liang et al 2016a 2016b according to the survey ye et al 2010 the average cumulative n amount of 0 100 cm soil profile in greenhouse vegetable field in dingzhou hebei province reached to 815 0 kg n ha 1 which is 12 3 times of the cropland which exists a great potential risk of groundwater pollution by nitrate leaching currently most studies on nitrate leaching were conducted via field experiments few studies combined modeling approach to evaluate the effects of catch crops on nitrate leaching under high soil residual nitrate conditions therefore the objectives of this study were i to calibrate and validate the whcns model using the data of two year experiment with three catch crops in typical vegetable greenhouse in north china ii to evaluate the effects of these catch crops on reducing n leaching and water drainage during the summer fallow season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in south district of dingzhou city hebei province china 38 8 n 115 4 e the soil texture is sandy loam the average altitude is 43 6 m and average annual sunshine time is 2427 4 h it is a typical warm temperate and semi humid continental monsoon climate the annual mean temperature is 13 0 c with average annual precipitation and evaporation 523 mm and 1910 mm respectively the frost free period is 190 day the groundwater depth is about 15 m the greenhouse of this experiment was built in 2001 which consisted of a common wall structure with a length of 41 3 m and a width of 6 2 m total area of 256 m2 the surface soil 0 20 cm properties were ph 1 2 5 soil water 7 5 organic matter 10 7 g kg 1 total n 1 07 g kg 1 olsen p 275 79 mg kg 1 and exchangeable k 222 36 mg kg 1 the physical and hydraulic properties of the soil profile in the greenhouse were shown in table 1 2 2 experiment design and measurements the greenhouse was used to plant cucumbers from january to june every year after the harvest of cucumbers the cover of the greenhouse was removed as common practices the experiment consisted of four treatments no catch crop planted during the fallow season ck and three catch crops treatments i e sweet corn zeamays l sc amaranth amaranthus spp a and sweet sorghum sorghum linn sg the catch crops were planted from june 21 to september 28 in 2008 and from june 28 to october 10 in 2009 respectively the plant densities were 6 7 plants m2 for sc 10 plants m2 for a and sg because of the drought in 2009 the plants were irrigated with 60 mm water before sowing in order to assure seed emergence all other treatments were neither irrigated nor fertilized during the catch crop growth period the area of each plot was 4 m long and 2 m wide with three duplicates and 1 m protection distance was arranged between the treatments a soil profile pit was excavated to 1 m and soil samples of each soil textural layer were collected before catch crops sowing in 2008 soil bulk density saturated water content field capacity wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity for each layer were measured table 1 during the crop growth period soil samples of each plot from 0 to 100 cm at 20 cm intervals in the soil profile were collected every 15 days soil water content was measured by oven drying for at least 24 h at 105 c fresh soil samples were extracted with 0 01 mol l 1 cacl2 to determine the content of no3 n by a continuous flow analyzer traacs 2000 bran and luebbe norderstedt germany when catch crops were harvested sweet corn had fully ripened while sweet sorghum was not fully grown ripened yet amaranth was still growing vigorously five plants were randomly sampled from each plot to measure the dry weight and n content of plant 2 3 whcns model the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model was used to simulate soil water movement n transport and crop growth in this study the model integrates the key processes governing water movement c and n cycles

1911 water redistribution is simulated by the richards equation root water uptake is evaluated using the model by van genuchten 1987 model soil heat transport simulation is directly introduced from the hydrus 1d model simunek et al 2008 soil c and n cycling concepts are drawn from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 soil n transport is described by convection dispersion equation n transformations

the vertical scope of microbial activity in soil could be set in the whcns model such as the soil n transformation processes mineralization immobilization nitrification and denitrification is considered within it in such a case the range of soil microbial activity set over the 0 30 cm soil profile the parameters for n transformation draw upon the default values of the daisy model hansen et al 1990 according to the local conditions the maximum nitrification rate was set as v n 50 g m 3 d 1 a half saturation constant for nitrification kn 100 g m 3 an empirical proportionality factor for denitrification kd 1 one order kinetic coefficient for ammonia volatilization kv 0 5 d 1 the initial c n ratio of residues and various organic matter distribution coefficients were given in jensen et al 2005 and liang et al 2016b 2 4 3 crop parameters the basic crop parameters for crop modeling were listed in table 2 the partition coefficients were calibrated to match with measured values of dry matter weight 2 4 4 meteorological data meteorological data including solar radiation minimum and maximum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed used for modeling evapotranspiration and crop development were obtained from the dingzhou weather station located 5 km away from the study site precipitation was measured locally 2 5 model evaluation statistics three statistical indices including normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and index of agreement d were used to evaluate model performance the three deviation statistics are calculated using the following equations 3 n r m s e 100 o i 1 n p i o i 2 n 4 n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 5 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where pi is the simulated value oi is the measured value o is the mean of the measured value n is the number of values li et al 2015b reported that an nrmse 15 represented good agreement 15 30 moderate agreement and 30 poor agreement nse ranged from to 1 the agreement index d ranged from 0 to 1 the closer the values of nse and d were to 1 the better the model performed van liew and garbrecht 2003 had suggested that when nse 0 36 and d 0 7 the model performed well 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the measured soil water content nitrate content crop biomass and crop n uptake were used to calibrate the model the trial and error method was used to adjust the model parameters until the simulated values agreed well with the measured data in the process of calibration the soil hydraulics parameters were taken from the measured values in table 1 the simulated and measured soil water content and nitrate content at different depths in four treatments were presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively soil water content changed more frequently at the top soil layer than those in the deeper layers fig 1 the simulated soil water content agreed well with the measured values the nrmse ranged from 7 8 to 13 0 and less than 15 table 3 nse values ranged from 0 39 to 0 58 and greater than 0 36 d values ranged from 0 84 to 0 89 and all greater than 0 7 which suggested the simulated soil water contents were all in good agreement with the measured values fig 2 illustrates that the soil nitrate content changed frequently in 0 60 cm upper soil layer while it in the 60 100 cm deeper soil layer changed slowly because the mineralization of organic matters and micro organisms mainly occurred at the surface soil 0 30 cm the nrmse values ranged from 13 3 to 27 8 the nse values ranged from 0 45 to 0 69 and the d values ranged from 0 84 to 0 91 which indicated that the simulated soil nitrate content agreed well with the measured values the measured biomass and n uptake in 2008 for sweet corn amaranth and sweet sorghum were close to the observed values their nrmses were all below 5 3 table 3 which suggested that the simulations were all in good agreement with the measured values after the model calibration the soil and crop parameters were all fixed and the measured dataset in 2009 was used to validate the model the soil water contents at different depths in 2009 were shown in fig 3 overall the pattern and trend of the soil water content in 2009 were similar as those in 2008 the soil water contents in the upper layers fluctuated more frequently than the deeper soil layers except for a few points most of the simulated values were in good agreement with the measured data from the statistical results in table 3 it was seen that the nrmses ranged from 5 6 to 10 2 and were less than 15 nse values ranged from 0 50 to 0 73 and were greater than 0 36 d values ranged from 0 88 to 0 93 and were all greater than 0 7 so the simulated soil water contents agreed well with the measured values the soil nitrate content at the upper layers changed more frequently than deeper soil layers fig 4 except for a few points the simulated nitrate content matched well with the measured values the statistical results indicated that the nrmses ranged from 17 7 to 23 1 the nse values ranged from 0 58 to 0 87 and d values ranged from 0 88 to 0 97 table 3 which all suggested that simulated soil n content agreed well with the observed values the average nrmse values for crop biomass and n uptake were 5 9 and 5 9 respectively their coefficients of determination r2 were 0 98 and 0 96 respectively fig 5 in general the simulated soil water content nitrate crop biomass and n uptake all agreed well with the measured values the whcns model could be used to simulate the water dynamic and fate of n in summer fallow season 3 2 dynamics in water drainage and n leaching the water drainage and n leaching mainly occurred at two periods the early stage of the crop growth and the rainy season late august fig 6 due to the irrigation in 2009 the water drainage and n leaching during the early stage were obviously larger than those in 2008 during the early stage of crop growth before august 10th due to the low crop cover and high temperature the water drainage and n leaching with catch crops were larger than that of ck as shown in fig 6 water drainage and n leaching were strongly related to precipitation and its patterns indicated that the precipitation and its patterns were the main factors leading to water drainage and n leaching in 2008 water drainage and n leaching started to increase in all treatments because of a heavy rainfall 44 mm on august 11th and n leaching peaked on august 13th with 75 mm of precipitation fig 6a whereas in 2009 n leaching peaked on june 26th due to the irrigation before sowing fig 6b the order of accumulative n leaching rate was ck sg sc a in both years although the total precipitation in 2008 was larger than that in 2009 the precipitation occurred dispersedly so the n leaching were also dispersedly the total precipitation in 2009 was relatively smaller but the precipitation was more concentrated the leaching rate increases as the precipitation occurred compared to ck the amounts of water drainage in catch crop treatments decreased by 20 1 25 3 in 2008 and by 16 2 34 9 in 2009 the n leaching rates decreased by 23 7 42 5 in 2008 and by 22 4 41 6 in 2009 fig 7 illustrates the accumulative n leaching rate in four treatments in 2008 and 2009 there were significant differences between three catch crops in accumulative n leaching because of different n uptake capacity and crop development however the differences were small before mid august in 2008 due to less rainfall in previous weeks after the heavy rain 75 mm on august 13th the accumulative n leaching rate of ck was higher than catch crop treatments fig 7a before august 23th in 2009 the accumulative n leaching rate of ck was significantly lower than catch crop treatments but significantly higher than other catch crops treatments after august 27th the phenomenon was likely due to the precipitation distribution patterns 3 3 water drainage and water balance table 4 shows the results of water balance in 0 100 cm soil profile under four treatments simulated by whcns in 2008 and 2009 except for one irrigation before sowing in 2009 there was no irrigation during the growing period of catch crops in both two years i e precipitation was the main source of water input since there was no catch crop planted in ck water consumption in ck was then equal to evaporation e which was 306 1 mm in 2008 and 345 6 mm in 2009 the evapotranspiration eta of three catch crop treatments were in the range of 353 6 371 8 mm in 2008 402 6 422 6 mm in 2009 which was significantly higher than that in ck the order of soil evaporation in 2008 was ck sg sc a while as ck sc sg a in 2009 transpiration t ranked as a sg sc ck in both years there was no significant differences between the two years in eta but t was significantly higher in 2009 water drainage in ck were 200 mm in 2008 and 182 3 mm in 2009 there were no significant differences among three catch crop treatments in water drainage in both years due to similar water management and weather conditions there was no runoff in 2008 and little runoff in 2009 the water input was 475 8 mm in 2008 and 432 9 mm in 2009 water drainage in 2008 ranked as ck a sc sg and as ck a sg sc in 2009 overall sweet corn had the least water drainage among all treatments 3 4 nitrogen fate and n balance table 5 listed the n fate and n balance under four treatments simulated by whcns in 2008 and 2009 since there was no fertilizer application in both years the main input of n were soil residual n and organic n mineralization the initial n contents of the four treatments were the same in 2008 but the initial n contents in 2009 were different due to different n fate in previous vegetable growth period from 2008 to 2009 the mineralization did not change significantly the main outputs of the ck treatment were n leaching while it was crop uptake and n leaching for the catch crop treatments the n leaching accounted for 32 1 47 5 of the total outputs while the crop uptake accounted for 47 2 60 8 of total outputs the n leaching in both years ranked the same as ck sg sc a the n leaching rate of both ck and catch crop treatments decreased from 2008 to 2009 it could be seen that the catch crops had strong absorbability of n table 5 the order of n uptake was sc a sg ck in 2008 while it was a sc sg ck in 2009 the different order for both years due to the lower planting density of amaranth in 2008 there were no significant differences between sweet corn and amaranth in n uptake and no significant differences among all the treatments in denitrification and ammonia volatilization 4 discussion in this study we calibrated and validated the whcns model using the data of a two year greenhouse experiment the results showed that the model simulation performed well in simulating sweet corn amaranth and sweet sorghum further we investigated the effects of three common catch crops used in the north china for intensive greenhouse vegetable system our results showed that catch crops significantly decreased the water drainage and nitrate leaching at the same time our study provides quantitative insights in n leaching influenced by catch crop in typical chinese greenhouse production systems n losses remain large in most greenhouse systems in china due to high input and sub optimal management 4 1 effects of different catch crops on n leaching in fallow season many studies suggested that there were two main controlling mechanisms of n leaching by catch crops one was that the catch crops can absorb residual n from the soil profile through its network structure of root thus reducing the nitrate leaching thorup kristensen and nielsen 1998 the other was that through crop transpiration like a pump pumping water and n in the deeper soil layer to the upper soil layer avoiding the n leaching out of the root zone thorup kristensen and nielsen 1998 tarkalson et al 2006 the ideal catch crops need to have some traits such as short growth period rapid growth rates high biomass and strong absorbability of soil mineral n thorup kristensen et al 2003 wang et al 2011 found that the catch crops could reduce the n leaching rate from 58 to 100 compared with the fallow treatment carey et al 2017 reported that planting oats as catch crop could decrease the n leaching by 25 compared with the ryegrass compared to chicory and perennial ryegrass fodder radish was more suitable as catch crops on reducing nitrate leaching in denmark sapkota et al 2012 hansen et al 2015 nitrate leaching had been reported that decreased by 29 94 in systems with non leguminous catch crops and by 6 48 with leguminous catch crops when compared with bare fallow systems sainju 1997 for the vegetable system in china due to the high soil residual mineral n non leguminous catch crop is more suitable sweet corn with deeper root was usually planted as summer catch crop in china some studies reported that sweet corn as the catch crop could significantly reduce the soil n leaching by 21 64 compared with the ck treatment ren et al 2006 min et al 2011a lu et al 2013 guo et al 2018 in this study we found that the catch crops absorbed the amount of soil residual n in 2008 ranged from 149 5 to 205 5 kg n ha 1 while it ranged from 131 5 to 243 0 kg n ha 1 in 2009 table 5 the residual n in 0 1 m soil profile decreased by 14 2 44 0 in 2008 and 53 1 91 5 in 2009 respectively the n leaching rate of ck treatment was significantly higher than catch crop planting treatments compared with the ck treatment catch crops planting could significantly reduce nitrate leaching from 271 6 kg n ha 1 to 156 0 207 3 kg n ha 1 in 2008 and from 97 3 kg n ha 1 to 56 8 75 5 kg n ha 1 in 2009 our results were in agreement with the above studies 4 2 effects of different catch crops on n uptake in fallow season the ability of n absorption and controlling n leaching effects of the catch crops had a close relationship with crop species root length and crop root distribution etc vos et al 1998 tosti et al 2014 valkama et al 2015 couëdel et al 2018 kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 used the deep point 15n injection method to study the effect of ryegrass fodder radish and winter rye on n uptake and found the root length density had a positive correlation with 15n absorption valkama et al 2015 reported that compared to control groups with no catch crops non legume catch crops mainly ryegrass species reduced n leaching loss by 50 on average and soil nitrated n or inorganic n by 35 in autumn alvarez et al 2017 proposed residual mineral n decreased after cover crops by 30 regardless if the cover crop species was or was not legume or not couëdel et al 2018 reported that compared to bare soil crucifer legume mixtures and crucifer sole cover crops provided the same level of nitrate catch crop service by reducing soil mineral n by an average of 59 while legume sole cover crops reduced it by at least 35 in this study the sweet corn had the maximum n uptake in 2008 reaching to 205 5 kg ha 1 the amaranth had the maximum in 2009 reaching to 243 0 kg ha 1 the least n leaching rate in 2008 and 2009 was the amaranth 150 5 kg ha 1 in 2008 and 56 5 kg ha 1 in 2009 as shown in table 6 the sweet corn with deep root mainly absorbed the nitrate from 0 to 100 cm soil profile the absorbed n from 0 to 30 cm accounted for 73 9 of the total n uptake while the amaranth with shallow root mainly absorbed the nitrate almost all from 0 to 30 cm soil depth the uptake scope of sweet sorghum was mainly concentrated in 0 60 cm soil layer the absorbed n from 0 to 30 cm accounted for 89 3 of the total n uptake some studies reported that the sweet corn as catch crop had better preventing effect of n leaching than catch crop with shallow root thorup kristensen 2001 guo et al 2018 however in this study we found that amaranth was more effective than sweet corn in reducing nitrate leaching this may be due to two reasons first the residual nitrate was mainly accumulated in the surface soil after the harvest of vegetable crops amaranth had stronger n uptake capacity than sweet corn in the 0 30 cm soil layer second the planting density of amaranth was 1 5 times of sweet corn hence the transpiration of amaranth is 30 mm greater than that of sweet corn in addition amaranth is a popular vegetable for local people the price of amaranth was higher than that of sweet corn and sweet sorghum thus planting amaranth as catch crop in the fallow season would be one of the most economic and effective measures to reduce the risk of nitrate leaching in the greenhouse vegetable field in the study areas 4 3 effects of the initial accumulative n and precipitation condition on n leaching in fallow season it was reported that the initial accumulative soil n content had a significant effect on soil n leaching wang et al 2010 found that the higher the initial n content in the soil the larger n leaching rate in cropland liang et al 2016b evaluated the effects of catch crop on reducing n leaching in fallow season which based on the previous greenhouse vegetable with three fertilization treatments ck no fertilization n1 380 kg n ha 1 n2 260 kg n ha 1 in beijing suburbs the results showed that the order of average n leaching rate from 2008 to 2010 followed the order of n1 treatment 184 8 kg ha 1 n2 treatment 151 8 kg ha 1 ck treatment 97 1 kg ha 1 the main reason lied in the higher initial accumulative soil n with higher fertilization in the present study the n leaching in 2008 was significantly higher than that in 2009 which was related to the decrease of initial n accumulation in the soil the initial accumulative n content in 2008 was 530 9 kg ha 1 while it was 264 0 359 4 kg ha 1 in 2009 which was significantly lower than that of 2008 our results agreed with these findings a large number of studies reported that the n leaching was closely related to the precipitation liang et al 2011 found that the n leaching was associated with the precipitation during the entire wheat growing season in tai lake region the maximum leaching rate and precipitation occurred almost on the same day li et al 2013b reported that the n leaching rate increased as the precipitation increased in quzhou city hebei province in the winter wheat growing period when the precipitation exceeded 200 mm the n leaching rate was 4 0 times greater than that under 100 150 mm precipitation condition and 2 2 times greater than that under 150 200 mm precipitation condition in the summer maize growing season when the precipitation was over 450 mm the n leaching rate was 4 2 times greater than that under 350 450 mm precipitation condition in this study the precipitation of 2008 was 475 8 mm while it is 372 9 mm in 2009 and the leaching rate of each treatment in 2008 was larger than that in 2009 the result was consistent with the above findings in this study we used the whcns model to simulate the n uptake of three catch crops our results would be better verified if there were measured data of n uptake from different soil depths normally the isotope technique could be used to distinguish the n uptake from different soil depths nevertheless n leaching is also related with other factors such as climate tillage soil texture fertilization soil residual n content and its distribution in soil profile etc gaines and gaines 1994 thorup kristensen et al 2003 valkama et al 2015 which should be considered in future studies as well 5 conclusions we successfully calibrated and validated the whcns model using the data of a two year field experiment in dingzhou hebei province the results showed that the simulated soil water content the inorganic content crop biomass and n uptake matched well with the measured data the whcns model could be a useful tool for evaluating the effects of catch crops on nitrate leaching during the summer fallow seasons catch crops could effectively absorb the residual n decrease the water drainage and control the n leaching during the summer fallow seasons compared with ck the catch crops significantly decreased drainage by 18 2 29 0 due to evapotranspiration the amount of water drainage ranked as ck a sg sc catch crops also decreased n leaching by 23 3 42 3 the amount of n leaching ranked as ck sg sc a the nitrate was mainly accumulated in the surface soil after vegetable harvested amaranth with shallow root was more effective than sweet corn with deep root in reducing n leaching hence planting amaranth in the summer fallow season would be an effective and economic measure to reduce the risk of nitrate leaching in greenhouse vegetable field in north china acknowledgements the study was funded by the

11264,small scale private irrigation is widely advocated as a means of improving agricultural incomes in sub saharan africa using the case of smallholder producers of african indigenous vegetables aivs in peri urban kenya we study whether irrigation driven productivity growth translates into improved market participation by smallholders we therefore a identify factors that drive smallholders to adopt irrigation in kiambu and b study how irrigation affects vegetable marketing we combine a regression analysis and propensity score matching in order to advance existing knowledge on the linkages of irrigation and marketing we use a 2014 survey of 176 aiv producers in kiambu county and 156 aiv traders in nairobi county we find that irrigation corresponds with up to 99 market participation rate and 86 of output sales we find that irrigators participate more in urban markets compete effectively with market intermediaries have more price bargaining power sell less at farm gate and face shorter value chains surprisingly supermarket outlets were associated with non irrigators while irrigators opt for wet markets although irrigators have larger commercialization indices the effect of irrigation depends on the type of technology used we find that irrigation and the associated access to better marketing arrangements is skewed towards farmers with off farm income and male headed households targeted support for female headed agricultural households to access modern irrigation technology is therefore an important policy measure we propose keywords irrigation marketing arrangements commercialization propensity scores horticulture kenya institutions 1 introduction smallholder farms averaging less than three hectares occupy 60 of cultivated land account for 75 of total agricultural output and 70 of marketed produce in kenya olwande et al 2015 gok 2010 salami et al 2010 minot and ngigi 2004 with agriculture accounting for up to 24 of gdp smallholder farms

et al 2002 sally and abernethy 2002 the argument is first that irrigation leads farmers to adopt high value crops and deliver better quality produce burney and naylor 2012 second irrigation facilitates intensification of smallholder production systems and adoption of other productivity enhancing inputs third irrigation makes smallholder farming more resilient to climate shocks and allows production planning to respond to the prevailing market conditions this way irrigation leads to productivity growth employment due to demand for farm labour improved livelihoods and improved food security until now there are however no studies on the relationship between smallholder irrigation market participation and improved rural livelihoods using the case of smallholder vegetable producers in peri urban kenya we seek to identify whether irrigation driven productivity growth translates into improved marketing conditions for smallholders our study aims to answer two questions which factors drive smallholders to adopt irrigation in kiambu how does irrigation impact vegetable market participation and marketing arrangements of smallholders understanding this relationship is critical given that market participation is the largest constraint facing smallholder farming in ssa particularly in kenya 84 of the country s total land mass is either arid or semi arid land asal and unsuitable for rain fed crop production gok 2009 second only 4 of cultivated land is irrigated and third the distribution of available surface water in kenya is strongly skewed gok 2009 promoting irrigation agriculture as a pro poor strategy in kenya therefore requires immense investments understanding fully how irrigation as a path to improved livelihoods is related to the main challenge facing smallholder farmers in the country is critical the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section two we describe the data sources used for the study section three is a description of the empirical approach used to evaluate impacts of irrigation development on smallholder market participation in the section that follows we present key findings on the nature of smallholder aiv irrigation and the relation of irrigation and marketing arrangements this is followed by an in depth discussion of these results in section five in section six we present our conclusions and recommendations for further research on the topical issue of irrigation as a strategy for smallholder agriculture development 2 material and methods 2 1 survey data this study used data sets for 176 african indigenous vegetable aiv producers in kiambu county and 156 aiv traders in nairobi county data used in this study were collected as part of the project horticultural innovations for improved nutrition and learning in east and central africa hortinlea in kenya hortinlea 2014 this study used baseline household survey data collected in 2014 the multi disciplinary research project hortinlea focused on investigating the socioeconomic institutional environmental nutritional and health dimensions of aiv production consumption and trade in rural peri urban and urban areas the study area is a peri urban county bordering nairobi and kajiado counties to the south machakos county to the east murang a county to the north and north east nyandarua county to the north west and nakuru county to the west gok 2016 kiambu county covers a land area of about 2543 5 km² is divided into ten sub counties and is home to an estimated two million people of the county s total land mass 1878 km² is under cultivation 649 7 km² is not arable land while 15 5 km² is covered with water bodies the average farm size in the county is approximately 0 88 acres in the smallholder regions and 169 5 acres in the large scale regions where coffee tea and pineapples are the main crops the smallholder farms are commonly found in the upper parts of the county where this study was undertaken in this region food crops and dairy farming are the main agricultural activities it is estimated that 85 of land owners have title deeds and the remaining 15 do not owing to unfinished land adjudication processes and non payment of necessary charges like elsewhere in kenya agriculture is the main source of livelihood in the county vegetable growing is the main agricultural activity in the study area rao et al 2012 fig 1 the close proximity of kiambu county to nairobi provides producers with a ready market for vegetables all year round rao et al 2012 ngugi et al 2007 similarly the small land sizes in kiambu give preference to horticultural production because of its relatively high price and return on land and labour olwande et al 2015 it is estimated that 69 of cultivated land in the county is allocated to vegetable production rao et al 2012 in addition to the five aivs in this study the other leafy vegetables important to farmers are spinach kales and cabbages rao et al 2012 aivs have gained particular importance in the recent past in response to higher demand around the city due to increased consumer awareness of their health and nutritional benefits ngugi et al 2007 2 2 method for evaluation of impacts of smallholder irrigation on horticultural marketing differences in costs faced by farmers in the marketplace can explain why some participate in agricultural markets while others produce only for own consumption similarly unequal access to assets and services to mitigate these costs can explain the heterogeneous market participation among smallholders alene et al 2008 generally smallholders face higher external transaction costs because their farms are too small for economies of scale to be realized hence they have higher unit costs for inputs and outputs market participation wiggins et al 2010 to overcome marketing challenges presented by high transaction costs farmers adopt various measures to boost their productive capacity attain sufficient marketable quantities and facilitate market participation technological innovations such as building irrigation are one way farmers can achieve economies of scale participate in markets and improve livelihoods to reap the benefits associated with irrigation agriculture like any other technology farmers have to decide independently whether or not to invest in irrigation additionally farmers will have to choose from among the irrigation technologies available on the market at both stages of decision making the utility of each alternative to the individual farmer is expected to be the key factor determining whether and which technology is adopted following the approach by khonje et al 2015 and becerril and abdulai 2010 the farmers decision to invest in irrigation can be modeled in a random utility framework under this framework holding all other factors constant a utility maximizing household will choose to invest in irrigation if the utility of investing which we denote as u i a is greater than the utility of not investing in irrigation which we denote as u i n a assuming v denotes the difference between the two utilities then for v u i a u i n a 0 the household will invest in irrigation however the utilities of investing and not investing in irrigation are unobservable and can only be expressed as a function of observables in a latent variable model as 2 v i x i β ε i w i t h v i 1 i f v i 0 0 i f v i 0 the expression v i denotes a binary variable for the adoption of irrigated farming v 1 if irrigation is practiced and v 0 if a farmer has not invested in irrigation the expression x i denotes a vector of socioeconomic and institutional characteristics β is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ε is the error term as an agricultural technology irrigation has the potential to improve the livelihoods of farm households by increasing farm productivity and incomes assuming that the annual vegetable output per unit of land annual aiv sales value and proportion of aivs sold are a linear function of the explanatory variable x i and the dummy for investment in irrigation v i the linear regression equation can be expressed as 1 q i x i β δ v i ʋ i z i x i β δ v i ʋ i y i x i β δ v i ʋ i where q i z i and y i are the average annual vegetable output per acre average annual aiv sales and the average proportion of aivs sold respectively x i is a vector of a household s socioeconomic and institutional characteristics β and δ are parameters to be estimated and ʋ i the disturbance term the effect of agricultural technologies irrigation in this case on household welfare is estimated as the parameter δ however random assignment of farmers into adopters and non adopters of irrigation is needed for δ to be an accurate measure of the impact of adoption dillon 2011 kassie et al 2011 according to becerril and abdulai 2010 for non observational data this grouping of farm households into adopters and non adopters relies on farmers self selecting into either category according to their own unobservable characteristics treatment not being random means that unobservable factors could influence the error terms of both the selection and outcome equation this could bias the outcome equation estimates using ordinary least squares therefore when evaluating the effect of irrigation on market participation the fundamental problem is developing a counterfactual because if a household has adopted irrigated farming we cannot observe the same household without the technology similarly for the non adopters we cannot observe their situation with the technology there is extensive literature on how to deal with the problem of self selection bias for non observational data see for instance cunguara and darnhofer 2011 kassie et al 2011 becerril and abdulai 2010 to assess the impacts of agricultural technologies the heckman two step method instrumental variable approach propensity score matching psm endogenous switching regression and double hurdle method have been used for the current study we use the psm approach as used in dillon 2011 kassie et al 2011 recommend the use of psm since it relaxes the linearity and distributional assumptions associated with most of the other treatment effect models following the methodology in khonje et al 2015 dillon 2011 and kassie et al 2011 we take y i a to represent a set of economic outcomes if a household invests in irrigation and y i n is the same set of economic outcomes for the same household without investments in irrigation then according to rosenbaum and rubin 1983 the average treatment effect att for this household δ y i can be expressed in a counterfactual framework as 3 δ y i e y i a y i n v 1 e y i a v 1 e y i n v 1 one problem associated with estimating equation three is that either y i a or y i n is observed for each household and never both of them since we can only observe e y i a v 1 and not e y i n v 1 e stimating att using this equation would yield biased estimates to avoid the missing data trap psm summarizes the pre treatment attributes of each respondent into a propensity score and then uses it to match individuals with similar scores rosenbaum and rubin 1983 this creates experiment like conditions by generating a statistical comparison group which allows each adopter to be compared to non adopters with similar socioeconomic characteristics psm is a two step approach in which a probability model for adoption equation three is estimated to calculate the propensity scores for each respondent second each adopter is matched with non adopter s with similar propensity scores although several methods for matching adopters and non adopters exist in this study we use the nearest neighbour nn and kernel based matching kbm approaches the estimation of att using the psm approach is based on two important assumptions which we test in our study first we have the assumption of conditional independence which states that given a set of observable covariates the outcomes of interest and adoption of the technology should be independent the second is the common support assumption which requires the compared respondents to have substantial overlap in their characteristics so that those with equal scores have a similar probability of being both adopters and non adopters khonje et al 2015 becerril and abdulai 2010 rosenbaum and rubin 1983 3 descriptive results 3 1 nature of irrigated aiv production and irrigation technologies used in kiambu county close proximity to city markets combined with small landholdings and favourable agro ecology makes production of aivs and other vegetables an attractive economic activity in kiambu county our results show that farmers have allocated 37 of their land to aiv production production of aivs like other vegetables in kiambu is largely irrigation dependent for the five vegetables under consideration 84 of spider plant producers 77 of ethiopian kale producers 72 of amaranth producers and 74 of african nightshade producers grow them under irrigation even cowpea a drought tolerant vegetable is grown under irrigation by 61 of producers with irrigation farmers produce vegetables throughout the year while production among non irrigators is restricted to the rainy seasons between april to may and october to november fig 2 irrigators in kiambu use different technologies irrigation technologies used in smallholder agriculture have been classified differently by various authors burney and naylor 2012 kay 2001 shah et al 2000 for our study we jointly adopt the classifications by kay 2001 and shah et al 2000 kay 2001 classifies smallholder irrigation technologies into three categories traditional modern and low cost technologies kay 2001 defines traditional technologies as the ones that farmers have used for a very long time with some used for several centuries in this category he includes use of surface runoff swamp irrigation spate irrigation floodplain irrigation and hill irrigation as shown in fig 3 no farmer in kiambu was observed using traditional irrigation technology kay defines modern irrigation technologies as on farm irrigation systems dependent on pipe conveyance and pressurized distribution systems from our results motorized irrigation involving lifting water from various sources into pipe distribution systems and applying it using overhead sprinklers is the most dominant form of irrigation in kiambu this set of modern irrigation technology was used by 64 of the irrigating farmers correspondingly 63 of the irrigating farmers use overhead sprinklers to apply water to the vegetable fields low cost irrigation systems are defined as an emerging form of irrigation technologies designed to retain the benefits of modern irrigation systems while making them affordable to smallholders their design allows lower acquisition and operating costs as well as reduced need for a pressurized water supply kay 2001 low cost technologies include treadle pumps hand pumps and drip irrigation kits since they rely on human labour to lift water shah et al 2000 refer to them as manual irrigation technologies a classification we adopt from our results in fig 3 manual irrigation i e drawing water from wells and streams using either buckets or manual pumps hand and treadle pumps was used by 29 of irrigators another 7 of irrigating farmers divert water from domestic uses for farming purposes and widely use manual application such as buckets and hose pinching in total 37 of irrigators use watering cans to apply irrigation water which corresponds to the percentage of farmers using non motorized methods to lift irrigation water 3 2 socioeconomic characteristics of irrigators and non irrigators in kiambu the socioeconomic characteristics of aiv producers in kiambu disaggregated by their irrigation status are presented in table 1 overall the sampled households were located near public infrastructure within a radius of three kilometres of a market two kilometres of a tarmac road and a few metres of a water source 60 of these households were male headed 51 of the households were members of producer groups and the average age of the head was 50 years the average household landholding was small averaging 1 5 acres 36 of which was under aiv production our respondents had relatively secure land tenure since 86 of them held title deeds further 82 of households were connected to electricity we found that both groups of farmers irrigators and non irrigators sold at least 80 of aiv output irrigators and non irrigators showed significant differences in household sizes access to information electricity access education of household head and land allocation to vegetable production first irrigators averaged four household members while non irrigators averaged five second heads of irrigating households had 10 years of formal education while those in non irrigating households had 8 years of education third 49 of irrigators had access to irrigation related information compared to only 26 of non irrigators fourth 87 of irrigators were connected to the national electricity grid compared to only 67 of non irrigators finally irrigators allocated 10 of their farmland to spinach production while non irrigators allocated only 4 of their land to spinach three significant differences exist between modern irrigators and manual irrigators first 62 of modern irrigators belong to producer organizations dealing with either production or marketing of aivs in comparison only 40 of manual irrigators belong to such groups second 96 of modern irrigators are connected to the electricity grid compared to only 71 of manual irrigators third modern irrigators sell significantly more at least 85 of aiv produce than manual irrigators who sell only 73 our results show surprisingly that non irrigators sell a larger proportion of their produce 80 than manual irrigators 73 this is a clear indication that grouping farmers into irrigators and non irrigators would not reveal the differences at various levels of irrigation adoption we therefore differentiate between irrigators and non irrigators but also distinguish irrigators by the type of irrigation technology used modern irrigators and manual irrigators 3 3 factors influencing adoption of smallholder irrigation in kiambu in this section we evaluate the factors that influenced smallholders decisions to adopt irrigation in kiambu although 96 of total cultivated land in kenya is rain fed in kiambu 74 of aiv producers practice irrigated farming in table 2 we present the binary probit regression results for these factors our findings indicate that vegetable marketing arrangements access to public infrastructure and household level variables influence farmers decision to invest in irrigation our analysis shows that farmers decision to irrigate in kiambu is largely influenced by market related factors first farmers who were producing far from the main vegetable buyers and input suppliers were more likely to invest in irrigation than farmers closer to markets specifically a one kilometre increase in distance between the farmer and the main aiv buyer increases the farmer s likelihood of adopting irrigation by 2 2 equally a one kilometre increase in distance between the farm and suppliers of agricultural and veterinarian inputs agrovet increases the likelihood of irrigation by 5 second retail markets within nairobi are an important destination for vegetables produced in kiambu as shown in fig 4 access to these markets increases a farmer s likelihood of investing in irrigation by 17 compared to farmers without access to these markets third the existence of marketing arrangements with aiv buyers increases the likelihood of farmers adopting irrigation by 15 by marketing arrangement we refer to various prior supply agreements between farmers and buyers about the quantities to be supplied at a specific future time or over a given duration at a particular price as shown in table 5 up to 64 of producers reported having some form of arrangement with buyers although most are informal and unwritten fourth and to our surprise marketing arrangements for supplying vegetables to supermarkets decreases the likelihood of farmers investing in irrigation we found that farmers selling almost exclusively to supermarkets were 92 less likely to irrigate than farmers selling to conventional markets access to public amenities such as electricity water sources roads and agricultural information also significantly influences farmers decision to invest in irrigation farmers with access to information on irrigation were 29 more likely to be irrigators than those without access to this information the distance from the farm to the nearest tarmac road and to water sources such as rivers and streams also influences farmers decision to irrigate a one kilometre increase in the distance to a tarmac road or water source reduces the likelihood of irrigation by 3 and 85 respectively likewise farmers connected to the national electricity grid were 21 more likely to irrigate than those who were not the characteristics of farmers and their households also significantly influence irrigation development in kiambu as farmers age and education level increases the likelihood of adopting irrigation based farming increases by 1 and 2 respectively male headed households were 10 more likely to irrigate than female headed households likewise larger households were also more likely to irrigate than small households an increase in household size by one person was found to increase the likelihood of irrigation by 53 we also found that farmers whose main occupation was farming were less likely to irrigate than farmers whose main occupation was an off farm activity additionally farmers belonging to producer groups dealing with aiv and farmers who felt that annual precipitation had been declining over the past few years were less likely to adopt irrigation based vegetable production finally for every one acre increase in area allocated to spinach the likelihood of adopting irrigation increases by 53 1 3 4 influence of irrigation on smallholder aiv production marketing in kiambu 3 4 1 interaction of smallholder aiv producers in kiambu with retail markets in nairobi to identify the relationship between irrigation and smallholder market participation we started by exploring the role played by farmers from kiambu in the aiv trade in nairobi s retail markets using data from 156 aiv traders in various retail markets around the capital city we found that kiambu is the main source of aivs traded in nairobi markets as shown in fig 4 75 of ethiopian kale 45 of nightshade 42 of spider plant 37 of amaranth and 24 of cowpea traders derived their supplies from kiambu county as expected close proximity to city markets gives producers in kiambu an advantage over other distant source markets individual producers and middlemen supplied most of the vegetables under consideration to retailers in nairobi s markets considerable market power parity exists between middlemen and individual producers in terms of quantities supplied by each to retail traders in nairobi contrary to the popular belief that farmers cannot overcome domination by market intermediaries individual farmers supply the largest proportion of aivs to nairobi s retail markets individual farmers supply 56 of ethiopian kale 39 of spider plant and 35 of nightshade to retailers in city markets middlemen sell more cowpea than farmers supplying 38 of interviewed traders fig 5 3 4 2 impact of irrigation on smallholder aiv marketing the impact of smallholder irrigation on aiv productivity per unit of land and proportion of aivs sold was evaluated based on nearest neighbour and kernel based matching algorithms the att was estimated to determine whether irrigation changes aiv output sales as well as proportion of aivs sold to our surprise irrigation had no significant impact on the proportion of aivs sold by farmers in kiambu county the difference in the proportion of total production sold between irrigators and non irrigators was 0 04 this is consistent with the findings in table 1 which indicate that irrigators and non irrigators sell 80 of their aiv produce in absolute terms however significant differences exist between irrigators and non irrigators in terms of the value of aivs produced and sold per acre as expected att for irrigated aiv production is significantly higher estimated between ksh 658 723 and ksh 803 386 for the value of aivs produced per acre annually the att for annual aiv sales was equally significant for irrigation estimated between ksh 511 990 7 and ksh 531 000 table 3 the propensity score matching psm procedure was repeated for the type of irrigation technology adopted the results are presented in table 4 investment in modern irrigation increased the proportion of aivs sold by 20 using proportion of aivs sold as a measure of commercialization modern irrigators were 20 more commercialized than they might have been had they been irrigating manually in addition to increased commercialization investment in modern irrigation was associated with higher farm productivity per acre and higher aiv sales in absolute terms 3 4 3 influence of irrigation on smallholder marketing arrangements in kiambu in addition to influencing aiv productivity irrigation also influenced smallholder marketing behaviour as shown in table 5 on average 86 of non irrigators sold aivs while a significantly larger percentage of irrigators 96 sold aivs participation in aiv marketing is also influenced to a large extent by the choice of irrigation technology at least 99 of modern irrigators sell aivs compared to 90 of manual irrigators this trend suggests incremental marketing benefits both from irrigation per se as well as from the type of irrigation chosen marketing arrangements are impacted by the farmer s irrigation decision and technology choice we find that there are significant differences on how prices are set between traders and farmers depending on whether the farmer irrigates or not for 35 of non irrigators prices are set by the buyer while for 65 either party determines the price for 74 of the irrigators prices are negotiated between the farmer and the buyer likewise 65 of non irrigators trade vegetables on cash on delivery terms while 35 extend credit to buyers among the irrigators 85 rely on cash transactions and only 15 give credit to the buyers the choice of marketing outlet is also influenced by farmers irrigation decision overall middlemen and traders buy the largest share of aiv output in kiambu with irrigation 32 of farmers sell aivs directly to retailers compared to 20 of non irrigators it is a surprise to us that supermarket outlets are more important to non irrigators than they are to irrigators about 5 of non irrigators supply supermarkets while 1 5 of irrigators and 0 of modern irrigators supply supermarkets 4 discussion our study has shown that adoption of small private irrigation depends on a series of factors socio economic demographic infrastructural and especially market related factors in turn irrigation impacts smallholder market participation productivity aiv sales and influences the nature of marketing arrangements between producers and buyers however the proportion of aivs sold by farmers as a measure of commercialization depends on the appropriateness of the irrigation investment made by the by farmer we find that irrigated farming in kiambu is both widespread and modernized our findings indicate that 74 of aiv producers use irrigation at least 63 of irrigators use motorized pumps coupled with pipe conveyance systems and overhead sprinklers likewise ground water sources such as wells and boreholes are becoming important alternatives our findings largely support other studies that emphasize the increasing significance of smallholder irrigation in ssa agriculture and horticulture in particular de fraiture and giordano 2014 and in kiambu rao et al 2012 however they do not confirm the premise that smallholders in ssa rely on surface water sources and hand watering technologies for irrigation burney and naylor 2012 namara et al 2014 we also found that credit had no significant effect of on the adoption of irrigation in kiambu in contrast to previous studies you et al 2014 we find that off farm income is the most important source of funds for investment in private irrigation this points to a particularity of the study location in peri urban kiambu 31 of household heads engaged in off farm labour either in own businesses or in paid employment our study confirms work by hanjra et al 2009a b who showed that accessible markets are the pre condition for irrigation to work as a pro poor strategy aiv demand and accessible marketing agreements with buyers were identified as some significant drivers of smallholder irrigation in kiambu first accessible markets in the city have incentivized and encouraged farmers to build the capacity needed for irrigation investment since demand in the city is year round farmers with direct or indirect access to these markets have invested more in irrigation to facilitate production throughout the year second irrigation is very important for farmers who are located far away from the main buyers these farmers need irrigation to reach sufficient output levels to justify transportation to distant markets either by the farmer or by buyers likewise these farmers have easier access to irrigation water than farmers near towns where most buyers and agrovets are located our analysis however exceeds existing studies as it explores the impact that the presence of specific marketing arrangements exhibit on irrigation decisions by small scale farmers we found that marketing agreements with buyers make farmers in kiambu more likely to irrigate a selling agreement increases farmers certainty of selling their produce and motivates them to adopt improved technologies barrett 2008 surprisingly our study of the relation of marketing arrangements and irrigation also found also that irrigation was not identified as a precondition for access to premium price markets such as supermarkets in kiambu in contrast to findings by rao et al 2012 we find that farmers who sell their aivs to supermarkets are less likely to invest in irrigation compared to non supermarket sellers this can be explained by kenyan supermarkets limited capacity for fresh produce we find that farmers in kiambu produce marketable surpluses even without irrigation in fact supermarkets were not a preferred outlet for most irrigating vegetable producers in kiambu we identified farmers who had started as supermarket suppliers and converted to supplying city wet markets they indicated that they resorted to conventional markets because of long procurement procedures inconsistent purchasing and limited quantities that the supermarkets were absorbing given that irrigation is an investment with operating costs farmers who adopted it sought markets that could absorb their increased output investments in smallholder irrigation have a double and incremental impact on aiv productivity consistent with the irrigation literature irrigation increases productivity per acre hanjra et al 2009a b yokwe 2009 namara et al 2010 giordano and de fraiture 2014 de fraiture and giordano 2014 namara et al 2014 as aivs have short maturity cycles ranging from 21 to 35 days oluoch et al 2009 and irrigators cultivate 6 8 seasons per year year round vegetable production and sales also during the dry seasons when prices are higher can be realized consequently they derived more revenue from aiv sales than manual irrigators many authors have argued that smallholders market participation in ssa depends on reaching a production threshold alene et al 2008 fischer and qaim 2012 suzuki et al 2011 barrett 2008 that exceeds their own consumption it is also assumed that widespread smallholder market participation can only be realized through interventions and investments that enable farmers to operate above this consumption level olwande et al 2015 our findings show that 86 of farmers in kiambu participate in aiv marketing and sell up to 80 of their aiv output even without irrigation irrigation increases the proportion of farmers participating in markets to 96 this suggests that the vast majority of kiambu smallholders has passed this assumed production threshold it might also mean that smallholder farmers in kiambu prioritize market production over household production our study contributes to knowledge on the impact of irrigation technology choice we explore the effects of different irrigation technology on productivity and confirm other studies that found modern irrigation more profitable than bucket irrigation woltering et al 2011 surprisingly the proportion of aivs sold as a measure of commercialization is not influenced by adoption of irrigation unless the farmer invests in modern irrigation technologies we found that 80 of aiv are sold by farmers in kiambu without irrigation with modern irrigation 85 of the aiv output is sold in contrast 73 of aiv output is sold with manual irrigation which is lower than 80 sold without irrigation this means that with manual irrigation 4 more farmers would participate in markets but they would sell 6 less output than without irrigation this finding is irritating but can be explained by the labour contraints of small scale farmers in our study manual irrigation is labour intensive and may divert labour from other production activities as found by danso et al 2002 manual irrigation requires frequent application and may consume as much as 38 of available productive time equally the limited reach of manual irrigation may limit the area under cultivation to the region around the water source as such manual irrigation may be unsuitable in areas like kiambu where production is market oriented in spite of this downside manual irrigators are able to produce throughout the year while non irrigators are not the opportunity cost of using manual irrigation is a 6 drop in output sold caused by higher labour demand and decline in cultivated area in addition to increasing productivity irrigation has transformed how smallholders interact with markets and other market actors this raises smallholders bargaining power in two ways first irrigating farmers have established networks with retail traders in nairobi we find that 20 of irrigating farmers have overcome the challenge of farm gate selling and integrated upwards to sell their vegetables in the city markets second the role of market intermediaries is being replaced by direct trade between producers and retailers in city markets we find that 32 of irrigators sell directly to retailers likewise interviewed retailers in city markets indicated that individual farmers provide most of their aiv supplies while intermediaries come in second third irrigation has influenced the price mechanism in the aiv trade we find that 74 of irrigators negotiate prices with their exchange partners as opposed to one party dictating the price increased interaction between irrigators retailers and retail markets has shortened the aiv value chain and allocates more value to the producers irrigating farmers sell aivs directly to city retail markets this eliminates some market intermediaries with more farmers interacting with retail markets on an almost daily basis the producer retailer network has become denser farmers gain more market experience and more information is shared because some farmers also double as retailers in city markets more market information has given farmers the capacity to compete with and even out compete intermediaries despite the benefits of smallholder irrigation in kiambu there are pitfalls that may reverse gains from irrigation driven market participation first 63 of irrigators use advanced irrigation technology which affects demand distribution and allocation of water especially during dry spells without an appropriate framework to ensure equitable irrigation water allocation irrigation in kiambu may face the fate of similar schemes which existed without appropriate governance systems without a mechanism to ensure equitable and sustainable water use the gains from transforming farming to market standards may be short lived second producing vegetables such as cowpea under irrigation may be unsustainable even though the crop is drought tolerant this indicates that irrigation in kiambu is driven by profit motives without due consideration to sustainability third irrigation is skewed towards male headed households and farmers with off farm income sources female headed households and farmers without alternative income sources who are usually poorer are more likely to be left out and measures to ensure their inclusion may be necessary increased productivity and incomes are the conventional end points of most studies on smallholder irrigation in ssa we extended this analysis to include the effect of irrigation on market participation and marketing arrangements the biggest challenge facing farmers in ssa we have confirmed the positive impact irrigation has on productivity which was found in several previous studies we have however generated findings that depart from previous studies in our study modern irrigation is not a feature of only a minority of most wealthy farmers we found that in kiambu modern irrigation is adopted by the majority of farmers we also found that irrigation in the study site if differentiated for technology exhibits contrasting impacts while motorized irrigation has positive effects on farm revenue manual irrigation had negative impacts on farm revenue we go beyond the study of factors for irrigation adoption and productivity impacts that were explored in several previous studies and generate new knowledge on the effect of irrigation adoption on market participation and marketing arrangements of small scale farmers we provide evidence that irrigation supports farmers position in markets and allows them to negotiate better marketing arrangements by increasing their bargaining power our study found that irrigators are more likely to negotiate prices than accept prices set by the buyer sell more often to retailers directly instead to middlemen and are less likely to accept delayed payment by their customers 5 conclusions and recommendations in our study we have shown that smallholder irrigation is one precondition for higher incomes and improved livelihoods however to make irrigation work for these farmers marketing opportunities must be available and accessible with irrigation investments and working markets productivity increases and translates into higher incomes first farmers produce and sell more with irrigation second and often ignored in most irrigation studies farmers visibility and competitiveness along the value chain improves due to year round production and larger outputs larger volumes allow farmers to participate in distant and more affluent markets the value chain also shortens more information is available within the chain and exchange networks become denser all these improved terms of exchange translate into higher earnings for farmers due to the productivity and marketing benefits associated with small private irrigation it is modernizing at an unprecedented rate it is and will continue being the central pillar supporting livelihoods of aiv producers in kiambu and other peri urban areas of kenya modernization includes movement from bucket irrigation with easily accessible surface water sources to motorized irrigation with pipe conveyance systems and overhead sprinklers drawing water from both surface and ground sources this trend is driven by high year round demand for vegetables in urban areas it is facilitated by farmers access to public infrastructure such as electricity roads and information networks extending these services to other regions in kenya will therefore give impetus to the transformation process of smallholder farms and kenyan agriculture due to the growing urban population the demand for fresh produce is expected to continue growing this will require more irrigation in peri urban areas because expanding the cultivated area is not always possible higher demand for water almost always creates conflicts among competing users for the case of kiambu it is necessary to evaluate whether an appropriate irrigation management system exists and whether it is capable of governing current and future water demand failure to invest in water governance systems not only financially but also in terms of deliberate discussion of appropriate irrigation management systems might lead to unsustainable irrigation water use our study also shows that irrigation is skewed towards farmers with off farm income and male headed households in order to improve the ability of women farmers and those without off farm income to negotiate better marketing arrangements there is a need to support access to modern irrigation technology on a broader scale funding this work was supported by hortinlea an interdisciplinary research project embedded in the funding initiative for global food security globe

11264,small scale private irrigation is widely advocated as a means of improving agricultural incomes in sub saharan africa using the case of smallholder producers of african indigenous vegetables aivs in peri urban kenya we study whether irrigation driven productivity growth translates into improved market participation by smallholders we therefore a identify factors that drive smallholders to adopt irrigation in kiambu and b study how irrigation affects vegetable marketing we combine a regression analysis and propensity score matching in order to advance existing knowledge on the linkages of irrigation and marketing we use a 2014 survey of 176 aiv producers in kiambu county and 156 aiv traders in nairobi county we find that irrigation corresponds with up to 99 market participation rate and 86 of output sales we find that irrigators participate more in urban markets compete effectively with market intermediaries have more price bargaining power sell less at farm gate and face shorter value chains surprisingly supermarket outlets were associated with non irrigators while irrigators opt for wet markets although irrigators have larger commercialization indices the effect of irrigation depends on the type of technology used we find that irrigation and the associated access to better marketing arrangements is skewed towards farmers with off farm income and male headed households targeted support for female headed agricultural households to access modern irrigation technology is therefore an important policy measure we propose keywords irrigation marketing arrangements commercialization propensity scores horticulture kenya institutions 1 introduction smallholder farms averaging less than three hectares occupy 60 of cultivated land account for 75 of total agricultural output and 70 of marketed produce in kenya olwande et al 2015 gok 2010 salami et al 2010 minot and ngigi 2004 with agriculture accounting for up to 24 of gdp smallholder farms effectively determine the performance of the kenyan economy agra 2013 ogada et al 2010 de janvry and sadoulet 2010 for several decades however this performance has remained dismal reducing prospects of smallholders driving growth and development an array of production and marketing challenges unique to smallholders limits their contribution to economic development fischer and qaim 2012 o cass and viet ngo 2012 alene et al 2008 for smallholder farming to drive the development agenda in the region a widespread transformation of these farms from semi subsistence low input low productivity units to intensive market oriented units is needed olwande et al 2015 fischer and qaim 2012 two components of this transformation are critically important smallholder productivity growth alene et al 2008 barrett 2008 wdr 2008 and improved access to markets chamberlin and jayne 2013 fischer and qaim 2012 obi 2010 productivity growth requires development dissemination and adoption of yield increasing technologies in return productivity enhancing technologies facilitate attainment of marketable surpluses which then contribute to household income and improved livelihoods barret 2008 refers to this approach as the agricultural productivity pathway out of poverty and subsistence agriculture unfortunately productivity growth alone is insufficient to address the numerous challenges faced by smallholders when marketing their produce minot 2011 jagwe et al 2010 obi 2010 these farmers usually face weak or non existing markets due to failed coordination and high transaction costs obi 2010 under these market conditions high productivity provides only marketable surpluses but may not translate into significant economic benefits for farmers because of inexperience in marketing high value commodities minot 2011 inaccessible markets resulting from socioeconomic institutional and infrastructural conditions faced by producers is considered more limiting to smallholder farming than low productivity alene et al 2008 pingali et al 2005 often poor infrastructure and poor access to supporting services expose farmers to high transaction costs which in turn reduce incentives for market participation o cass and viet ngo 2012 fischer and qaim 2012 alene et al 2008 barrett 2008 key et al 2000 omamo 1998 equally limited livelihood means restrict farmers access to resources and services needed to upgrade their farms to market based production standards fischer and qaim 2012 wiggins et al 2010 reardon et al 2009 smallholders are also excluded from emerging markets due to enforcement of quality standards and modernization of procurement systems olwande et al 2015 okello et al 2008 these challenges combined with seasonal cash shortages lack of produce handling facilities and little market information further weaken farmers position along the value chain pokhrel and gopal 2007 given this reality of markets in ssa researchers have recommended that addressing smallholder productivity growth be coupled with measures to enhance market access fischer and qaim 2012 alene et al 2008 recent studies venot 2016 domènech 2015 wichelns 2014 burney and naylor 2012 dillon 2011 hanjra et al 2009a b connor et al 2008 huang et al 2006 have unanimously identified irrigation as the main productivity pathway out of poverty and subsistence farming in ssa irrigation is regarded as the vital and missing component for transforming smallholder farms from subsistence to market based commercial production standards mutabazi et al 2013 burney and naylor 2012 jaleta et al 2009 herbert et al 2002 sally and abernethy 2002 the argument is first that irrigation leads farmers to adopt high value crops and deliver better quality produce burney and naylor 2012 second irrigation facilitates intensification of smallholder production systems and adoption of other productivity enhancing inputs third irrigation makes smallholder farming more resilient to climate shocks and allows production planning to respond to the prevailing market conditions this way irrigation leads to productivity growth employment due to demand for farm labour improved livelihoods and improved food security until now there are however no studies on the relationship between smallholder irrigation market participation and improved rural livelihoods using the case of smallholder vegetable producers in peri urban kenya we seek to identify whether irrigation driven productivity growth translates into improved marketing conditions for smallholders our study aims to answer two questions which factors drive smallholders to adopt irrigation in kiambu how does irrigation impact vegetable market participation and marketing arrangements of smallholders understanding this relationship is critical given that market participation is the largest constraint facing smallholder farming in ssa particularly in kenya 84 of the country s total land mass is either arid or semi arid land asal and unsuitable for rain fed crop production gok 2009 second only 4 of cultivated land is irrigated and third the distribution of available surface water in kenya is strongly skewed gok 2009 promoting irrigation agriculture as a pro poor strategy in kenya therefore requires immense investments understanding fully how irrigation as a path to improved livelihoods is related to the main challenge facing smallholder farmers in the country is critical the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section two we describe the data sources used for the study section three is a description of the empirical approach used to evaluate impacts of irrigation development on smallholder market participation in the section that follows we present key findings on the nature of smallholder aiv irrigation and the relation of irrigation and marketing arrangements this is followed by an in depth discussion of these results in section five in section six we present our conclusions and recommendations for further research on the topical issue of irrigation as a strategy for smallholder agriculture development 2 material and methods 2 1 survey data this study used data sets for 176 african indigenous vegetable aiv producers in kiambu county and 156 aiv traders in nairobi county data used in this study were collected as part of the project horticultural innovations for improved nutrition and learning in east and central africa hortinlea in kenya hortinlea 2014 this study used baseline household survey data collected in 2014 the multi disciplinary research project hortinlea focused on investigating the socioeconomic institutional environmental nutritional and health dimensions of aiv production consumption and trade in rural peri urban and urban areas the study area is a peri urban county bordering nairobi and kajiado counties to the south machakos county to the east murang a county to the north and north east nyandarua county to the north west and nakuru county to the west gok 2016 kiambu county covers a land area of about 2543 5 km² is divided into ten sub counties and is home to an estimated two million people of the county s total land mass 1878 km² is under cultivation 649 7 km² is not arable land while 15 5 km² is covered with water bodies the average farm size in the county is approximately 0 88 acres in the smallholder regions and 169 5 acres in the large scale regions where coffee tea and pineapples are the main crops the smallholder farms are commonly found in the upper parts of the county where this study was undertaken in this region food crops and dairy farming are the main agricultural activities it is estimated that 85 of land owners have title deeds and the remaining 15 do not owing to unfinished land adjudication processes and non payment of necessary charges like elsewhere in kenya agriculture is the main source of livelihood in the county vegetable growing is the main agricultural activity in the study area rao et al 2012 fig 1 the close proximity of kiambu county to nairobi provides producers with a ready market for vegetables all year round rao et al 2012 ngugi et al 2007 similarly the small land sizes in kiambu give preference to horticultural production because of its relatively high price and return on land and labour olwande et al 2015 it is estimated that 69 of cultivated land in the county is allocated to vegetable production rao et al 2012 in addition to the five aivs in this study the other leafy vegetables important to farmers are spinach kales and cabbages rao et al 2012 aivs have gained particular importance in the recent past in response to higher demand around the city due to increased consumer awareness of their health and nutritional benefits ngugi et al 2007 2 2 method for evaluation of impacts of smallholder irrigation on horticultural marketing differences in costs faced by farmers in the marketplace can explain why some participate in agricultural markets while others produce only for own consumption similarly unequal access to assets and services to mitigate these costs can explain the heterogeneous market participation among smallholders alene et al 2008 generally smallholders face higher external transaction costs because their farms are too small for economies of scale to be realized hence they have higher unit costs for inputs and outputs market participation wiggins et al 2010 to overcome marketing challenges presented by high transaction costs farmers adopt various measures to boost their productive capacity attain sufficient marketable quantities and facilitate market participation technological innovations such as building irrigation are one way farmers can achieve economies of scale participate in markets and improve livelihoods to reap the benefits associated with irrigation agriculture like any other technology farmers have to decide independently whether or not to invest in irrigation additionally farmers will have to choose from among the irrigation technologies available on the market at both stages of decision making the utility of each alternative to the individual farmer is expected to be the key factor determining whether and which technology is adopted following the approach by khonje et al 2015 and becerril and abdulai 2010 the farmers decision to invest in irrigation can be modeled in a random utility framework under this framework holding all other factors constant a utility maximizing household will choose to invest in irrigation if the utility of investing which we denote as u i a is greater than the utility of not investing in irrigation which we denote as u i n a assuming v denotes the difference between the two utilities then for v u i a u i n a 0 the household will invest in irrigation however the utilities of investing and not investing in irrigation are unobservable and can only be expressed as a function of observables in a latent variable model as 2 v i x i β ε i w i t h v i 1 i f v i 0 0 i f v i 0 the expression v i denotes a binary variable for the adoption of irrigated farming v 1 if irrigation is practiced and v 0 if a farmer has not invested in irrigation the expression x i denotes a vector of socioeconomic and institutional characteristics β is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ε is the error term as an agricultural technology irrigation has the potential to improve the livelihoods of farm households by increasing farm productivity and incomes assuming that the annual vegetable output per unit of land annual aiv sales value and proportion of aivs sold are a linear function of the explanatory variable x i and the dummy for investment in irrigation v i the linear regression equation can be expressed as 1 q i x i β δ v i ʋ i z i x i β δ v i ʋ i y i x i β δ v i ʋ i where q i z i and y i are the average annual vegetable output per acre average annual aiv sales and the average proportion of aivs sold respectively x i is a vector of a household s socioeconomic and institutional characteristics β and δ are parameters to be estimated and ʋ i the disturbance term the effect of agricultural technologies irrigation in this case on household welfare is estimated as the parameter δ however random assignment of farmers into adopters and non adopters of irrigation is needed for δ to be an accurate measure of the impact of adoption dillon 2011 kassie et al 2011 according to becerril and abdulai 2010 for non observational data this grouping of farm households into adopters and non adopters relies on farmers self selecting into either category according to their own unobservable characteristics treatment not being random means that unobservable factors could influence the error terms of both the selection and outcome equation this could bias the outcome equation estimates using ordinary least squares therefore when evaluating the effect of irrigation on market participation the fundamental problem is developing a counterfactual because if a household has adopted irrigated farming we cannot observe the same household without the technology similarly for the non adopters we cannot observe their situation with the technology there is extensive literature on how to deal with the problem of self selection bias for non observational data see for instance cunguara and darnhofer 2011 kassie et al 2011 becerril and abdulai 2010 to assess the impacts of agricultural technologies the heckman two step method instrumental variable approach propensity score matching psm endogenous switching regression and double hurdle method have been used for the current study we use the psm approach as used in dillon 2011 kassie et al 2011 recommend the use of psm since it relaxes the linearity and distributional assumptions associated with most of the other treatment effect models following the methodology in khonje et al 2015 dillon 2011 and kassie et al 2011 we take y i a to represent a set of economic outcomes if a household invests in irrigation and y i n is the same set of economic outcomes for the same household without investments in irrigation then according to rosenbaum and rubin 1983 the average treatment effect att for this household δ y i can be expressed in a counterfactual framework as 3 δ y i e y i a y i n v 1 e y i a v 1 e y i n v 1 one problem associated with estimating equation three is that either y i a or y i n is observed for each household and never both of them since we can only observe e y i a v 1 and not e y i n v 1 e stimating att using this equation would yield biased estimates to avoid the missing data trap psm summarizes the pre treatment attributes of each respondent into a propensity score and then uses it to match individuals with similar scores rosenbaum and rubin 1983 this creates experiment like conditions by generating a statistical comparison group which allows each adopter to be compared to non adopters with similar socioeconomic characteristics psm is a two step approach in which a probability model for adoption equation three is estimated to calculate the propensity scores for each respondent second each adopter is matched with non adopter s with similar propensity scores although several methods for matching adopters and non adopters exist in this study we use the nearest neighbour nn and kernel based matching kbm approaches the estimation of att using the psm approach is based on two important assumptions which we test in our study first we have the assumption of conditional independence which states that given a set of observable covariates the outcomes of interest and adoption of the technology should be independent the second is the common support assumption which requires the compared respondents to have substantial overlap in their characteristics so that those with equal scores have a similar probability of being both adopters and non adopters khonje et al 2015 becerril and abdulai 2010 rosenbaum and rubin 1983 3 descriptive results 3 1 nature of irrigated aiv production and irrigation technologies used in kiambu county close proximity to city markets combined with small landholdings and favourable agro ecology makes production of aivs and other vegetables an attractive economic activity in kiambu county our results show that farmers have allocated 37 of their land to aiv production production of aivs like other vegetables in kiambu is largely irrigation dependent for the five vegetables under consideration 84 of spider plant producers 77 of ethiopian kale producers 72 of amaranth producers and 74 of african nightshade producers grow them under irrigation even cowpea a drought tolerant vegetable is grown under irrigation by 61 of producers with irrigation farmers produce vegetables throughout the year while production among non irrigators is restricted to the rainy seasons between april to may and october to november fig 2 irrigators in kiambu use different technologies irrigation technologies used in smallholder agriculture have been classified differently by various authors burney and naylor 2012 kay 2001 shah et al 2000 for our study we jointly adopt the classifications by kay 2001 and shah et al 2000 kay 2001 classifies smallholder irrigation technologies into three categories traditional modern and low cost technologies kay 2001 defines traditional technologies as the ones that farmers have used for a very long time with some used for several centuries in this category he includes use of surface runoff swamp irrigation spate irrigation floodplain irrigation and hill irrigation as shown in fig 3 no farmer in kiambu was observed using traditional irrigation technology kay defines modern irrigation technologies as on farm irrigation systems dependent on pipe conveyance and pressurized distribution systems from our results motorized irrigation involving lifting water from various sources into pipe distribution systems and applying it using overhead sprinklers is the most dominant form of irrigation in kiambu this set of modern irrigation technology was used by 64 of the irrigating farmers correspondingly 63 of the irrigating farmers use overhead sprinklers to apply water to the vegetable fields low cost irrigation systems are defined as an emerging form of irrigation technologies designed to retain the benefits of modern irrigation systems while making them affordable to smallholders their design allows lower acquisition and operating costs as well as reduced need for a pressurized water supply kay 2001 low cost technologies include treadle pumps hand pumps and drip irrigation kits since they rely on human labour to lift water shah et al 2000 refer to them as manual irrigation technologies a classification we adopt from our results in fig 3 manual irrigation i e drawing water from wells and streams using either buckets or manual pumps hand and treadle pumps was used by 29 of irrigators another 7 of irrigating farmers divert water from domestic uses for farming purposes and widely use manual application such as buckets and hose pinching in total 37 of irrigators use watering cans to apply irrigation water which corresponds to the percentage of farmers using non motorized methods to lift irrigation water 3 2 socioeconomic characteristics of irrigators and non irrigators in kiambu the socioeconomic characteristics of aiv producers in kiambu disaggregated by their irrigation status are presented in table 1 overall the sampled households were located near public infrastructure within a radius of three kilometres of a market two kilometres of a tarmac road and a few metres of a water source 60 of these households were male headed 51 of the households were members of producer groups and the average age of the head was 50 years the average household landholding was small averaging 1 5 acres 36 of which was under aiv production our respondents had relatively secure land tenure since 86 of them held title deeds further 82 of households were connected to electricity we found that both groups of farmers irrigators and non irrigators sold at least 80 of aiv output irrigators and non irrigators showed significant differences in household sizes access to information electricity access education of household head and land allocation to vegetable production first irrigators averaged four household members while non irrigators averaged five second heads of irrigating households had 10 years of formal education while those in non irrigating households had 8 years of education third 49 of irrigators had access to irrigation related information compared to only 26 of non irrigators fourth 87 of irrigators were connected to the national electricity grid compared to only 67 of non irrigators finally irrigators allocated 10 of their farmland to spinach production while non irrigators allocated only 4 of their land to spinach three significant differences exist between modern irrigators and manual irrigators first 62 of modern irrigators belong to producer organizations dealing with either production or marketing of aivs in comparison only 40 of manual irrigators belong to such groups second 96 of modern irrigators are connected to the electricity grid compared to only 71 of manual irrigators third modern irrigators sell significantly more at least 85 of aiv produce than manual irrigators who sell only 73 our results show surprisingly that non irrigators sell a larger proportion of their produce 80 than manual irrigators 73 this is a clear indication that grouping farmers into irrigators and non irrigators would not reveal the differences at various levels of irrigation adoption we therefore differentiate between irrigators and non irrigators but also distinguish irrigators by the type of irrigation technology used modern irrigators and manual irrigators 3 3 factors influencing adoption of smallholder irrigation in kiambu in this section we evaluate the factors that influenced smallholders decisions to adopt irrigation in kiambu although 96 of total cultivated land in kenya is rain fed in kiambu 74 of aiv producers practice irrigated farming in table 2 we present the binary probit regression results for these factors our findings indicate that vegetable marketing arrangements access to public infrastructure and household level variables influence farmers decision to invest in irrigation our analysis shows that farmers decision to irrigate in kiambu is largely influenced by market related factors first farmers who were producing far from the main vegetable buyers and input suppliers were more likely to invest in irrigation than farmers closer to markets specifically a one kilometre increase in distance between the farmer and the main aiv buyer increases the farmer s likelihood of adopting irrigation by 2 2 equally a one kilometre increase in distance between the farm and suppliers of agricultural and veterinarian inputs agrovet increases the likelihood of irrigation by 5 second retail markets within nairobi are an important destination for vegetables produced in kiambu as shown in fig 4 access to these markets increases a farmer s likelihood of investing in irrigation by 17 compared to farmers without access to these markets third the existence of marketing arrangements with aiv buyers increases the likelihood of farmers adopting irrigation by 15 by marketing arrangement we refer to various prior supply agreements between farmers and buyers about the quantities to be supplied at a specific future time or over a given duration at a particular price as shown in table 5 up to 64 of producers reported having some form of arrangement with buyers although most are informal and unwritten fourth and to our surprise marketing arrangements for supplying vegetables to supermarkets decreases the likelihood of farmers investing in irrigation we found that farmers selling almost exclusively to supermarkets were 92 less likely to irrigate than farmers selling to conventional markets access to public amenities such as electricity water sources roads and agricultural information also significantly influences farmers decision to invest in irrigation farmers with access to information on irrigation were 29 more likely to be irrigators than those without access to this information the distance from the farm to the nearest tarmac road and to water sources such as rivers and streams also influences farmers decision to irrigate a one kilometre increase in the distance to a tarmac road or water source reduces the likelihood of irrigation by 3 and 85 respectively likewise farmers connected to the national electricity grid were 21 more likely to irrigate than those who were not the characteristics of farmers and their households also significantly influence irrigation development in kiambu as farmers age and education level increases the likelihood of adopting irrigation based farming increases by 1 and 2 respectively male headed households were 10 more likely to irrigate than female headed households likewise larger households were also more likely to irrigate than small households an increase in household size by one person was found to increase the likelihood of irrigation by 53 we also found that farmers whose main occupation was farming were less likely to irrigate than farmers whose main occupation was an off farm activity additionally farmers belonging to producer groups dealing with aiv and farmers who felt that annual precipitation had been declining over the past few years were less likely to adopt irrigation based vegetable production finally for every one acre increase in area allocated to spinach the likelihood of adopting irrigation increases by 53 1 3 4 influence of irrigation on smallholder aiv production marketing in kiambu 3 4 1 interaction of smallholder aiv producers in kiambu with retail markets in nairobi to identify the relationship between irrigation and smallholder market participation we started by exploring the role played by farmers from kiambu in the aiv trade in nairobi s retail markets using data from 156 aiv traders in various retail markets around the capital city we found that kiambu is the main source of aivs traded in nairobi markets as shown in fig 4 75 of ethiopian kale 45 of nightshade 42 of spider plant 37 of amaranth and 24 of cowpea traders derived their supplies from kiambu county as expected close proximity to city markets gives producers in kiambu an advantage over other distant source markets individual producers and middlemen supplied most of the vegetables under consideration to retailers in nairobi s markets considerable market power parity exists between middlemen and individual producers in terms of quantities supplied by each to retail traders in nairobi contrary to the popular belief that farmers cannot overcome domination by market intermediaries individual farmers supply the largest proportion of aivs to nairobi s retail markets individual farmers supply 56 of ethiopian kale 39 of spider plant and 35 of nightshade to retailers in city markets middlemen sell more cowpea than farmers supplying 38 of interviewed traders fig 5 3 4 2 impact of irrigation on smallholder aiv marketing the impact of smallholder irrigation on aiv productivity per unit of land and proportion of aivs sold was evaluated based on nearest neighbour and kernel based matching algorithms the att was estimated to determine whether irrigation changes aiv output sales as well as proportion of aivs sold to our surprise irrigation had no significant impact on the proportion of aivs sold by farmers in kiambu county the difference in the proportion of total production sold between irrigators and non irrigators was 0 04 this is consistent with the findings in table 1 which indicate that irrigators and non irrigators sell 80 of their aiv produce in absolute terms however significant differences exist between irrigators and non irrigators in terms of the value of aivs produced and sold per acre as expected att for irrigated aiv production is significantly higher estimated between ksh 658 723 and ksh 803 386 for the value of aivs produced per acre annually the att for annual aiv sales was equally significant for irrigation estimated between ksh 511 990 7 and ksh 531 000 table 3 the propensity score matching psm procedure was repeated for the type of irrigation technology adopted the results are presented in table 4 investment in modern irrigation increased the proportion of aivs sold by 20 using proportion of aivs sold as a measure of commercialization modern irrigators were 20 more commercialized than they might have been had they been irrigating manually in addition to increased commercialization investment in modern irrigation was associated with higher farm productivity per acre and higher aiv sales in absolute terms 3 4 3 influence of irrigation on smallholder marketing arrangements in kiambu in addition to influencing aiv productivity irrigation also influenced smallholder marketing behaviour as shown in table 5 on average 86 of non irrigators sold aivs while a significantly larger percentage of irrigators 96 sold aivs participation in aiv marketing is also influenced to a large extent by the choice of irrigation technology at least 99 of modern irrigators sell aivs compared to 90 of manual irrigators this trend suggests incremental marketing benefits both from irrigation per se as well as from the type of irrigation chosen marketing arrangements are impacted by the farmer s irrigation decision and technology choice we find that there are significant differences on how prices are set between traders and farmers depending on whether the farmer irrigates or not for 35 of non irrigators prices are set by the buyer while for 65 either party determines the price for 74 of the irrigators prices are negotiated between the farmer and the buyer likewise 65 of non irrigators trade vegetables on cash on delivery terms while 35 extend credit to buyers among the irrigators 85 rely on cash transactions and only 15 give credit to the buyers the choice of marketing outlet is also influenced by farmers irrigation decision overall middlemen and traders buy the largest share of aiv output in kiambu with irrigation 32 of farmers sell aivs directly to retailers compared to 20 of non irrigators it is a surprise to us that supermarket outlets are more important to non irrigators than they are to irrigators about 5 of non irrigators supply supermarkets while 1 5 of irrigators and 0 of modern irrigators supply supermarkets 4 discussion our study has shown that adoption of small private irrigation depends on a series of factors socio economic demographic infrastructural and especially market related factors in turn irrigation impacts smallholder market participation productivity aiv sales and influences the nature of marketing arrangements between producers and buyers however the proportion of aivs sold by farmers as a measure of commercialization depends on the appropriateness of the irrigation investment made by the by farmer we find that irrigated farming in kiambu is both widespread and modernized our findings indicate that 74 of aiv producers use irrigation at least 63 of irrigators use motorized pumps coupled with pipe conveyance systems and overhead sprinklers likewise ground water sources such as wells and boreholes are becoming important alternatives our findings largely support other studies that emphasize the increasing significance of smallholder irrigation in ssa agriculture and horticulture in particular de fraiture and giordano 2014 and in kiambu rao et al 2012 however they do not confirm the premise that smallholders in ssa rely on surface water sources and hand watering technologies for irrigation burney and naylor 2012 namara et al 2014 we also found that credit had no significant effect of on the adoption of irrigation in kiambu in contrast to previous studies you et al 2014 we find that off farm income is the most important source of funds for investment in private irrigation this points to a particularity of the study location in peri urban kiambu 31 of household heads engaged in off farm labour either in own businesses or in paid employment our study confirms work by hanjra et al 2009a b who showed that accessible markets are the pre condition for irrigation to work as a pro poor strategy aiv demand and accessible marketing agreements with buyers were identified as some significant drivers of smallholder irrigation in kiambu first accessible markets in the city have incentivized and encouraged farmers to build the capacity needed for irrigation investment since demand in the city is year round farmers with direct or indirect access to these markets have invested more in irrigation to facilitate production throughout the year second irrigation is very important for farmers who are located far away from the main buyers these farmers need irrigation to reach sufficient output levels to justify transportation to distant markets either by the farmer or by buyers likewise these farmers have easier access to irrigation water than farmers near towns where most buyers and agrovets are located our analysis however exceeds existing studies as it explores the impact that the presence of specific marketing arrangements exhibit on irrigation decisions by small scale farmers we found that marketing agreements with buyers make farmers in kiambu more likely to irrigate a selling agreement increases farmers certainty of selling their produce and motivates them to adopt improved technologies barrett 2008 surprisingly our study of the relation of marketing arrangements and irrigation also found also that irrigation was not identified as a precondition for access to premium price markets such as supermarkets in kiambu in contrast to findings by rao et al 2012 we find that farmers who sell their aivs to supermarkets are less likely to invest in irrigation compared to non supermarket sellers this can be explained by kenyan supermarkets limited capacity for fresh produce we find that farmers in kiambu produce marketable surpluses even without irrigation in fact supermarkets were not a preferred outlet for most irrigating vegetable producers in kiambu we identified farmers who had started as supermarket suppliers and converted to supplying city wet markets they indicated that they resorted to conventional markets because of long procurement procedures inconsistent purchasing and limited quantities that the supermarkets were absorbing given that irrigation is an investment with operating costs farmers who adopted it sought markets that could absorb their increased output investments in smallholder irrigation have a double and incremental impact on aiv productivity consistent with the irrigation literature irrigation increases productivity per acre hanjra et al 2009a b yokwe 2009 namara et al 2010 giordano and de fraiture 2014 de fraiture and giordano 2014 namara et al 2014 as aivs have short maturity cycles ranging from 21 to 35 days oluoch et al 2009 and irrigators cultivate 6 8 seasons per year year round vegetable production and sales also during the dry seasons when prices are higher can be realized consequently they derived more revenue from aiv sales than manual irrigators many authors have argued that smallholders market participation in ssa depends on reaching a production threshold alene et al 2008 fischer and qaim 2012 suzuki et al 2011 barrett 2008 that exceeds their own consumption it is also assumed that widespread smallholder market participation can only be realized through interventions and investments that enable farmers to operate above this consumption level olwande et al 2015 our findings show that 86 of farmers in kiambu participate in aiv marketing and sell up to 80 of their aiv output even without irrigation irrigation increases the proportion of farmers participating in markets to 96 this suggests that the vast majority of kiambu smallholders has passed this assumed production threshold it might also mean that smallholder farmers in kiambu prioritize market production over household production our study contributes to knowledge on the impact of irrigation technology choice we explore the effects of different irrigation technology on productivity and confirm other studies that found modern irrigation more profitable than bucket irrigation woltering et al 2011 surprisingly the proportion of aivs sold as a measure of commercialization is not influenced by adoption of irrigation unless the farmer invests in modern irrigation technologies we found that 80 of aiv are sold by farmers in kiambu without irrigation with modern irrigation 85 of the aiv output is sold in contrast 73 of aiv output is sold with manual irrigation which is lower than 80 sold without irrigation this means that with manual irrigation 4 more farmers would participate in markets but they would sell 6 less output than without irrigation this finding is irritating but can be explained by the labour contraints of small scale farmers in our study manual irrigation is labour intensive and may divert labour from other production activities as found by danso et al 2002 manual irrigation requires frequent application and may consume as much as 38 of available productive time equally the limited reach of manual irrigation may limit the area under cultivation to the region around the water source as such manual irrigation may be unsuitable in areas like kiambu where production is market oriented in spite of this downside manual irrigators are able to produce throughout the year while non irrigators are not the opportunity cost of using manual irrigation is a 6 drop in output sold caused by higher labour demand and decline in cultivated area in addition to increasing productivity irrigation has transformed how smallholders interact with markets and other market actors this raises smallholders bargaining power in two ways first irrigating farmers have established networks with retail traders in nairobi we find that 20 of irrigating farmers have overcome the challenge of farm gate selling and integrated upwards to sell their vegetables in the city markets second the role of market intermediaries is being replaced by direct trade between producers and retailers in city markets we find that 32 of irrigators sell directly to retailers likewise interviewed retailers in city markets indicated that individual farmers provide most of their aiv supplies while intermediaries come in second third irrigation has influenced the price mechanism in the aiv trade we find that 74 of irrigators negotiate prices with their exchange partners as opposed to one party dictating the price increased interaction between irrigators retailers and retail markets has shortened the aiv value chain and allocates more value to the producers irrigating farmers sell aivs directly to city retail markets this eliminates some market intermediaries with more farmers interacting with retail markets on an almost daily basis the producer retailer network has become denser farmers gain more market experience and more information is shared because some farmers also double as retailers in city markets more market information has given farmers the capacity to compete with and even out compete intermediaries despite the benefits of smallholder irrigation in kiambu there are pitfalls that may reverse gains from irrigation driven market participation first 63 of irrigators use advanced irrigation technology which affects demand distribution and allocation of water especially during dry spells without an appropriate framework to ensure equitable irrigation water allocation irrigation in kiambu may face the fate of similar schemes which existed without appropriate governance systems without a mechanism to ensure equitable and sustainable water use the gains from transforming farming to market standards may be short lived second producing vegetables such as cowpea under irrigation may be unsustainable even though the crop is drought tolerant this indicates that irrigation in kiambu is driven by profit motives without due consideration to sustainability third irrigation is skewed towards male headed households and farmers with off farm income sources female headed households and farmers without alternative income sources who are usually poorer are more likely to be left out and measures to ensure their inclusion may be necessary increased productivity and incomes are the conventional end points of most studies on smallholder irrigation in ssa we extended this analysis to include the effect of irrigation on market participation and marketing arrangements the biggest challenge facing farmers in ssa we have confirmed the positive impact irrigation has on productivity which was found in several previous studies we have however generated findings that depart from previous studies in our study modern irrigation is not a feature of only a minority of most wealthy farmers we found that in kiambu modern irrigation is adopted by the majority of farmers we also found that irrigation in the study site if differentiated for technology exhibits contrasting impacts while motorized irrigation has positive effects on farm revenue manual irrigation had negative impacts on farm revenue we go beyond the study of factors for irrigation adoption and productivity impacts that were explored in several previous studies and generate new knowledge on the effect of irrigation adoption on market participation and marketing arrangements of small scale farmers we provide evidence that irrigation supports farmers position in markets and allows them to negotiate better marketing arrangements by increasing their bargaining power our study found that irrigators are more likely to negotiate prices than accept prices set by the buyer sell more often to retailers directly instead to middlemen and are less likely to accept delayed payment by their customers 5 conclusions and recommendations in our study we have shown that smallholder irrigation is one precondition for higher incomes and improved livelihoods however to make irrigation work for these farmers marketing opportunities must be available and accessible with irrigation investments and working markets productivity increases and translates into higher incomes first farmers produce and sell more with irrigation second and often ignored in most irrigation studies farmers visibility and competitiveness along the value chain improves due to year round production and larger outputs larger volumes allow farmers to participate in distant and more affluent markets the value chain also shortens more information is available within the chain and exchange networks become denser all these improved terms of exchange translate into higher earnings for farmers due to the productivity and marketing benefits associated with small private irrigation it is modernizing at an unprecedented rate it is and will continue being the central pillar supporting livelihoods of aiv producers in kiambu and other peri urban areas of kenya modernization includes movement from bucket irrigation with easily accessible surface water sources to motorized irrigation with pipe conveyance systems and overhead sprinklers drawing water from both surface and ground sources this trend is driven by high year round demand for vegetables in urban areas it is facilitated by farmers access to public infrastructure such as electricity roads and information networks extending these services to other regions in kenya will therefore give impetus to the transformation process of smallholder farms and kenyan agriculture due to the growing urban population the demand for fresh produce is expected to continue growing this will require more irrigation in peri urban areas because expanding the cultivated area is not always possible higher demand for water almost always creates conflicts among competing users for the case of kiambu it is necessary to evaluate whether an appropriate irrigation management system exists and whether it is capable of governing current and future water demand failure to invest in water governance systems not only financially but also in terms of deliberate discussion of appropriate irrigation management systems might lead to unsustainable irrigation water use our study also shows that irrigation is skewed towards farmers with off farm income and male headed households in order to improve the ability of women farmers and those without off farm income to negotiate better marketing arrangements there is a need to support access to modern irrigation technology on a broader scale funding this work was supported by hortinlea an interdisciplinary research project embedded in the funding initiative for global food security globe
