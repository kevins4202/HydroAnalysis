extract power from ocean wave energy such a turbine has great importance as a renewable energy power generation unit without an environmental impact accordingly many researchers have performed extensive studies on the wells turbine to enhance its performance gato et al 1996 and curran and gato 1996 made experimental studies to identify different designs on wells turbine performance kim et al 2002 studied numerically the blade sweep and its influence on such turbine performance different modifications were introduced for wells turbines by setoguchi et al setoguchi et al 2000 setoguchi and takao 2006 such modifications were utilizing inlet guide vanes and self rectifying turbines brito melo et al 2002 studied numerically different design parameters of the wells turbine turbine performance analysis was introduced computationally by dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 raghunathan et al 1989 introduced a study of the effect of inlet conditions on the wells turbine performance the previous arts demonstrated that the performance of the wells turbine was influenced by geometrical parameters such parameters were blade geometry kim et al 2001 blade setting angle setoguchi et al 2003a the use of endplates takao et al 2006a and tip clearance torresi et al 2008 for small scale wells turbines the optimum blade profile was found to be naca0020 setoguchi et al 2003b while for large scale turbines the optimum blade profile was naca0015 takao et al 2006b thakker et al 2005 depicted the effect of guide vanes on the constant chord wells turbine additionally setoguchi and takao 2001 demonstrated the guide vanes effect on the variable chord wells turbine it was demonstrated by takao et al 2006b boake et al 2002 that wells turbine with guide vanes stalled before those without guide vanes taha et al taha and sugiyono sawada 2010 taha et al 2011 studied the effect of tip leakage flow on the performance of the wells turbine with uniform tip clearance taha and sugiyono sawada 2010 and also with non uniform tip clearance taha et al 2011 it was found in both studies that the turbine performance and the process of turbine stall were affected by tip leakage flow shaaban and hafiz shaaban and abdel 2012 depicted numerically the role of the turbine duct geometry and its effect on the wells turbine performance halder and samad 2015 studied the effect of casing treatment and the vortex pattern change on the stall limit of the wells turbine studying the effect of the rotor blade number on the turbine performance had been accomplished by many authors as recommended from the previous studies some turbines have a rotor of 8 blades gato et al 1996 curran and gato 1996 torresi et al 2008 thakker and abdulhadi 2008 and the others have a rotor of 6 blades thakker and abdulhadi 2008 setoguchi et al 2003b on the other side using air turbines to be immersed in the water gave a promising performance sarma et al 2014 demonstrated that operating savonius wind turbines as a water turbine to achieve higher performance halder et al 2015 studied the effect of circumferential casing groove rectangular shape on the wells turbine performance at different groove depth and width besides two different cases with and without a tip groove were considered to predict the optimal turbine speed for the different flow velocities halder and samad 2016 the grooved casing design performed better performance than that without a grooved casing another attempt had been made to improve the operating range of the wells turbine by using variable blade sweep angles at the tip and midsections halder et al 2017a 2017b a methodology was described to determine the optimal size of the wells turbine considering the hydro aerodynamic model torres et al 2018 besides the effects of blade thickness on both aerodynamic and entropy generation analysis of the wells turbine had been investigated numerically nazeryan and lakzian 2018 moreover a trial was performed for optimizing the blade profile of the wells turbine to maximize the torque coefficient for greater performance gratton et al 2018 to improve the wells turbine performance hamed et al 2017 proposed a new operating concept where the turbine was immersed in water this study allowed operating the turbine in higher specific weight fluids besides hashem et al 2018 suggested the same operating principle of using water as a working fluid and used s1046 as a new blade profile the analysis was achieved for a new device proposed by boccotti in which a vertical axis hydraulic wells turbine is installed in a vertical duct below the seawater level recently kotb et al 2020 studied the effect of the rectangular gurney flap on the wells turbine performance halder et al haldermohamed and samad 2018 performed steady state and unsteady state simulations and compared its results and concluded that the difference between steady and unsteady state results is slightly low the concept of changing the working fluid of the wells turbine from air to water was previously presented by boccotti 2002 and filianoti 1991 boccotti 2002 and filianoti 1991 provided an innovative design of the oscillating water column owc plant in which the wells turbine operates directly by an oscillating water column this presented design gave wells turbine the opportunity of operating the turbine with working fluid having a higher specific weight than air furthermore camporeale et al 2003 provided a three dimensional unsteady flow analysis of a wells turbine in a sea wave energy conversion device to predict the performance of high and low solidity wells turbines operating in boccotti s owc plant near la spezia italy coast all the previous literature review presented highlights the limitation of the operation of wells turbine due to its low aerodynamic efficiency low power produced and narrow operating range while there are a few previous studies hamed et al 2017 hashem et al 2018 filianoti 1991 camporeale et al 2003 that have investigated the new concept of the hydraulic wells turbine for sea wave energy conversion consequently the objective of the present paper is to overcome these drawbacks therefore the present work is performed by immersing the turbine rotor under the water surface and using a tip groove casing regarding the case of immersing the turbine rotor it makes the wells turbine works as a hydraulic axial turbine hence it extracts the power directly from the water column oscillation in the case of blade tip groove casing the present work introduces six heterogeneous shapes to investigate their influence on the turbine performance the idea of immersing air turbines in water and using a circumferential groove is not new however the originality of the present work is to apply such an idea with wells turbine in the wave energy conversion in the present work the turbine is investigated while having symmetrical naca 0015 as a sectional profile the results are performed by solving numerically 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equation rans using ansys fluent ansys cfx 2015 the turbine performance is illustrated by the flow coefficient pressure coefficient torque coefficient operating range and turbine efficiency furthermore the flow fields and static pressure distribution around the turbine blades are demonstrated 2 computational methodology in this section the demonstration of the wells turbine operation its groove casing and its computational methodology are presented 2 1 wells turbine the wells turbine is composed of a rotor with untwisted blades of the symmetrical cross sectional area that is positioned normally to the central axis of rotation this type of blade positioning makes the turbine rotates in a unidirectional rotation irrespective of the incoming flow direction bidirectional flow curran and gato 1996 torresi et al 2008 shaaban and abdel 2012 halder and samad 2015 as presented in fig 1 a wells turbine utilizes the oscillating motion of waves into a bi directional airflow through the turbine instead of that the present work proposed to immerse such a turbine under the water surface see fig 1 b accordingly the generated power from the turbine comes directly from the oscillating water column in this case the variations of water oscillations are achieved in the range of the wave crest 2 2 new groove schemes the present study aims to apply the groove technique in the immersed wells turbine see fig 2 a as shown fig 2 a the groove changes tip clearance design which changes the flow distribution around the pressure side and the section side immersing air turbines in water is a promising concept that is introduced in sarma et al 2014 hamed et al 2017 hashem et al 2018 boccotti 2002 filianoti 1991 camporeale et al 2003 in the present study six different groove shapes are used the scheme grooves are rectangular multi rectangular triangular multi triangular curved and multi curved grooves all groove dimensions are represented in fig 2 b 2 3 computational equations in fig 3 the flow of an incidence angle α will generate a lift force l and a drag force d the components of these forces in both axial and tangential directions are denoted by fx and fθ respectively accordingly fθ creates the turbine rotor torque while fx causes thrust along the axis of the turbine rotor dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 thus for a rotating turbine in an oscillating flow the incidence angle varies from positive to negative values according to the upward and downward flow directions respectively see fig 1 since the rotor blade is symmetrical the tangential force fθ is acting in the same direction and it is independent of positive or negative values of α accordingly torque has a unidirectional feature that is created from an oscillating flow dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 the flow coefficient φ can be written as 1 φ ν u the flow coefficient is varied accordingly to the variation of the axial flow velocity v while keeping the rotational speed u constant consequently the torque coefficient c t can be expressed in equation 2 shaaban and abdel 2012 halder and samad 2015 as 2 c t t ρ ω 2 r 5 where t is the rotor torque ρ is the fluid density ω is the angular velocity and r is the rotor tip radius stagnation pressure drop coefficient c p is expressed in equation 3 shaaban and abdel 2012 halder and samad 2015 by the following formula 3 c p δ p ο ρ ω 2 r 5 where δ p o is the total pressure drop the turbine efficiency η is expressed as 4 η t ω δ p ο q where q is the volume flow rate rotor solidity is an important parameter that affects the performance of wells turbines the rotor solidity σ is defined as 5 σ z c 2 π r where z is the number of blades c is the chord length and r is the radius from eq 5 varying the number of turbine blades affects the rotor solidity σ 3 methodology and validation in the present work the effect of using water as a working fluid on wells turbine performance is numerically studied by solving the 3d incompressible rans equation for unidirectional water flow the main target of any turbulence model used with the rans scheme is to accurately model the reynolds stresses in this work the realizable k ε turbulence model is employed besides the enhanced wall functions are applied in the modeling of near wall flow the combination of the realizable k ϵ turbulence model and the enhanced wall functions allow good prediction of the aerodynamic performance of such configuration besides the moving reference frame method is used to represent the turbine rotor but the main governing equations are solved in the absolute frame the finite volume method is used to discretize the absolute frame using the cfd code fluent the present investigation utilizes different discretization schemes these schemes are 1 standard scheme for pressure 2 simplec algorithm used pressure velocity coupling 3 the second order upwind scheme used for momentum 4 kinetic energy k 5 turbulence dissipation rate ϵ the simplec algorithm utilized for pressure velocity coupling decreases the effect of mesh skewness on the final solution the considered maximum residual values of the solutions are 10 4 for continuity momentum and turbulence equations 3 1 mesh independent study the wells turbine geometry of curran and gato 1996 is used in this study table 1 presents the specifications of the wells turbine that is under investigation the 360 full cylindrical domains of six blade and eight blade rotors are reduced to slices of domain angles θ 60 and 45 of the full domains respectively see fig 4 this reduction was made due to the turbine rotor symmetry around the rotational axis and to reduce the computational processing and memory demand shaaban and abdel 2012 moreover table 2 shows meshing and boundary conditions for the flow domain figs 4 and 5 depict the computational domain and the computational mesh respectively to guarantee that the flow at the turbine is not affected by the boundaries the large cylindrical domain extended 4 and 8 blade chord lengths upstream and downstream of the rotor respectively shaaban and abdel 2012 here fine grids are utilized near the blade surface this is used to detect the flow field inside the boundary layer all the computational meshes that appeared in the presented work are created using the ansys meshing fig 5 illustrates the unstructured mesh consists of tetrahedral elements employed on the total flow domain in the present work the total number of elements in the domain is 2 580 800 the unstructured tetrahedral elements are substantially increased in the vicinity of wall boundaries to get a normalized wall distance y 1 keeping y 5 confirms the capability of resolving the viscous sub layer and consequently using wall functions could be omitted this is achieved by employing inflation or the so called prismatic layers on the surface of the hub blade and casing the number of inflation layers is 20 with a growth rate of 1 3 for all wall boundaries the height of the first layer normal to the wall is set to be about 4 10 6 m to achieve y 1 at all operating conditions the domain inlet and outlet conditions are uniform velocity and outlet pressure respectively no slip wall conditions are considered for the blades shroud and hub surfaces φ is varied from 0 075 to 0 32 and the turbine rotational speed was kept constant 2000 rpm hence the blade tip velocity was kept constant fig 6 presents the minimal influence of mesh size on the cfd results this is achieved by demonstrating the effect of mesh size on simulated η at φ 0 15 the mesh size was increased in five gradual steps from 1 440 182 cells to 4 057 831 cells while maintaining the normalized wall distance y 1 at the same φ this test indicated that the maximum percentage of the deviations of c t η and c p are 1 95 1 85 and 0 8 respectively cells number 2 580 800 was found to be the optimum solution quality where the numerical results are independent of the mesh size consequently this number of cells was used throughout the present work 3 2 model validation validation curves of η c t and c p have been accomplished against φ as shown in fig 7 a and b and 7 c respectively furthermore other experimental curran and gato 1996 and theoretical results torresi et al 2008 shaaban and abdel 2012 halder and samad 2015 were plotted the cfd results show more matching with the previous experimental work of curran and gato 1996 when compared with the other theoretical results the predicted turbine torque coefficient in this work is slightly lower than that of the experimental work except for the stall margin while the stagnation pressure drop coefficient is almost the same hence the turbine efficiency of the present computational results before the stalling point is slightly lower see fig 7 a the value of peak efficiency obtained from the present calculation differs by approximately 6 and occurs at almost the same value as the flow coefficient of experimental results φ 0 1 accordingly in general the present cfd model is accepted as a computational tool for wells turbine performance it has the benefit that it can detect not only the performance of different wells turbine configurations but also the flow field around the turbine blades the implemented methodology was validated against experimental data of curran and gato 1996 besides verification of the circumferential groove shape is achieved for satisfaction fig 8 shows that the present numerical results of the rectangular groove shape have good matching with halder and samad 2016 4 results and discussions the results of the wells turbine operating performance are revealed in this section with different parameters accordingly three subsections are introduced that are performance for the submersible turbine the effect of the number of blades for the submersible turbine and the blade tip groove casing 4 1 immersed turbine performance this section mainly presents and discusses the results obtained from a reliable cfd simulation to investigate the performance of the immersed wells turbine in water fig 9 demonstrates the variations of η c t and c p at different values of φ for the two working fluids air and water the results show that the turbine efficiency working with water as a working fluid is slightly higher than that of air through the φ range from 0 1 to 0 175 otherwise through the φ range from 0 2 to 0 3 the immersed wells turbine in water efficiency is enhanced significantly this is due to the specific weight of water at φ 0 275 the efficiency η equals 0 04 and 0 4 for air and water respectively the maximum percentage increase in η is achieved at φ 0 3 which equals 400 due to the change of working fluid besides the wells turbine immersed in water has a wider operating range than in air for instance at turbine efficiency η 0 5 the hydraulic wells turbine has an operating range of about 1 5 times its range in air on the other hand c t in the case of water is slightly higher than that of air in the same range of ϕ as mentioned in the efficiency c t reaches its maximum values of 0 11 at φ 0 25 and 0 18 at φ 0 275 for air and water respectively the maximum percentage increase in c t equals 430 at φ 0 275 relative increase based on the torque coefficient of air see fig 9 consequently the main reason for the increased c t is the momentum of the working fluid and the delay of the separation c p is gradually increased as the φ increases for the two types of working fluids despite the increase in density and viscosity of the working fluid c p has not changed through the whole range of operation the performance of the immersed wells turbine is better than the air wells turbine through the whole range of operation from φ 0 075 to φ 0 3 the stall point of the air wells turbine has occurred at φ 0 25 while the stall point of the hydraulic wells turbine is shifted to some higher value φ 0 275 than that working with air to explain the effect of using water instead of air as a working fluid for wells turbine an investigation is also performed on the flow field around the turbine blades the flow characteristics can be explained in more detail by analyzing the flow field through the turbine for different flow regimes before and after stall condition the flow velocity and pressure fields are demonstrated for conventional and immersed wells turbine as shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the comparison of flow field between air and water is established at values of φ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 and h 10 50 and 90 however in the case of the pressure field the demonstration is done for both pressure and suction sides at φ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 it is noticed that there are two important regions the wake region formed on the suction side near the leading edge and the vortex region on the suction side at the trailing edge as shown in fig 10 a the size and location of such two regions have a vital effect on the performance of the wells turbine as the flow coefficient increases there is a slight decrease in the wake region size on the suction side however at the same time there is an increase in the vortex region size near the trailing edge in the case of water as a working fluid the two regions are relatively smaller than those in the case of air at all values of φ on the other hand the two regions are decreased in size as h increases as revealed in fig 10 b hence the tip leakage flow affects primarily the size of both the wake region and the vortex region generally the size of the two regions is smaller in water than in air because of the specific weight and viscosity of water consequently a little chance for a boundary layer separation may be happening fig 11 shows the pressure field through both the pressure and suction sides of the wells turbine blade working with air and water three important pressure regions are affecting dramatically the wells turbine performance two of them are located on the suction side negative and low while the third located on the pressure side high the negative and low pressure regions on the suction side represent the location of the wake region and the vortex region respectively as φ is increased both the negative and low pressure regions are increasing also the high pressure region increases as φ increases the difference in pressure between the high pressure region and the negative pressure region creates the force required for power generation hence the location of the two regions relative to each other contributes significantly to the performance of such a turbine at φ 0 1 there is a very thin layer of both high pressure and negative pressure regions which reflects a streamlined flow around the turbine blade as a result higher turbine efficiency is achieved as depicted in fig 9 4 2 effect of number of blades in the literature the recommended number of blades of wells turbine is eight gato et al 1996 curran and gato 1996 torresi et al 2008 thakker and abdulhadi 2008 or six setoguchi et al 2003b thakker and abdulhadi 2008 it is notable to mention that the wells turbine with the eight blade rotor was used in the present model as in curran and gato 1996 for convenience fig 12 demonstrates the variation of η c p and c t with φ for six and eight blade rotor wells turbines the eight blade rotor has η values of 0 51 0 59 through the φ range of 0 1 0 25 while the six blade rotor has higher η values of 0 62 0 7 through the smaller φ range of 0 1 0 2 so the eight blade rotor operating range exceeds thus of the six blade rotor by nearly 50 besides the values of η of the six blade rotor are more than that of the eight blade rotor by approximately 20 on the other hand the efficiency of the six blade and eight blade rotors suffer a drastic drop at values of φ more than 0 2 and 0 25 respectively furthermore the eight blade rotor has higher values of c p and c t than that of the six blade from these results it can conclude that each rotor has a certain privilege over the other however the eight blade rotor is more suitable as it is convenient for wider operating conditions when the turbine is operated with a high density fluid water as a working fluid the turbine will have a better performance see fig 9 fig 13 presents an innovative owc plant which it s patented by boccotti 2002 that allows the use of such unusual turbines immersed inside seawater and supposed to be moved directly utilizing the oscillating water flow on the other hand there are more intensive works still required to present a complete description of the characteristics of the turbine performance generally the present study confirmed that the hydraulic immersed wells turbine obtain a better performance than that of the air conventional wells turbine all over the operating range the air wells turbine deals with air saturated with moisture where the humidity ratio reaches 100 therefore wells turbine already operates in a harsh environmental area so the turbine material used must be treated carefully even the turbine is submerged inside the water regarding performing a new operating concept of immersing wells turbine in the water and its mechanical and economic impacts the percentage increase in the generation capacity and the enhancements in the turbine performance could overcome any extra economic or mechanical aspects 4 3 blade tip groove casing in this subsection the effect of six different shapes of tip groove casing has been investigated on the performance of the immersed wells turbine in water for convenience the performance is compared with the immersed wells turbine without tip groove according to the data the multi groove shapes have a different influence on the turbine performance than that of basic groove shapes therefore two groups of figures are herein presented one for multi shapes and the other for basic shapes 4 3 1 effect of multi groove shapes foremost the three multi groove shapes are tested as shown in fig 14 at high flow coefficients it is found that the three multi groove shapes show poor performance compared with immersed wells turbines without the groove on the other side at a very narrow range of φ 0 1 0 15 the triangle and rectangle multi groove shapes improve slightly the wells turbine efficiency the maximum efficiency reaches 61 5 for both the triangle and rectangle multi groove shapes compared with 58 5 in the case of without groove for the wells turbines without the groove η is decreased gradually from 58 up to 51 through the range of φ from 0 15 to 0 25 respectively unfortunately for the triangle and rectangle multi groove shapes a steep decrease in η from 58 up to approximately 15 through the range of φ from 0 15 to 0 2 furthermore in the case of multi rectangular and multi triangle shapes it is noticed that the η c p and c t at the range of φ of 0 2 0 25 are not so smooth see fig 14 this is due to the mutual effect between the high flow velocity at the blade tip clearance and the multi groove casing besides the interaction between the vortex region and the wake region near the blade tip h 50 90 see fig 15 however the curved multi groove shape deteriorates such turbine performance through the whole range of φ the multi groove shapes reduce intensely the c t which reflects its bad effect on the performance of the immersed well turbines in the water these results are guidelines for the other researchers to reduce their efforts and not to use such multi groove shapes for performance enhancement the flow field of the immersed wells turbine in water with multi groove shapes is illustrated in fig 15 a and b for different values of φ and h respectively at h 0 5 and φ 0 2 the vortex region occupies the whole suction side of the blade due to stall and scavenges the wake region downstream it see fig 15 a this reduces the pressure difference between the pressure side and suction side which in turn loses the power generated from the blade at the same value of h 0 5 the vortex region grows more at φ 0 3 and separates the wake region from the blade suction side hence a stalled flow has been accomplished and the blade fades its ability for doing work fig 15 b demonstrates the vortex region propagation from the blade hub to its tip at φ 0 2 as h increases the vortex region grows very harsh and eats up the wake region fig 16 demonstrates the static pressure field through both the pressure side and suction side of the immersed wells turbine in water the location of the small negative pressure region accompanying the wake region exists on the suction side at φ 0 1 and 0 2 however at φ 0 3 there is no negative pressure region attached to the suction side surface because of the stalled flow 4 3 2 effect of basic groove shapes fig 17 demonstrates the results of the three basic groove shapes rectangular triangular and curved shapes it is observed that utilizing such grooves influence positively the immersed wells turbine performance it is clear from fig 17 a that the tip grooved turbine has a larger operating range with higher efficiency than that without the groove at a very narrow range of φ 0 125 0 15 the rectangular and triangular groove shapes enhance slightly the wells turbine efficiency and the curved groove declines such turbine efficiency however at φ 0 2 the basic groove shapes strongly increase the η which reflects its good effect on the performance of such a turbine moreover the basic groove shapes reduce c p see fig 17 c at φ 0 15 0 3 the triangular groove shape dominates the enhancement of η through the range 0 62 0 66 compared with 0 58 0 1 for the turbine without groove respectively the maximum η and c t reaches 0 66 and 0 2 respectively at φ 0 275 also at φ 0 275 the percentage increase achieved in η and c t are 65 and 14 28 respectively compared with those without groove at φ 0 3 for the triangular groove the maximum percentage increase in η and c t are 4 5 and 3 times their values without groove respectively for the rectangular tip groove the maximum η reaches 0 63 at φ 0 275 however the maximum c t reaches 0 187 at φ 0 3 the percentage increase in η achieved is 55 at φ 0 275 relative to the turbine without the groove although the maximum percentage increase in the turbine η and c t are 4 8 and 2 6 times their values without groove located at φ 0 3 on the other hand the curved groove shape has a slight effect on the turbine performance although it has a good effect on the turbine performance in the higher values of φ comparing between the turbine without the groove and that with the curved groove it can be noted that the maximum c t decreased from 0 176 at φ 0 275 to 0 159 at φ 0 3 in addition the maximum efficiency shifted from 0 58 at φ 0 1 to 0 565 at φ 0 2 despite this the turbine efficiency reaches 0 534 at φ 0 3 with the curved groove scheme as a result the maximum percentage increase in the turbine efficiency with the curved groove scheme is 3 85 times their value without groove which is located at φ 0 3 by analogy fig 18 a and b illustrated the flow field of the immersed wells turbine in water with basic groove shapes for different values of φ and h respectively fig 18 a describes the size propagation of both the wake region and the vortex region concerning φ according to the increase in φ the enlargement in the wake region size on the blade suction side enhances the wells turbine efficiency as mentioned in fig 17 a it is noticed that at φ 0 3 a very large vortex region has been formed on the blade suction side in the case of the triangular groove fig 18 b reveals the reduction of the size of the wake region along with the blade height at h 10 50 and 90 fig 19 demonstrates the static pressure field through the pressure and suction sides of the immersed wells turbine with basic groove shapes for rectangular and curved grooves the size of the wake region increases as the φ is raised however for the triangular groove the location of the wake region is reduced at φ 0 3 because of the stalled flow 5 conclusions the present work aims to enhance the wells turbine performance and to increase its operating range an immersed wells turbine in water is investigated in this work and compared with the conventional air turbine as well as its number of blades are studied furthermore the present work introduces the effect of six different casing grooves at the tip of the turbine blades three of these grooves are basic shapes triangle rectangle and curved and the other three grooves are multiple of those basic shapes the turbine performance is investigated using a realizable k ε model where its numerical results were validated the model is based on the 3d incompressible rans equation in the rotating reference frame accordingly the following conclusions are taken i the maximum percentage increase of the immersed wells turbine in η is achieved at φ 0 3 that equals 400 due to the change of working fluid ii the immersed wells turbine has an operating range of about 1 5 times its range in the air at the turbine efficiency η 0 5 iii the efficiency of the six blade rotor in most of its operating range is higher than the eight blades however the eight blade rotor has a wider operating range that exceeds the six blade rotor by nearly 50 this makes the eight blades are more convenient for different operating conditions iv the three grooves of multi basic shapes lead to poor wells turbine performance v applying basic groove configuration on immersed wells turbine to performance enhancement and wider operating range vi for the triangular groove the maximum percentage increase in η and c t is 4 5 and 3 times their values without groove respectively vii the present concept may be a promising issue for further wells turbine investigations and optimization credit authorship

performance analysis was introduced computationally by dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 raghunathan et al 1989 introduced a study of the effect of inlet conditions on the wells turbine performance the previous arts demonstrated that the performance of the wells turbine was influenced by geometrical parameters such parameters were blade geometry kim et al 2001 blade setting angle setoguchi et al 2003a the use of endplates takao et al 2006a and tip clearance torresi et al 2008 for small scale wells turbines the optimum blade profile was found to be naca0020 setoguchi et al 2003b while for large scale turbines the optimum blade profile was naca0015 takao et al 2006b thakker et al 2005 depicted the effect of guide vanes on the constant chord wells turbine additionally setoguchi and takao 2001 demonstrated the guide vanes effect on the variable chord wells turbine it was demonstrated by takao et al 2006b boake et al 2002 that wells turbine with guide vanes stalled before those without guide vanes taha et al taha and sugiyono sawada 2010 taha et al 2011 studied the effect of tip leakage flow on the performance of the wells turbine with uniform tip clearance taha and sugiyono sawada 2010 and also with non uniform tip clearance taha et al 2011 it was found in both studies that the turbine performance and the process of turbine stall were affected by tip leakage flow shaaban and hafiz shaaban and abdel 2012 depicted numerically the role of the turbine duct geometry and its effect on the wells turbine performance halder and samad 2015 studied the effect of casing treatment and the vortex pattern change on the stall limit of the wells turbine studying the effect of the rotor blade number on the turbine performance had been accomplished by many authors as recommended from the previous studies some turbines have a rotor of 8 blades gato et al 1996 curran and gato 1996 torresi et al 2008 thakker and abdulhadi 2008 and the others have a rotor of 6 blades thakker and abdulhadi 2008 setoguchi et al 2003b on the other side using air turbines to be immersed in the water gave a promising performance sarma et al 2014 demonstrated that operating savonius wind turbines as a water turbine to achieve higher performance halder et al 2015 studied the effect of circumferential casing groove rectangular shape on the wells turbine performance at different groove depth and width besides two different cases with and without a tip groove were considered to predict the optimal turbine speed for the different flow velocities halder and samad 2016 the grooved casing design performed better performance than that without a grooved casing another attempt had been made to improve the operating range of the wells turbine by using variable blade sweep angles at the tip and midsections halder et al 2017a 2017b a methodology was described to determine the optimal size of the wells turbine considering the hydro aerodynamic model torres et al 2018 besides the effects of blade thickness on both aerodynamic and entropy generation analysis of the wells turbine had been investigated numerically nazeryan and lakzian 2018 moreover a trial was performed for optimizing the blade profile of the wells turbine to maximize the torque coefficient for greater performance gratton et al 2018 to improve the wells turbine performance hamed et al 2017 proposed a new operating concept where the turbine was immersed in water this study allowed operating the turbine in higher specific weight fluids besides hashem et al 2018 suggested the same operating principle of using water as a working fluid and used s1046 as a new blade profile the analysis was achieved for a new device proposed by boccotti in which a vertical axis hydraulic wells turbine is installed in a vertical duct below the seawater level recently kotb et al 2020 studied the effect of the rectangular gurney flap on the wells turbine performance halder et al haldermohamed and samad 2018 performed steady state and unsteady state simulations and compared its results and concluded that the difference between steady and unsteady state results is slightly low the concept of changing the working fluid of the wells turbine from air to water was previously presented by boccotti 2002 and filianoti 1991 boccotti 2002 and filianoti 1991 provided an innovative design of the oscillating water column owc plant in which the wells turbine operates directly by an oscillating water column this presented design gave wells turbine the opportunity of operating the turbine with working fluid having a higher specific weight than air furthermore camporeale et al 2003 provided a three dimensional unsteady flow analysis of a wells turbine in a sea wave energy conversion device to predict the performance of high and low solidity wells turbines operating in boccotti s owc plant near la spezia italy coast all the previous literature review presented highlights the limitation of the operation of wells turbine due to its low aerodynamic efficiency low power produced and narrow operating range while there are a few previous studies hamed et al 2017 hashem et al 2018 filianoti 1991 camporeale et al 2003 that have investigated the new concept of the hydraulic wells turbine for sea wave energy conversion consequently the objective of the present paper is to overcome these drawbacks therefore the present work is performed by immersing the turbine rotor under the water surface and using a tip groove casing regarding the case of immersing the turbine rotor it makes the wells turbine works as a hydraulic axial turbine hence it extracts the power directly from the water column oscillation in the case of blade tip groove casing the present work introduces six heterogeneous shapes to investigate their influence on the turbine performance the idea of immersing air turbines in water and using a circumferential groove is not new however the originality of the present work is to apply such an idea with wells turbine in the wave energy conversion in the present work the turbine is investigated while having symmetrical naca 0015 as a sectional profile the results are performed by solving numerically 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equation rans using ansys fluent ansys cfx 2015 the turbine performance is illustrated by the flow coefficient pressure coefficient torque coefficient operating range and turbine efficiency furthermore the flow fields and static pressure distribution around the turbine blades are demonstrated 2 computational methodology in this section the demonstration of the wells turbine operation its groove casing and its computational methodology are presented 2 1 wells turbine the wells turbine is composed of a rotor with untwisted blades of the symmetrical cross sectional area that is positioned normally to the central axis of rotation this type of blade positioning makes the turbine rotates in a unidirectional rotation irrespective of the incoming flow direction bidirectional flow curran and gato 1996 torresi et al 2008 shaaban and abdel 2012 halder and samad 2015 as presented in fig 1 a wells turbine utilizes the oscillating motion of waves into a bi directional airflow through the turbine instead of that the present work proposed to immerse such a turbine under the water surface see fig 1 b accordingly the generated power from the turbine comes directly from the oscillating water column in this case the variations of water oscillations are achieved in the range of the wave crest 2 2 new groove schemes the present study aims to apply the groove technique in the immersed wells turbine see fig 2 a as shown fig 2 a the groove changes tip clearance design which changes the flow distribution around the pressure side and the section side immersing air turbines in water is a promising concept that is introduced in sarma et al 2014 hamed et al 2017 hashem et al 2018 boccotti 2002 filianoti 1991 camporeale et al 2003 in the present study six different groove shapes are used the scheme grooves are rectangular multi rectangular triangular multi triangular curved and multi curved grooves all groove dimensions are represented in fig 2 b 2 3 computational equations in fig 3 the flow of an incidence angle α will generate a lift force l and a drag force d the components of these forces in both axial and tangential directions are denoted by fx and fθ respectively accordingly fθ creates the turbine rotor torque while fx causes thrust along the axis of the turbine rotor dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 thus for a rotating turbine in an oscillating flow the incidence angle varies from positive to negative values according to the upward and downward flow directions respectively see fig 1 since the rotor blade is symmetrical the tangential force fθ is acting in the same direction and it is independent of positive or negative values of α accordingly torque has a unidirectional feature that is created from an oscillating flow dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 the flow coefficient φ can be written as 1 φ ν u the flow coefficient is varied accordingly to the variation of the axial flow velocity v while keeping the rotational speed u constant consequently the torque coefficient c t can be expressed in equation 2 shaaban and abdel 2012 halder and samad 2015 as 2 c t t ρ ω 2 r 5 where t is the rotor torque ρ is the fluid density ω is the angular velocity and r is the rotor tip radius stagnation pressure drop coefficient c p is expressed in equation 3 shaaban and abdel 2012 halder and samad 2015 by the following formula 3 c p δ p ο ρ ω 2 r 5 where δ p o is the total pressure drop the turbine efficiency η is expressed as 4 η t ω δ p ο q where q is the volume flow rate rotor solidity is an important parameter that affects the performance of wells turbines the rotor solidity σ is defined as 5 σ z c 2 π r where z is the number of blades c is the chord length and r is the radius from eq 5 varying the number of turbine blades affects the rotor solidity σ 3 methodology and validation in the present work the effect of using water as a working fluid on wells turbine performance is numerically studied by solving the 3d incompressible rans equation for unidirectional water flow the main target of any turbulence model used with the rans scheme is to accurately model the reynolds stresses in this work the realizable k ε turbulence model is employed besides the enhanced wall functions are applied in the modeling of near wall flow the combination of the realizable k ϵ turbulence model and the enhanced wall functions allow good prediction of the aerodynamic performance of such configuration besides the moving reference frame method is used to represent the turbine rotor but the main governing equations are solved in the absolute frame the finite volume method is used to discretize the absolute frame using the cfd code fluent the present investigation utilizes different discretization schemes these schemes are 1 standard scheme for pressure 2 simplec algorithm used pressure velocity coupling 3 the second order upwind scheme used for momentum 4 kinetic energy k 5 turbulence dissipation rate ϵ the simplec algorithm utilized for pressure velocity coupling decreases the effect of mesh skewness on the final solution the considered maximum residual values of the solutions are 10 4 for continuity momentum and turbulence equations 3 1 mesh independent study the wells turbine geometry of curran and gato 1996 is used in this study table 1 presents the specifications of the wells turbine that is under investigation the 360 full cylindrical domains of six blade and eight blade rotors are reduced to slices of domain angles θ 60 and 45 of the full domains respectively see fig 4 this reduction was made due to the turbine rotor symmetry around the rotational axis and to reduce the computational processing and memory demand shaaban and abdel 2012 moreover table 2 shows meshing and boundary conditions for the flow domain figs 4 and 5 depict the computational domain and the computational mesh respectively to guarantee that the flow at the turbine is not affected by the boundaries the large cylindrical domain extended 4 and 8 blade chord lengths upstream and downstream of the rotor respectively shaaban and abdel 2012 here fine grids are utilized near the blade surface this is used to detect the flow field inside the boundary layer all the computational meshes that appeared in the presented work are created using the ansys meshing fig 5 illustrates the unstructured mesh consists of tetrahedral elements employed on the total flow domain in the present work the total number of elements in the domain is 2 580 800 the unstructured tetrahedral elements are substantially increased in the vicinity of wall boundaries to get a normalized wall distance y 1 keeping y 5 confirms the capability of resolving the viscous sub layer and consequently using wall functions could be omitted this is achieved by employing inflation or the so called prismatic layers on the surface of the hub blade and casing the number of inflation layers is 20 with a growth rate of 1 3 for all wall boundaries the height of the first layer normal to the wall is set to be about 4 10 6 m to achieve y 1 at all operating conditions the domain inlet and outlet conditions are uniform velocity and outlet pressure respectively no slip wall conditions are considered for the blades shroud and hub surfaces φ is varied from 0 075 to 0 32 and the turbine rotational speed was kept constant 2000 rpm hence the blade tip velocity was kept constant fig 6 presents the minimal influence of mesh size on the cfd results this is achieved by demonstrating the effect of mesh size on simulated η at φ 0 15 the mesh size was increased in five gradual steps from 1 440 182 cells to 4 057 831 cells while maintaining the normalized wall distance y 1 at the same φ this test indicated that the maximum percentage of the deviations of c t η and c p are 1 95 1 85 and 0 8 respectively cells number 2 580 800 was found to be the optimum solution quality where the numerical results are independent of the mesh size consequently this number of cells was used throughout the present work 3 2 model validation validation curves of η c t and c p have been accomplished against φ as shown in fig 7 a and b and 7 c respectively furthermore other experimental curran and gato 1996 and theoretical results torresi et al 2008 shaaban and abdel 2012 halder and samad 2015 were plotted the cfd results show more matching with the previous experimental work of curran and gato 1996 when compared with the other theoretical results the predicted turbine torque coefficient in this work is slightly lower than that of the experimental work except for the stall margin while the stagnation pressure drop coefficient is almost the same hence the turbine efficiency of the present computational results before the stalling point is slightly lower see fig 7 a the value of peak efficiency obtained from the present calculation differs by approximately 6 and occurs at almost the same value as the flow coefficient of experimental results φ 0 1 accordingly in general the present cfd model is accepted as a computational tool for wells turbine performance it has the benefit that it can detect not only the performance of different wells turbine configurations but also the flow field around the turbine blades the implemented methodology was validated against experimental data of curran and gato 1996 besides verification of the circumferential groove shape is achieved for satisfaction fig 8 shows that the present numerical results of the rectangular groove shape have good matching with halder and samad 2016 4 results and discussions the results of the wells turbine operating performance are revealed in this section with different parameters accordingly three subsections are introduced that are performance for the submersible turbine the effect of the number of blades for the submersible turbine and the blade tip groove casing 4 1 immersed turbine performance this section mainly presents and discusses the results obtained from a reliable cfd simulation to investigate the performance of the immersed wells turbine in water fig 9 demonstrates the variations of η c t and c p at different values of φ for the two working fluids air and water the results show that the turbine efficiency working with water as a working fluid is slightly higher than that of air through the φ range from 0 1 to 0 175 otherwise through the φ range from 0 2 to 0 3 the immersed wells turbine in water efficiency is enhanced significantly this is due to the specific weight of water at φ 0 275 the efficiency η equals 0 04 and 0 4 for air and water respectively the maximum percentage increase in η is achieved at φ 0 3 which equals 400 due to the change of working fluid besides the wells turbine immersed in water has a wider operating range than in air for instance at turbine efficiency η 0 5 the hydraulic wells turbine has an operating range of about 1 5 times its range in air on the other hand c t in the case of water is slightly higher than that of air in the same range of ϕ as mentioned in the efficiency c t reaches its maximum values of 0 11 at φ 0 25 and 0 18 at φ 0 275 for air and water respectively the maximum percentage increase in c t equals 430 at φ 0 275 relative increase based on the torque coefficient of air see fig 9 consequently the main reason for the increased c t is the momentum of the working fluid and the delay of the separation c p is gradually increased as the φ increases for the two types of working fluids despite the increase in density and viscosity of the working fluid c p has not changed through the whole range of operation the performance of the immersed wells turbine is better than the air wells turbine through the whole range of operation from φ 0 075 to φ 0 3 the stall point of the air wells turbine has occurred at φ 0 25 while the stall point of the hydraulic wells turbine is shifted to some higher value φ 0 275 than that working with air to explain the effect of using water instead of air as a working fluid for wells turbine an investigation is also performed on the flow field around the turbine blades the flow characteristics can be explained in more detail by analyzing the flow field through the turbine for different flow regimes before and after stall condition the flow velocity and pressure fields are demonstrated for conventional and immersed wells turbine as shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the comparison of flow field between air and water is established at values of φ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 and h 10 50 and 90 however in the case of the pressure field the demonstration is done for both pressure and suction sides at φ 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 it is noticed that there are two important regions the wake region formed on the suction side near the leading edge and the vortex region on the suction side at the trailing edge as shown in fig 10 a the size and location of such two regions have a vital effect on the performance of the wells turbine as the flow coefficient increases there is a slight decrease in the wake region size on the suction side however at the same time there is an increase in the vortex region size near the trailing edge in the case of water as a working fluid the two regions are relatively smaller than those in the case of air at all values of φ on the other hand the two regions are decreased in size as h increases as revealed in fig 10 b hence the tip leakage flow affects primarily the size of both the wake region and the vortex region generally the size of the two regions is smaller in water than in air because of the specific weight and viscosity of water consequently a little chance for a boundary layer separation may be happening fig 11 shows the pressure field through both the pressure and suction sides of the wells turbine blade working with air and water three important pressure regions are affecting dramatically the wells turbine performance two of them are located on the suction side negative and low while the third located on the pressure side high the negative and low pressure regions on the suction side represent the location of the wake region and the vortex region respectively as φ is increased both the negative and low pressure regions are increasing also the high pressure region increases as φ increases the difference in pressure between the high pressure region and the negative pressure region creates the force required for power generation hence the location of the two regions relative to each other contributes significantly to the performance of such a turbine at φ 0 1 there is a very thin layer of both high pressure and negative pressure regions which reflects a streamlined flow around the turbine blade as a result higher turbine efficiency is achieved as depicted in fig 9 4 2 effect of number of blades in the literature the recommended number of blades of wells turbine is eight gato et al 1996 curran and gato 1996 torresi et al 2008 thakker and abdulhadi 2008 or six setoguchi et al 2003b thakker and abdulhadi 2008 it is notable to mention that the wells turbine with the eight blade rotor was used in the present model as in curran and gato 1996 for convenience fig 12 demonstrates the variation of η c p and c t with φ for six and eight blade rotor wells turbines the eight blade rotor has η values of 0 51 0 59 through the φ range of 0 1 0 25 while the six blade rotor has higher η values of 0 62 0 7 through the smaller φ range of 0 1 0 2 so the eight blade rotor operating range exceeds thus of the six blade rotor by nearly 50 besides the values of η of the six blade rotor are more than that of the eight blade rotor by approximately 20 on the other hand the efficiency of the six blade and eight blade rotors suffer a drastic drop at values of φ more than 0 2 and 0 25 respectively furthermore the eight blade rotor has higher values of c p and c t than that of the six blade from these results it can conclude that each rotor has a certain privilege over the other however the eight blade rotor is more suitable as it is convenient for wider operating conditions when the turbine is operated with a high density fluid water as a working fluid the turbine will have a better performance see fig 9 fig 13 presents an innovative owc plant which it s patented by boccotti 2002 that allows the use of such unusual turbines immersed inside seawater and supposed to be moved directly utilizing the oscillating water flow on the other hand there are more intensive works still required to present a complete description of the characteristics of the turbine performance generally the present study confirmed that the hydraulic immersed wells turbine obtain a better performance than that of the air conventional wells turbine all over the operating range the air wells turbine deals with air saturated with moisture where the humidity ratio reaches 100 therefore wells turbine already operates in a harsh environmental area so the turbine material used must be treated carefully even the turbine is submerged inside the water regarding performing a new operating concept of immersing wells turbine in the water and its mechanical and economic impacts the percentage increase in the generation capacity and the enhancements in the turbine performance could overcome any extra economic or mechanical aspects 4 3 blade tip groove casing in this subsection the effect of six different shapes of tip groove casing has been investigated on the performance of the immersed wells turbine in water for convenience the performance is compared with the immersed wells turbine without tip groove according to the data the multi groove shapes have a different influence on the turbine performance than that of basic groove shapes therefore two groups of figures are herein presented one for multi shapes and the other for basic shapes 4 3 1 effect of multi groove shapes foremost the three multi groove shapes are tested as shown in fig 14 at high flow coefficients it is found that the three multi groove shapes show poor performance compared with immersed wells turbines without the groove on the other side at a very narrow range of φ 0 1 0 15 the triangle and rectangle multi groove shapes improve slightly the wells turbine efficiency the maximum efficiency reaches 61 5 for both the triangle and rectangle multi groove shapes compared with 58 5 in the case of without groove for the wells turbines without the groove η is decreased gradually from 58 up to 51 through the range of φ from 0 15 to 0 25 respectively unfortunately for the triangle and rectangle multi groove shapes a steep decrease in η from 58 up to approximately 15 through the range of φ from 0 15 to 0 2 furthermore in the case of multi rectangular and multi triangle shapes it is noticed that the η c p and c t at the range of φ of 0 2 0 25 are not so smooth see fig 14 this is due to the mutual effect between the high flow velocity at the blade tip clearance and the multi groove casing besides the interaction between the vortex region and the wake region near the blade tip h 50 90 see fig 15 however the curved multi groove shape deteriorates such turbine performance through the whole range of φ the multi groove shapes reduce intensely the c t which reflects its bad effect on the performance of the immersed well turbines in the water these results are guidelines for the other researchers to reduce their efforts and not to use such multi groove shapes for performance enhancement the flow field of the immersed wells turbine in water with multi groove shapes is illustrated in fig 15 a and b for different values of φ and h respectively at h 0 5 and φ 0 2 the vortex region occupies the whole suction side of the blade due to stall and scavenges the wake region downstream it see fig 15 a this reduces the pressure difference between the pressure side and suction side which in turn loses the power generated from the blade at the same value of h 0 5 the vortex region grows more at φ 0 3 and separates the wake region from the blade suction side hence a stalled flow has been accomplished and the blade fades its ability for doing work fig 15 b demonstrates the vortex region propagation from the blade hub to its tip at φ 0 2 as h increases the vortex region grows very harsh and eats up the wake region fig 16 demonstrates the static pressure field through both the pressure side and suction side of the immersed wells turbine in water the location of the small negative pressure region accompanying the wake region exists on the suction side at φ 0 1 and 0 2 however at φ 0 3 there is no negative pressure region attached to the suction side surface because of the stalled flow 4 3 2 effect of basic groove shapes fig 17 demonstrates the results of the three basic groove shapes rectangular triangular and curved shapes it is observed that utilizing such grooves influence positively the immersed wells turbine performance it is clear from fig 17 a that the tip grooved turbine has a larger operating range with higher efficiency than that without the groove at a very narrow range of φ 0 125 0 15 the rectangular and triangular groove shapes enhance slightly the wells turbine efficiency and the curved groove declines such turbine efficiency however at φ 0 2 the basic groove shapes strongly increase the η which reflects its good effect on the performance of such a turbine moreover the basic groove shapes reduce c p see fig 17 c at φ 0 15 0 3 the triangular groove shape dominates the enhancement of η through the range 0 62 0 66 compared with 0 58 0 1 for the turbine without groove respectively the maximum η and c t reaches 0 66 and 0 2 respectively at φ 0 275 also at φ 0 275 the percentage increase achieved in η and c t are 65 and 14 28 respectively compared with those without groove at φ 0 3 for the triangular groove the maximum percentage increase in η and c t are 4 5 and 3 times their values without groove respectively for the rectangular tip groove the maximum η reaches 0 63 at φ 0 275 however the maximum c t reaches 0 187 at φ 0 3 the percentage increase in η achieved is 55 at φ 0 275 relative to the turbine without the groove although the maximum percentage increase in the turbine η and c t are 4 8 and 2 6 times their values without groove located at φ 0 3 on the other hand the curved groove shape has a slight effect on the turbine performance although it has a good effect on the turbine performance in the higher values of φ comparing between the turbine without the groove and that with the curved groove it can be noted that the maximum c t decreased from 0 176 at φ 0 275 to 0 159 at φ 0 3 in addition the maximum efficiency shifted from 0 58 at φ 0 1 to 0 565 at φ 0 2 despite this the turbine efficiency reaches 0 534 at φ 0 3 with the curved groove scheme as a result the maximum percentage increase in the turbine efficiency with the curved groove scheme is 3 85 times their value without groove which is located at φ 0 3 by analogy fig 18 a and b illustrated the flow field of the immersed wells turbine in water with basic groove shapes for different values of φ and h respectively fig 18 a describes the size propagation of both the wake region and the vortex region concerning φ according to the increase in φ the enlargement in the wake region size on the blade suction side enhances the wells turbine efficiency as mentioned in fig 17 a it is noticed that at φ 0 3 a very large vortex region has been formed on the blade suction side in the case of the triangular groove fig 18 b reveals the reduction of the size of the wake region along with the blade height at h 10 50 and 90 fig 19 demonstrates the static pressure field through the pressure and suction sides of the immersed wells turbine with basic groove shapes for rectangular and curved grooves the size of the wake region increases as the φ is raised however for the triangular groove the location of the wake region is reduced at φ 0 3 because of the stalled flow 5 conclusions the present work aims to enhance the wells turbine performance and to increase its operating range an immersed wells turbine in water is investigated in this work and compared with the conventional air turbine as well as its number of blades are studied furthermore the present work introduces the effect of six different casing grooves at the tip of the turbine blades three of these grooves are basic shapes triangle rectangle and curved and the other three grooves are multiple of those basic shapes the turbine performance is investigated using a realizable k ε model where its numerical results were validated the model is based on the 3d incompressible rans equation in the rotating reference frame accordingly the following conclusions are taken i the maximum percentage increase of the immersed wells turbine in η is achieved at φ 0 3 that equals 400 due to the change of working fluid ii the immersed wells turbine has an operating range of about 1 5 times its range in the air at the turbine efficiency η 0 5 iii the efficiency of the six blade rotor in most of its operating range is higher than the eight blades however the eight blade rotor has a wider operating range that exceeds the six blade rotor by nearly 50 this makes the eight blades are more convenient for different operating conditions iv the three grooves of multi basic shapes lead to poor wells turbine performance v applying basic groove configuration on immersed wells turbine to performance enhancement and wider operating range vi for the triangular groove the maximum percentage increase in η and c t is 4 5 and 3 times their values without groove respectively vii the present concept may be a promising issue for further wells turbine investigations and optimization credit authorship

20951,a neural network based fuzzy controller is proposed to attenuate the irregular wave induced vibration of a steel jacket offshore platform firstly the offshore platform is modeled as a system with time varying control delay under random wave forces secondly disturbance rejection measures are taken in designing an optimal controller containing delayed states thirdly neural networks are adopted to observe and restore the controlled system in order to learn the delayed control law using instant state finally fuzzy models are constructed for reducing the complexity in data collecting and neural network training trained with sample data from fuzzy models the neuro fuzzy observation system is able to reconstruct the control system and the generalized neural network based controller works efficiently in different delayed cases it achieves better vibration attenuating performance under uncertain control delay and random waves when compared to existed optimal control laws and fuzzy controllers without neural networks the main contributions of this paper are 1 obtaining a neural network based observer in state approximation 2 designing a neural network based controller based on fuzzy rules to cope with random control delay keywords offshore platform uncertain control delay fuzzy observer neural network based controller 1 introduction in the past decades vibration control of offshore platforms in complex marine conditions gained much attention li and sau lon james hu 2002 offshore structures bear various environmental loads during lifetime elhanafi et al 2017 and inevitably suffer from detrimental vibration to ensure the structural stability as well as the safety of personnel it is necessary to study different control strategies and minimize the vibration kandasamy et al 2016 robust control method is a typical active control approach to reduce the effect on platform structure injected by disturbances including h control xie and ma 2015 yang 2018 sliding mode control som and das 2018 and h2 control li et al 2003 optimal control is a widely applied control strategy ma et al 2006 utilizing state feedback and disturbance feedforward channels zhang et al 2014 when implementing any of these control methods however researchers always need to offset extra perturbation caused by practical interference factors such as random control delay in engineering time delay comes from transmission between sensors and computation in controllers zhang et al 2019 leading to structure dynamic change or even control failure some delay losses can be compensated by the formula transformation concerning derived delay free control models ma et al 2009 researchers also find positive utilization of introducing delay intentionally adopting delayed laws artificially nourisola et al 2015 the inherent and unique response characteristics of some algorithms yield more satisfactory outcomes when reacting to delayed states zhang and tang 2013 for networked control systems uncertain delay usually includes control time delay combining packet dropouts and disordering ma et al 2019a when dealing with these large packet dropouts and serious data disordering adding buffers in communication channels is efficient hamdan and mahmoud 2018 ma et al 2019b actual control delay in offshore platforms usually varies with time yet few research results focus on that several scholars discussed the time changing delay in a tension flag platform saeed et al 2018 but aforementioned jacket platforms are significantly different from this floating platform in locating environment sea conditions and characteristics therefore we cannot directly transplant their algorithms for floating plants to our control system it is better to extend the existed compensation measures for jacket platforms under fixed delay to the cases with time varying delay using auxiliary tools a typical approach for addressing changing delay problem is to observe or estimate uncertain states under some restrictions cao et al 2021 state estimators can minimize the approximation error while the delay function has to be differentiable with its derivative bounded lu et al 2018 or else with the initial delay interval divided into several subintervals wang and han 2018 the risk of instability is also mitigated by state estimators through wirtinger inequality and markovian jump sun 2018 zhang et al 2020a moreover neural networks have been testified as powerful observation tools in handling uncertain engineering problems with fewer limits wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b they guarantee the ultimate bound of tracking error park et al 2017 and compensate the lumped uncertainty due to parametric variations mixed with un modeled dynamics xu et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 the monitoring system based on neural networks maps the power distributions obtaining estimated frequency and magnitude output abbasi et al 2015 furthermore data driven optimal controllers provide higher efficiency through the improved learning criterion wang et al 2017 wang and mu 2017 intelligent control is realized online on the basis of both the identified model and the linear or nonlinear controller mohammad and hao 2018 the learning capability together with low computational complexity of neural networks is properly leveraged in identifying and rebuilding the control function jafari et al 2021 asymptotic tracking control problems under external disturbance and time varying output constraints are solved where uncertain dynamics are approximated by reusable adaptive neural networks wu et al 2019 wu and wang 2020 good transient and steady state performance is provided without explicit knowledge li et al 2016 inspired by these neural network based applications mentioned above we adopt neural networks to estimate system states in dealing with tricky random delay problems our aim is to obtain a relationship between non delayed states and random delayed control forces following ideas similar but different to the uncertain tracking problems with reusable neural networks restoring a neural network based observation system as the supplement of optimal control strategies is the first motivation of this paper although neural networks do not need nominal description of uncertain models they require a substantial amount of training data when restoring models with partly unknown parameters fuzzy methods are adopted to reduce working load ma et al 2019c takagi sugeno t s model approach has been proposed to construct systems with incomplete information where local dynamics in different regions are represented by linear models jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 based on uncertain estimating and tracking theories markov processes and simplified fuzzy models are utilized to rebuild the control system jiang and han 2007 chattering is avoided with the sliding control function adjusted according to fuzzy logic tuning schemes ngo et al 2017 noticing that although fuzzy neural network control approach is developed in recent years qiao et al 2018 it is not widely used for lack of long term practical foundation as neural network control method and fuzzy control method are both advanced approximation approaches wang et al 2020b they potentially get better performance when implemented as different parts in the same system sarrafan et al 2012 chairez 2013 the nonlinear delayed system is roughly approximated by fuzzy delayed linear models and designed typical control laws are applied to the fuzzy blending of models wang et al 2018 similarly the t s fuzzy active scheme working in fault and disturbance estimation significantly reduces the control cost li et al 2018 noting that fuzzy methods competently tackle these uncertain problems in a simplified way with reduced computation load the second motivation of this paper is to simplify the neural network based observation system by t s fuzzy rules in this paper we design a neuro fuzzy optimal controller for jacket type offshore platforms combining the advantages of introducing delay sets deliberately and applying estimation states properly we are motivated to extend the core method about known fixed control delay to a random delayed control environment and adopt observing techniques compared to adding buffers or taking an exhaustion method this neural network based observer does not need to sort delayed data besides the accurate delay values are not required either as rough data is adequate firstly we introduce delayed system states and wave force items into the controller with preset control delay neural networks are adopted to restore the system response states in a predefined ideal scenario that all the delayed values are known and learn the inner relationship among delayed states disturbances and control forces secondly we utilize t s fuzzy approximation strategy to get sample data by taking fuzzy systems as ideal estimation systems the proposed estimator observes the system state output but bypass part of the introduced delayed items working as an intelligent approach with promising learning capability finally we extract a neuro fuzzy controller which achieves comparable or even better performance than other controllers while computational load is reduced the learning capability of the proposed intelligent controller makes it competent to suppress the uncertainty

modeling of offshore platform we focus on the jacket type offshore platforms in bohai bay as shown in fig 1 and the system with an active mass damper amd mechanism is simplified into a single degree

displacement of offshore structure is denoted by x 1 the mass stiffness frequency and damping ratio of the amd located at the deck are denoted to be m 2 ω 2 and ξ 2 while the displacement of the amd is x 2 the motion is described by the following coupled differential equations 1 x 1 t ω 1 2 ω 2 2 m 2 m 1 x 1 t ω 2 2 m 2 m 1 x 2 t 2 ξ 1 ω ξ 2 ω 2 m 2 m 1 x 1 t 2 ξ 2 ω 2 m 2 m 1 x 2 f t u t τ t m 1

random wave forces acting on the offshore platform are described as following li et al 2003 ma et al 2009 2019a wave is composed by wave components and the wave evaluation is 3 η t j 1 r η j t j 1 r a

12 satisfy 13 λ j j g 1 j j 1 2 2 r all the poles on the unit circle are the simple roots of minimum polynomial of g so that exosystem 12 is asymptotically stable 3 design of delay compensation scheme this section describes compensation measures to deal with uncertain control delay control laws with defined control delay are proposed a neural network based observer system is introduced to rebuild the control system and to find a universal controller suitable for every delayed case 3 1 control laws with transformation under preset delay assuming that the value of control delay h k is knowing we define a controller with the delayed states for the platform vibration problem we need to introduce some pre conditions first when n we define the quadratic average cost index as 14 j 1 n k 1 n x t k q x k u t k r u k where q r n n and r r m m are positive matrices assumption 1 a b is completely controllable and a q 1 2 is completely observable theorem 1 considering the offshore platform system 2 under random wave force 12 there exists a vibration suppression control law incorporated with every delayed state expressed as 15 u k k x h k x k k ω h k ω k l k h k k 1 k x l x l k ω l ω l where 16 k

h k b h k proof we adopt a transformation ma et al 2009 22 z k x k l k h k k 1 a k l 1 a h k b u l and rebuild 2 through a new model as 23 z k 1 a z k b h k u k d f k where b h k a h k b the new quadratic average cost index is defined as 24 j 1 n k 1 n z t k q z k u t k r u k apply minimum principle to it we can get 25 u k r 1 b h k t λ k 1 and 26 λ k q z k a t λ k 1 set 27 λ k p h k z k p h

guaranteed unique by the existence of matrices p h k and p h k the existence and uniqueness of p h k follow from the assumption 1 with a b h k is completely controllable considering the stein equation 21 it has a unique solution if and only if 29 λ i i a t i p h k b h k s h k 1 b h k t λ j j g 1 i i 1 2 n j j 1 2 2 r according to optimal control theory we have 30 λ i i a t i p h k b h k s h k 1 b h

the relationship of u k x k x k 1 x k h we substitute 22 into 28 and get 32 u k s h k 1 b h k t p h k ax k s h k 1 b h k t p h k df p h k g ω k s h k 1 b h k t p h k a l k h k k 1 a k l 1 a h k bu l define 16 17 18 and 19 we can get 15 this completes the proof substituting 15 to 2 derives 33 x k 1 ax k df k bk x h k x k b l k h k k 1 k x l x l k ω l ω l bk ω h k ω k k k h k k means that in time k control law u k is calculating with current states in time k while the controller plant system runs with delayed states u k h k it s noticed that for each time delay h k at the particular time we have a corresponding transformed control law and the question is to decide which particular group of computed matrices are adopted when control delay is time varying and unknown if the control delay is detected as a fixed constant the control law in 15 will roll back to a constant delayed version ma et al 2009 when the delay is random and time varying however the new challenge is to decide which group of delayed states will be picked for constructing a controller therefore we build a neural network based observation system to approximate system 2 and try to find concise correlations between system inner states 3 2 neural network based observer system restore in this subsection we restore a system specifically to obtain the expression of x k 1 in 33 x k 1 is calculated with a huge group of past states including x k ω k x k 1 ω k 1 x k h k and ω k h k while x k is already a reflection of x k 1 ω k 1 x k h k and ω k h k therefore it is sensible to derive x k 1 only by x k and ω k in that case we design a neural network based observer system as shown in fig 2 which can essentially indicate the relationship of x k ω k and x k 1 to approximate the complicated functions and to learn the hidden relationship between the delayed control forces and real time states as listed in 33 we introduce neural networks into the restored control system considering the different inherent characteristics of wave force and system response two neural networks are utilized for each group of items respectively the first type has system state x as feedback input and the second type has wave force base vector ω as feedforward input define weight matrices and thresholds w x 1 w ω 1 b x 1 and b ω 1 we can get the neural network based observation system with two single hidden layer neural networks by 34 x ˆ k 1 a x ˆ k b w x 1 h x x ˆ k b x 1 w ω 1 h ω ω k b ω 1 d f k e k and 35 y ˆ k c x ˆ k 1 where x ˆ k is the estimated state of x k e k is observation error derived by e k y k y ˆ k y ˆ k is observed output h x and h ω are the outputs of hidden layers each neural network has one hidden layer with the output 36 h x x ˆ k o w x 2 x ˆ k b x 2 h ω ω k o w ω 2 ω k b ω 2 in which o is activation function as o x 2 1 e 2 x 1 and w x 2 w ω 2 b x 2 b ω 2 are weight matrices and thresholds in hidden layers in 33 x k 1 is computed by parameters k x h k k ω h k k x l k ω l and past states x k ω k x k 1 ω k 1 x k h k and ω k h k compared to that 34 can bypass most delayed states and approximate x k 1 more sufficiently with x k and ω k by calculating every predefined case with control delay training the neural networks with these samples from 33 and comparing the observation error we can find a proper controller based on this observation system with fixed parameters catering for the vibration system with random delay for experimental implementation wave sensors are attached to the steel legs of the offshore platform our control method is supposed to be incorporated inside the amd or a similar active control device and the key function is to provide accurate control forces as the designed controller output the flow chart of the control structure is listed in fig 3 4 neural network based controller design with fuzzy method once the neural network based observation system can observe the states in system 2 with random control delay the vibration system can be stabilized by the controller based on the mature neural networks updating laws and training examples are introduced as following 4 1 updating laws and neural network based controller structure iterating and training period is needed before getting all the neural network parameters we set e k 1 2 e t k p e e k with constant matrix p e and update parameters by the gradient descent method after meeting the iteration goal the neural networks will get the optimal condition where all parameters are defined as w x 1 b x 1 w x 2 b x 2 w ω 1 b ω 1 w ω 2 and b ω 2 based on the restored system 34 after training we can get a reliable vibration controller as following theorem 2 considering the vibration control system 2 with varying control delay under random wave force 12 there exists a stable neural network vibration controller 37 based on the observation system 34 to suppress the vibration 37 u ˆ k w x h x x ˆ k b x w ω h ω ω k b ω where u ˆ is the estimated control force proof training data comes from 33 therefore the initial asymptotic stability of 34 is guaranteed by the proof in theorem 1 we need to prove its ultimate bound substituting 37 into system 2 and comparing it with 34 we have 38 c 1 e k e k ac 1 e k 1 b b x 1 b x 1 b b ω 1 b ω 1 b w x 1 h x x ˆ k w x 1 h x x ˆ k b w ω 1 h ω ω k w ω 1 h ω ω k define parameter errors w x 1 w x 1 w x 1 h x k h x x ˆ k h x x ˆ k b x 1 b x 1 b x 1 w ω 1 w ω 1 w ω 1 h ω k h ω ω k h ω ω k b ω 1 b ω 1 b ω 1 38 is expressed as 39 e k c 1 i 1 ac 1 e k 1 b w x 1 h x k w x 1 h x k w ω 1 h ω k w ω 1 h ω k b x 1 b ω 1 after training all the parameter observation errors are supposed to be constants updating laws ensure that optimal parameters are constant matrices when cost function e k meets a setting goal besides 40 e k c 1 i 1 ac 1 e k 1 c 1 i 1 bw x 1 h x k c 1 i 1 b w x 1 h x k c 1 i 1 b b x 1 c 1 i 1 bw ω 1 h ω k c 1 i 1 b w ω 1 h ω k c 1 i 1 b b ω 1 meanwhile activation function in neural networks is bounded and then h k and h k are bounded with asymptotically convergent x k and initially bounded e 0 40 is bounded therefore the control system 2 under wave forces 12 with controller in 37 is stable this completes the proof structure of the mature neural network based controller is displayed in fig 4 a restriction of the compensation strategy mentioned above is that all the possibilities for h k are to be considered in advance in order to avoid overload we try to simplify the training and identification period for neural networks in next subsection 4 2 fuzzy method in control model obtaining instead of getting all the simulation cases calculated we build a t s fuzzy scheme without the pre defining each value of time varying control delay we can approximate the changing dynamics by t s fuzzy models assumption 2 for each sample time k random control delay h k has an upper bound h h and a lower bond h l satisfying h k h l h h according to t s fuzzy logic theory following fuzzy rules are employed in which the same fuzzy sets are shared plant rule i if h k is m iq then 41 x k 1 i 1 q φ i h i a x k b u i k h i d f k with φ i h i ϕ i m i q i 1 q ϕ i m i q ϕ i m i q is the weight of fuzzy set m iq φ i h i 0 i 1 q φ i h i 1 where i 1 2 q and q is the number of if then rules m iq is the fuzzy set corresponding to h k in assumption 2 and controller rule i h i is the known preset time delay for controller rule i and h i m iq control force u i is defined in controller rule i if h k is m iq 42 u i k k x h i x k k ω h i ω k l k h i k 1 k x l x l k ω l ω l the following algorithm summarizes the procedures to design a neuro fuzzy optimal controller algorithm 1 step 1 for control delay h k h l h h choose a fuzzy set m iq step 2 set h k h i and get sample data from model 41 under controller 42 according to certain fuzzy set and fuzzy rule step 3 train the neural network based observation system with data collected in step 2 taking x k ω k as input and x k 1 as output then the well trained observation system is stating as 43 x ˆ k 1 i 1 q φ i h i a x ˆ k df k e k b w x 1 i h x i x ˆ k h i b x 1 i w ω 1 i h ω i ω k h i b ω 1 i 44 y ˆ k c x ˆ k 1 where w x 1 i w ω 1 i b x 1 i and b ω 1 i are ideal weight matrices and thresholds for every rule i step 4 design an neural network based fuzzy optimal controller as 45 u ˆ i k i 1 q φ i h i w x 1 i h x i x ˆ k b x 1 i w ω 1 i h ω i ω k b ω 1 i step 5 test the control effect under system 2 based on the sample data of 41 42 under preset control delay weights and thresholds of neural networks are updated through iteration before they reach the optimal condition identification of suitable approximation for these values has to be realized offline it is actually a common restriction of most neural network controllers after training period the neural network based controller with optimal weights will replace the sample control law for better comparison fuzzy controllers without neural networks work independently in which the same fuzzy sets in the premise algorithm are shared the following algorithm summarizes the procedures to design a fuzzy controller algorithm 2 step 1 for control delay h k h l h h choose a fuzzy set m iq step 2 set h

remark 2 if wave forces are not taken into consideration when designing the controller the state feedback optimal control law sfoc is derived as 47 u k k x h k x k l k h k k 1 k x l x l accordingly observer system 34 for sfoc only has one type of neural network as 48 x ˆ k 1 a x ˆ k df k e k b w x 1 h x x ˆ k b x 1 simulation results for different control laws fuzzy controllers and fuzzy neural network based controllers are discussed in next section 5 simulation results in this section the parameters of sea conditions and an offshore platform under irregular wave forces are given the

has been minimized two t s fuzzy rules for delay compensation are adopted as controller rule 1 if h k is m 12 then fuzzy optimal controller is 51 u 1 k k x h 1 x k k ω h 1 ω k l k h 1 k 1 k x l x l k ω l ω l controller rule 2 if h k is m 22 then fuzzy optimal controller is 52 u 2 k k x h 2 x k k ω h 2 ω k l k h 2 k 1 k x l x l k ω l ω l fuzzy systems for training data are built by rules plant rule

expectation of h k as h i and the probability density function of h k as φ i h i under rule i as for neuro fuzzy controllers the network structure is decided by experience for every neural network we take a three layer structure and each hidden layer contains 7 nodes the maximum number of iteration generation for each neural network is 20 and observation error e k stays around 1 5 1 neuro fuzzy optimal controllers based on different control laws in this subsection we set h l 0 and h h 100 then h k m 12 delay values are shown in fig 6 a in which the details around simulation time t 50s are enlarged to show the tendency more clearly considering controller rules in designing fuzzy controllers only h 1 50 fuzzy set m 12 and controller rule 1 are adopted based on sfoc the fuzzy optimal controller 1 foc1 is derived from algorithm 2 similarly the delay internal and fuzzy set indicate that plant rule 1 is adopted when collecting sample data by algorithm 1 for neural network training neuro fuzzy optimal controller 1 nfoc1 based on sfoc is constructed to reject disturbance and get smaller vibration responses a feedforward part of the wave force is introduced into the control law based on ffoc in 19 the fuzzy optimal controller 2 foc2 is obtained from algorithm 2 collecting data through algorithm 1 we can get the neuro fuzzy optimal controller 2 nfoc2 in consideration of feedback and feedforward channels we adopt two kinds of neural networks for system state items and wave force items respectively it is noticed that feedforward and feedback control laws with disturbance rejection method have smaller vibration responses and smaller control forces than state feedback control laws in fig 7 in comparison of sfoc foc1 nfoc1 in table 3 the peak values and standard deviations for structure response of ffoc foc2 and nfoc2 decrease after adding wave force items into control channel when discussing max deviations foc2 reduces 34 23 of displacement response and 57 85 of acceleration response when compared with no control situation with only half the control force of ffoc 5 2 neuro fuzzy optimal controllers for a larger delay period in this subsection we set a larger delay period as h l 0 and h h 150 as shown in fig 5 b more fuzzy rules are predefined in dealing with a higher level of uncertainty adopting fuzzy controller rules 1 2 and fuzzy sets m 12 m 22 the fuzzy optimal controller 3 foc3 is built through algorithm 2 neuro fuzzy optimal controller 3 nfoc3 is constructed through algorithm 1 we notice that a relatively larger control delay brings uncertainty into the control system following more violent vibration of the platform as shown in fig 8 when comparing control forces and structure responses fuzzy optimal controller foc3 and neuro fuzzy optimal controller nfoc3 have similar control performance adopting disturbance rejection approach in ffoc more intelligent controllers containing feedback and feedforward channels have been designed fuzzy optimal controller 4 foc4 under fuzzy controller rules 1 2 is described through algorithm 2 for better control effects neuro fuzzy optimal controller 4 nfoc4 is constructed through algorithm 1 with two types of neural networks when adopting disturbance rejection method both foc3 and foc4 are competent to reduce vibration as shown in figs 8 and 9 and table 4 while control delay is not accurate we can see that fuzzy optimal controllers foc3 foc4 and neuro fuzzy optimal controllers nfoc3 nfoc4 under uncertain control delay are equivalent to controllers sfoc and ffoc in ideal situations where control delay is known for better comparison we introduce a delayed h controller dhc zhang and tang 2013 and a wavelet neural network based vibration controller wnn ma et al 2017 for dhc we choose a possible case where h index is set as 0 5 introduced delay as 0 22s for equation computation and simulate with random control delay from 0s to 1 5s in comparable of dhc our controllers provide more appropriate control forces and get more desired performance for wnn we list a case when control delay is set as 0s as simulation results indicate that it loses effectiveness when the delay value varies from 0 to 1 5 it is obvious that we need much smaller control forces to reach a similar control performance simulation results show that fuzzy controllers require bigger forces than neuro fuzzy controllers when reaching a similar level of vibration suppression for the standard deviations nfoc4 reduces 32 32 of the displacement and 55 11 of the acceleration when compared to the original non controlled state the control force drops to less than a half of sfoc or three quarters of foc4 meanwhile the maximum responses decrease to 21 57 displacement and 43 56 acceleration of the no control situation for the same offshore platform in the same water depth d 13 2m as the original simulation we test the controller in harsh or stable sea conditions where wave height h s and peak frequency ω 0 are different simulation results are shown in table 5 6 conclusion and discussion in this paper we observe system states with neural networks and design neural fuzzy controllers to suppress the vibration of an offshore platform delayed states and disturbance items introduced into the control law design guarantee a good vibration attenuation performance when control system has random time delay the neural network based observation system estimates system output and straightly derives a simple controller with non delayed states based on neural networks trained by fuzzy data designed controllers can calculate control force output with non delayed states from simulation results we can see that proposed controllers have more desirable results when compared with previous control laws that are taken as training samples implied with sample sets under t s fuzzy rules neural network based fuzzy controllers reduce the vibration in a relatively long delay period our neural network based fuzzy control method does significantly suppress the vibration with reduced workload yet there are several flaws the first limitation lies in the reliability of samples as we have to collect initial historical data from real sensors or simulations regarding the uncertainty it is summarized by a simple function in our research however practical platforms may suffer from uncertainty which cannot be described mathematically and we will face unexpected situations in severe environmental condition the second restriction is about the implementation of this controller incorporated in a real offshore platform for now the entire simulation is accomplished in matlab and further research is needed for the complete implementation credit authorship contribution statement yun zhang

20951,a neural network based fuzzy controller is proposed to attenuate the irregular wave induced vibration of a steel jacket offshore platform firstly the offshore platform is modeled as a system with time varying control delay under random wave forces secondly disturbance rejection measures are taken in designing an optimal controller containing delayed states thirdly neural networks are adopted to observe and restore the controlled system in order to learn the delayed control law using instant state finally fuzzy models are constructed for reducing the complexity in data collecting and neural network training trained with sample data from fuzzy models the neuro fuzzy observation system is able to reconstruct the control system and the generalized neural network based controller works efficiently in different delayed cases it achieves better vibration attenuating performance under uncertain control delay and random waves when compared to existed optimal control laws and fuzzy controllers without neural networks the main contributions of this paper are 1 obtaining a neural network based observer in state approximation 2 designing a neural network based controller based on fuzzy rules to cope with random control delay keywords offshore platform uncertain control delay fuzzy observer neural network based controller 1 introduction in the past decades vibration control of offshore platforms in complex marine conditions gained much attention li and sau lon james hu 2002 offshore structures bear various environmental loads during lifetime elhanafi et al 2017 and inevitably suffer from detrimental vibration to ensure the structural stability as well as the safety of personnel it is necessary to study different control strategies and minimize the vibration kandasamy et al 2016 robust control method is a typical active control approach to reduce the effect on platform structure injected by disturbances including h control xie and ma 2015 yang 2018 sliding mode control som and das 2018 and h2 control li et al 2003 optimal control is a widely applied control strategy ma et al 2006 utilizing state feedback and disturbance feedforward channels zhang et al 2014 when implementing any of these control methods however researchers always need to offset extra perturbation caused by practical interference factors such as random control delay in engineering time delay comes from transmission between sensors and computation in controllers zhang et al 2019 leading to structure dynamic change or even control failure some delay losses can be compensated by the formula transformation concerning derived delay free control models ma et al 2009 researchers also find positive utilization of introducing delay intentionally adopting delayed laws artificially nourisola et al 2015 the inherent and unique response characteristics of some algorithms yield more satisfactory outcomes when reacting to delayed states zhang and tang 2013 for networked control systems uncertain delay usually includes control time delay combining packet dropouts and disordering ma et al 2019a when dealing with these large packet dropouts and serious data disordering adding buffers in communication channels is efficient hamdan and mahmoud 2018 ma et al 2019b actual control delay in offshore platforms usually varies with time yet few research results focus on that several scholars discussed the time changing delay in a tension flag platform saeed et al 2018 but aforementioned jacket platforms are significantly different from this floating platform in locating environment sea conditions and characteristics therefore we cannot directly transplant their algorithms for floating plants to our control system it is better to extend the existed compensation measures for jacket platforms under fixed delay to the cases with time varying delay using auxiliary tools a typical approach for addressing changing delay problem is to observe or estimate uncertain states under some restrictions cao et al 2021 state estimators can minimize the approximation error while the delay function has to be differentiable with its derivative bounded lu et al 2018 or else with the initial delay interval divided into several subintervals wang and han 2018 the risk of instability is also mitigated by state estimators through wirtinger inequality and markovian jump sun 2018 zhang et al 2020a moreover neural networks have been testified as powerful observation tools in handling uncertain engineering problems with fewer limits wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b they guarantee the ultimate bound of tracking error park et al 2017 and compensate the lumped uncertainty due to parametric variations mixed with un modeled dynamics xu et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 the monitoring system based on neural networks maps the power distributions obtaining estimated frequency and magnitude output abbasi et al 2015 furthermore data driven optimal controllers provide higher efficiency through the improved learning criterion wang et al 2017 wang and mu 2017 intelligent control is realized online on the basis of both the identified model and the linear or nonlinear controller mohammad and hao 2018 the learning capability together with low computational complexity of neural networks is properly leveraged in identifying and rebuilding the control function jafari et al 2021 asymptotic tracking control problems under external disturbance and time varying output constraints are solved where uncertain dynamics are approximated by reusable adaptive neural networks wu et al 2019 wu and wang 2020 good transient and steady state performance is provided without explicit knowledge li et al 2016 inspired by these neural network based applications mentioned above we adopt neural networks to estimate system states in dealing with tricky random delay problems our aim is to obtain a relationship between non delayed states and random delayed control forces following ideas similar but different to the uncertain tracking problems with reusable neural networks restoring a neural network based observation system as the supplement of optimal control strategies is the first motivation of this paper although neural networks do not need nominal description of uncertain models they require a substantial amount of training data when restoring models with partly unknown parameters fuzzy methods are adopted to reduce working load ma et al 2019c takagi sugeno t s model approach has been proposed to construct systems with incomplete information where local dynamics in different regions are represented by linear models jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 based on uncertain estimating and tracking theories markov processes and simplified fuzzy models are utilized to rebuild the control system jiang and han 2007 chattering is avoided with the sliding control function adjusted according to fuzzy logic tuning schemes ngo et al 2017 noticing that although fuzzy neural network control approach is developed in recent years qiao et al 2018 it is not widely used for lack of long term practical foundation as neural network control method and fuzzy control method are both advanced approximation approaches wang et al 2020b they potentially get better performance when implemented as different parts in the same system sarrafan et al 2012 chairez 2013 the nonlinear delayed system is roughly approximated by fuzzy delayed linear models and designed typical control laws are applied to the fuzzy blending of models wang et al 2018 similarly the t s fuzzy active scheme working in fault and disturbance estimation significantly reduces the control cost li et al 2018 noting that fuzzy methods competently tackle these uncertain problems in a simplified way with reduced computation load the second motivation of this paper is to simplify the neural network based observation system by t s fuzzy rules in this paper we design a neuro fuzzy optimal controller for jacket type offshore platforms combining the advantages of introducing delay sets deliberately and applying estimation states properly we are motivated to extend the core method about known fixed control delay to a random delayed control environment and adopt observing techniques compared to adding buffers or taking an exhaustion method this neural network based observer does not need to sort delayed data besides the accurate delay values are not required either as rough data is adequate firstly we introduce delayed system states and wave force items into the controller with preset control delay neural networks are adopted to restore the system response states in a predefined ideal scenario that all the delayed values are known and learn the inner relationship among delayed states disturbances and control forces secondly we utilize t s fuzzy approximation strategy to get sample data by taking fuzzy systems as ideal estimation systems the proposed estimator observes the system state output but bypass part of the introduced delayed items working as an intelligent approach with promising learning capability finally we extract a neuro fuzzy controller which achieves comparable or even better performance than other controllers while computational load is reduced the learning capability of the proposed intelligent controller makes it competent to suppress the uncertainty related vibration the rest of paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the modeling of the platform and wave forces section 3 introduces motivations for delay compensation methods and neural network based observation system settings section 4 is about a neural network based controller containing updating laws and t s fuzzy methods section 5 displays the simulation results and section 6 gets the conclusion 2 preliminaries the models of the offshore platform and wave forces are introduced in this section the motion equations for the simplified system are derived as following 2 1 modeling of offshore platform we focus on the jacket type offshore platforms in bohai bay as shown in fig 1 and the system with an active mass damper amd mechanism is simplified into a single degree

displacement of offshore structure is denoted by x 1 the mass stiffness frequency and damping ratio of the amd located at the deck are denoted to be m 2 ω 2 and ξ 2 while the displacement of the amd is x 2 the motion is described by the following coupled differential equations 1 x 1 t ω 1 2 ω 2 2 m 2 m 1 x 1 t ω 2 2 m 2 m 1 x 2 t 2 ξ 1 ω ξ 2 ω 2 m 2 m 1 x 1 t 2 ξ 2 ω 2 m 2 m 1 x 2 f t u t τ t m 1

obtain the state space model taking t as sample period and τ t as time varying delay where τ t h k t τ 0 0 τ 0 t yields the discrete time equation 2 x k 1 a x k b u k h k d f k k 0 1 y k c x k 1 where

random wave forces acting on the offshore platform are described as following li et al 2003 ma et al 2009 2019a wave is composed by wave components and the wave evaluation is 3 η t j 1 r η j t j 1 r a

the jth wave component t is time ε j is random phase angle uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π in the assumption of wave theory the total wave forces acting on the offshore platform can be expressed as the sum of wave component forces 4 f t j 1 r f j t for the jth wave component the wave force can be expressed as 5 f j t 0 d p j z t d z where d is water depth z is vertical axis zero at

the wave forces with ma et al 2009 2019a 9 v t ω 1 2 ω r 2 v t g a v t define ω t v t t v t t t i as unit matrix and 0 as zero matrix we have 10 ω t 0 i g a 0 ω t g c ω t and 11 f t t 11 t 1 r t 21 t

12 satisfy 13 λ j j g 1 j j 1 2 2 r all the poles on the unit circle are the simple roots of minimum polynomial of g so that exosystem 12 is asymptotically stable 3 design of delay compensation scheme this section describes compensation measures to deal with uncertain control delay control laws with defined control delay are proposed a neural network based observer system is introduced to rebuild the control system and to find a universal controller suitable for every delayed case 3 1 control laws with transformation under preset delay assuming that the value of control delay h k is knowing we define a controller with the delayed states for the platform vibration problem we need to introduce some pre conditions first when n we define the quadratic average cost index as 14 j 1 n k 1 n x t k q x k u t k r u k where q r n n and r r m m are positive matrices assumption 1 a b is completely controllable and a q 1 2 is completely observable theorem 1 considering the offshore platform system 2 under random wave force 12 there exists a vibration suppression control law incorporated with every delayed state expressed as 15 u k k x h k x k k ω h k ω k l k h k k 1 k x l x l k ω l ω l where 16 k

h k b h k proof we adopt a transformation ma et al 2009 22 z k x k l k h k k 1 a k l 1 a h k b u l and rebuild 2 through a new model as 23 z k 1 a z k b h k u k d f k where b h k a h k b the new quadratic average cost index is defined as 24 j 1 n k 1 n z t k q z k u t k r u k apply minimum principle to it we can get 25 u k r 1 b h k t λ k 1 and 26 λ k q z k a t λ k 1 set 27 λ k p h k z k p h

guaranteed unique by the existence of matrices p h k and p h k the existence and uniqueness of p h k follow from the assumption 1 with a b h k is completely controllable considering the stein equation 21 it has a unique solution if and only if 29 λ i i a t i p h k b h k s h k 1 b h k t λ j j g 1 i i 1 2 n j j 1 2 2 r according to optimal control theory we have 30 λ i i a t i p h k b h k s h k 1 b h

the relationship of u k x k x k 1 x k h we substitute 22 into 28 and get 32 u k s h k 1 b h k t p h k ax k s h k 1 b h k t p h k df p h k g ω k s h k 1 b h k t p h k a l k h k k 1 a k l 1 a h k bu l define 16 17 18 and 19 we can get 15 this completes the proof substituting 15 to 2 derives 33 x k 1 ax k df k bk x h k x k b l k h k k 1 k x l x l k ω l ω l bk ω h k ω k k k h k k means that in time k control law u k is calculating with current states in time k while the controller plant system runs with delayed states u k h k it s noticed that for each time delay h k at the particular time we have a corresponding transformed control law and the question is to decide which particular group of computed matrices are adopted when control delay is time varying and unknown if the control delay is detected as a fixed constant the control law in 15 will roll back to a constant delayed version ma et al 2009 when the delay is random and time varying however the new challenge is to decide which group of delayed states will be picked for constructing a controller therefore we build a neural network based observation system to approximate system 2 and try to find concise correlations between system inner states 3 2 neural network based observer system restore in this subsection we restore a system specifically to obtain the expression of x k 1 in 33 x k 1 is calculated with a huge group of past states including x k ω k x k 1 ω k 1 x k h k and ω k h k while x k is already a reflection of x k 1 ω k 1 x k h k and ω k h k therefore it is sensible to derive x k 1 only by x k and ω k in that case we design a neural network based observer system as shown in fig 2 which can essentially indicate the relationship of x k ω k and x k 1 to approximate the complicated functions and to learn the hidden relationship between the delayed control forces and real time states as listed in 33 we introduce neural networks into the restored control system considering the different inherent characteristics of wave force and system response two neural networks are utilized for each group of items respectively the first type has system state x as feedback input and the second type has wave force base vector ω as feedforward input define weight matrices and thresholds w x 1 w ω 1 b x 1 and b ω 1 we can get the neural network based observation system with two single hidden layer neural networks by 34 x ˆ k 1 a x ˆ k b w x 1 h x x ˆ k b x 1 w ω 1 h ω ω k b ω 1 d f k e k and 35 y ˆ k c x ˆ k 1 where x ˆ k is the estimated state of x k e k is observation error derived by e k y k y ˆ k y ˆ k is observed output h x and h ω are the outputs of hidden layers each neural network has one hidden layer with the output 36 h x x ˆ k o w x 2 x ˆ k b x 2 h ω ω k o w ω 2 ω k b ω 2 in which o is activation function as o x 2 1 e 2 x 1 and w x 2 w ω 2 b x 2 b ω 2 are weight matrices and thresholds in hidden layers in 33 x k 1 is computed by parameters k x h k k ω h k k x l k ω l and past states x k ω k x k 1 ω k 1 x k h k and ω k h k compared to that 34 can bypass most delayed states and approximate x k 1 more sufficiently with x k and ω k by calculating every predefined case with control delay training the neural networks with these samples from 33 and comparing the observation error we can find a proper controller based on this observation system with fixed parameters catering for the vibration system with random delay for experimental implementation wave sensors are attached to the steel legs of the offshore platform our control method is supposed to be incorporated inside the amd or a similar active control device and the key function is to provide accurate control forces as the designed controller output the flow chart of the control structure is listed in fig 3 4 neural network based controller design with fuzzy method once the neural network based observation system can observe the states in system 2 with random control delay the vibration system can be stabilized by the controller based on the mature neural networks updating laws and training examples are introduced as following 4 1 updating laws and neural network based controller structure iterating and training period is needed before getting all the neural network parameters we set e k 1 2 e t k p e e k with constant matrix p e and update parameters by the gradient descent method after meeting the iteration goal the neural networks will get the optimal condition where all parameters are defined as w x 1 b x 1 w x 2 b x 2 w ω 1 b ω 1 w ω 2 and b ω 2 based on the restored system 34 after training we can get a reliable vibration controller as following theorem 2 considering the vibration control system 2 with varying control delay under random wave force 12 there exists a stable neural network vibration controller 37 based on the observation system 34 to suppress the vibration 37 u ˆ k w x h x x ˆ k b x w ω h ω ω k b ω where u ˆ is the estimated control force proof training data comes from 33 therefore the initial asymptotic stability of 34 is guaranteed by the proof in theorem 1 we need to prove its ultimate bound substituting 37 into system 2 and comparing it with 34 we have 38 c 1 e k e k ac 1 e k 1 b b x 1 b x 1 b b ω 1 b ω 1 b w x 1 h x x ˆ k w x 1 h x x ˆ k b w ω 1 h ω ω k w ω 1 h ω ω k define parameter errors w x 1 w x 1 w x 1 h x k h x x ˆ k h x x ˆ k b x 1 b x 1 b x 1 w ω 1 w ω 1 w ω 1 h ω k h ω ω k h ω ω k b ω 1 b ω 1 b ω 1 38 is expressed as 39 e k c 1 i 1 ac 1 e k 1 b w x 1 h x k w x 1 h x k w ω 1 h ω k w ω 1 h ω k b x 1 b ω 1 after training all the parameter observation errors are supposed to be constants updating laws ensure that optimal parameters are constant matrices when cost function e k meets a setting goal besides 40 e k c 1 i 1 ac 1 e k 1 c 1 i 1 bw x 1 h x k c 1 i 1 b w x 1 h x k c 1 i 1 b b x 1 c 1 i 1 bw ω 1 h ω k c 1 i 1 b w ω 1 h ω k c 1 i 1 b b ω 1 meanwhile activation function in neural networks is bounded and then h k and h k are bounded with asymptotically convergent x k and initially bounded e 0 40 is bounded therefore the control system 2 under wave forces 12 with controller in 37 is stable this completes the proof structure of the mature neural network based controller is displayed in fig 4 a restriction of the compensation strategy mentioned above is that all the possibilities for h k are to be considered in advance in order to avoid overload we try to simplify the training and identification period for neural networks in next subsection 4 2 fuzzy method in control model obtaining instead of getting all the simulation cases calculated we build a t s fuzzy scheme without the pre defining each value of time varying control delay we can approximate the changing dynamics by t s fuzzy models assumption 2 for each sample time k random control delay h k has an upper bound h h and a lower bond h l satisfying h k h l h h according to t s fuzzy logic theory following fuzzy rules are employed in which the same fuzzy sets are shared plant rule i if h k is m iq then 41 x k 1 i 1 q φ i h i a x k b u i k h i d f k with φ i h i ϕ i m i q i 1 q ϕ i m i q ϕ i m i q is the weight of fuzzy set m iq φ i h i 0 i 1 q φ i h i 1 where i 1 2 q and q is the number of if then rules m iq is the fuzzy set corresponding to h k in assumption 2 and controller rule i h i is the known preset time delay for controller rule i and h i m iq control force u i is defined in controller rule i if h k is m iq 42 u i k k x h i x k k ω h i ω k l k h i k 1 k x l x l k ω l ω l the following algorithm summarizes the procedures to design a neuro fuzzy optimal controller algorithm 1 step 1 for control delay h k h l h h choose a fuzzy set m iq step 2 set h k h i and get sample data from model 41 under controller 42 according to certain fuzzy set and fuzzy rule step 3 train the neural network based observation system with data collected in step 2 taking x k ω k as input and x k 1 as output then the well trained observation system is stating as 43 x ˆ k 1 i 1 q φ i h i a x ˆ k df k e k b w x 1 i h x i x ˆ k h i b x 1 i w ω 1 i h ω i ω k h i b ω 1 i 44 y ˆ k c x ˆ k 1 where w x 1 i w ω 1 i b x 1 i and b ω 1 i are ideal weight matrices and thresholds for every rule i step 4 design an neural network based fuzzy optimal controller as 45 u ˆ i k i 1 q φ i h i w x 1 i h x i x ˆ k b x 1 i w ω 1 i h ω i ω k b ω 1 i step 5 test the control effect under system 2 based on the sample data of 41 42 under preset control delay weights and thresholds of neural networks are updated through iteration before they reach the optimal condition identification of suitable approximation for these values has to be realized offline it is actually a common restriction of most neural network controllers after training period the neural network based controller with optimal weights will replace the sample control law for better comparison fuzzy controllers without neural networks work independently in which the same fuzzy sets in the premise algorithm are shared the following algorithm summarizes the procedures to design a fuzzy controller algorithm 2 step 1 for control delay h k h l h h choose a fuzzy set m iq step 2 set h

remark 2 if wave forces are not taken into consideration when designing the controller the state feedback optimal control law sfoc is derived as 47 u k k x h k x k l k h k k 1 k x l x l accordingly observer system 34 for sfoc only has one type of neural network as 48 x ˆ k 1 a x ˆ k df k e k b w x 1 h x x ˆ k b x 1 simulation results for different control laws fuzzy controllers and fuzzy neural

expectation of h k as h i and the probability density function of h k as φ i h i under rule i as for neuro fuzzy controllers the network structure is decided by experience for every neural network we take a three layer structure and each hidden layer contains 7 nodes the maximum number of iteration generation for each neural network is 20 and observation error e k stays around 1 5 1 neuro fuzzy optimal controllers based on different control laws in this subsection we set h l 0 and h h 100 then h k m 12 delay values are shown in fig 6 a in which the details around simulation time t 50s are enlarged to show the tendency more clearly considering controller rules in designing fuzzy controllers only h 1 50 fuzzy set m 12 and controller rule 1 are adopted based on sfoc the fuzzy optimal controller 1 foc1 is derived from algorithm 2 similarly the delay internal and fuzzy set indicate that plant rule 1 is adopted when collecting sample data by algorithm 1 for neural network training neuro fuzzy optimal controller 1 nfoc1 based on sfoc is constructed to reject disturbance and get smaller vibration responses a feedforward part of the wave force is introduced into the control law based on ffoc in 19 the fuzzy optimal controller 2 foc2 is obtained from algorithm 2 collecting data through algorithm 1 we can get the neuro fuzzy optimal controller 2 nfoc2 in consideration of feedback and feedforward channels we adopt two kinds of neural networks for system state items and wave force items respectively it is noticed that feedforward and feedback control laws with disturbance rejection method have smaller vibration responses and smaller control forces than state feedback control laws in fig 7 in comparison of sfoc foc1 nfoc1 in table 3 the peak values and standard deviations for structure response of ffoc foc2 and nfoc2 decrease after adding wave force items into control channel when discussing max deviations foc2 reduces 34 23 of displacement response and 57 85 of acceleration response when compared with no control situation with only half the control force of ffoc 5 2 neuro fuzzy optimal controllers for a larger delay period in this subsection we set a larger delay period as h l 0 and h h 150 as shown in fig 5 b more fuzzy rules are predefined in dealing with a higher level of uncertainty adopting fuzzy controller rules 1 2 and fuzzy sets m 12 m 22 the fuzzy optimal controller 3 foc3 is built through algorithm 2 neuro fuzzy optimal controller 3 nfoc3 is constructed through algorithm 1 we notice that a relatively larger control delay brings uncertainty into the control system following more violent vibration of the platform as shown in fig 8 when comparing control forces and structure responses fuzzy optimal controller foc3 and neuro fuzzy optimal controller nfoc3 have similar control performance adopting disturbance rejection approach in ffoc more intelligent controllers containing feedback and feedforward channels have been designed fuzzy optimal controller 4 foc4 under fuzzy controller rules 1 2 is described through algorithm 2 for better control effects neuro fuzzy optimal controller 4 nfoc4 is constructed through algorithm 1 with two types of neural networks when adopting disturbance rejection method both foc3 and foc4 are competent to reduce vibration as shown in figs 8 and 9 and table 4 while control delay is not accurate we can see that fuzzy optimal controllers foc3 foc4 and neuro fuzzy optimal controllers nfoc3 nfoc4 under uncertain control delay are equivalent to controllers sfoc and ffoc in ideal situations where control delay is known for better comparison we introduce a delayed h controller dhc zhang and tang 2013 and a wavelet neural network based vibration controller wnn ma et al 2017 for dhc we choose a possible case where h index is set as 0 5 introduced delay as 0 22s for equation computation and simulate with random control delay from 0s to 1 5s in comparable of dhc our controllers provide more appropriate control forces and get more desired performance for wnn we list a case when control delay is set as 0s as simulation results indicate that it loses effectiveness when the delay value varies from 0 to 1 5 it is obvious that we need much smaller control forces to reach a similar control performance simulation results show that fuzzy controllers require bigger forces than neuro fuzzy controllers when reaching a similar level of vibration suppression for the standard deviations nfoc4 reduces 32 32 of the displacement and 55 11 of the acceleration when compared to the original non controlled state the control force drops to less than a half of sfoc or three quarters of foc4 meanwhile the maximum responses decrease to 21 57 displacement and 43 56 acceleration of the no control situation for the same offshore platform in the same water depth d 13 2m as the original simulation we test the controller in harsh or stable sea conditions where wave height h s and peak frequency ω 0 are different simulation results are shown in table 5 6 conclusion and discussion in this paper we observe system states with neural networks and design neural fuzzy controllers to suppress the vibration of an offshore platform delayed states and disturbance items introduced into the control law design guarantee a good vibration attenuation performance when control system has random time delay the neural network based observation system estimates system output and straightly derives a simple controller with non delayed states based on neural networks trained by fuzzy data designed controllers can calculate control force output with non delayed states from simulation results we can see that proposed controllers have more desirable results when compared with previous control laws that are taken as training samples implied with sample sets under t s fuzzy rules neural network based fuzzy controllers reduce the vibration in a relatively long delay period our neural network based fuzzy control method does significantly suppress the vibration with reduced workload yet there are several flaws the first limitation lies in the reliability of samples as we have to collect initial historical data from real sensors or simulations regarding the uncertainty it is summarized by a simple function in our research however practical platforms may suffer from uncertainty which cannot be described mathematically and we will face unexpected situations in severe environmental condition the second restriction is about the implementation of this controller incorporated in a real offshore platform for now the entire simulation is accomplished in matlab and further research is needed for the complete implementation credit authorship contribution statement yun zhang

20952,the statistical description of ocean wave groups has always been a topic of interest in ocean and coastal engineering the present study focuses on the statistical properties of wave groups in three different types of sea states the analysed wave data are composed of field data with single peaked spectra secondary waves generated by experiments and freak waves collected during typhoon haima group parameters defined by the wave envelope smoothed instantaneous wave energy history and wavelet transform can serve as effective indicators of wave groupiness in gaussian sea states with single wave systems the envelope spectra can present distinguishing bimodal features in combined sea states under this circumstance the groupiness factor shows a more evident correlation with the wave grouping degree than the mean high runs for linear waves the groupiness factor and mean high runs defined by the envelope and wavelet methods fail to capture the group structure of secondary waves nevertheless these two parameters can reflect the nonlinearity and instability of the waves during a freak wave event the energies of a single freak wave will carry over to higher frequencies while those of an extreme wave group do not transfer to high frequency components keywords wave group combined sea state freak wave wavelet transform envelope spectrum nonlinearity 1 introduction a wave group is commonly defined as a sequence of high waves above a specified height scientists and engineers have recognised the influence of wave grouping on marine structures and ships burcharth 1978 ma et al 2011 sun et al 2011 wang et al 2018 hou et al 2020 greater damage can be caused by wave groups than individual waves with the same energy level dispersed throughout a wave record johnson et al 1978 medina et al 1990 balaji et al 2008 thus groupiness should be incorporated in preliminary engineering designs medina et al 1994 several methods have been presented to evaluate the ship response based on the probabilistic characteristics of wave groups spyrou 2005 bassler et al 2010 anastopoulos et al 2016 in addition wave groupiness may be closely related with the process of wave breaking banner et al 2000 padilla and alsina 2017 extreme waves kharif et al 2001 fedele 2007 resuspension of sandy sediments williams et al 2002 and sand bar formation boczar karakiewicz et al 1996 ocean waves in nature are nonrepeatable and changeable in both time and space domains and it is possible to consider them to be stochastic for an improved understanding of their fundamental properties statistical models for wave groups have been established and can be commonly categorised into three methods 1 treating the wave height sequence as a markov chain 2 describing the wave groups through the envelope of the random waves and 3 examining the character and behaviour of the instantaneous wave energy signal of a random process kimura 1980 derived the probability distributions of the run of high waves and total run by means of the markov chain where the transition probability of the wave height train was given by a two dimensional rayleigh distribution battjes and van vledder 1984 verified kimura s theory by analysing the probability distribution and expectation of the length of wave groups van vledder 1992 concentrated on wave group analysis and discussed the relation between spectral shape parameters and group length statistics derived by the kimura s model however the rayleigh distribution does not always provide an accurate solution owing to its assumption of a narrow band process stansell et al 2002 compared the mean run and group lengths predicted by kimura s theory with observations from storms aiming to test the efficiency of the markov chain model they used five different schemes to calculate the transition probabilities and discussed the estimation of the correlation parameter for broad banded spectra lamberti and rossi 1993 provided possible explanations on the divergence from the kimura theoretical model based on a statistical analysis of measured data the envelope approach for the analysis of wave groups was described by longuet higgins 1984 based on a theory proposed by rice 1945 1958 in this approach a wave group is considered to comprise all waves exceeding a specified level during two consecutive up crossings of an envelope the author also modified and simplified kimura s model following this different methods for calculating the wave envelope were discussed sobey and liang 1986 hudspeth and medina 1988 wave groups defined by the envelope method can contain only one wave crest or no wave crests at all which is referred to as an empty envelope excursion eee ditlevson and lindgren 1988 zheng et al 2004 high waves with a period close to the nature period of motion of a marine system can generate resonant oscillation of fixed and floating structures in particular when structures are struck by successive high waves damage could be enhanced because of resonant type reinforcements therefore to ensure the safety of marine systems a distinction should be made between wave groups involving two or more waves whose heights exceed a specified threshold level of an envelope and those containing only one or even no waves ochi and sahinoglou 1989a b considered the statistical properties of wave groups that consists of at least two high waves exceeding a threshold level the probability density function of the time duration and interval associated with the wave groups were derived laying the foundation for evaluating the frequency of occurrence of wave groups dawson et al 1991 emphasised the crucial differences between envelope and group statistics using the results from a laboratory study they found that the gamma distribution function is a good approximation for the probability structure of envelope durations or intervals while the poisson or exponential distribution assumed by longuet higgins 1984 deviates considerably from the data from an energy standpoint funke and mansard 1979 applied the smoothed instantaneous wave energy history siweh to isolate wave groups within a wave record in this study the authors proposed a new simulation program for random waves based on a target wave power spectrum and a siweh sequence to obtain the wave series with a given group structure studies have compared the statistics of wave groups simulated by this technique and those of observed data mase et al 1983 it is noteworthy that this method involves smoothing over the peak spectral period implying that the siweh based groupiness depends strongly on variation in the peak frequency list 1991 later similar approaches focusing on the time variation of the local variance known as the local variance time series and wave height were proposed by thompson and seelig 1984 and liu and li 2018 respectively real ocean waves have been shown to be non stationary by nature the conventional fourier analysis which assumes a stationary stochastic process may give misleading results when processing such data huang et al 1998 massel 2001 veltcheva 2002 and hwang et al 2014 pointed out that the time evolution of the frequency and energy of wave records appears to be an intrinsic property of group structure in this context several methods for calculating the time frequency distribution of wave energy have been applied to investigate the wave groups two parameters the normalised group time length and the normalised total group energy were introduced by liu 1994 to describe a wave group using wavelet transform after that they were employed to analyse wave data collected in nearshore great lakes liu 2000 veltcheva and guedes soares 2016 applied the hilbert huang transform hht to analyse the wave groups and proposed two group parameters based on the hilbert spectrum they also investigated the relation between the characteristics of abnormal waves and groupiness using both the envelope method and hht method wave groups have marked impact on the safety of coastal and offshore systems especially when the wave periods in the group consecutively fall in the marine structures resonant period range therefore wave groupiness should not be neglected in the design of a marine system thus far however most studies on statistical descriptions of wave groups have been restricted to single wave systems the present study focuses on the statistical characteristics of ocean wave groups and utilises an extensive database consisting of waves with single peaked and two peaked spectra as well as those containing freak waves as the markov chain model and envelope model can lead to approximately identical outcomes longuet higgins 1984 the analysis of wave groups was performed based on the envelope and siweh of the wave series in addition considering the non stationarity of ocean waves the instantaneous wave energy process determined by wavelet transforms was adopted to describe the wave grouping the remainder of the paper is structured as follows first definitions of wave groups based on the three approaches are briefly described in section 2 in the same section wave group parameters that serve as representations of the degree of groupiness are introduced section 3 presents the characteristics of wave groups with a single wave system using in situ measured data in section 4 the group structures of waves with two peaked spectra including secondary waves generated by laboratory experiments and simulated wave data are examined the statistical properties of extreme wave groups assembled during a storm were investigated and the results were discussed in section 5 finally in section 6 major findings are discussed and conclusions are drawn 2 wave group statistics 2 1 definitions of wave groups the envelope method identifies a wave group as all waves between two consecutive up crossings of the wave envelope a t exceeding a threshold level ã the envelope of the wave crests is determined using the hilbert transform as suggested by hudspeth and medina 1988 the value of ã is often chosen as a significant wave height related statistic according to dawson et al 1991 to decrease the influences of nonlinearity on the average values of the envelope and group intervals ã is set to 0 4 times of the significant wave height in this study 1 a 0 4 h s where hs is the significant wave height fig 1 a shows a sample of a wave record together with the wave envelope which is denoted as red dash line wave groups with only one wave crest as well as those with no wave crest can be observed when the group interval is relatively short in addition a large group with a wave height sequence above the threshold level might be split into smaller units as can be seen between 130 s and 140 s nevertheless it will be more perilous if marine structures are struck by wave groups containing two or more high waves such wave groups deserve more attention owing to their engineering significance an alternative method for defining a wave group is based on the instantaneous wave energy process which is represented by the siweh proposed by funke and mansard 1979 2 e s t 1 t p η 2 t ξ q ξ d ξ where η is the water surface elevation t p is the peak period and q is the bartlett window function given by 3 q ξ 1 ξ t p t p ξ t p 0 o t h e r w i s e similar to the envelope method the wave group phenomenon can be considered as the exceedance of e s t above a threshold level however it should be noted that the dimensions of the envelope function and siweh are different indicating that they cannot be compared directly according to medina and hudspeth 1990 the approximate relation between them can be given by 4 e s t a 2 t 2 therefore to draw a reasonable comparison the threshold level of siweh can be set to 5 e a 2 2 0 08 h s 2 fig 1 b shows the siweh signal and the wave sequence and envelope are also plotted in the same figure so that a clear visual comparison can be made between the envelope and siweh approaches it seems that this instantaneous energy sequence provides a smaller proportion of wave groups involving an isolated wave however the eee phenomenon can be detected please note that the squared surface displacement series should be smoothed by low pass filters different types of smoothed function and cut off frequencies might lead to different shapes of e s t and thus have an effect on the intersections of the siweh process and a given threshold level the wave group is a representation of the non stationarity of ocean waves a wavelet transform which can provide the instantaneous frequency and energy of the wave records is highly capable of detecting this non stationary behaviour farge 1992 torrence and compo 1998 owing to its attributes this technique is one of the most powerful available random wave data analysis approaches therefore a wavelet based signal will be adopted in this study to investigate the group structure the continuous wavelet transform which is essentially a short term fourier transform with an adjustable window can be expressed as 6 w a b 1 a 0 η t ψ t b a d t where a and b are the dilation and translation parameters respectively ψ denotes a basic wavelet function and asterisk represents the complex conjugate the form of the basic wavelet function should be designated before the analysis in the present study the morlet wavelet is adopted owing to its extensive applications in ocean and meteorological research liu 1994 dong et al 2008 2017 huang and dong 2019a the energy conservation formula for the wavelet transform of η t can be expressed as 7 η t 2 d t 1 c ψ 0 0 w a b 2 a 2 d b d a in which 8 c ψ 0 ψ ω 2 ω d ω where ψ ω is the fourier transform of the basic wavelet function ψ t eq 8 known as the admission condition ensures that η t can be reconstructed from the wavelet coefficients to examine the group structure of a wave record one can define the local energy density as 9 e w b 1 c ψ 0 w a b 2 a 2 d a similar to siweh eq 9 can describe the fluctuations in energy within the wave record please note that the values of a should be selected when calculating the wavelet transform as recommended by torrence and compo 1998 the scale parameter is expressed as fractional powers of two 10 a a 0 2 j δ j j 0 1 j 11 j 1 δ j log 2 n δ t a 0 where n is the number of data points and δt is the sample interval the smallest resolvable scale a 0 is equal to the value corresponding to the fourier period 2δt a smaller value of δ j can provide better resolutions to ensure adequate sampling the maximum value for δ j is about 0 5 for the morlet wavelet in the present study δ j was set to 0 125 analogous to the determination of random waves using the zero up crossing approach a wave group can be regarded as a level crossing event associated with the wavelet local energy density ẽ in eq 5 is chosen as the limit level so that the equivalent envelope threshold level is approximately 0 4hs fig 1 c depicted the wave groups defined by the wavelet method an improvement can be observed i e almost all the wavelet based groups comprise more than one wave crests higher the specified level those envelope based groups containing less than two high waves are either neglected or included in the adjacent groups it is noteworthy that there are five waves between the up crossing of level ẽ at 175 s and the down crossing at 200 s with three waves exceeding the threshold and two waves below the limit as suggested by bassler et al 2010 the exceedance of a wave group can contain individual waves whose amplitudes are smaller than the specified threshold from the point of view of the ship dynamics such a definition can ensure the time duration of a group is sufficiently long so that ships or structures are not affected by the previous excitation event 2 2 wave groupiness one of the primary objectives of wave group research is to establish some measures for the intensity of grouping funke and mansard 1979 presented a groupiness factor based on the siweh 12 g f s 1 e s t 1 t n 0 t n e s t e s t 2 d t where e s t is the mean of the energy signal over the length of the wave sequence t n as mentioned above the calculation of the siweh involves a filtering operation with a window width of t p implying that the value of gf s may be affected by the peak period variation attempting to describe the group structure more accurately list 1991 proposed gf e based on the wave envelope 13 g f e 2 σ a a t where a t and σ a are the average and standard deviation of the wave envelope respectively list 1991 reported that this parameter which ranges from zero to one remained fairly constant in a transition from fair weather to a storm conflicting with the random linear wave theory by contrast the values of gf e decreases rapidly in shallow water and identify the breaking zone very well considering the non stationarity of real ocean wave groups dong et al 2008 defined a groupiness factor gf w using the continuous wavelet transform 14 g f w 1 e w t 1 t n 0 t n e w t e w t 2 d t where e w t is the average of e w t dong et al 2008 illustrated that the choice of δ j which is the only influencing factor during the calculation of e w t slightly affects the values of this parameter accordingly the effect of the operational definition on gf w is smaller compared to that on gf s or gf e for marine disasters associated with resonance phenomena the resonant stress on structures can be determined by both the duration of the driving force and intensity knowledge of the group length with frequencies close to the natural frequencies of structures would be of great value to the risk assessment therefore the run of high waves l which stands for the number of waves exceeding the standard level in a group is a parameter of great concern the average value of the high runs l is a commonly used index of wave grouping investigations on the properties of this groupiness factor have been performed using different statistical models kimura 1980 longuet higgins 1984 ochi and sahinoglou 1989a distributions of consecutive wave heights have been employed by kimura 1980 to examine the characteristics of ocean wave groups as wave groups appear as sequences of high waves it is reasonable that the probability that a wave height is above a certain height given that the previous wave height exceeded the same height which should be a higher priority for parametric rolling design spyrou 2005 can be a manifestation of the wave grouping degree for a specified threshold height h c it is given by 15 p h i 1 h c h i h c 0 h c 0 h c f h h h 1 h 2 d h 1 d h 2 0 h c f h h 1 d h 1 where f h h 1 and f hh h 1 h 2 are the marginal distribution of the wave heights and bivariate distribution of successive wave heights respectively in the present application the significant wave height hs is chosen as the critical height h c in addition the joint distribution of consecutive wave periods f tt t 1 t 2 while relatively uncertain is a major element in the probabilistic design of oscillatory roll motion spyrou 2005 for a better comparison the wave periods are normalised as 16 τ t m 1 m 0 where m k k 0 1 is the moment of the wave power spectra s f given by 17 m k 0 f k s f d f for a specified τ the probability of the wave period falling in the interval of τ 0 1 τ 0 1 given the previous period in the same interval can be calculated based on the conditional probability formula 18 p τ 1 τ 2 τ 2 τ 1 τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 τ 2 f τ 1 τ 2 d τ 1 d τ 2 τ 1 τ 2 f τ 1 d τ 1 where τ 1 τ 0 1 and τ 2 τ 0 1 this conditional probability has been applied by myrhaug et al 2000 to assess the synchronous motion of ship rolling 3 waves with single peaked spectra 3 1 wave data description wave data with single peaked spectra were recorded by a buoy near the coast of qingdao in shandong province china the measurements were performed hourly with a duration of 1024 s from october 17 to november 4 2014 the sample interval of each wave record was 0 5 s wave series with single peaked spectra were picked for the investigation the zero up crossing approach was applied to define the wave crests the values of hs varied between 0 3891 m and 1 9567 m while those of the peak frequency f p varied between 0 1260 hz and 0 2529 hz the values of the kurtosis κ which is closely related to the nonlinearity of the wave records janssen and herbers 2009 ranged from 2 6361 to 3 4163 the kurtosis that were approximately equal to 3 implied that the observations were nearly gaussian before the analysis the wave records were interpolated to eliminate the effect of the sampling rate fig 1 illustrates the divergences of run lengths defined by the envelope siweh and wavelet approaches a more detailed examination of the proportions of wave groups with a given number of high waves for all the observed data was carried out dawson et al 1991 pointed out that statistics should be calculated from truncated spectra when using the envelope method here the lower and higher cut off frequencies were determined as 0 5f p and 6 0f p respectively mase 1989 as the wave envelope is sensitive to the choice of lowpass filter cut off frequency list 1991 two truncated frequencies at 0 2 hz and 0 1 hz for digital filtering were adopted table 1 summarises the percentages based on the three different definitions it can be seen that more than 30 of the envelope crossings involve no wave crests exceeding the critical level for a higher cut off frequency this rate sinks to around 17 when components with frequencies higher than 0 1 hz are filtered out additionally the weight of the wave groups containing only one high wave is lower for the lower frequency truncation indicating that the wave envelope defined by a smaller value of the lowpass filter cut off can determine more groups with greater engineering significance it is obvious that the definition of groups based on the envelope method is significantly affected by the filtering operation the proportions of the eee phenomenon are much lower for the siweh and wavelet based wave groups these two instantaneous wave energy approaches also define more wave groups involving two or more high waves compared to the envelope method it seems that these two techniques are more suitable for the determination of wave groups for marine engineering application moreover it is noteworthy that the energy signal based on the wavelet transform performs slightly better than the siweh with regard to wave group definition as it has a lower percentage of groups with less than two high wave crests 3 2 assessment of groupiness factors wave groupiness is an important consideration in the modern design of offshore structures therefore it is necessary to describe the group structure of a given wave field adequately fig 2 illustrates the groupiness factors defined by the envelope siweh and wavelet approaches as a function of the conditional probability of wave heights p h i 1 h c h i h c the frequency truncation limits can affect the values of gf e the lowpass envelope filter cut off is 0 2 hz for fig 2 a while it is 0 1 hz for fig 2 b plots of the groupiness factors derived by the envelope siweh and wavelet methods denoted by circles triangles and squares respectively indicate that there is a close correspondence between these three group parameters and the conditional probability of wave heights although the values of gf s are larger than those of gf w these two parameters both increase with p h i 1 h c h i h c indicating a positive correlation it is not surprising that the values of gf e in fig 2 b are smaller than those in fig 2 a as the latter involves higher frequency components however the upward trend of gf e is slightly influenced by the filtering process it can also be observed that the dependency of gf e on the conditional probability is weaker than those of the other two parameters the characteristics of the average of the high runs obtained by the three techniques were also examined here please note that the groups without any high wave crests were removed when calculating the mean runs similar to the tendencies of the groupiness factor derived by the envelope siweh and wavelet methods as can be seen in fig 3 the average lengths of high run calculated by these approaches increase as the conditional probability increases it is reasonable that the l determined by the wavelet and siweh approaches are longer owing to their larger percentage of groups containing two or more crests above the threshold level the envelope based l does not change significantly with p h i 1 h c h i h c for the cut off frequencies at 0 2 hz nevertheless for the case of 0 1 hz this parameter appears to be a reliable indicator of wave grouping both figs 2 and 3 suggest that the statistics derived by the wave envelope are very susceptible to filter cut offs for the nearly gaussian wave groups the groupiness factors and mean high runs calculated by the siweh or wavelet transform serve as sensitive measures of the grouping degree additionally in cases where disturbance of high frequency components does not occur knowledge of gf e or the envelope based l allows for the estimation of the extent of wave groupiness to take into account the wave period the conditional probability of the wave period given the previous wave period for different groupiness degree was investigated as can be seen in fig 4 the peaks of p τ 1 τ 2 τ 2 τ 1 τ 1 τ 2 which are located near the mean periods of the wave records increase with the wave grouping moreover the probability with different groupiness degrees can present different sharpnesses flatter for a lower groupiness factor value and more pointed for a higher one it seems that the adjacent waves within a group are more likely to have similar wave periods compared to those that are not clustered if the period of a high wave in a group is close to the resonant period of the oscillation system the structure might be struck by two or even more high waves with periods near to its natural period accordingly wave records with a mean period falling in the resonant period band of motion of the marine systems and strong wave grouping can certainly threaten the safety of the structures and ships 4 waves groups in combined sea states wave spectra measured in real states can present two peaks owing to the mixture of wind sea and swell systems aranuvachapun 1987 nevertheless studies on the statistical properties of wave groups in such sea states receive less attention kumar et al 2003 estimated the wave group statistics in combined sea states utilising observations collected along the indian coast rodríguez et al 2000 investigated the probability distributions of the run length and total length in nine types of combined sea states based on simulated data kimura s model was unable to provide a satisfactory description of the group statistics in mixed sea states in this section a detailed examination will be performed on group structure in wave fields with two peaked spectra by analysing experimental and simulated data chiapponi et al 2020 performed a statistical analysis of the interaction between wind waves and currents and found that the wave grouping can reflect the action of the current the authors observed that wave energies can transfer to longer waves and a double peaked spectrum can be formed in the presence of counter currents 4 1 wave data a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to generate secondary waves which stand as perfect examples of ocean waves involving various of wave systems such waves can be observed when long swells travel over a bar or breakwater the nonlinear wave wave interactions can cause the decomposition of wave energy and transfer to higher harmonics and thus the formation of waves with multi peaked spectra beji and battjes 1993 kuznetsov and saprykina 2012 the wave flume used in this study was 68 m long 1 m wide and 1 5 m deep and was equipped with a wave generator at one end of the tank fig 5 shows a schematic of the wave flume to reduce wave reflections a wave absorber was installed at each end of the basin a vertical breakwater was installed 32 m away from the wave maker the top surface of the caisson was 0 98 m above the bottom of the wave flume the still water level was set to 0 96 m during all the sets of experiments three wave gauges were placed along the length of the flume with one gauge on the windward side and two gauges on the leeward side of the obstruction gauge number one captured the incident wave signal and gauges number two and three measured the secondary wave records five experimental wave conditions were considered and the jonswap spectra were chosen to generate the incident waves the wave parameters are listed in table 2 fig 6 illustrates the average spectral densities of the experimental data the major characteristics of the two peaked spectra are the ratio of the energies of the two wave systems and the distance between the peak frequencies in this study two dimensionless parameters are adopted rodríguez et al 2000 19 s s e r m 0 w s m 0 s w 0 s s e r 1 20 i d f p w s f p s w f p w s f p s w 0 i d 1 where m 0ws and m 0sw denote the zeroth order spectral moments of the wind sea and swell systems respectively f pws and f psw represent the peak frequencies of the wind sea and swell components respectively based on these two parameters the mixed sea states can be classified into nine types rodríguez et al 2000 the secondary waves whose sser values range from 0 66 to 0 90 and id values are between 0 32 and 0 39 are dominated by low frequency components with two spectral peaks located at a medium distance moreover the κ values vary from 4 67 to 14 16 implying higher nonlinearity the wavelet energy spectra of the incident waves and secondary waves for case 1 which is shown in fig 7 clearly illustrate the energy transfer from the first harmonics to higher components the group structure of the wave records can be sufficiently reflected by the wavelet energy distributions dong et al 2008 the more uniform distribution of secondary waves implies that waves propagating over barriers have not only lower mean periods but also decreasing groupiness such features are of significance to the development of coastal protection kuznetsov and saprykina 2012 the experimental data cannot cover all the combined sea states according to rye 1982 elgar et al 1985 liu et al 1993 and smith et al 2006 the statistical properties of the observed wave groups are comparable with those of the linear simulations therefore nine types of combined sea states based on the study by rodríguez et al 2000 were simulated using the six parameter spectral model ochi and hubble 1976 for a comprehensive study table 3 illustrates the descriptive statistics of the simulated data to avoid statistical fluctuations 1000 realisations with 32768 data points and a time step of 0 5 s for each type of sea state were simulated ozbahceci et al 2002 4 2 wave groupiness analysis it should be noted that the siweh series is averaged over t p by a filter function indicating that this method is unsuitable for the analysis of bimodal spectrum waves therefore only the envelope and wavelet approaches were used to examine the characteristics of wave groups another issue that needed attention was the effect of multi peaked spectra on the wave envelope or instantaneous energy signal according to tayfun and lo 1989 the spectral density of a t contains the following term 21 s a f π 4 m 0 0 s u s u f d u s a f can present the double peak structure if s f represents the power spectra of a combined sea state fig 8 illustrates the envelope spectrum and s a f of the experimental data for case 1 please note that s a f is only part of the integral envelope spectra hence the shape in fig 8 b is not yet entirely matched with that in fig 8 a it can be observed that both the estimate and theoretical spectra of secondary waves present a two peaked structure to explore the properties of other types of combined sea states the envelope spectra of the simulated data were calculated as shown in fig 9 as can be expected the bimodal feature becomes increasingly prominent with an increase in id values moreover the spectral bandwidth is broader for larger id values it is noteworthy that the envelope spectral width of the wind sea dominated sea state is narrowest while that of the sea swell energy equivalent sea state is widest accordingly the envelope filtering truncation should be chosen with caution in the present application the filtering implementation will not be applied to the envelopes of waves with two peaked spectra to avoid information loss fig 10 shows the variations in the groupiness factors and mean length of high runs with the conditional probability of the wave heights for secondary waves surprisingly no clear correlation between these two group parameters was obtained for the envelope or wavelet methods and p h i 1 h c h i h c there are two possible explanations for the ineffectiveness of these two measures the envelope spectra are wider and bimodal or the secondary waves involve high nonlinearity a comparative investigation was performed by simulating waves with similar power and envelope spectra of secondary waves the technique proposed by xu et al 1993 was therefore adopted the relationships between the two group parameters and p h i 1 h c h i h c for simulated data are shown in fig 11 the two approaches illustrate the similar tendency of increasing the groupiness factor and mean length of high runs as the conditional probability becomes larger implying that the results in fig 10 can be attributed to the nonlinear coupling between wave components fig 12 shows the variation in the groupiness factor and mean high runs with kurtosis for secondary waves the increasing trends of gf e or gf w corroborate the results obtained by li et al 2015 that the groupiness factor can reflect the nonlinearity and instability of a wave in addition the values of l calculated by the two approaches decrease with the κ values i e for higher nonlinear wave records the envelope and wavelet based l are shorter this might be caused by fluctuations in a t and e w t induced by the nonlinearity it is reasonable that the l values would decrease when such nonlinear fluctuations increase these effects can obscure the fluctuations invoked by the wave grouping therefore the above group parameters determined by the envelope or wavelet approaches do not sufficiently capture the group structure further investigation is required on more appropriate grouping indicators for nonlinear waves the wave grouping of nine types of combined sea states was examined using simulated data to investigate the effect of the double peaked spectrum on the group parameters figs 13 and 14 show the variations in the groupiness factor and mean length of high runs with the wave grouping respectively for gf w a homogeneous increasing trend is observed as p h i 1 h c h i h c increases for all categories of sea states although gf e presents a similar tendency this parameter is not strongly related to the conditional probability it is noteworthy that the trends of these two groupiness factors are less obvious for lower grouping degrees this effect is more apparent for gf e as it has a narrower range especially when the two peaked structure is more distinct and the bandwidth of the envelope spectra is broader as can be seen in categories c and iiia gf e suggests a nearly constant value these features have a smaller impact on gf w by comparison this is consistent with the results from single peaked wave data that gf e is more susceptible to the envelope spectral width the l defined by the wavelet method exhibits on average increasing trends for the nine types of wave systems it exhibits a less manifest correlation when the envelope spectrum is broader or the p h i 1 h c h i h c values are smaller the l defined by the envelope method seems to be almost independent of p h i 1 h c h i h c especially for wider envelope spectra and lower wave grouping levels the shape and bandwidth of the envelope spectra have a greater influence on the behaviour of the mean length of high runs than the groupiness factor as can be observed in figs 13 and 14 for larger id values which are correlated with distinguishing bimodal features and broad envelope spectra higher values of l do not correspond to higher p h i 1 h c h i h c if the wave grouping of a wave record is lower a higher proportion of values close to the average of the high runs would be obtained a broader bandwidth and greater energies of higher frequency components for an envelope spectrum can decrease the number of larger high runs values and thus aggravate the situation under such conditions l is unable to characterise the wave groupiness adequately a larger number of analyses of the group structure in mixed sea states are needed such as probability distribution of the wave group length one should note that the definition of wave groups is analogous to the zero up crossing method this implies that the probability structure might present multimodal feature as the envelope spectrum is bimodal huang and dong 2019b huang et al 2020 5 extreme wave group waves with extreme heights larger than twice the significant wave height are called freak waves wave groups containing extreme wave heights called extreme wave groups have attracted the attention of many oceanographers owing to their severe destruction of vessels and offshore facilities su 1986 research suggests that wave group structure influences the formation and geometric properties of extreme waves wu and yao 2004 ortega and smith 2009 found two patterns of large waves in the hilbert spectrum which might imply two different mechanisms for the generation of extreme waves using thousands of 20 min raw wave samples christou and ewans 2011 performed a wavelet analysis on the temporal evolution of the spectral density and the phase spectra of freak wave events in most of studies mentioned above the grouping of high waves was performed from a statistical perspective whilst some researchers are bidding to explain them from a physical perspective the modulational instability and envelope soliton model have been applied in studies on the wave group properties of storm waves mase and iwagaki 1986 5 1 wave measurements the wave data were collected during typhoon haima which occurred between october 20 and october 22 2016 wave measurements were carried out hourly on nanao island in guangdong province china four wave records containing freak waves were used in this study each record was 1024 s long with a sampling period of 0 5 s table 4 lists the characteristics of the analysed wave records the maximum waves in records i iii and iv obey the abnormality criterion while two waves in record ii can be treated as rogue waves fig 15 shows the time series of the considered four records the freak waves in records i iii and iv did not occur with larger waves by contrast both the two freaks waves in record ii are in the extreme wave groups the relatively larger kurtosis implies that these wave records involve abnormal waves signifying non gaussian sea states these results support the finding by christou et al 2008 who employed the wavelet transform to compare the focused wave groups generated by three different models i e the linear second order and fully nonlinear wave models that the rapid amplification of all frequency components near the freak wave is a demonstration of the enhancement of nonlinearity therefore some group parameters such as the groupiness factors and average of high runs may not serve as effective indicators of wave grouping degree for series containing freak waves the ratio of the crest height to wave height ζ h crest h max is another important parameter that can be used to determine whether a wave is rogue the freak waves in records i and iv with ζ larger than 0 5 appear to be more asymmetrical while the maximum wave in record iii with ζ close to 0 5 is relatively symmetrical it is worth noting that the two freak waves in record ii exhibit symmetrical and asymmetrical profiles respectively it seems that both single freak waves and extreme wave groups exhibit asymmetry features 5 2 wavelet analysis of freak waves the wavelet transform approach has been depicted as an ideal method for identifying the occurrence of rogue waves and describing their statistical properties liu and mori 2000 figs 16 19 illustrate the wavelet power spectra and phase spectra of the preceding wave freak wave and succeeding wave for records i ii iii and iv as mentioned above the group structure of a wave record can be reflected by its wavelet power spectrum the more uniform wavelet energy distributions of records i iii and iv indicate that these series have lower degrees of groupiness compared to record ii accordingly it is not surprising that the freak waves in record ii accompany other large waves while those in the other three records appear as single abnormal waves the location of a freak wave can be identified as the point where an instantaneous energy surge occurs in a wavelet power spectrum however significant differences can be observed between an extreme wave group and a single freak wave for records i iii and iv the wavelet energy densities at the freak events extend toward higher frequencies nevertheless similar characteristics of wave energy transfer to high frequency components do not appear in the wavelet spectrum of record ii therefore at the maximum event the power spectrum of a single freak wave would be broader than that of an extreme wave group in other words the spectral bandwidth at the time of freak wave occurrence might be an adequate measure of the groupiness for extreme wave groups this corroborates the results of mase et al 1990 who found that the maximum wave in a record is usually accompanied by large waves for narrow spectra whereas the converse is true for wide spectra the evolution of an extreme wave group has been investigated by touboul et al 2006 and li et al 2015 in the time and frequency domains according to li et al 2015 the almost symmetrical triangles in the wavelet spectra of records i iii and iv imply that they are in the stage of full freak wave growth while the forms in record ii indicate the focusing or defocusing stage in the process of freak wave generation the effect of the wind can increase the freak wave height and lengthen the lifetime of the rogue wave event touboul et al 2006 the phenomenon of phase locking can be observed at the instance of abnormal wave occurrence for all the considered records especially in the high energy region this peculiarity of the phase concentration has been reported by christou and ewans 2011 and lee et al 2011 it implies that the integration of different frequency components with approximately identical phases might be a major cause of freak wave generation by contrast at the crests before and after the maximum wave the phase spectra appear to vary significantly i e the energetic frequency components of the previous and posterior waves are out of phase 6 conclusions in the present study the statistical characteristics of ocean wave groups were investigated with a focus on single peaked spectra bimodal spectra and the freak wave event the envelope method siweh and wavelet transform were adopted to explore the group structure the properties of a single freak wave and extreme wave group are examined and compared by wavelet analysis the conclusions can be summarised as follows 1 the groupiness factors and average of high runs defined by these three approaches are capable of indicating the wave grouping degree in gaussian sea states with single peaked spectra compared to the envelope method the siweh and wavelet method provide a lower proportion of eee and wave groups involving single high waves with smaller operational definition influence 2 the envelope spectra in combined sea states can present a bimodal structure the longer distance of the two spectral peaks can lead to more prominent bimodal features for the envelope spectrum the groupiness factor derived by the wavelet method serves as a more reliable measure of wave groupiness than that derived by the envelope method nevertheless the mean length of high runs determined by these two methods cannot describe the groupiness degree accurately especially for broader envelope spectrum and lower groupiness 3 the statistics defined by the wave envelope or wavelet approach fail to capture the group structure of waves with strong nonlinearity such as the secondary waves under these circumstances the groupiness factors and average mean length calculated by these two methods show a manifest correlation with wave kurtosis implying that these parameters can indicate the nonlinearity and instability of a wave further analyses on the description of wave groupiness for nonlinear waves are required in a future study 4 during the freak wave event the energies of a single freak wave will extend toward higher frequency components while those of an extreme wave group are confined to low frequency components therefore the spectral bandwidth at the freak wave event is recommended as an indicator of wave groupiness the phase spectra results suggest that for either a single freak wave or an extreme wave group the frequency components in the high energy region are in phase at instant of freak wave occurrence credit authorship contribution statement weinan huang conceptualization methodology software validation

20952,the statistical description of ocean wave groups has always been a topic of interest in ocean and coastal engineering the present study focuses on the statistical properties of wave groups in three different types of sea states the analysed wave data are composed of field data with single peaked spectra secondary waves generated by experiments and freak waves collected during typhoon haima group parameters defined by the wave envelope smoothed instantaneous wave energy history and wavelet transform can serve as effective indicators of wave groupiness in gaussian sea states with single wave systems the envelope spectra can present distinguishing bimodal features in combined sea states under this circumstance the groupiness factor shows a more evident correlation with the wave grouping degree than the mean high runs for linear waves the groupiness factor and mean high runs defined by the envelope and wavelet methods fail to capture the group structure of secondary waves nevertheless these two parameters can reflect the nonlinearity and instability of the waves during a freak wave event the energies of a single freak wave will carry over to higher frequencies while those of an extreme wave group do not transfer to high frequency components keywords wave group combined sea state freak wave wavelet transform envelope spectrum nonlinearity 1 introduction a wave group is commonly defined as a sequence of high waves above a specified height scientists and engineers have recognised the influence of wave grouping on marine structures and ships burcharth 1978 ma et al 2011 sun et al 2011 wang et al 2018 hou et al 2020 greater damage can be caused by wave groups than individual waves with the same energy level dispersed throughout a wave record johnson et al 1978 medina et al 1990 balaji et al 2008 thus groupiness should be incorporated in preliminary engineering designs medina et al 1994 several methods have been presented to evaluate the ship response based on the probabilistic characteristics of wave groups spyrou 2005 bassler et al 2010 anastopoulos et al 2016 in addition wave groupiness may be closely related with the process of wave breaking banner et al 2000 padilla and alsina 2017 extreme waves kharif et al 2001 fedele 2007 resuspension of sandy sediments williams et al 2002 and sand bar formation boczar karakiewicz et al 1996 ocean waves in nature are nonrepeatable and changeable in both time and space domains and it is possible to consider them to be stochastic for an improved understanding of their fundamental properties statistical models for wave groups have been established and can be commonly categorised into three methods 1 treating the wave height sequence as a markov chain 2 describing the wave groups through the envelope of the random waves and 3 examining the character and behaviour of the instantaneous wave energy signal of a random process kimura 1980 derived the probability distributions of the run of high waves and total run by means of the markov chain where the transition probability of the wave height train was given by a two dimensional rayleigh distribution battjes and van vledder 1984 verified kimura s theory by analysing the probability distribution and expectation of the length of wave groups van vledder 1992 concentrated on wave group analysis and discussed the relation between spectral shape parameters and group length statistics derived by the kimura s model however the rayleigh distribution does not always provide an accurate solution owing to its assumption of a narrow band process stansell et al 2002 compared the mean run and group lengths predicted by kimura s theory with observations from storms aiming to test the efficiency of the markov chain model they used five different schemes to calculate the transition probabilities and discussed the estimation of the correlation parameter for broad banded spectra lamberti and rossi 1993 provided possible explanations on the divergence from the kimura theoretical model based on a statistical analysis of measured data the envelope approach for the analysis of wave groups was described by longuet higgins 1984 based on a theory proposed by rice 1945 1958 in this approach a wave group is considered to comprise all waves exceeding a specified level during two consecutive up crossings of an envelope the author also modified and simplified kimura s model following this different methods for calculating the wave envelope were discussed sobey and liang 1986 hudspeth and medina 1988 wave groups defined by the envelope method can contain only one wave crest or no wave crests at all which is referred to as an empty envelope excursion eee ditlevson and lindgren 1988 zheng et al 2004 high waves with a period close to the nature period of motion of a marine system can generate resonant oscillation of fixed and floating structures in particular when structures are struck by successive high waves damage could be enhanced because of resonant type reinforcements therefore to ensure the safety of marine systems a distinction should be made between wave groups involving two or more waves whose heights exceed a specified threshold level of an envelope and those containing only one or even no waves ochi and sahinoglou 1989a b considered the statistical properties of wave groups that consists of at least two high waves exceeding a threshold level the probability density function of the time duration and interval associated with the wave groups were derived laying the foundation for evaluating the frequency of occurrence of wave groups dawson et al 1991 emphasised the crucial differences between envelope and group statistics using the results from a laboratory study they found that the gamma distribution function is a good approximation for the probability structure of envelope durations or intervals while the poisson or exponential distribution assumed by longuet higgins 1984 deviates considerably from the data from an energy standpoint funke and mansard 1979 applied the smoothed instantaneous wave energy history siweh to isolate wave groups within a wave record in this study the authors proposed a new simulation program for random waves based on a target wave power spectrum and a siweh sequence to obtain the wave series with a given group structure studies have compared the statistics of wave groups simulated by this technique and those of observed data mase et al 1983 it is noteworthy that this method involves smoothing over the peak spectral period implying that the siweh based groupiness depends strongly on variation in the peak frequency list 1991 later similar approaches focusing on the time variation of the local variance known as the local variance time series and wave height were proposed by thompson and seelig 1984 and liu and li 2018 respectively real ocean waves have been shown to be non stationary by nature the conventional fourier analysis which assumes a stationary stochastic process may give misleading results when processing such data huang et al 1998 massel 2001 veltcheva 2002 and hwang et al 2014 pointed out that the time evolution of the frequency and energy of wave records appears to be an intrinsic property of group structure in this context several methods for calculating the time frequency distribution of wave energy have been applied to investigate the wave groups two parameters the normalised group time length and the normalised total group energy were introduced by liu 1994 to describe a wave group using wavelet transform after that they were employed to analyse wave data collected in nearshore great lakes liu 2000 veltcheva and guedes soares 2016 applied the hilbert huang transform hht to analyse the wave groups and proposed two group parameters based on the hilbert spectrum they also investigated the relation between the characteristics of abnormal waves and groupiness using both the envelope method and hht method wave groups have marked impact on the safety of coastal and offshore systems especially when the wave periods in the group consecutively fall in the marine structures resonant period range therefore wave groupiness should not be neglected in the design of a marine system thus far however most studies on statistical descriptions of wave groups have been restricted to single wave systems the present study focuses on the statistical characteristics of ocean wave groups and utilises an extensive database consisting of waves with single peaked and two peaked spectra as well as those containing freak waves as the markov chain model and envelope model can lead to approximately identical outcomes longuet higgins 1984 the analysis of wave groups was performed based on the envelope and siweh of the wave series in addition considering the non stationarity of ocean waves the instantaneous wave energy process determined by wavelet transforms was adopted to describe the wave grouping the remainder of the paper is structured as follows first definitions of wave groups based on the three approaches are briefly described in section 2 in the same section wave group parameters that serve as representations of the degree of groupiness are introduced section 3 presents the characteristics of wave groups with a single wave system using in situ measured data in section 4 the group structures of waves with two peaked spectra including secondary waves generated by laboratory experiments and simulated wave data are examined the statistical properties of extreme wave groups assembled during a storm were investigated and the results were discussed in section 5 finally in section 6 major findings are discussed and conclusions are drawn 2 wave group statistics 2 1 definitions of wave groups the envelope method identifies a wave group as all waves between two consecutive up crossings of the wave envelope a t exceeding a threshold level ã the envelope of the wave crests is determined using the hilbert transform as suggested by hudspeth and medina 1988 the value of ã is often chosen as a significant wave height related statistic according to dawson et al 1991 to decrease the influences of nonlinearity on the average values of the envelope and group intervals ã is set to 0 4 times of the significant wave height in this study 1 a 0 4 h s where hs is the significant wave height fig 1 a shows a sample of a wave record together with the wave envelope which is denoted as red dash line wave groups with only one wave crest as well as those with no wave crest can be observed when the group interval is relatively short in addition a large group with a wave height sequence above the threshold level might be split into smaller units as can be seen between 130 s and 140 s nevertheless it will be more perilous if marine structures are struck by wave groups containing two or more high waves such wave groups deserve more attention owing to their engineering significance an alternative method for defining a wave group is based on the instantaneous wave energy process which is represented by the siweh proposed by funke and mansard 1979 2 e s t 1 t p η 2 t ξ q ξ d ξ where η is the water surface elevation t p is the peak period and q is the bartlett window function given by 3 q ξ 1 ξ t p t p ξ t p 0 o t h e r w i s e similar to the envelope method the wave group phenomenon can be considered as the exceedance of e s t above a threshold level however it should be noted that the dimensions of the envelope function and siweh are different indicating that they cannot be compared directly according to medina and hudspeth 1990 the approximate relation between them can be given by 4 e s t a 2 t 2 therefore to draw a reasonable comparison the threshold level of siweh can be set to 5 e a 2 2 0 08 h s 2 fig 1 b shows the siweh signal and the wave sequence and envelope are also plotted in the same figure so that a clear visual comparison can be made between the envelope and siweh approaches it seems that this instantaneous energy sequence provides a smaller proportion of wave groups involving an isolated wave however the eee phenomenon can be detected please note that the squared surface displacement series should be smoothed by low pass filters different types of smoothed function and cut off frequencies might lead to different shapes of e s t and thus have an effect on the intersections of the siweh process and a given threshold level the wave group is a representation of the non stationarity of ocean waves a wavelet transform which can provide the instantaneous frequency and energy of the wave records is highly capable of detecting this non stationary behaviour farge 1992 torrence and compo 1998 owing to its attributes this technique is one of the most powerful available random wave data analysis approaches therefore a wavelet based signal will be adopted in this study to investigate the group structure the continuous wavelet transform which is essentially a short term fourier transform with an adjustable window can be expressed as 6 w a b 1 a 0 η t ψ t b a d t where a and b are the dilation and translation parameters respectively ψ denotes a basic wavelet function and asterisk represents the complex conjugate the form of the basic wavelet function should be designated before the analysis in the present study the morlet wavelet is adopted owing to its extensive applications in ocean and meteorological research liu 1994 dong et al 2008 2017 huang and dong 2019a the energy conservation formula for the wavelet transform of η t can be expressed as 7 η t 2 d t 1 c ψ 0 0 w a b 2 a 2 d b d a in which 8 c ψ 0 ψ ω 2 ω d ω where ψ ω is the fourier transform of the basic wavelet function ψ t eq 8 known as the admission condition ensures that η t can be reconstructed from the wavelet coefficients to examine the group structure of a wave record one can define the local energy density as 9 e w b 1 c ψ 0 w a b 2 a 2 d a similar to siweh eq 9 can describe the fluctuations in energy within the wave record please note that the values of a should be selected when calculating the wavelet transform as recommended by torrence and compo 1998 the scale parameter is expressed as fractional powers of two 10 a a 0 2 j δ j j 0 1 j 11 j 1 δ j log 2 n δ t a 0 where n is the number of data points and δt is the sample interval the smallest resolvable scale a 0 is equal to the value corresponding to the fourier period 2δt a smaller value of δ j can provide better resolutions to ensure adequate sampling the maximum value for δ j is about 0 5 for the morlet wavelet in the present study δ j was set to 0 125 analogous to the determination of random waves using the zero up crossing approach a wave group can be regarded as a level crossing event associated with the wavelet local energy density ẽ in eq 5 is chosen as the limit level so that the equivalent envelope threshold level is approximately 0 4hs fig 1 c depicted the wave groups defined by the wavelet method an improvement can be observed i e almost all the wavelet based groups comprise more than one wave crests higher the specified level those envelope based groups containing less than two high waves are either neglected or included in the adjacent groups it is noteworthy that there are five waves between the up crossing of level ẽ at 175 s and the down crossing at 200 s with three waves exceeding the threshold and two waves below the limit as suggested by bassler et al 2010 the exceedance of a wave group can contain individual waves whose amplitudes are smaller than the specified threshold from the point of view of the ship dynamics such a definition can ensure the time duration of a group is sufficiently long so that ships or structures are not affected by the previous excitation event 2 2 wave groupiness one of the primary objectives of wave group research is to establish some measures for the intensity of grouping funke and mansard 1979 presented a groupiness factor based on the siweh 12 g f s 1 e s t 1 t n 0 t n e s t e s t 2 d t where e s t is the mean of the energy signal over the length of the wave sequence t n as mentioned above the calculation of the siweh involves a filtering operation with a window width of t p implying that the value of gf s may be affected by the peak period variation attempting to describe the group structure more accurately list 1991 proposed gf e based on the wave envelope 13 g f e 2 σ a a t where a t and σ a are the average and standard deviation of the wave envelope respectively list 1991 reported that this parameter which ranges from zero to one remained fairly constant in a transition from fair weather to a storm conflicting with the random linear wave theory by contrast the values of gf e decreases rapidly in shallow water and identify the breaking zone very well considering the non stationarity of real ocean wave groups dong et al 2008 defined a groupiness factor gf w using the continuous wavelet transform 14 g f w 1 e w t 1 t n 0 t n e w t e w t 2 d t where e w t is the average of e w t dong et al 2008 illustrated that the choice of δ j which is the only influencing factor during the calculation of e w t slightly affects the values of this parameter accordingly the effect of the operational definition on gf w is smaller compared to that on gf s or gf e for marine disasters associated with resonance phenomena the resonant stress on structures can be determined by both the duration of the driving force and intensity knowledge of the group length with frequencies close to the natural frequencies of structures would be of great value to the risk assessment therefore the run of high waves l which stands for the number of waves exceeding the standard level in a group is a parameter of great concern the average value of the high runs l is a commonly used index of wave grouping investigations on the properties of this groupiness factor have been performed using different statistical models kimura 1980 longuet higgins 1984 ochi and sahinoglou 1989a distributions of consecutive wave heights have been employed by kimura 1980 to examine the characteristics of ocean wave groups as wave groups appear as sequences of high waves it is reasonable that the probability that a wave height is above a certain height given that the previous wave height exceeded the same height which should be a higher priority for parametric rolling design spyrou 2005 can be a manifestation of the wave grouping degree for a specified threshold height h c it is given by 15 p h i 1 h c h i h c 0 h c 0 h c f h h h 1 h 2 d h 1 d h 2 0 h c f h h 1 d h 1 where f h h 1 and f hh h 1 h 2 are the marginal distribution of the wave heights and bivariate distribution of successive wave heights respectively in the present application the significant wave height hs is chosen as the critical height h c in addition the joint distribution of consecutive wave periods f tt t 1 t 2 while relatively uncertain is a major element in the probabilistic design of oscillatory roll motion spyrou 2005 for a better comparison the wave periods are normalised as 16 τ t m 1 m 0 where m k k 0 1 is the moment of the wave power spectra s f given by 17 m k 0 f k s f d f for a specified τ the probability of the wave period falling in the interval of τ 0 1 τ 0 1 given the previous period in the same interval can be calculated based on the conditional probability formula 18 p τ 1 τ 2 τ 2 τ 1 τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 τ 2 f τ 1 τ 2 d τ 1 d τ 2 τ 1 τ 2 f τ 1 d τ 1 where τ 1 τ 0 1 and τ 2 τ 0 1 this conditional probability has been applied by myrhaug et al 2000 to assess the synchronous motion of ship rolling 3 waves with single peaked spectra 3 1 wave data description wave data with single peaked spectra were recorded by a buoy near the coast of qingdao in shandong province china the measurements were performed hourly with a duration of 1024 s from october 17 to november 4 2014 the sample interval of each wave record was 0 5 s wave series with single peaked spectra were picked for the investigation the zero up crossing approach was applied to define the wave crests the values of hs varied between 0 3891 m and 1 9567 m while those of the peak frequency f p varied between 0 1260 hz and 0 2529 hz the values of the kurtosis κ which is closely related to the nonlinearity of the wave records janssen and herbers 2009 ranged from 2 6361 to 3 4163 the kurtosis that were approximately equal to 3 implied that the observations were nearly gaussian before the analysis the wave records were interpolated to eliminate the effect of the sampling rate fig 1 illustrates the divergences of run lengths defined by the envelope siweh and wavelet approaches a more detailed examination of the proportions of wave groups with a given number of high waves for all the observed data was carried out dawson et al 1991 pointed out that statistics should be calculated from truncated spectra when using the envelope method here the lower and higher cut off frequencies were determined as 0 5f p and 6 0f p respectively mase 1989 as the wave envelope is sensitive to the choice of lowpass filter cut off frequency list 1991 two truncated frequencies at 0 2 hz and 0 1 hz for digital filtering were adopted table 1 summarises the percentages based on the three different definitions it can be seen that more than 30 of the envelope crossings involve no wave crests exceeding the critical level for a higher cut off frequency this rate sinks to around 17 when components with frequencies higher than 0 1 hz are filtered out additionally the weight of the wave groups containing only one high wave is lower for the lower frequency truncation indicating that the wave envelope defined by a smaller value of the lowpass filter cut off can determine more groups with greater engineering significance it is obvious that the definition of groups based on the envelope method is significantly affected by the filtering operation the proportions of the eee phenomenon are much lower for the siweh and wavelet based wave groups these two instantaneous wave energy approaches also define more wave groups involving two or more high waves compared to the envelope method it seems that these two techniques are more suitable for the determination of wave groups for marine engineering application moreover it is noteworthy that the energy signal based on the wavelet transform performs slightly better than the siweh with regard to wave group definition as it has a lower percentage of groups with less than two high wave crests 3 2 assessment of groupiness factors wave groupiness is an important consideration in the modern design of offshore structures therefore it is necessary to describe the group structure of a given wave field adequately fig 2 illustrates the groupiness factors defined by the envelope siweh and wavelet approaches as a function of the conditional probability of wave heights p h i 1 h c h i h c the frequency truncation limits can affect the values of gf e the lowpass envelope filter cut off is 0 2 hz for fig 2 a while it is 0 1 hz for fig 2 b plots of the groupiness factors derived by the envelope siweh and wavelet methods denoted by circles triangles and squares respectively indicate that there is a close correspondence between these three group parameters and the conditional probability of wave heights although the values of gf s are larger than those of gf w these two parameters both increase with p h i 1 h c h i h c indicating a positive correlation it is not surprising that the values of gf e in fig 2 b are smaller than those in fig 2 a as the latter involves higher frequency components however the upward trend of gf e is slightly influenced by the filtering process it can also be observed that the dependency of gf e on the conditional probability is weaker than those of the other two parameters the characteristics of the average of the high runs obtained by the three techniques were also examined here please note that the groups without any high wave crests were removed when calculating the mean runs similar to the tendencies of the groupiness factor derived by the envelope siweh and wavelet methods as can be seen in fig 3 the average lengths of high run calculated by these approaches increase as the conditional probability increases it is reasonable that the l determined by the wavelet and siweh approaches are longer owing to their larger percentage of groups containing two or more crests above the threshold level the envelope based l does not change significantly with p h i 1 h c h i h c for the cut off frequencies at 0 2 hz nevertheless for the case of 0 1 hz this parameter appears to be a reliable indicator of wave grouping both figs 2 and 3 suggest that the statistics derived by the wave envelope are very susceptible to filter cut offs for the nearly gaussian wave groups the groupiness factors and mean high runs calculated by the siweh or wavelet transform serve as sensitive measures of the grouping degree additionally in cases where disturbance of high frequency components does not occur knowledge of gf e or the envelope based l allows for the estimation of the extent of wave groupiness to take into account the wave period the conditional probability of the wave period given the previous wave period for different groupiness degree was investigated as can be seen in fig 4 the peaks of p τ 1 τ 2 τ 2 τ 1 τ 1 τ 2 which are located near the mean periods of the wave records increase with the wave grouping moreover the probability with different groupiness degrees can present different sharpnesses flatter for a lower groupiness factor value and more pointed for a higher one it seems that the adjacent waves within a group are more likely to have similar wave periods compared to those that are not clustered if the period of a high wave in a group is close to the resonant period of the oscillation system the structure might be struck by two or even more high waves with periods near to its natural period accordingly wave records with a mean period falling in the resonant period band of motion of the marine systems and strong wave grouping can certainly threaten the safety of the structures and ships 4 waves groups in combined sea states wave spectra measured in real states can present two peaks owing to the mixture of wind sea and swell systems aranuvachapun 1987 nevertheless studies on the statistical properties of wave groups in such sea states receive less attention kumar et al 2003 estimated the wave group statistics in combined sea states utilising observations collected along the indian coast rodríguez et al 2000 investigated the probability distributions of the run length and total length in nine types of combined sea states based on simulated data kimura s model was unable to provide a satisfactory description of the group statistics in mixed sea states in this section a detailed examination will be performed on group structure in wave fields with two peaked spectra by analysing experimental and simulated data chiapponi et al 2020 performed a statistical analysis of the interaction between wind waves and currents and found that the wave grouping can reflect the action of the current the authors observed that wave energies can transfer to longer waves and a double peaked spectrum can be formed in the presence of counter currents 4 1 wave data a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to generate secondary waves which stand as perfect examples of ocean waves involving various of wave systems such waves can be observed when long swells travel over a bar or breakwater the nonlinear wave wave interactions can cause the decomposition of wave energy and transfer to higher harmonics and thus the formation of waves with multi peaked spectra beji and battjes 1993 kuznetsov and saprykina 2012 the wave flume used in this study was 68 m long 1 m wide and 1 5 m deep and was equipped with a wave generator at one end of the tank fig 5 shows a schematic of the wave flume to reduce wave reflections a wave absorber was installed at each end of the basin a vertical breakwater was installed 32 m away from the wave maker the top surface of the caisson was 0 98 m above the bottom of the wave flume the still water level was set to 0 96 m during all the sets of experiments three wave gauges were placed along the length of the flume with one gauge on the windward side and two gauges on the leeward side of the obstruction gauge number one captured the incident wave signal and gauges number two and three measured the secondary wave records five experimental wave conditions were considered and the jonswap spectra were chosen to generate the incident waves the wave parameters are listed in table 2 fig 6 illustrates the average spectral densities of the experimental data the major characteristics of the two peaked spectra are the ratio of the energies of the two wave systems and the distance between the peak frequencies in this study two dimensionless parameters are adopted rodríguez et al 2000 19 s s e r m 0 w s m 0 s w 0 s s e r 1 20 i d f p w s f p s w f p w s f p s w 0 i d 1 where m 0ws and m 0sw denote the zeroth order spectral moments of the wind sea and swell systems respectively f pws and f psw represent the peak frequencies of the wind sea and swell components respectively based on these two parameters the mixed sea states can be classified into nine types rodríguez et al 2000 the secondary waves whose sser values range from 0 66 to 0 90 and id values are between 0 32 and 0 39 are dominated by low frequency components with two spectral peaks located at a medium distance moreover the κ values vary from 4 67 to 14 16 implying higher nonlinearity the wavelet energy spectra of the incident waves and secondary waves for case 1 which is shown in fig 7 clearly illustrate the energy transfer from the first harmonics to higher components the group structure of the wave records can be sufficiently reflected by the wavelet energy distributions dong et al 2008 the more uniform distribution of secondary waves implies that waves propagating over barriers have not only lower mean periods but also decreasing groupiness such features are of significance to the development of coastal protection kuznetsov and saprykina 2012 the experimental data cannot cover all the combined sea states according to rye 1982 elgar et al 1985 liu et al 1993 and smith et al 2006 the statistical properties of the observed wave groups are comparable with those of the linear simulations therefore nine types of combined sea states based on the study by rodríguez et al 2000 were simulated using the six parameter spectral model ochi and hubble 1976 for a comprehensive study table 3 illustrates the descriptive statistics of the simulated data to avoid statistical fluctuations 1000 realisations with 32768 data points and a time step of 0 5 s for each type of sea state were simulated ozbahceci et al 2002 4 2 wave groupiness analysis it should be noted that the siweh series is averaged over t p by a filter function indicating that this method is unsuitable for the analysis of bimodal spectrum waves therefore only the envelope and wavelet approaches were used to examine the characteristics of wave groups another issue that needed attention was the effect of multi peaked spectra on the wave envelope or instantaneous energy signal according to tayfun and lo 1989 the spectral density of a t contains the following term 21 s a f π 4 m 0 0 s u s u f d u s a f can present the double peak structure if s f represents the power spectra of a combined sea state fig 8 illustrates the envelope spectrum and s a f of the experimental data for case 1 please note that s a f is only part of the integral envelope spectra hence the shape in fig 8 b is not yet entirely matched with that in fig 8 a it can be observed that both the estimate and theoretical spectra of secondary waves present a two peaked structure to explore the properties of other types of combined sea states the envelope spectra of the simulated data were calculated as shown in fig 9 as can be expected the bimodal feature becomes increasingly prominent with an increase in id values moreover the spectral bandwidth is broader for larger id values it is noteworthy that the envelope spectral width of the wind sea dominated sea state is narrowest while that of the sea swell energy equivalent sea state is widest accordingly the envelope filtering truncation should be chosen with caution in the present application the filtering implementation will not be applied to the envelopes of waves with two peaked spectra to avoid information loss fig 10 shows the variations in the groupiness factors and mean length of high runs with the conditional probability of the wave heights for secondary waves surprisingly no clear correlation between these two group parameters was obtained for the envelope or wavelet methods and p h i 1 h c h i h c there are two possible explanations for the ineffectiveness of these two measures the envelope spectra are wider and bimodal or the secondary waves involve high nonlinearity a comparative investigation was performed by simulating waves with similar power and envelope spectra of secondary waves the technique proposed by xu et al 1993 was therefore adopted the relationships between the two group parameters and p h i 1 h c h i h c for simulated data are shown in fig 11 the two approaches illustrate the similar tendency of increasing the groupiness factor and mean length of high runs as the conditional probability becomes larger implying that the results in fig 10 can be attributed to the nonlinear coupling between wave components fig 12 shows the variation in the groupiness factor and mean high runs with kurtosis for secondary waves the increasing trends of gf e or gf w corroborate the results obtained by li et al 2015 that the groupiness factor can reflect the nonlinearity and instability of a wave in addition the values of l calculated by the two approaches decrease with the κ values i e for higher nonlinear wave records the envelope and wavelet based l are shorter this might be caused by fluctuations in a t and e w t induced by the nonlinearity it is reasonable that the l values would decrease when such nonlinear fluctuations increase these effects can obscure the fluctuations invoked by the wave grouping therefore the above group parameters determined by the envelope or wavelet approaches do not sufficiently capture the group structure further investigation is required on more appropriate grouping indicators for nonlinear waves the wave grouping of nine types of combined sea states was examined using simulated data to investigate the effect of the double peaked spectrum on the group parameters figs 13 and 14 show the variations in the groupiness factor and mean length of high runs with the wave grouping respectively for gf w a homogeneous increasing trend is observed as p h i 1 h c h i h c increases for all categories of sea states although gf e presents a similar tendency this parameter is not strongly related to the conditional probability it is noteworthy that the trends of these two groupiness factors are less obvious for lower grouping degrees this effect is more apparent for gf e as it has a narrower range especially when the two peaked structure is more distinct and the bandwidth of the envelope spectra is broader as can be seen in categories c and iiia gf e suggests a nearly constant value these features have a smaller impact on gf w by comparison this is consistent with the results from single peaked wave data that gf e is more susceptible to the envelope spectral width the l defined by the wavelet method exhibits on average increasing trends for the nine types of wave systems it exhibits a less manifest correlation when the envelope spectrum is broader or the p h i 1 h c h i h c values are smaller the l defined by the envelope method seems to be almost independent of p h i 1 h c h i h c especially for wider envelope spectra and lower wave grouping levels the shape and bandwidth of the envelope spectra have a greater influence on the behaviour of the mean length of high runs than the groupiness factor as can be observed in figs 13 and 14 for larger id values which are correlated with distinguishing bimodal features and broad envelope spectra higher values of l do not correspond to higher p h i 1 h c h i h c if the wave grouping of a wave record is lower a higher proportion of values close to the average of the high runs would be obtained a broader bandwidth and greater energies of higher frequency components for an envelope spectrum can decrease the number of larger high runs values and thus aggravate the situation under such conditions l is unable to characterise the wave groupiness adequately a larger number of analyses of the group structure in mixed sea states are needed such as probability distribution of the wave group length one should note that the definition of wave groups is analogous to the zero up crossing method this implies that the probability structure might present multimodal feature as the envelope spectrum is bimodal huang and dong 2019b huang et al 2020 5 extreme wave group waves with extreme heights larger than twice the significant wave height are called freak waves wave groups containing extreme wave heights called extreme wave groups have attracted the attention of many oceanographers owing to their severe destruction of vessels and offshore facilities su 1986 research suggests that wave group structure influences the formation and geometric properties of extreme waves wu and yao 2004 ortega and smith 2009 found two patterns of large waves in the hilbert spectrum which might imply two different mechanisms for the generation of extreme waves using thousands of 20 min raw wave samples christou and ewans 2011 performed a wavelet analysis on the temporal evolution of the spectral density and the phase spectra of freak wave events in most of studies mentioned above the grouping of high waves was performed from a statistical perspective whilst some researchers are bidding to explain them from a physical perspective the modulational instability and envelope soliton model have been applied in studies on the wave group properties of storm waves mase and iwagaki 1986 5 1 wave measurements the wave data were collected during typhoon haima which occurred between october 20 and october 22 2016 wave measurements were carried out hourly on nanao island in guangdong province china four wave records containing freak waves were used in this study each record was 1024 s long with a sampling period of 0 5 s table 4 lists the characteristics of the analysed wave records the maximum waves in records i iii and iv obey the abnormality criterion while two waves in record ii can be treated as rogue waves fig 15 shows the time series of the considered four records the freak waves in records i iii and iv did not occur with larger waves by contrast both the two freaks waves in record ii are in the extreme wave groups the relatively larger kurtosis implies that these wave records involve abnormal waves signifying non gaussian sea states these results support the finding by christou et al 2008 who employed the wavelet transform to compare the focused wave groups generated by three different models i e the linear second order and fully nonlinear wave models that the rapid amplification of all frequency components near the freak wave is a demonstration of the enhancement of nonlinearity therefore some group parameters such as the groupiness factors and average of high runs may not serve as effective indicators of wave grouping degree for series containing freak waves the ratio of the crest height to wave height ζ h crest h max is another important parameter that can be used to determine whether a wave is rogue the freak waves in records i and iv with ζ larger than 0 5 appear to be more asymmetrical while the maximum wave in record iii with ζ close to 0 5 is relatively symmetrical it is worth noting that the two freak waves in record ii exhibit symmetrical and asymmetrical profiles respectively it seems that both single freak waves and extreme wave groups exhibit asymmetry features 5 2 wavelet analysis of freak waves the wavelet transform approach has been depicted as an ideal method for identifying the occurrence of rogue waves and describing their statistical properties liu and mori 2000 figs 16 19 illustrate the wavelet power spectra and phase spectra of the preceding wave freak wave and succeeding wave for records i ii iii and iv as mentioned above the group structure of a wave record can be reflected by its wavelet power spectrum the more uniform wavelet energy distributions of records i iii and iv indicate that these series have lower degrees of groupiness compared to record ii accordingly it is not surprising that the freak waves in record ii accompany other large waves while those in the other three records appear as single abnormal waves the location of a freak wave can be identified as the point where an instantaneous energy surge occurs in a wavelet power spectrum however significant differences can be observed between an extreme wave group and a single freak wave for records i iii and iv the wavelet energy densities at the freak events extend toward higher frequencies nevertheless similar characteristics of wave energy transfer to high frequency components do not appear in the wavelet spectrum of record ii therefore at the maximum event the power spectrum of a single freak wave would be broader than that of an extreme wave group in other words the spectral bandwidth at the time of freak wave occurrence might be an adequate measure of the groupiness for extreme wave groups this corroborates the results of mase et al 1990 who found that the maximum wave in a record is usually accompanied by large waves for narrow spectra whereas the converse is true for wide spectra the evolution of an extreme wave group has been investigated by touboul et al 2006 and li et al 2015 in the time and frequency domains according to li et al 2015 the almost symmetrical triangles in the wavelet spectra of records i iii and iv imply that they are in the stage of full freak wave growth while the forms in record ii indicate the focusing or defocusing stage in the process of freak wave generation the effect of the wind can increase the freak wave height and lengthen the lifetime of the rogue wave event touboul et al 2006 the phenomenon of phase locking can be observed at the instance of abnormal wave occurrence for all the considered records especially in the high energy region this peculiarity of the phase concentration has been reported by christou and ewans 2011 and lee et al 2011 it implies that the integration of different frequency components with approximately identical phases might be a major cause of freak wave generation by contrast at the crests before and after the maximum wave the phase spectra appear to vary significantly i e the energetic frequency components of the previous and posterior waves are out of phase 6 conclusions in the present study the statistical characteristics of ocean wave groups were investigated with a focus on single peaked spectra bimodal spectra and the freak wave event the envelope method siweh and wavelet transform were adopted to explore the group structure the properties of a single freak wave and extreme wave group are examined and compared by wavelet analysis the conclusions can be summarised as follows 1 the groupiness factors and average of high runs defined by these three approaches are capable of indicating the wave grouping degree in gaussian sea states with single peaked spectra compared to the envelope method the siweh and wavelet method provide a lower proportion of eee and wave groups involving single high waves with smaller operational definition influence 2 the envelope spectra in combined sea states can present a bimodal structure the longer distance of the two spectral peaks can lead to more prominent bimodal features for the envelope spectrum the groupiness factor derived by the wavelet method serves as a more reliable measure of wave groupiness than that derived by the envelope method nevertheless the mean length of high runs determined by these two methods cannot describe the groupiness degree accurately especially for broader envelope spectrum and lower groupiness 3 the statistics defined by the wave envelope or wavelet approach fail to capture the group structure of waves with strong nonlinearity such as the secondary waves under these circumstances the groupiness factors and average mean length calculated by these two methods show a manifest correlation with wave kurtosis implying that these parameters can indicate the nonlinearity and instability of a wave further analyses on the description of wave groupiness for nonlinear waves are required in a future study 4 during the freak wave event the energies of a single freak wave will extend toward higher frequency components while those of an extreme wave group are confined to low frequency components therefore the spectral bandwidth at the freak wave event is recommended as an indicator of wave groupiness the phase spectra results suggest that for either a single freak wave or an extreme wave group the frequency components in the high energy region are in phase at instant of freak wave occurrence credit authorship contribution statement weinan huang conceptualization methodology software validation

20953,tropical cyclone tc wind and wave models are used to quantify meteorological and oceanographic conditions in the application of offshore engineering design criteria in regions such as the north west shelf of australia a statistically sound risk of failure design assessment can require historical records far longer than are typically available even with meteorological datasets of several decades length to address this mismatch between design requirements and observational history synthetic tropical cyclone wind and wave datasets can be developed to mimic long records with the objective of estimating extreme event average recurrence intervals of 10 000 years modelling large numbers of tc storms in practice requires a trade off between time computational efficiency and accuracy model skill the development of the synthetic dataset in this study draws the balance by combining computationally efficient parametric models and computationally intensive fully dynamic models with different model grid resolutions this paper outlines performance differences between the various model approaches and make recommendations for engineering keywords tropical cyclones wind model wave model 1 introduction the northwest shelf nws fig 1 of australia is an active industrial region characterised by capital intensive engineered structures and ongoing oil and gas operations offshore operations rely on accurate marine forecasts and tropical cyclones tcs are an especially significant consideration potential impacts include the need to shut down operations accidental release of hazardous materials or critical damage to infrastructure e g hasling 2016 kaiser 2008 cruz and krausmann 2008 in this context the bureau of meteorology have developed an operational ensemble prediction system for tc winds and waves zieger et al 2018 aijaz et al 2019 in addition to ongoing operational matters estimated tc conditions play an essential role in the engineering design processes for offshore structures ships and moorings designs are often limited by estimates of fatigue loading and the likelihood of extreme events these design constraints are commonly evaluated via average recurrence intervals ari for wind and wave conditions and the primary basis of such analyses is accurate historical meteorological and oceanographic observations historical records of tropical storms cover the past 30 50 years but may occasionally date back further a record of 30 50 years allows the estimation of an ari of a 1 in 100 150 year event caires and sterl 2005 vinoth and young 2011 the comparatively short time span associated with historical records can be overcome by synthesising events and applying numerical models as predictors to estimate say an ari of a 1 in 1 000 year event tropical cyclones are extreme events characterised by intense wind fields that vary rapidly in magnitude and direction in space and time the unique spatial compactness of the vortex structure has led to numerous parametric models for tropical cyclone surface wind fields e g hughes 1952 holland 1980 willoughby et al 2006 holland et al 2010 when considering the response of ocean surface waves to tropical cyclone winds the situation becomes increasingly complex for example it is still not clear which physical processes are dominant across the lifecycle of a tropical cyclone event this is particularly true for the momentum transferred from the winds to the waves and the role of drag coefficient at high wind speeds powell et al 2003 makin 2005 moon et al 2008 similar to parametric wind models there have been attempts to describe the surface wave field through parametric means by analysing a range of data sources including in situ buoy observations altimeter observations and numerical model data young 2017 the surface wave field associated with tropical cyclone winds is however relatively complex forward motion significantly modulates the spatial distribution of wind sea generation and the direction of generating winds young 2006 existing parametric wave models young 1988 young and burchell 1996 young and vinoth 2013 have demonstrated some skill in estimating the spatial distribution of integral wave parameters including significant wave height and peak wave period these models incorporate theoretical knowledge from fetch limited observations hasselmann et al 1973 and differ in size and source of the underlying storm observations the more interested reader is referred to young 2017 who provides a review of parametric models for tropical cyclone applications parametric wave models are computationally cheap to run compared to third generation wave models but their application is limited for example if directional properties of the wave field are required the purpose of this paper is to investigate the balance between computational efficiency and skill in the results from various parametric and dynamic modelling approaches applied to a large number of storms section 2 gives an overview of the wind and wave models and highlights common aspects and differences between models methods are outlined in section 3 our assessment of the parametric models versus the dynamic models is shown in section 4 this is followed by a discussion in section 5 and conclusion in section 6 2 models parametric tropical cyclone models aim to reproduce key features of spatial fields from a small number of parameters they generally do not represent the entire three dimensional structure but rather produce an environmental field at a single vertical level typical models are realised in storm centric coordinates and largely ignore any asymmetric effects historic storm track databases exist that collate analysed properties such as storm centre coordinates central pressure p c maximum wind speed v max radius to maximum winds r max and radius to gales r gale radius to 34 kt wind speed the australian best track database is a publicly available example and forms the basis of this study bureau of meteorology 2020a despite the complexity of tc dynamics the few track parameters available can sufficiently describe the gradient wind field and allow estimation of the maximum expected value in the associated wave field as will be demonstrated below based on the probability distribution of track parameters in the best track database a large synthetic tropical cyclone dataset was developed consisting of 665 711 storms over the nws region of australia the dataset is a set of storm tracks each varying in cyclone position intensity and structure at consecutive times spatially varying statistics were developed for tropical cyclone motion parameters to allow track density intensity and other parameters to vary spatially and seasonally in addition autocorrelation functions were used to incorporate memory or temporal correlation of track parameters statistics of cyclone formation life time and landfall have been developed using guidance from the historic track database the synthetic track database includes tracks with lengths as short as 2 days ranging up to about 20 days details of the synthetic track database can be found in bureau of meteorology 2020b 2 1 parametric wind model parametric radial wind profiles can be formulated in terms of either wind or pressure because wind has a more direct influence on the engineering impact this section will be framed in terms of wind the wind fields provided by parametric tropical cyclone models are intended to provide a statistically unbiased estimate of the mean wind at a particular location and time within the cyclone and omit the effects of turbulence and gustiness following the arguments of harper et al 2010 it is therefore meaningless to describe them as representing for example 1 min winds or 10 min winds as the expected value of the mean wind at a given point in space and time is simply the true statistical mean provided only that the averaging period is short enough to not be influenced by the movement or development of the cyclone scale circulation harper et al 2010 the holland profile h80 holland 1980 and the modified rankine vortex mrv hughes 1952 are two widely used wind profiles that can be completely specified by three tropical cyclone parameters v max r max and r gale the outer wind radius essentially defines the wind at all radii between r max and r gale in the case of h80 it modifies the wind structure inside of r max as well willoughby et al 2006 wdr recognises that inner wind radius r r max and outer wind radius r r max can change and thus introduced two new radial models that both require additional parameters these are subsequently referred to as the wdr single and double formulations the single wdr profiles has the following differences to the mrv i the decay of winds outside of r max is exponential rather than a power law and the length scale l 1 of that exponential decay is a parameter to the profile ii the flow inside r max is not necessarily in solid body rotation but given by a power law whose exponent n is a parameter to the profile typically 0 4 n 2 4 and iii smoothing is applied in the vicinity of r max so that the profile has several continuous radial derivatives the mrv has none the width lb of this smoothing band is a further parameter to the model the relevant equations are as follows inside of r max 1 v i n n e r r v m a x r r m a x n outside of r max 2 v o u t e r r v m a x e r m a x r l 1 the full wdr single profile is written as 3 v r 1 w r v i n n e r r w r v o u t e r r where w r is a weighting function that goes from 0 to 1 over a blending zone of width 2l b that includes r max and is 0 at radii inside of the blending zone and 1 outside of it the details of the weighting function are given by wdr recognising the need for additional variability in wind profiles wdr also introduced the double profile in which the outer structure is represented by the weighted sum of two exponentials rather than one 4 v o u t e r r 1 x v m a x e r m a x r l 1 x v m a x e r m a x r l 2 they thus introduce two additional parameters the length scale l 2 of the second exponential and the relative weight of the two exponentials x making five in total since fitting the sum of two exponentials to data is not well conditioned they recommend that the shorter of the two length scales l 2 be held constant at 25 km for practical applications fig 2 b shows several wdr profiles with the same v max r max and r gale showing that the degree of concavity of the profile between r max and r gale can vary using aircraft reconnaissance data in the north atlantic wdr found that roughly one third of observed storms fit better with their second profile than their first or in other words about one third of storms require a non zero value of x we illustrate the differences between the profiles in fig 2a which shows how the three profiles fit a reasonably intense cyclone with a horizontal scale typical of north western australia v max 40 m s 1 78 kt r max 25 km and r gale 150 km the selected vortex parameters are given in the legend fig 2a the wdr and h80 wind profiles are quite similar except for r 50 km where the h80 profile has a much broader maximum in contrast the mrv is dramatically different with much lower winds for r max r r gale and much greater outside of that the three profile shapes in fig 2a have some significantly different properties in the mrv the vorticity is always positive while h80 and the single wdr profiles usually have an annulus of negative vorticity well outside of the r max poor choices of parameters can result in the amplitude of this annulus becoming so large that the vortex is inertially unstable and hence physically implausible this constraint is the source of the well known requirement that shape parameter b 2 5 in h80 in the h80 profile the eye expands and the pressure drop increases near r max as b increases from zero for the mrv model total circulation around a circle of radius r becomes infinite in the limit as r approaches infinity in contrast this quantity is bounded in h80 and wdr when deriving pressure fields by radial integration of the gradient wind equation the integral to infinite radius is bounded in h80 and wdr but not in mrv we have elected to use the wdr profiles in this study primarily because it was developed using a large database of aircraft observations in tropical cyclones and avoids the major known limitations of other parametric profiles a challenge with this profile is dealing with the relatively large number of vortex parameters based on position intensity v max inner core size r max and outer core size r gale from the best track database an objective methodology was developed to fit wdr parameters that define a gradient level vortex in the wind field details and verification of this methodology are described in a companion manuscript bureau of meteorology 2020b 2 2 simple and complex wind models the parametric profile described in the previous section provides an axisymmetric wind field at the top of the boundary layer this study employs two alternative methods to derive the required surface winds denoted as the simple and complex wind models both introduce asymmetry into the wind fields the simple model is like the dynamical model in that it first constructs a gradient level wdr profile which is adjusted to provide surface wind fields while the complex model does this adjustment through iterating the hydrodynamical equations of motion to near equilibrium the simple model performs the adjustment statistically the simple wind model assumes that the surface wind speed can be modelled as 5 v 10 r θ s r v g r r u t c w f θ where v 10 r θ is the magnitude of the surface wind vector s r is a radius dependent surface wind reduction factor v g r r is the gradient level wind profile u t c is the magnitude of the cyclone motion vector w is the ratio of the wind asymmetry to the cyclone motion f is a sinusoidal function of storm relative azimuth that ranges between 1 and 1 with maximum in the left forward quadrant consistent with observations and the dynamical wind model described next r is radius and θ is the azimuth relative to storm motion note that the wind asymmetry is approximately proportional to the storm motion speed for the complex wind model the asymmetric wind at the bottom of the boundary layer is calculated by applying a fully dynamic three dimensional model the kepert wang model kw kepert and wang 2001 kepert 2012 to the wdr profiles described in the preceding section the complex wind model diagnoses the boundary layer flow by solving the dry equations of motion beneath a prescribed pressure field the solution is found by integrating the equations forward in time until a quasi steady state is achieved which generally occurs after 24 simulation hours however in order to speed up the convergence to steady state of the complex wind model the model was initialised from the solution to the linear model kepert 2001 saving half the computational cost without material effect on the results the complex model set up consists of 20 vertical levels with the lowest at 10 m and the top at 2 25 km resolution is highest near the surface a translating coordinate system is used in which the lower boundary is shifted so that the parameterized tropical cyclone is stationary in the model domain the horizontal grid spacing is 3 km the horizontal model extent is 1200 1200 km larger than in many previous studies using this model according to the best track database the 99th percentile of the r gale for storms west of 130 e is 400 km this domain is therefore sufficient to contain the gale force winds of almost all storms while also leaving an ample allowance for blending of the sub gale winds into the environment the model is run for 12 simulated hours by which time all fields have attained a nearly steady state each model run represents a single instantaneous time when the tropical cyclone centre is at a specific location as it moves along its track the model is run multiple times to simulate the tropical cyclone vortex at 3 h intervals during the passage of the cyclone and the fields are then interpolated to 30 min intervals in storm relative coordinates the surface wind fields are extracted from the three dimensional model outputs and blended into matching era interim dee et al 2011 background fields the blending procedure uses a fifth order polynomial blending function in which the blending radius is dynamically calculated from the azimuthal mean of wind speed zieger et al 2021 time interpolation in storm centric coordinates avoids elongation artefacts due to storm motion a maximum storm duration of 7 days was modelled with the times and locations of the vortex centre of simulation defined such that the tropical cyclone vortex was generated 4 days before and 3 days after it passed the specific target site nra fig 1 when analysing historical events the dates of the event are known therefore existing analysis or reanalysis of atmospheric and wave boundary conditions can be used for synthetic events in order to select appropriate environmental fields for blending it is necessary to identify an analogue historical event whose time sequence of atmospheric and wave boundary conditions can be applied to the synthetic event these time sequences need to be approximately one week long thus we need to match one week synthetic track sections against the best track database this matching was based on a measure of distance between tracks i e nearest neighbour 2 3 parametric wave model as discussed in section 2 1 parametric radial profiles provide a method through which tropical cyclone wind fields can be reproduced from a small number of parameters in a similar fashion it is possible to derive a parametric tropical cyclone wave field in the context of this study three parametric wave models have been evaluated young 2017 y88 young 1988 yb96 young and burchell 1996 and y13 young and vinoth 2013 all three models use the concept of an equivalent fetch f to estimate the parametric wave field equivalent fetch can be parameterised using effective radius r 6 r 22 5 10 3 l o g 10 r m a x 70 8 10 3 7 f r a b 1 v m a x 2 b 2 v m a x v

60 m s 1 and forward speed v fm 0 0 12 5 m s 1 the three parametric models are fits to different sets of observations the coefficients for each model are listed in table 1 and fig 3 shows contour lines of f r the solid blue boxes in fig 3 indicate the range for which the empirical model has been developed values outside this box have been extrapolated and should therefore be treated with caution it should be noted that the synthetic tropical cyclone database contains tcs outside these parameter ranges knowing the values of the fetch f one can use the fetch limited wave growth relationship jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 to determine maximum significant wave height h s max and the maximum wave peak period t p max in the wave field g refers to the gravitational constant 8 g h

the wave field once the spatial distribution of h s max and t p max have been determined these diagrams can be used to map out the entire distribution around the centre of the tropical cyclone the spatial distribution diagrams have been non dimensionalised by the effective radius r the effective radius as a function of r max is shown in fig 4 the extent of the spatial distribution diagrams is limited to about 12r there are a number of significant limitations in the use of a parametric wave models firstly the model is limited in terms of the spatial extent of the domain as noted above secondly it can only estimate the two integral parameters h s and t p a third limitation is that the parametric wave models examined here have been derived for a limited range of tropical cyclone parameters specifically v fm and v max and caution should be used outside these ranges fig 3 solid blue lines fourthly the wave field distributions were estimated with a relatively primitive second generation wave model which omits the non linear interaction term finally the pre computed spatial distributions are based on a static wind profile with a fixed r max and assume no bottom topography i e deep water an illustrative example is shown in fig 6 2 4 dynamic wave models the dynamic gridded wave model used is based on wavewatch iii ww3 version 6 07 the wavewatch dev group 2019 ww3 is a widely used operational and research wave modelling framework which is able to simulate waves in extreme conditions liu et al 2017 the full implementation of ww3 for synthetic tropical cyclone waves is hereafter referred to as stc and is replicated from zieger et al 2021 the domain spans 25 s 8 s and 100 e 135 e see fig 1 and is a multiple resolution grid that consists of one 5 km 0 05 resolution grid for the north west shelf and two dedicated 1 km 0 01 grids around the complex features of rowley shoals row and scott and seringapatam reefs ssr in addition a computationally cheaper implementation with a spatial resolution of 0 20 was created this is referred to t20 hereafter details of the wave model grid configurations are listed in table 2 and table 3 itemizes differences between simple and complex wave models accurate bathymetry is a fundamental but non trivial requirement for the dynamic wave model alternative datasets were assessed against field data provided by our industry partner woodside pty ltd with gebco weatherall et al 2015 selected as the broad area base bathymetry our assessment identified two areas specifically row and ssr away from the coastline characterised by poor accuracy in all bathymetry datasets to address this deficiency we digitized depths from admiralty charts and merged them with field data from our industry partner for the high resolution 1 km grids the bottom friction source term in ww3 bt4 includes a roughness parameterisation that allows formation of ripples on sandy bottoms with medium sediment size d50 0 2 mm this value of d50 was used for all areas with the exception of reefs within the 1 km resolution grids of stc where it was increased to d50 2 0 mm see table 2 in order to select between viable source term configurations with the stc model we trialled several configurations under the high quality hindcast wind fields described in section 2 2 with wave boundary conditions obtained from a global model see next paragraph the results were assessed against wave observations from 17 storms in the nws region zieger et al 2021 all of the alterative wave model configurations showed similar results with an overall mean absolute error in peak h s mostly less than 0 90 m configuration test471f showed an overall mean absolute error in peak h s of 0 87 m and was selected for all wave model configurations of the present study see table 2 wave boundary conditions bcs are required to represent remotely generated swell in the simulations for the synthetic storms in the present work and the stc model these bcs were obtained from a lower resolution 0 40 global wave simulation surface winds for this global model were obtained from the ncep climate forecast system version 2 cfs2 saha et al 2014 directional wave spectra were saved along the boundaries of the domain at 3 hourly intervals and a spatial resolution of 0 40 for 5 years during the southern hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons 2013 14 through to 2017 18 these five years of tropical cyclone season also provided initial conditions ics for the wave model within the domain at 2 day intervals to map synthetic time to wave model time the year of the start date of the simulation was replaced with a year ranging from 2013 to 2018 once an appropriate year was assigned initial conditions and boundary conditions were automatically selected from pre computed databases based on the start day month and year the initial day of the synthetic storm was rounded to midnight of the next closest day of a restart file the seasons were cycled through sequentially as the surface winds from each synthetic tc were blended with era interim background fields rather than those from cfs2 minor inconsistencies may be expected at the beginning of each event such inconsistencies may impact both initial wind fields and the wave ics and bcs however a comparison of cfs2 winds and era interim winds found that the spatial distribution of the two datasets is very similar and the mean wind speeds are within 0 5 m s 1 over most of the southern ocean see fig 5 it is therefore reasonable to assume that the use of different atmospheric hindcast sources had minimal impact on the development of the bcs and ics the computationally cheap model t20 uses open bcs and jonswap fetch limited ics hasselmann et al 1973 komen et al 1994 3 method as noted in the introduction modelling of the winds and waves of such a large number of storms comes at a computational cost however the aim of long return period risk assessment requires the tails of the distribution to be resolved as well as is practicable it is therefore desirable to perform detailed wind and wave modelling predominantly for high impact storms accordingly storm selection processes were developed and applied at a specific target site north rankin see fig 1 to ensure that the detailed modelling was done so far as was practically possible on the most extreme cases that is storms within the upper tail of the wind and or wave distributions direct comparisons of the parametric wave models are based on two different subsets of the full synthetic storm database the differences between the subsets were important for the purpose of estimating the return period risk or ari as was undertaken in a separate piece of work but this is not part of the present study and is irrelevant for the purpose of wave model intercomparison for all 665 711 storms in the synthetic database an initial estimate of winds and wave parameters at the target site was calculated with the simple wind model and the yb96 parametric wave model a subset of storms which produced the highest waves at that site was then produced these selected storms were subsequently modelled with the complex wind model and the dynamic wave models the synthetic tropical cyclone parameters were applied to prescribe wdr wind profiles at the upper boundary to compute the gradient level winds at 10 m surface height in both the simple and complex wind models section 2 2 these wind fields were subsequently applied to force the alternative wave model configurations differences between the various models will be analysed in the following way simple wind model vs complex wind model parametric wave model from track parameters vs stc wave model forced with complex winds t20 wave model forced with simple winds vs stc wave model forced with simple winds t20 wave model forced with simple winds vs stc wave model forced with complex winds our assumption throughout is that the stc wave model forced with the complex winds represents the most physically realistic depiction of the wave fields and that comparisons will illuminate the degradation incurred by each of the cheaper modelling approaches this assumption is based on the stc model having the most complete physics and highest model resolution furthermore verification of 17 tc hindcasts has demonstrated the high quality of this model zieger et al 2021 4 results 4 1 wind model intercomparison we compare the simple and dynamical wind models for two intense synthetic storms at one point in time these two examples are representative and all storms show similar features as the storm intensifies intense storms with small radius to gales can be well described by the simple wind model those less intense storms with larger radius to gales show systematic biases between radius to maximum winds and radius to gales the first such storm was synthetic tc 0499038 see fig 7 the azimuthal mean structure shows two particular features good agreement in intensity v max but a substantially increased r gale for the simple wind model the winds from the simple model are up to 4 m s 1 too strong directly ahead of the storm similar plots for the generally faster moving synthetic tc 0919526 are shown in fig 8 the agreement between radius to maximum winds and radius to gales has improved however there is a systematic high bias in the simple wind model across that range since the simple wind model is statistically based it is natural to ask whether these systematic biases can be removed the high bias between r max and r gale appears to be due to the linear interpolation of the surface wind factor between these radii it is likely that a more complex model could alleviate this issue for instance one could also calculate statistical models for radius dependent wind reduction factor s r in equation 5 at the intermediate radii r storm and r hurr and use a higher order interpolation it is clear from the plots that the simple wind model works well at the radii where s is presently modelled and so it is reasonable to expect that applying similar models at other radii would improve the present interpolation the second systematic issue is the front back wind speed bias with the simple wind model tending to have its maximum winds too close to the front of the storm this is a problem not just in the inner core but also at larger radii where the dynamical model tends to have the strongest winds at a given radius on the left but slightly to the rear rather than in the left forward quadrant it appears that the function f θ should be a function of r as well and that there may also be benefit in making the azimuth of maximum winds depend also on other storm parameters as was done with s and w 4 2 wave model intercomparison the various wave model configurations sections 2 3 2 4 are compared using two different subsets of the full synthetic storm database direct comparisons of the parametric wave models are based on a selection of 1 000 storms covering the tail and body of the storm distribution later the discussion of maximum wind speed and h s values obtained from the simple and complex models is based on the 2 300 storm subset the differences between the versions are not important for the purpose of wave model intercomparison both datasets are for the same target site nra 4 2 1 parametric comparisons of h s from the three versions of the parametric wave model y88 yb96 and yv13 and the stc wave model are shown in fig 9 the comparisons are for maximum h s within a 25 grid point region around the centre of the storm the yv13 and y88 models overestimate maximum h s for intense storms with a systematic positive bias out of the three models compared the yb96 version in fig 9 and table 4 appears to be the most skilful i e rmse 3 50 m bias 1 91 m scatter index 0 42 the two peaks in the distributions reflect the fact that these 1 000 storms include tail storms and body storms note that these figures are actually the best comparisons possible as they consider the maximum h s value within the region around the tc wherever it occurs in that region spatial interpolation to the exact coordinates of the point of interest will further increase the scatter and reduce the skill of all the parametric wave models a point to point comparison using the most skilful parametric model yb96 and interpolating to the site of interest is shown in fig 10 the scatter in fig 10 is increased compared to fig 9 the increase in scatter can be attributed to the issues relating to the pre computed spatial distribution diagrams for the wave field young 1988 limitations of these fields have been discussed in section 2 3 last paragraph scatter plots for peak wave period were also produced for the parametric wave model yb96 with even poorer performance in particular the correlation coefficient ρ is less than 0 3 as shown in table 4 and fig 11 4 2 2 coarse resolution in this section integrated wave parameters from the coarse resolution wave model t20 are compared to those from stc model for point to point comparisons at nra for an initial set of 1 000 storms wind forcing for the coarse resolution model is obtained from the simple wind model the stc model is forced by the complex wind model the results shown in fig 12 are significantly improved over those of the parametric wave models figs 10 and 11 the remaining scatter between models stc and t20 can be attributed to differences in wind profiles e g figs 7 and 8 initial and boundary conditions and spectral and spatial resolution to investigate more closely the skill of the t20 model configuration two intense synthetic tropical cyclones 499038 and 919526 were examined in more detail differences in wind profiles for these storms have been plotted in figs 7 and 8 fig 13 shows time histories of wind speed h s and t p for the two tropical cyclones and indicates that a maximum h s of 16 4 m was simulated for both storms with the stc model which is 1 4 m and 2 2 m lower than the estimate with t20 and simple winds modelled values obtained from the simple models are broader and more intense around the peak for both wind speed and h s it is clear from fig 13 that the differences in these two wave model simulations are predominantly due to differences in the wind profile the wind profile generated with the simple wind model features a slightly broader r gale fig 7 and creates more intense winds at the site the r gale and thus the fetch associated with it is a significant contributor to the waves intensity likely has a second order effect a second set of tests was undertaken to investigate the impact of the spatial resolution of the t20 grid the simple winds from synthetic tropical cyclones 499038 and 919526 were applied to both the t20 wave model and the stc model time series of h s and t p are shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the time series for h s are almost identical the differences in t p are the results of the open boundaries for t20 i e wave spectra are not prescribed at the boundary the t p values of approximately 15 s in stc are associated with southern ocean swell propagating onto the shelf the high resolution nested grid around scott and seringapatam reefs does not influence the results shown in fig 14 because synthetic tropical cyclones 499038 and 919526 approach from the west and west north west respectively 5 discussion for the purposes of this section the t20 wave model forced with simple winds will be referred to as the simple wave model comparison of wind and wave models in section 4 showed that simple models are systematically biased high this high bias can be attributed to the slightly broader radius to gales r gale in the azimuthal wind profile which in turn increases fetch and thus maximum h s the cumulative density functions cdfs of maximum wind speed and maximum h s at nra calculated from the complex wind and wave models are shown in fig 15 solid lines right panels fig 15 is based on a set of 2 300 synthetic storms and shows density functions calculated from the corresponding simple wind models and simple wave models it can be seen that there is a small offset towards higher values in the distribution of the simple models in fig 15 this can also be seen in the results of section 4 2 2 where the simple models were found to produce higher values than their more complex versions see for example fig 13 the probability density function pdf of maximum wind speed fig 15 upper left panel from the complex wind model is skewed with a median value of 53 6 m s 1 and the standard deviation is 8 9 m s 1 the range from lowest to highest of those selected storms is 43 2 m s 1 it is emphasized that these statistics and figures do not represent the full dataset but only the 2 300 selected storms interpretation of these data must carefully account for that selection process small bias aside the shape of the distribution of the simple wind model follows that of the complex wind model closely for maximum h s the shape of the distributions of the selected storms is more symmetric than that of the wind speeds fig 15 left panels the mean value for maximum h s is 12 5 m the standard deviation is 1 4 m and the range is 10 1 m the pdfs in fig 15 lower left panel shows that the shape of the distribution for the simple wave model shaded area is narrower and features a peak at about 13 m that leads to small but subtle differences in the shape of the two distributions this is partially due to the higher wind speeds noted above and possibly also due to the fact a number of important sub grid scale features are missing in the simple model setup 6 summary and conclusions this work has compared alternative approaches to modelling wind and wave fields under realistic tropical cyclones conditions for a particular site of interest on the nws section 4 1 demonstrated that the simple wind model is statistically biased to some degree wind intensity v max compared well to the fully dynamic wind model however winds greater than radius to gales could benefit from an improved fit the difference between simple and complex wind models was found to be small compared to the difference in maximum h s between simple and complex wave models given the limitations noted in section 2 3 the use of a coarse resolution wave model t20 was investigated as an alternative to the parametric wave model this version of the wave model is designed to rapidly estimate a time series of integral wave parameters at any output location given a gridded wind field it does not include boundary conditions i e no wave energy is input at the boundaries of the domain although overestimated at the peak the growth and decay of h s is well captured throughout passage of the storm in addition to h s we demonstrated the skill of the t20 model for peak wave period t p and peak wave direction d p an advantage of the simple wave model t20 is the possibility of obtaining additional wave parameters e g mean wave period mean direction wave energy period etc for example to derive design criteria for floating marine structure or vessels each synthetic storm was modelled for a period of 7 days the computational costs associated with a synthetic storm are listed in table 5 the simple wind and wave models are cheap to run and took about 2 min wall time to complete on a single node i e 48 processors the fully dynamic models come at a significantly greater cost with the complex wave model being the most expensive model as a result of high spectral resolution nonetheless the simple models t20 provide a good first estimate when looking at the distributions of maximum wind speed and significant wave height in conclusion it is recommended that when rapid estimates of tropical cyclone wave parameters are required a coarse resolution dynamic wave model is strongly preferred over the use of a parametric wave model in the absence of any computing facilities to run even a simple wave model then the parametric wave model yb96 is arguably the best choice this should be used only within particular ranges of tropical cyclone parameters t p values should be used with caution and h s values should be used with the knowledge of the biases that have been demonstrated here funding this research was supported by woodside energy limited australia

20953,tropical cyclone tc wind and wave models are used to quantify meteorological and oceanographic conditions in the application of offshore engineering design criteria in regions such as the north west shelf of australia a statistically sound risk of failure design assessment can require historical records far longer than are typically available even with meteorological datasets of several decades length to address this mismatch between design requirements and observational history synthetic tropical cyclone wind and wave datasets can be developed to mimic long records with the objective of estimating extreme event average recurrence intervals of 10 000 years modelling large numbers of tc storms in practice requires a trade off between time computational efficiency and accuracy model skill the development of the synthetic dataset in this study draws the balance by combining computationally efficient parametric models and computationally intensive fully dynamic models with different model grid resolutions this paper outlines performance differences between the various model approaches and make recommendations for engineering keywords tropical cyclones wind model wave model 1 introduction the northwest shelf nws fig 1 of australia is an active industrial region characterised by capital intensive engineered structures and ongoing oil and gas operations offshore operations rely on accurate marine forecasts and tropical cyclones tcs are an especially significant consideration potential impacts include the need to shut down operations accidental release of hazardous materials or critical damage to infrastructure e g hasling 2016 kaiser 2008 cruz and krausmann 2008 in this context the bureau of meteorology have developed an operational ensemble prediction system for tc winds and waves zieger et al 2018 aijaz et al 2019 in addition to ongoing operational matters estimated tc conditions play an essential role in the engineering design processes for offshore structures ships and moorings designs are often limited by estimates of fatigue loading and the likelihood of extreme events these design constraints are commonly evaluated via average recurrence intervals ari for wind and wave conditions and the primary basis of such analyses is accurate historical meteorological and oceanographic observations historical records of tropical storms cover the past 30 50 years but may occasionally date back further a record of 30 50 years allows the estimation of an ari of a 1 in 100 150 year event caires and sterl 2005 vinoth and young 2011 the comparatively short time span associated with historical records can be overcome by synthesising events and applying numerical models as predictors to estimate say an ari of a 1 in 1 000 year event tropical cyclones are extreme events characterised by intense wind fields that vary rapidly in magnitude and direction in space and time the unique spatial compactness of the vortex structure has led to numerous parametric models for tropical cyclone surface wind fields e g hughes 1952 holland 1980 willoughby et al 2006 holland et al 2010 when considering the response of ocean surface waves to tropical cyclone winds the situation becomes increasingly complex for example it is still not clear which physical processes are dominant across the lifecycle of a tropical cyclone event this is particularly true for the momentum transferred from the winds to the waves and the role of drag coefficient at high wind speeds powell et al 2003 makin 2005 moon et al 2008 similar to parametric wind models there have been attempts to describe the surface wave field through parametric means by analysing a range of data sources including in situ buoy observations altimeter observations and numerical model data young 2017 the surface wave field associated with tropical cyclone winds is however relatively complex forward motion significantly modulates the spatial distribution of wind sea generation and the direction of generating winds young 2006 existing parametric wave models young 1988 young and burchell 1996 young and vinoth 2013 have demonstrated some skill in estimating the spatial distribution of integral wave parameters including significant wave height and peak wave period these models incorporate theoretical knowledge from fetch limited observations hasselmann et al 1973 and differ in size and source of the underlying storm observations the more interested reader is referred to young 2017 who provides a review of parametric models for tropical cyclone applications parametric wave models are computationally cheap to run compared to third generation wave models but their application is limited for example if directional properties of the wave field are required the purpose of this paper is to investigate the balance between computational efficiency and skill in the results from various parametric and dynamic modelling approaches applied to a large number of storms section 2 gives an overview of the wind and wave models and highlights common aspects and differences between models methods are outlined in section 3 our assessment of the parametric models versus the dynamic models is shown in section 4 this is followed by a discussion in section 5 and conclusion in section 6 2 models parametric tropical cyclone models aim to reproduce key features of spatial fields from a small number of parameters they generally do not represent the entire three dimensional structure but rather produce an environmental field at a single vertical level typical models are realised in storm centric coordinates and largely ignore any asymmetric effects historic storm track databases exist that collate analysed properties such as storm centre coordinates central pressure p c maximum wind speed v max radius to maximum winds r max and radius to gales r gale radius to 34 kt wind speed the australian best track database is a publicly available example and forms the basis of this study bureau of meteorology 2020a despite the complexity of tc dynamics the few track parameters available can sufficiently describe the gradient wind field and allow estimation of the maximum expected value in the associated wave field as will be demonstrated below based on the probability distribution of track parameters in the best track database a large synthetic tropical cyclone dataset was developed consisting of 665 711 storms over the nws region of australia the dataset is a set of storm tracks each varying in cyclone position intensity and structure at consecutive times spatially varying statistics were developed for tropical cyclone motion parameters to allow track density intensity and other parameters to vary spatially and seasonally in addition autocorrelation functions were used to incorporate memory or temporal correlation of track parameters statistics of cyclone formation life time and landfall have been developed using guidance from the historic track database the synthetic track database includes tracks with lengths as short as 2 days ranging up to about 20 days details of the synthetic track database can be found in bureau of meteorology 2020b 2 1 parametric wind model parametric radial wind profiles can be formulated in terms of either wind or pressure because wind has a more direct influence on the engineering impact this section will be framed in terms of wind the wind fields provided by parametric tropical cyclone models are intended to provide a statistically unbiased estimate of the mean wind at a particular location and time within the cyclone and omit the effects of turbulence and gustiness following the arguments of harper et al 2010 it is therefore meaningless to describe them as representing for example 1 min winds or 10 min winds as the expected value of the mean wind at a given point in space and time is simply the true statistical mean provided only that the averaging period is short enough to not be influenced by the movement or development of the cyclone scale circulation harper et al 2010 the holland profile h80 holland 1980 and the modified rankine vortex mrv hughes 1952 are two widely used wind profiles that can be completely specified by three tropical cyclone parameters v max r max and r gale the outer wind radius essentially defines the wind at all radii between r max and r gale in the case of h80 it modifies the wind structure inside of r max as well willoughby et al 2006 wdr recognises that inner wind radius r r max and outer wind radius r r max can change and thus introduced two new radial models that both require additional parameters these are subsequently referred to as the wdr single and double formulations the single wdr profiles has the following differences to the mrv i the decay of winds outside of r max is exponential rather than a power law and the length scale l 1 of that exponential decay is a parameter to the profile ii the flow inside r max is not necessarily in solid body rotation but given by a power law whose exponent n is a parameter to the profile typically 0 4 n 2 4 and iii smoothing is applied in the vicinity of r max so that the profile has several continuous radial derivatives the mrv has none the width lb of this smoothing band is a further parameter to the model the relevant equations are as follows inside of r max 1 v i n n e r r v m a x r r m a x n outside of r max 2 v o u t e r r v m a x e r m a x r l 1 the full wdr single profile is written as 3 v r 1 w r v i n n e r r w r v o u t e r r where w r is a weighting function that goes from 0 to 1 over a blending zone of width 2l b that includes r max and is 0 at radii inside of the blending zone and 1 outside of it the details of the weighting function are given by wdr recognising the need for additional variability in wind profiles wdr also introduced the double profile in which the outer structure is represented by the weighted sum of two exponentials rather than one 4 v o u t e r r 1 x v m a x e r m a x r l 1 x v m a x e r m a x r l 2 they thus introduce two additional parameters the length scale l 2 of the second exponential and the relative weight of the two exponentials x making five in total since fitting the sum of two exponentials to data is not well conditioned they recommend that the shorter of the two length scales l 2 be held constant at 25 km for practical applications fig 2 b shows several wdr profiles with the same v max r max and r gale showing that the degree of concavity of the profile between r max and r gale can vary using aircraft reconnaissance data in the north atlantic wdr found that roughly one third of observed storms fit better with their second profile than their first or in other words about one third of storms require a non zero value of x we illustrate the differences between the profiles in fig 2a which shows how the three profiles fit a reasonably intense cyclone with a horizontal scale typical of north western australia v max 40 m s 1 78 kt r max 25 km and r gale 150 km the selected vortex parameters are given in the legend fig 2a the wdr and h80 wind profiles are quite similar except for r 50 km where the h80 profile has a much broader maximum in contrast the mrv is dramatically different with much lower winds for r max r r gale and much greater outside of that the three profile shapes in fig 2a have some significantly different properties in the mrv the vorticity is always positive while h80 and the single wdr profiles usually have an annulus of negative vorticity well outside of the r max poor choices of parameters can result in the amplitude of this annulus becoming so large that the vortex is inertially unstable and hence physically implausible this constraint is the source of the well known requirement that shape parameter b 2 5 in h80 in the h80 profile the eye expands and the pressure drop increases near r max as b increases from zero for the mrv model total circulation around a circle of radius r becomes infinite in the limit as r approaches infinity in contrast this quantity is bounded in h80 and wdr when deriving pressure fields by radial integration of the gradient wind equation the integral to infinite radius is bounded in h80 and wdr but not in mrv we have elected to use the wdr profiles in this study primarily because it was developed using a large database of aircraft observations in tropical cyclones and avoids the major known limitations of other parametric profiles a challenge with this profile is dealing with the relatively large number of vortex parameters based on position intensity v max inner core size r max and outer core size r gale from the best track database an objective methodology was developed to fit wdr parameters that define a gradient level vortex in the wind field details and verification of this methodology are described in a companion manuscript bureau of meteorology 2020b 2 2 simple and complex wind models the parametric profile described in the previous section provides an axisymmetric wind field at the top of the boundary layer this study employs two alternative methods to derive the required surface winds denoted as the simple and complex wind models both introduce asymmetry into the wind fields the simple model is like the dynamical model in that it first constructs a gradient level wdr profile which is adjusted to provide surface wind fields while the complex model does this adjustment through iterating the hydrodynamical equations of motion to near equilibrium the simple model performs the adjustment statistically the simple wind model assumes that the surface wind speed can be modelled as 5 v 10 r θ s r v g r r u t c w f θ where v 10 r θ is the magnitude of the surface wind vector s r is a radius dependent surface wind reduction factor v g r r is the gradient level wind profile u t c is the magnitude of the cyclone motion vector w is the ratio of the wind asymmetry to the cyclone motion f is a sinusoidal function of storm relative azimuth that ranges between 1 and 1 with maximum in the left forward quadrant consistent with observations and the dynamical wind model described next r is radius and θ is the azimuth relative to storm motion note that the wind asymmetry is approximately proportional to the storm motion speed for the complex wind model the asymmetric wind at the bottom of the boundary layer is calculated by applying a fully dynamic three dimensional model the kepert wang model kw kepert and wang 2001 kepert 2012 to the wdr profiles described in the preceding section the complex wind model diagnoses the boundary layer flow by solving the dry equations of motion beneath a prescribed pressure field the solution is found by integrating the equations forward in time until a quasi steady state is achieved which generally occurs after 24 simulation hours however in order to speed up the convergence to steady state of the complex wind model the model was initialised from the solution to the linear model kepert 2001 saving half the computational cost without material effect on the results the complex model set up consists of 20 vertical levels with the lowest at 10 m and the top at 2 25 km resolution is highest near the surface a translating coordinate system is used in which the lower boundary is shifted so that the parameterized tropical cyclone is stationary in the model domain the horizontal grid spacing is 3 km the horizontal model extent is 1200 1200 km larger than in many previous studies using this model according to the best track database the 99th percentile of the r gale for storms west of 130 e is 400 km this domain is therefore sufficient to contain the gale force winds of almost all storms while also leaving an ample allowance for blending of the sub gale winds into the environment the model is run for 12 simulated hours by which time all fields have attained a nearly steady state each model run represents a single instantaneous time when the tropical cyclone centre is at a specific location as it moves along its track the model is run multiple times to simulate the tropical cyclone vortex at 3 h intervals during the passage of the cyclone and the fields are then interpolated to 30 min intervals in storm relative coordinates the surface wind fields are extracted from the three dimensional model outputs and blended into matching era interim dee et al 2011 background fields the blending procedure uses a fifth order polynomial blending function in which the blending radius is dynamically calculated from the azimuthal mean of wind speed zieger et al 2021 time interpolation in storm centric coordinates avoids elongation artefacts due to storm motion a maximum storm duration of 7 days was modelled with the times and locations of the vortex centre of simulation defined such that the tropical cyclone vortex was generated 4 days before and 3 days after it passed the specific target site nra fig 1 when analysing historical events the dates of the event are known therefore existing analysis or reanalysis of atmospheric and wave boundary conditions can be used for synthetic events in order to select appropriate environmental fields for blending it is necessary to identify an analogue historical event whose time sequence of atmospheric and wave boundary conditions can be applied to the synthetic event these time sequences need to be approximately one week long thus we need to match one week synthetic track sections against the best track database this matching was based on a measure of distance between tracks i e nearest neighbour 2 3 parametric wave model as discussed in section 2 1 parametric radial profiles provide a method through which tropical cyclone wind fields can be reproduced from a small number of parameters in a similar fashion it is possible to derive a parametric tropical cyclone wave field in the context of this study three parametric wave models have been evaluated young 2017 y88 young 1988 yb96 young and burchell 1996 and y13 young and vinoth 2013 all three models use the concept of an equivalent fetch f to estimate the parametric wave field equivalent fetch can be parameterised using effective radius r 6 r 22 5 10 3 l o g 10 r m a x 70 8 10 3 7 f r a b 1 v m a x 2 b 2 v m a x v f m b 3 v f m 2 b 4 v m a x b 5 v f m b 6 parameters b 1 b 6 are fitting coefficients and a is a scaling parameter the relationships above were determined empirically from maximum wind speed v max 20 60 m s 1 and forward speed v fm 0 0 12 5 m s 1 the three parametric models are fits to different sets of observations the coefficients for each model are listed in table 1 and fig 3 shows contour lines of f r the solid blue boxes in fig 3 indicate the range for which the empirical model has been developed values outside this box have been extrapolated and should therefore be treated with caution it should be noted that the synthetic tropical cyclone database contains tcs outside these parameter ranges knowing the values of the fetch f one can use the fetch limited wave growth relationship jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 to determine maximum significant wave height h s max and the maximum wave peak period t p max in the wave field g refers to the gravitational constant 8 g h s m a x v m a x 2 0 0016 g f v m a x 2 0 50 9 g t p m a x 2 π v m a x 0 045 g f v m a x 2 0 33 for a pre defined choice of values of v max and v fm spatial distribution diagrams are pre computed for the wave field once the spatial distribution of h s max and t p max have been determined these diagrams can be used to map out the entire distribution around the centre of the tropical cyclone the spatial distribution diagrams have been non dimensionalised by the effective radius r the effective radius as a function of r max is shown in fig 4 the extent of the spatial distribution diagrams is limited to about 12r there are a number of significant limitations in the use of a parametric wave models firstly the model is limited in terms of the spatial extent of the domain as noted above secondly it can only estimate the two integral parameters h s and t p a third limitation is that the parametric wave models examined here have been derived for a limited range of tropical cyclone parameters specifically v fm and v max and caution should be used outside these ranges fig 3 solid blue lines fourthly the wave field distributions were estimated with a relatively primitive second generation wave model which omits the non linear interaction term finally the pre computed spatial distributions are based on a static wind profile with a fixed r max and assume no bottom topography i e deep water an illustrative example is shown in fig 6 2 4 dynamic wave models the dynamic gridded wave model used is based on wavewatch iii ww3 version 6 07 the wavewatch dev group 2019 ww3 is a widely used operational and research wave modelling framework which is able to simulate waves in extreme conditions liu et al 2017 the full implementation of ww3 for synthetic tropical cyclone waves is hereafter referred to as stc and is replicated from zieger et al 2021 the domain spans 25 s 8 s and 100 e 135 e see fig 1 and is a multiple resolution grid that consists of one 5 km 0 05 resolution grid for the north west shelf and two dedicated 1 km 0 01 grids around the complex features of rowley shoals row and scott and seringapatam reefs ssr in addition a computationally cheaper implementation with a spatial resolution of 0 20 was created this is referred to t20 hereafter details of the wave model grid configurations are listed in table 2 and table 3 itemizes differences between simple and complex wave models accurate bathymetry is a fundamental but non trivial requirement for the dynamic wave model alternative datasets were assessed against field data provided by our industry partner woodside pty ltd with gebco weatherall et al 2015 selected as the broad area base bathymetry our assessment identified two areas specifically row and ssr away from the coastline characterised by poor accuracy in all bathymetry datasets to address this deficiency we digitized depths from admiralty charts and merged them with field data from our industry partner for the high resolution 1 km grids the bottom friction source term in ww3 bt4 includes a roughness parameterisation that allows formation of ripples on sandy bottoms with medium sediment size d50 0 2 mm this value of d50 was used for all areas with the exception of reefs within the 1 km resolution grids of stc where it was increased to d50 2 0 mm see table 2 in order to select between viable source term configurations with the stc model we trialled several configurations under the high quality hindcast wind fields described in section 2 2 with wave boundary conditions obtained from a global model see next paragraph the results were assessed against wave observations from 17 storms in the nws region zieger et al 2021 all of the alterative wave model configurations showed similar results with an overall mean absolute error in peak h s mostly less than 0 90 m configuration test471f showed an overall mean absolute error in peak h s of 0 87 m and was selected for all wave model configurations of the present study see table 2 wave boundary conditions bcs are required to represent remotely generated swell in the simulations for the synthetic storms in the present work and the stc model these bcs were obtained from a lower resolution 0 40 global wave simulation surface winds for this global model were obtained from the ncep climate forecast system version 2 cfs2 saha et al 2014 directional wave spectra were saved along the boundaries of the domain at 3 hourly intervals and a spatial resolution of 0 40 for 5 years during the southern hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons 2013 14 through to 2017 18 these five years of tropical cyclone season also provided initial conditions ics for the wave model within the domain at 2 day intervals to map synthetic time to wave model time the year of the start date of the simulation was replaced with a year ranging from 2013 to 2018 once an appropriate year was assigned initial conditions and boundary conditions were automatically selected from pre computed databases based on the start day month and year the initial day of the synthetic storm was rounded to midnight of the next closest day of a restart file the seasons were cycled through sequentially as the surface winds from each synthetic tc were blended with era interim background fields rather than those from cfs2 minor inconsistencies may be expected at the beginning of each event such inconsistencies may impact both initial wind fields and the wave ics and bcs however a comparison of cfs2 winds and era interim winds found that the spatial distribution of the two datasets is very similar and the mean wind speeds are within 0 5 m s 1 over most of the southern ocean see fig 5 it is therefore reasonable to assume that the use of different atmospheric hindcast sources had minimal impact on the development of the bcs and ics the computationally cheap model t20 uses open bcs and jonswap fetch limited ics hasselmann et al 1973 komen et al 1994 3 method as noted in the introduction modelling of the winds and waves of such a large number of storms comes at a computational cost however the aim of long return period risk assessment requires the tails of the distribution to be resolved as well as is practicable it is therefore desirable to perform detailed wind and wave modelling predominantly for high impact storms accordingly storm selection processes were developed and applied at a specific target site north rankin see fig 1 to ensure that the detailed modelling was done so far as was practically possible on the most extreme cases that is storms within the upper tail of the wind and or wave distributions direct comparisons of the parametric wave models are based on two different subsets of the full synthetic storm database the differences between the subsets were important for the purpose of estimating the return period risk or ari as was undertaken in a separate piece of work but this is not part of the present study and is irrelevant for the purpose of wave model intercomparison for all 665 711 storms in the synthetic database an initial estimate of winds and wave parameters at the target site was calculated with the simple wind model and the yb96 parametric wave model a subset of storms which produced the highest waves at that site was then produced these selected storms were subsequently modelled with the complex wind model and the dynamic wave models the synthetic tropical cyclone parameters were applied to prescribe wdr wind profiles at the upper boundary to compute the gradient level winds at 10 m surface height in both the simple and complex wind models section 2 2 these wind fields were subsequently applied to force the alternative wave model configurations differences between the various models will be analysed in the following way simple wind model vs complex wind model parametric wave model from track parameters vs stc wave model forced with complex winds t20 wave model forced with simple winds vs stc wave model forced with simple winds t20 wave model forced with simple winds vs stc wave model forced with complex winds our assumption throughout is that the stc wave model forced with the complex winds represents the most physically realistic depiction of the wave fields and that comparisons will illuminate the degradation incurred by each of the cheaper modelling approaches this assumption is based on the stc model having the most complete physics and highest model resolution furthermore verification of 17 tc hindcasts has demonstrated the high quality of this model zieger et al 2021 4 results 4 1 wind model intercomparison we compare the simple and dynamical wind models for two intense synthetic storms at one point in time these two examples are representative and all storms show similar features as the storm intensifies intense storms with small radius to gales can be well described by the simple wind model those less intense storms with larger radius to gales show systematic biases between radius to maximum winds and radius to gales the first such storm was synthetic tc 0499038 see fig 7 the azimuthal mean structure shows two particular features good agreement in intensity v max but a substantially increased r gale for the simple wind model the winds from the simple model are up to 4 m s 1 too strong directly ahead of the storm similar plots for the generally faster moving synthetic tc 0919526 are shown in fig 8 the agreement between radius to maximum winds and radius to gales has improved however there is a systematic high bias in the simple wind model across that range since the simple wind model is statistically based it is natural to ask whether these systematic biases can be removed the high bias between r max and r gale appears to be due to the linear interpolation of the surface wind factor between these radii it is likely that a more complex model could alleviate this issue for instance one could also calculate statistical models for radius dependent wind reduction factor s r in equation 5 at the intermediate radii r storm and r hurr and use a higher order interpolation it is clear from the plots that the simple wind model works well at the radii where s is presently modelled and so it is reasonable to expect that applying similar models at other radii would improve the present interpolation the second systematic issue is the front back wind speed bias with the simple wind model tending to have its maximum winds too close to the front of the storm this is a problem not just in the inner core but also at larger radii where the dynamical model tends to have the strongest winds at a given radius on the left but slightly to the rear rather than in the left forward quadrant it appears that the function f θ should be a function of r as well and that there may also be benefit in making the azimuth of maximum winds depend also on other storm parameters as was done with s and w 4 2 wave model intercomparison the various wave model configurations sections 2 3 2 4 are compared using two different subsets of the full synthetic storm database direct comparisons of the parametric wave models are based on a selection of 1 000 storms covering the tail and body of the storm distribution later the discussion of maximum wind speed and h s values obtained from the simple and complex models is based on the 2 300 storm subset the differences between the versions are not important for the purpose of wave model intercomparison both datasets are for the same target site nra 4 2 1 parametric comparisons of h s from the three versions of the parametric wave model y88 yb96 and yv13 and the stc wave model are shown in fig 9 the comparisons are for maximum h s within a 25 grid point region around the centre of the storm the yv13 and y88 models overestimate maximum h s for intense storms with a systematic positive bias out of the three models compared the yb96 version in fig 9 and table 4 appears to be the most skilful i e rmse 3 50 m bias 1 91 m scatter index 0 42 the two peaks in the distributions reflect the fact that these 1 000 storms include tail storms and body storms note that these figures are actually the best comparisons possible as they consider the maximum h s value within the region around the tc wherever it occurs in that region spatial interpolation to the exact coordinates of the point of interest will further increase the scatter and reduce the skill of all the parametric wave models a point to point comparison using the most skilful parametric model yb96 and interpolating to the site of interest is shown in fig 10 the scatter in fig 10 is increased compared to fig 9 the increase in scatter can be attributed to the issues relating to the pre computed spatial distribution diagrams for the wave field young 1988 limitations of these fields have been discussed in section 2 3 last paragraph scatter plots for peak wave period were also produced for the parametric wave model yb96 with even poorer performance in particular the correlation coefficient ρ is less than 0 3 as shown in table 4 and fig 11 4 2 2 coarse resolution in this section integrated wave parameters from the coarse resolution wave model t20 are compared to those from stc model for point to point comparisons at nra for an initial set of 1 000 storms wind forcing for the coarse resolution model is obtained from the simple wind model the stc model is forced by the complex wind model the results shown in fig 12 are significantly improved over those of the parametric wave models figs 10 and 11 the remaining scatter between models stc and t20 can be attributed to differences in wind profiles e g figs 7 and 8 initial and boundary conditions and spectral and spatial resolution to investigate more closely the skill of the t20 model configuration two intense synthetic tropical cyclones 499038 and 919526 were examined in more detail differences in wind profiles for these storms have been plotted in figs 7 and 8 fig 13 shows time histories of wind speed h s and t p for the two tropical cyclones and indicates that a maximum h s of 16 4 m was simulated for both storms with the stc model which is 1 4 m and 2 2 m lower than the estimate with t20 and simple winds modelled values obtained from the simple models are broader and more intense around the peak for both wind speed and h s it is clear from fig 13 that the differences in these two wave model simulations are predominantly due to differences in the wind profile the wind profile generated with the simple wind model features a slightly broader r gale fig 7 and creates more intense winds at the site the r gale and thus the fetch associated with it is a significant contributor to the waves intensity likely has a second order effect a second set of tests was undertaken to investigate the impact of the spatial resolution of the t20 grid the simple winds from synthetic tropical cyclones 499038 and 919526 were applied to both the t20 wave model and the stc model time series of h s and t p are shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the time series for h s are almost identical the differences in t p are the results of the open boundaries for t20 i e wave spectra are not prescribed at the boundary the t p values of approximately 15 s in stc are associated with southern ocean swell propagating onto the shelf the high resolution nested grid around scott and seringapatam reefs does not influence the results shown in fig 14 because synthetic tropical cyclones 499038 and 919526 approach from the west and west north west respectively 5 discussion for the purposes of this section the t20 wave model forced with simple winds will be referred to as the simple wave model comparison of wind and wave models in section 4 showed that simple models are systematically biased high this high bias can be attributed to the slightly broader radius to gales r gale in the azimuthal wind profile which in turn increases fetch and thus maximum h s the cumulative density functions cdfs of maximum wind speed and maximum h s at nra calculated from the complex wind and wave models are shown in fig 15 solid lines right panels fig 15 is based on a set of 2 300 synthetic storms and shows density functions calculated from the corresponding simple wind models and simple wave models it can be seen that there is a small offset towards higher values in the distribution of the simple models in fig 15 this can also be seen in the results of section 4 2 2 where the simple models were found to produce higher values than their more complex versions see for example fig 13 the probability density function pdf of maximum wind speed fig 15 upper left panel from the complex wind model is skewed with a median value of 53 6 m s 1 and the standard deviation is 8 9 m s 1 the range from lowest to highest of those selected storms is 43 2 m s 1 it is emphasized that these statistics and figures do not represent the full dataset but only the 2 300 selected storms interpretation of these data must carefully account for that selection process small bias aside the shape of the distribution of the simple wind model follows that of the complex wind model closely for maximum h s the shape of the distributions of the selected storms is more symmetric than that of the wind speeds fig 15 left panels the mean value for maximum h s is 12 5 m the standard deviation is 1 4 m and the range is 10 1 m the pdfs in fig 15 lower left panel shows that the shape of the distribution for the simple wave model shaded area is narrower and features a peak at about 13 m that leads to small but subtle differences in the shape of the two distributions this is partially due to the higher wind speeds noted above and possibly also due to the fact a number of important sub grid scale features are missing in the simple model setup 6 summary and conclusions this work has compared alternative approaches to modelling wind and wave fields under realistic tropical cyclones conditions for a particular site of interest on the nws section 4 1 demonstrated that the simple wind model is statistically biased to some degree wind intensity v max compared well to the fully dynamic wind model however winds greater than radius to gales could benefit from an improved fit the difference between simple and complex wind models was found to be small compared to the difference in maximum h s between simple and complex wave models given the limitations noted in section 2 3 the use of a coarse resolution wave model t20 was investigated as an alternative to the parametric wave model this version of the wave model is designed to rapidly estimate a time series of integral wave parameters at any output location given a gridded wind field it does not include boundary conditions i e no wave energy is input at the boundaries of the domain although overestimated at the peak the growth and decay of h s is well captured throughout passage of the storm in addition to h s we demonstrated the skill of the t20 model for peak wave period t p and peak wave direction d p an advantage of the simple wave model t20 is the possibility of obtaining additional wave parameters e g mean wave period mean direction wave energy period etc for example to derive design criteria for floating marine structure or vessels each synthetic storm was modelled for a period of 7 days the computational costs associated with a synthetic storm are listed in table 5 the simple wind and wave models are cheap to run and took about 2 min wall time to complete on a single node i e 48 processors the fully dynamic models come at a significantly greater cost with the complex wave model being the most expensive model as a result of high spectral resolution nonetheless the simple models t20 provide a good first estimate when looking at the distributions of maximum wind speed and significant wave height in conclusion it is recommended that when rapid estimates of tropical cyclone wave parameters are required a coarse resolution dynamic wave model is strongly preferred over the use of a parametric wave model in the absence of any computing facilities to run even a simple wave model then the parametric wave model yb96 is arguably the best choice this should be used only within particular ranges of tropical cyclone parameters t p values should be used with caution and h s values should be used with the knowledge of the biases that have been demonstrated here funding this research was supported by woodside energy limited australia

20954,in the past mooring chain failure probabilities have been much higher than the design failure probabilities the high failure rates are attributed to prolonged exposure to various degradation mechanisms in harsh offshore conditions in addition to understanding failure mechanisms researchers have stressed on reducing the risk of failures through regular and reliable inspections current inspection techniques involve both in air and in water inspections however current in air inspections are time consuming and expensive while in water inspection techniques are not yet reliable the present paper proposes a condition monitoring and strength estimation methodology based on three dimensional 3d scans of links the study first identifies and estimates changes in simple geometrical features of chain links using finite element fe modeling for condition monitoring the methodology has two stages 3d general imaging 3d gi to identify degraded chain links using feature monitoring followed by 3d detailed imaging 3d di of the identified weak links the weak links 3d point clouds could be further converted to solid fe models for residual strength estimation by employing a suitable material degradation model the geometrical feature monitoring methodology is verified by 3d scans of an undeformed and a deformed studded link keywords mooring chain mooring integrity condition monitoring 3d inspections finite element analysis strength estimation 1 introduction the mooring chain is a safety critical component which controls the offset of offshore floating vessels its ability to work in extreme environments direct handling by the winches superior performance in the splash and thrash zones and long application experience makes it a popular choice for station keeping however prolonged exposure to large wave current and wind forces during storms and hurricanes in its design life 10 30 years leads to continuous deterioration that increases the likelihood of single or multiple line failures the recorded events of mooring chain replacements failures and complete breakaways have been summarized by various researchers in the past d souza et al 2013 ma et al 2013 maslin 2013 smedley and petruska 2014 in addition the single and multiple line failure probabilities are observed to be about a hundred times more than the design failure probabilities in general offshore floating facilities are designed to withstand single line failures however line failures can lead to substantial economic losses in terms of replacements costs and production losses brown et al 2005 moreover if undetected increased forces on other lines may lead to multiple line failure causing extended shutdowns riser damage hydrocarbon release and even loss of station in extreme cases in addition to high failure rates previous investigations identified wear and corrosion in links as major discard criteria the studies conducted by fontaine et al 2012 2014 in scorch jip showed much higher wear and corrosion rates than those specified in the api rp 2sk 2005 and dnv os e301 2010 consequently frequent inspections are vital for reliable condition assessment early damage detection and timely replacement to ensure safe working conditions allan et al 2013 brown et al 2005 2010 the current inspection methodologies can be categorized into in air outside water and in water in situ inspections the in air inspection requires retrieval of chains to the deck of inspection vessel to enable geometrical inter grip and visible crack measurements in addition several non destructive testing ndt procedures such as magnetic particle inspection mpi radiographic and guided ultrasonic wave guw tests can be carried out thus making the inspection reliable angulo et al 2017 the methodology is suitable for mobile offshore drilling units modus which recover mooring lines and anchors on a regular basis in permanent floating production units fpus in air inspections though reliable are not desirable due to temporary operational shutdown causing production losses or hiring of anchor handling and temporary heading control tugs can lead to economic losses therefore vessel owners and operators are more inclined towards employing in water inspections which are carried out using tethered remotely operated vehicles rovs the use of rovs allows unhindered daily operations in the facility thus increasing the economic viability and enhancing asset integrity the in water inspection process includes general visual inspection gvi and close visual inspection cvi using rovs gvi ensures overall integrity and identifies any gross anomaly or damage followed by cvi for closer inspection of anomalies additionally cvi is followed by chain measurements using rov mounted mechanical or optical calipers for corrosion and wear rate estimations allan et al 2013 however the cvi and chain measurements are not completely reliable and any suspected anomalies can only be confidently ascertained and further investigated by taking the chain out of water the deficiency of in water methodologies to reliably ascertain the anomalies other than those visually identifiable has led to extensive research in the field allan et al 2013 introduced novel 3d vision capabilities of welaptega marine ltd edwards et al 2014 and ruiz et al 2014 worked on developing the chain climbing robot moorinspect for in water ndt inspection of chain links using guided ultrasonic waves guws yang et al 2018 proposed thermographic technique for in situ monitoring of cracks and defects in the mooring chain links fontaine et al 2012 used 3d photogrammetry for finite element fe model creation of corroded links recovered from west africa rosen et al 2015 and crapps et al 2017 used 3d laser scans for inspection and analysis of the degraded chain links rosen et al 2015 in scorch jip also established the use of 3d scans to determine the distribution of corrosion pits in chain links recovered after service in recent years researchers through significant effort have made in water inspections more reliable however apart from obvious pitting corrosion and cracks which are directly visible identification of other anomalies causing subtle changes in chain links such as interlink wear overloading torsion strength degradation etc remains a critical issue the practice of diameter and length measurements using mechanical and optical calipers requires frequent calibrations and is time consuming moreover the measurements are restricted to validate that the wear and corrosion rates are within limits in addition the measurement at the interlink region where the plastic deformations wear diameter changes etc are concentrated is difficult through rov mounted calipers the confidence provided by previous research in 3d photogrammetry and laser scanning are the basis for the present study this study identifies a methodology which utilizes quality 3d inspection data for feature recognition and estimation to identify degraded chain links the study also proposes a reliable strength estimation technique for rational discard criteria of the identified weak links this study proposes a two stage inspection process a 3d general imaging 3d gi which includes fast full length scanning of mooring chain capturing link outer surface for wear rate estimations deformation and overloading assessments identifying links with visible corrosion and fatigue cracks and b 3d detailed imaging 3d di of identified weak links links with pitting corrosion severe wear deformed links overloaded links etc for condition assessment and rational discard criteria fig 1 shows the methodology for 3d inspections weak link identification and strength estimation 2 review of in water inspection practices and discard criteria brown et al 2010 2005 and mooring integrity guidance oil gas uk 2008 provide specific mooring inspection guidance for permanent mooring installations the mooring chains are inspected at two instances a before supply as manufacturer s quality control and b in service for safety and maintenance chains before supply undergo strength tests and ndts to ascertain that the minimum break load mbl are above the required value and ensure that the chain links do not have any manufacturing defects or cracks reliable in service inspections conducted for condition assessment early fault detection and repair enhance the overall mooring integrity api rp 2i and bv mooring classification code rule note nr 493 2015 provide useful inspection guidance and retirement criteria the bv mooring classification code classifies the in service surveys as annual intermediate and class renewal survey the in service surveys at various intervals enable operators to evaluate the deterioration mechanisms at work and areas of action the in water visual inspection systems have no depth limitation and are extensively used wherever diver inspections are not suitable fig 2 shows the gvi for overall condition monitoring and cvi for closer observation for anomalies in identified links the mooring chains are generally allowed a degree of corrosion or wear by virtue of being deployed in harsh environmental conditions the cvi is usually followed by chain measurements using mechanical and optical calipers to estimate and ascertain that the wear and corrosion rates are within the design values as shown in fig 3 however the under water measurement methodology has major shortcomings mechanical calipers require frequent calibration and optical calipers must have a pre assigned orientation for accurate measurements the measurements using rov mounted calipers a are time consuming b cannot provide measurements in the interlink contact regions to identify subtle changes in link geometry c are inadequate for modelling uniform or pitting corrosion and e are unable to provide assessments of link damage severity despite the major shortcomings of in water measurements it is still used for fitness checks of chain links which require reliable data and its interpretation bv mooring classification code rule note nr 493 2015 defines interlink distance measurement and provides discard criteria entirely based on dimension measurements at critical locations past research publications showed that severe reduction in cross sectional area or material loss at certain locations may or may not severely affect the strength of the chain links brown et al 2010 fontaine et al 2012 2014 therefore reliance placed only on the dimensional measurements may not be effective hence there is a need for more reliable strength based assessment criteria in addition to the present dimensional discard criteria the present study aims to improve the overall under water link measurement methodology through reliable data and its interpretation for identification of damaged links this study combines sub sea 3d imaging non contact optical scanning methods and link geometry monitoring for degraded link identification during in water inspections accurate chain dimensional measurements from 3d imaging data is useful in estimating corrosion and interlink wear identifying overloaded link measuring twist angle in chains under torsion or identifying excessive uniform or pitting corrosion the study also proposes to assess static strength in addition to dimensional measurements for more appropriate and reliable discard criteria for chain strength estimation 3d imaging data can be converted to 3d fe models and analyzed in conjunction with continuum damage mechanics for static strength estimate of the degraded links 3 proposed in water inspection using 3d imaging the length of mooring chain in floating facilities can span multiple kilometers with over 10 000 chain links which necessitates detailed 3d imaging of all links to be significantly tedious and time consuming therefore categorization of degradation is necessary to speed up the inspection process the present study categorizes degradation in links into i type 1 degradation which are easily visible severe corrosion or pitting corrosion severe abrasive wear loss of stud major fatigue cracks etc ii type 2 degradation which can be estimated or measured using 3d point cloud involving interlink wear corrosion angle of rotation due to torsion in multi component mooring lines and deformations due to overloading iii type 3 degradation which cannot be observed using point cloud data minor fatigue cracks and damage for example due to out of plane bending fatigue the degradation identified as type 3 cannot be ascertained using 3d imaging data and will require other techniques such as underwater guided ultrasonic waves or thermal inspections this study focuses on type 1 and type 2 degradations links with type 1 degradation can be directly considered for strength estimation links with type 2 degradation may not be obvious while identifying degraded links in the entire mooring line is essential for reliable inspection therefore this study utilizes deformations or geometrical changes in chain links to identify the degraded links past studies do not provide the change or extent of change in geometry of studless or studded chain links with increasing or repeated load application in addition the deformations and associated identifiable features and overall behavior will be different for studless and studded chain links due to difference in structural arrangement and geometry therefore geometrical features which undergo change in both studless and studded link need to be identified and quantified these links will be considered for strength estimation on the basis of deformation severity and associated change in geometrical feature 4 fe study to identify geometrical feature and estimate change the present fe study is used to identify features associated with overloading wear and torsion loading the study does not consider the out of plane bending opb phenomenon because it occurs inside the turret of a floating production vessel while it is absent when the links are outside the turret and are free to rotate the fe analysis utilizes fe models and elastic plastic material properties presented by sachan and choo 2020 4 1 fe model the fe studies are conducted on 76 mm studded and studless chain link of r3 grade steel non linear fe analysis of chain link employs an assembly of two 1 4th links as shown in fig 4 for studded link fe model the bottom link is fixed in y direction and is allowed to translate in all other directions load is applied by providing vertical displacement to the top link the model utilizes symmetry boundary conditions in the xy and yz planes the model employs c3d20r and c3d8r finite elements 20 node and 8 node brick elements in abaqus with reduced integration in the bottom and top link respectively the fe analysis utilizes elastic plastic material definition with hardening using stress strain data from coupon wsl 2 fig 5 shows the material strength tests and stress strain relationship summarized by sachan and choo 2020 4 2 geometrical features and changes due to loading a feature can be something associated with the chain link geometry which may be monitored for change or extracted for meaningful information this section identifies length width interlink distance crown straight leg curvature overall shape and link rotation as major observable features in which monitoring associated change can help to identify a degraded link fig 6 shows the incremental change in the studless and studded link geometry with increasing in line load it is evident from fig 6 that for in line axial loading inelastic behavior is mainly concentrated in the interlink contact regions and crown area the best differentiating feature between studded and studless chain link is that the straight legs in the studded chain link remains straight due to the presence of stud different features and change estimates using fe analysis are length change length of an undeformed studded and studless link is 6d where d is the nominal diameter of the link bar the elongation or length change depends on the maximum load the link has been subjected to while in service fig 7 a shows the load as mbl vs ratio of elongated link length to initial length for both studded and studless links the load is normalized using minimum breaking load of 76 mm diameter studded and studless chain links in studded link length change is primarily due to post yield plastic material flow in the contact and crown regions on the other hand in studless links inward movement of straight legs further increases the total deformation thus explaining higher deformations as compared to studded links at similar load levels maximum overall length change is around 10 11 for both types of links which is sufficient for comparing a deformed and an undeformed link point clouds width change in studded links presence of stud at mid height of the straight leg restricts the collapse of legs hence change in width is approximately zero which renders measuring width futile for condition monitoring conversely link width proves to be an important feature in studless chain overload monitoring the initial width for 76 mm studless chain link is 256 mm code specification 3 35d 3 4d and total reduction in width at mbl is 43 mm which is around 17 18 indicating larger sensitivity to loading than length change fig 7 b shows the relationship between applied load and ratio of width to initial width interlink distance interlink distance is a suitable indicator of cross section reduction due to interlink wear in chain links the measurements of diameter in the direction of loading d 1 and perpendicular direction d 2 represents the state of loading and wear in the interlink region the study ignores wear and only considers the interlink distance variation from increasing axial loads fig 8 shows the reduction in interlink distance in mm for the studless and studded link with increasing load in operational conditions the interlink distance will be a combination of in line load and inter link wear the overall reduction in interlink distance is in the range of 8 9 for studded link and 11 12 for studless link curvature change the local curvature varies in the crown region upon load application in both studded and studless chain links change in curvature radius at crown and straight legs for studless links only is obtained by extracting the points along the outline and fitting a circle to those points curvature change in the crown region is one of the useful features which undergoes substantial change in both the links for the crown region relative change is in the range of 20 25 as illustrated in fig 9 a for both link types initial curvature change in studded link is small because of the presence of stud followed by rapid change after plastic yielding as the load approaches mbl relative curvature change is larger for the studded link fig 9 b shows the relative change in curvature in straight leg of studless link the initial curvature value is very large 30756 at 8 mbl and approaches to a relatively smaller value 1152 at around 98 mbl the straight leg curvature is highly sensitive to loading and the relative curvature is 90 at 50 of mbl overall shape and cross sectional change monitoring overall shape and comparing with the preliminary inspection of standard link can also provide reliable information the overall shape of the chain links for both studless and studded chain link is the most easily observable feature refer to fig 6 the deformations above the inflection points near the bend region could be easily correlated with the loading for both studded and studless links moreover the collapse of straight leg in the studless link is also a notable feature the cross section perpendicular to the link plane can be compared for deformations or cross sectional reduction in the contact regions as shown in fig 10 angle between two link torsion in multi component mooring lines leads to inter link rotation in the mooring chain the angle of rotation due to torsion in the mooring line can be estimated by monitoring two adjacent links as illustrated in fig 11 the inter link angles measured using relative rotation of adjacent chain link provide useful estimate of torque in the mooring lines the present study does not include torsional angle measurements due to lack of data however the twist angles measured during inspection can be correlated with the torque and residual strength of chain links table 1 summarizes the features and total change in the monitored features at maximum load 5 non contact 3d optical scanning for inspection and strength estimation 2d imaging is insignificant in providing accurate damage assessment the measurements using rov mounted calipers can only be provided at any one point in time and thus time consuming conversely the 3d optical method provides spatial coordinates which represent the geometry of an object in the form of 3d point cloud these spatial points on the surface of the body can be used to measure dimensions or monitor any change in geometry therefore in water 3d inspection data of chain links could be compared with the undeformed chain geometry or installation survey 3d data for meaningful observations fig 12 shows the 3d point cloud data of a failed and a deformed chain link 3d scanning methodology has several advantages over 2d imaging i it is fast and can capture more than 200 frames per second fps which makes it suitable for real time scanning applications ii the 3d point cloud data does not require scaling and it thus enables direct and accurate dimensional measurements accuracy of measurement is further enhanced by the time of flight measurement of light pulses using a precision timer which is generally accurate to 0 1 mm or less for normal hand held devices iii ambient light is not required for 3d scanning since the device works on laser or white light pulse based data acquisition which is sufficient to capture the intricate features of an object figs 13 a and 14 a shows an undeformed and a deformed link respectively which are used to generate quality 3d point cloud data as shown in figs 13 b and 14 b using a hand held artec eva scanner the 3d point clouds are post processed using autodesk meshmixer to remove duplicate faces duplicate vertices zero area faces or any self intersecting faces etc as 3d scanning is carried out in a controlled laboratory environment with good ambient lighting the additional post processing required for both undeformed and deformed link point cloud is minimal figs 13 c and 14 c show 3d point clouds with 94 reduced mesh roughly 10 20k points the undeformed and deformed link used for 3d scanning are from the same lot which were used for chain strength tests sachan and choo 2020 the 3d point clouds from an undeformed and deformed link are used to verify the feature change monitoring methodology and compare the features observed between the two links the features compared include link length width shape change cross section and crown curvature for degradation estimation the study does not verify the changes in studless links due the unavailability of studless links for the project and associated studless 3d point cloud data 5 1 geometrical change monitoring using 3d scan data since the deformed link used to generate 3d point cloud is from the strength tests the features extracted are largely associated with the overloading mechanisms however the techniques can readily be extended for links with different material properties under different loading conditions this section also compares the features obtained from 3d point clouds of undeformed deformed links fig 15 a and b show the post processed point clouds and the outer boundaries of the point clouds of deformed and undeformed links the length as obtained from the deformed and undeformed scans are 495 1 mm and 460 9 mm which is consistent with physical measurements after monotonically increasing load experiments the results are also consistent with numerical observations 7 4 elongation at approximately 95 of mbl the change in width in the deformed studded link is minimal due to the presence of stud and the two point clouds show a small difference of 2 1 mm in width undeformed point cloud width 270 9 mm deformed point cloud width 273 0 mm fig 15 c compares the two outer extremes or overall shape of the undeformed and deformed link scanning only the outer rim in the first stage of inspection will expedite inspection process in addition overall shape change monitoring will be far superior in studless link monitoring due to obvious and large geometrical changes under load application fig 16 a and b show the cross sections at the top and bottom crown regions for undeformed and deformed link respectively changes in cross sectional diameters and link length are evident when plotted together for comparison as shown in fig 16 c table 2 summarizes the diameters as obtained from point clouds and actual measurements monitoring cross section diameters in the interlink regions using 3d point clouds is convenient and provides required information as compared to rov mounted calipers the measured diameter values may be further utilized for chain link fitness tests as indicated in bv mooring classification code bv nr 493 2015 the diameters measured at 90 d 1 d 2 using 3d point cloud are slightly larger than the actual measurements with error under 0 7 as shown in table 2 fig 17 a and b show the curvature radius at the top and bottom crown of the undeformed and deformed links respectively from the 3d point cloud data the comparison between curvature radii is summarized in table 3 the undeformed link has top and bottom curvature radius of 123 mm and 124 mm respectively which are in agreement with the values from fe analysis for an undeformed link the curvature radius is 98 mm and 104 mm for top and bottom crown regions of the deformed studded link for studded links assuming the initial value to be 123 mm the change is 20 3 and 15 4 for top and bottom crown respectively corresponding to 95 of mbl the fe analysis shows maximum change of 25 4 for studded links compared to 13 4 for studless links at 98 of mbl the presence of stud in the studded link restricts the inward movement of the straight legs thus witnessing smaller curvature or larger curvature change at higher loading level whereas in studless links the straight legs can freely move thus providing a larger curvature to the crown region at higher loads 5 2 strength estimation of scanned links rosen et al 2015 and crapps et al 2017 generated fe models and used continuum mechanics for the fe analysis of chain links since the conventional continuum mechanics fails to model the material separation or failure it is difficult to define the ultimate strength of the chain links this section establishes the strength of links using abaqus explicit analysis which employs fe model generated from 3d scan data and a suitable material degradation model for failure modelling 5 2 1 fe model from 3d scans the spatial 3d point clouds are post processed in autodesk meshmixer after post processing the spatial point clouds are converted to solid 3d fe models using solidworks a solid modeling computer aided design and engineering program figs 18 and 19 show the solid 3d fe models of both the undeformed and deformed links the deformed chain link model has different cross sectional dimensions in the top and bottom crown regions as indicated in table 2 therefore two fe models deformed 1 and defromed 2 as shown in fig 19 are generated from the two halves of the deformed link deformed 1 and deformed 2 have minimum cross section diameters of 67 76 mm and 69 38 mm respectively fig 20 shows the 1 4th undeformed and deformed 1 fe models obtained from the link scans 5 2 2 material damage model and parameter estimation sachan and choo 2020 explored the use of porous metal plasticity pmp continuum damage mechanics cdm and shear failure sf models to compute the ultimate strength of chain links the study identified that continuum damage mechanics model would be suitable for use in conjunction with elastic plastic material properties obtained from material strength tests as shown to fig 5 for ductile failure modelling the cdm model treats damage as an internal variable describing the state of the continuum and phenomenologically models the void nucleation growth and coalescence in materials the ductile damage model incorporated in abaqus is similar to the ductile damage model proposed by lemaitre 1985 in abaqus the cdm model is divided into two stages of damage initiation detection and damage evolution the onset of damage is identified using a variable ω d ω d d ε p l ε d p l η ε p l 1 no damage 1 damage initiation where ε p l is the equivalent plastic strain at damage initiation which is assumed to be a function of both the stress triaxiality η and plastic strain rate ε p l once the damage initiation criterion has been reached the effective plastic displacement ε p l is defined with the evolution equation u p l l ε p l where l is the characteristic length of the element assuming linear evolution of the damage variable with respect to effective plastic displacement u f p l the u f p l at the point of failure full degradation can be specified and increase in damage is specified by the equation d l ε p l u f p l u p l u f p l this definition ensures that when the effective plastic displacement u f p l u f p l the material stiffness will be fully degraded with d 1 therefore in ductile damage model the material damage behaviour can be completely defined by three parameters ε d p l u f p l and critical damage d c at which separation occurs the present study investigates material parameters for different mesh densities due to mesh dependency of the model the effective plastic strain ε d p l at damage initiation is assumed to be the strain at which necking starts there is no rational approach to estimate the values of effective plastic displacement at failure u f p l for different mesh densities therefore the u f p l values for different mesh sizes are obtained using parametric analysis on coupon fe model the results of the parametric analysis for different model parameters are compared with results from tensile experiment wsl 2 as shown in fig 21 table 4 summarizes the modelling parameters for different mesh sizes 5 2 3 mesh suitability the fe models from 3d point cloud data has irregular surface finish due to minor corrosion pits and indentations the post processing in meshmixer is not intended for smoothing the point clouds and thus imposes restrictions in meshing with structured c3d8r elements for cases with meshing difficulties due to geometrical complexities tetrahedral elements provide good versatility however there are certain disadvantages of tetrahedral mesh it requires much larger number of elements as compared to structured hexahedral mesh for similar accuracy the first order linear tetrahedral elements c3d4 are stiff and very fine mesh is required moreover second order c3d10 elements are effective alternatives to linear types but the increased number of integration points further increases the computational costs therefore the fe analysis is carried out with very fine c3d4 element mesh for both the master and slave instances as shown in fig 20 and other methods to increase the computational efficiency are explored in explicit analysis stable time increment can be increased by increasing the characteristic length l e or element size of element or by increasing the mass density of model abaqus 2014 increasing element size is impractical and significantly reduces the accuracy therefore economical solutions for qausi static analysis in abaqus explicit often employ limited amount of mass scaling indiscriminate change in mass consequently increases the inertial forces which may alter the solution significantly and can considerably degrade the accuracy of the analysis the appropriateness of the response is judged by utilizing the energy balance in the system fig 22 shows typical energy plots for reliable quasi static simulations the kinetic energy e ke should be 5 10 of external work e w or internal energy e i as shown in fig 22 a in addition work done by external forces e w should be approximately equal to the internal energy e i further establishing the assumption of quasi static analysis e tot is almost equal to zero as compared to the e i and e w providing the key rationality check for the analysis table 5 summarizes the stable time increment and computational times for the analyses with varying mass scaling factors msfs mass scaling significantly improves the computational time without altering the behavior or significantly affecting the results as shown in fig 23 a for larger msfs load displacement response is consistent except flattening out of the minor fluctuations fig 23 b c and d show the total energy e tot work done by external forces e w and total internal energy e i of the system the e w is almost equal to e i which supports the assumption of quasi static analysis and total energy e tot is almost zero of the order 10 4 as compared to e i and e w which satisfies the key rationality check the kinetic energy of the system is also low as shown in fig 24 a in addition the ratio of e ke to e w or e i is well below the range of 5 10 as illustrated in fig 24 b the other method to increase the computational efficiency and improve the economy of the solution for quasi static analysis is by increasing the rate of the loading which is achieved by reducing the solution time mass scaling and rate of loading both alternatives yield similar results for rate independent materials however the present study preferred the mass scaling approach due to non availability of rate dependent material properties 5 2 4 ultimate strength of scanned links progressive damage and ductile fracture properties are assigned to the bottom link where link failure occurs and the top link has only elastic plastic material definition abaqus explicit analysis program with element removal from the mesh is used to simulate ductile failure in the bottom link and compute ultimate strength of the link the ultimate strength is estimated for three fe models a undef b def 1 and c def 2 with c3d4 mesh of element size 1 5 mm any further reduction in the mesh size leads to very high computational requirements table 6 provides the number of elements for different mesh sizes for the undef def 1 and def 2 fe models table 7 relates the minimum cross section diameter and failure load obtained from the abaqus explicit analysis the fe model with ductile damage slightly under predicted the strength 93 2 for the undeformed link however the experiments conducted on the 5 link chains of the same batch also showed lesser ultimate strength than specified mbl for the chains the average ultimate strength of the 5 link chains observed in the experimental study was 4625 kn which is 94 7 of the code specified mbl fig 25 shows the load displacement response of the undef def 1 and def 2 models as expected the minimum failure load is obtained for the link with least cross sectional diameter fig 26 a b and c show the failure mode mises stress contours and equivalent plastic strain for the undef def 1 and def 2 links in undef model the fracture starts near the edge of the contact with adjacent link for def 1 which has the least cross sectional diameter 67 76 mm fracture initiation location shifts internally towards the lower cross section in the contact region the fracture initiation location for def 2 is approximately same as for def 1 the static strength for the def 1 and def 2 is 80 8 and 84 2 of the mbl the ductile damage model proves to be suitable for ductile failure modeling and ultimate strength estimation of chain links 6 conclusions the present study proposes a two step methodology which identifies degraded chain links and computes their ultimate strength by using 3d scanned point clouds in the first step damaged or degraded links are identified using 3d imaging and feature recognition in the second step 3d imaging data is converted to fe models and further analyzed for ultimate strength to make better discard decision the present study supports the following findings and conclusions 1 the 3d general imaging 3d gi and associated detailed imaging 3d di is found to be a more suitable inspection methodology as compared to conventional visual inspections gvi and cvi 3d imaging circumvents the requirement of underwater optical or mechanical calipers and is capable of identifying even minor deterioration in the chain links 2 the present study establishes a methodology to identify damaged or degraded studded and studless links using feature monitoring in studded links inelastic deformations are concentrated in the contact regions only therefore changes in overall length shape and crown curvature radius are found to be the most readily observable features for studless links additional changes in width and straight leg curvature radius can also be monitored 3 during 3d point cloud post processing the number of points were reduced to only 6 of the total points captured the number of active points control the feature representation the locations with anomalies such as uniform or pitting corrosion damages etc may be modelled with larger number of points the reduced mesh can be further scaled re oriented or modified in solidworks before converting it to 3d fe models for strength evaluation 4 the study improves the subsea inspection methodology by making the inspection more holistic in nature the proposed inspection methodology when combined with reliable in water ndt capabilities has the ability to eliminate the requirement of in air inspections thus saving time and money spent on surveys credit authorship contribution statement

20954,in the past mooring chain failure probabilities have been much higher than the design failure probabilities the high failure rates are attributed to prolonged exposure to various degradation mechanisms in harsh offshore conditions in addition to understanding failure mechanisms researchers have stressed on reducing the risk of failures through regular and reliable inspections current inspection techniques involve both in air and in water inspections however current in air inspections are time consuming and expensive while in water inspection techniques are not yet reliable the present paper proposes a condition monitoring and strength estimation methodology based on three dimensional 3d scans of links the study first identifies and estimates changes in simple geometrical features of chain links using finite element fe modeling for condition monitoring the methodology has two stages 3d general imaging 3d gi to identify degraded chain links using feature monitoring followed by 3d detailed imaging 3d di of the identified weak links the weak links 3d point clouds could be further converted to solid fe models for residual strength estimation by employing a suitable material degradation model the geometrical feature monitoring methodology is verified by 3d scans of an undeformed and a deformed studded link keywords mooring chain mooring integrity condition monitoring 3d inspections finite element analysis strength estimation 1 introduction the mooring chain is a safety critical component which controls the offset of offshore floating vessels its ability to work in extreme environments direct handling by the winches superior performance in the splash and thrash zones and long application experience makes it a popular choice for station keeping however prolonged exposure to large wave current and wind forces during storms and hurricanes in its design life 10 30 years leads to continuous deterioration that increases the likelihood of single or multiple line failures the recorded events of mooring chain replacements failures and complete breakaways have been summarized by various researchers in the past d souza et al 2013 ma et al 2013 maslin 2013 smedley and petruska 2014 in addition the single and multiple line failure probabilities are observed to be about a hundred times more than the design failure probabilities in general offshore floating facilities are designed to withstand single line failures however line failures can lead to substantial economic losses in terms of replacements costs and production losses brown et al 2005 moreover if undetected increased forces on other lines may lead to multiple line failure causing extended shutdowns riser damage hydrocarbon release and even loss of station in extreme cases in addition to high failure rates previous investigations identified wear and corrosion in links as major discard criteria the studies conducted by fontaine et al 2012 2014 in scorch jip showed much higher wear and corrosion rates than those specified in the api rp 2sk 2005 and dnv os e301 2010 consequently frequent inspections are vital for reliable condition assessment early damage detection and timely replacement to ensure safe working conditions allan et al 2013 brown et al 2005 2010 the current inspection methodologies can be categorized into in air outside water and in water in situ inspections the in air inspection requires retrieval of chains to the deck of inspection vessel to enable geometrical inter grip and visible crack measurements in addition several non destructive testing ndt procedures such as magnetic particle inspection mpi radiographic and guided ultrasonic wave guw tests can be carried out thus making the inspection reliable angulo et al 2017 the methodology is suitable for mobile offshore drilling units modus which recover mooring lines and anchors on a regular basis in permanent floating production units fpus in air inspections though reliable are not desirable due to temporary operational shutdown causing production losses or hiring of anchor handling and temporary heading control tugs can lead to economic losses therefore vessel owners and operators are more inclined towards employing in water inspections which are carried out using tethered remotely operated vehicles rovs the use of rovs allows unhindered daily operations in the facility thus increasing the economic viability and enhancing asset integrity the in water inspection process includes general visual inspection gvi and close visual inspection cvi using rovs gvi ensures overall integrity and identifies any gross anomaly or damage followed by cvi for closer inspection of anomalies additionally cvi is followed by chain measurements using rov mounted mechanical or optical calipers for corrosion and wear rate estimations allan et al 2013 however the cvi and chain measurements are not completely reliable and any suspected anomalies can only be confidently ascertained and further investigated by taking the chain out of water the deficiency of in water methodologies to reliably ascertain the anomalies other than those visually identifiable has led to extensive research in the field allan et al 2013 introduced novel 3d vision capabilities of welaptega marine ltd edwards et al 2014 and ruiz et al 2014 worked on developing the chain climbing robot moorinspect for in water ndt inspection of chain links using guided ultrasonic waves guws yang et al 2018 proposed thermographic technique for in situ monitoring of cracks and defects in the mooring chain links fontaine et al 2012 used 3d photogrammetry for finite element fe model creation of corroded links recovered from west africa rosen et al 2015 and crapps et al 2017 used 3d laser scans for inspection and analysis of the degraded chain links rosen et al 2015 in scorch jip also established the use of 3d scans to determine the distribution of corrosion pits in chain links recovered after service in recent years researchers through significant effort have made in water inspections more reliable however apart from obvious pitting corrosion and cracks which are directly visible identification of other anomalies causing subtle changes in chain links such as interlink wear overloading torsion strength degradation etc remains a critical issue the practice of diameter and length measurements using mechanical and optical calipers requires frequent calibrations and is time consuming moreover the measurements are restricted to validate that the wear and corrosion rates are within limits in addition the measurement at the interlink region where the plastic deformations wear diameter changes etc are concentrated is difficult through rov mounted calipers the confidence provided by previous research in 3d photogrammetry and laser scanning are the basis for the present study this study identifies a methodology which utilizes quality 3d inspection data for feature recognition and estimation to identify degraded chain links the study also proposes a reliable strength estimation technique for rational discard criteria of the identified weak links this study proposes a two stage inspection process a 3d general imaging 3d gi which includes fast full length scanning of mooring chain capturing link outer surface for wear rate estimations deformation and overloading assessments identifying links with visible corrosion and fatigue cracks and b 3d detailed imaging 3d di of identified weak links links with pitting corrosion severe wear deformed links overloaded links etc for condition assessment and rational discard criteria fig 1 shows the methodology for 3d inspections weak link identification and strength estimation 2 review of in water inspection practices and discard criteria brown et al 2010 2005 and mooring integrity guidance oil gas uk 2008 provide specific mooring inspection guidance for permanent mooring installations the mooring chains are inspected at two instances a before supply as manufacturer s quality control and b in service for safety and maintenance chains before supply undergo strength tests and ndts to ascertain that the minimum break load mbl are above the required value and ensure that the chain links do not have any manufacturing defects or cracks reliable in service inspections conducted for condition assessment early fault detection and repair enhance the overall mooring integrity api rp 2i and bv mooring classification code rule note nr 493 2015 provide useful inspection guidance and retirement criteria the bv mooring classification code classifies the in service surveys as annual intermediate and class renewal survey the in service surveys at various intervals enable operators to evaluate the deterioration mechanisms at work and areas of action the in water visual inspection systems have no depth limitation and are extensively used wherever diver inspections are not suitable fig 2 shows the gvi for overall condition monitoring and cvi for closer observation for anomalies in identified links the mooring chains are generally allowed a degree of corrosion or wear by virtue of being deployed in harsh environmental conditions the cvi is usually followed by chain measurements using mechanical and optical calipers to estimate and ascertain that the wear and corrosion rates are within the design values as shown in fig 3 however the under water measurement methodology has major shortcomings mechanical calipers require frequent calibration and optical calipers must have a pre assigned orientation for accurate measurements the measurements using rov mounted calipers a are time consuming b cannot provide measurements in the interlink contact regions to identify subtle changes in link geometry c are inadequate for modelling uniform or pitting corrosion and e are unable to provide assessments of link damage severity despite the major shortcomings of in water measurements it is still used for fitness checks of chain links which require reliable data and its interpretation bv mooring classification code rule note nr 493 2015 defines interlink distance measurement and provides discard criteria entirely based on dimension measurements at critical locations past research publications showed that severe reduction in cross sectional area or material loss at certain locations may or may not severely affect the strength of the chain links brown et al 2010 fontaine et al 2012 2014 therefore reliance placed only on the dimensional measurements may not be effective hence there is a need for more reliable strength based assessment criteria in addition to the present dimensional discard criteria the present study aims to improve the overall under water link measurement methodology through reliable data and its interpretation for identification of damaged links this study combines sub sea 3d imaging non contact optical scanning methods and link geometry monitoring for degraded link identification during in water inspections accurate chain dimensional measurements from 3d imaging data is useful in estimating corrosion and interlink wear identifying overloaded link measuring twist angle in chains under torsion or identifying excessive uniform or pitting corrosion the study also proposes to assess static strength in addition to dimensional measurements for more appropriate and reliable discard criteria for chain strength estimation 3d imaging data can be converted to 3d fe models and analyzed in conjunction with continuum damage mechanics for static strength estimate of the degraded links 3 proposed in water inspection using 3d imaging the length of mooring chain in floating facilities can span multiple kilometers with over 10 000 chain links which necessitates detailed 3d imaging of all links to be significantly tedious and time consuming therefore categorization of degradation is necessary to speed up the inspection process the present study categorizes degradation in links into i type 1 degradation which are easily visible severe corrosion or pitting corrosion severe abrasive wear loss of stud major fatigue cracks etc ii type 2 degradation which can be estimated or measured using 3d point cloud involving interlink wear corrosion angle of rotation due to torsion in multi component mooring lines and deformations due to overloading iii type 3 degradation which cannot be observed using point cloud data minor fatigue cracks and damage for example due to out of plane bending fatigue the degradation identified as type 3 cannot be ascertained using 3d imaging data and will require other techniques such as underwater guided ultrasonic waves or thermal inspections this study focuses on type 1 and type 2 degradations links with type 1 degradation can be directly considered for strength estimation links with type 2 degradation may not be obvious while identifying degraded links in the entire mooring line is essential for reliable inspection therefore this study utilizes deformations or geometrical changes in chain links to identify the degraded links past studies do not provide the change or extent of change in geometry of studless or studded chain links with increasing or repeated load application in addition the deformations and associated identifiable features and overall behavior will be different for studless and studded chain links due to difference in structural arrangement and geometry therefore geometrical features which undergo change in both studless and studded link need to be identified and quantified these links will be considered for strength estimation on the basis of deformation severity and associated change in geometrical feature 4 fe study to identify geometrical feature and estimate change the present fe study is used to identify features associated with overloading wear and torsion loading the study does not consider the out of plane bending opb phenomenon because it occurs inside the turret of a floating production vessel while it is absent when the links are outside the turret and are free to rotate the fe analysis utilizes fe models and elastic plastic material properties presented by sachan and choo 2020 4 1 fe model the fe studies are conducted on 76 mm studded and studless chain link of r3 grade steel non linear fe analysis of chain link employs an assembly of two 1 4th links as shown in fig 4 for studded link fe model the bottom link is fixed in y direction and is allowed to translate in all other directions load is applied by providing vertical displacement to the top link the model utilizes symmetry boundary conditions in the xy and yz planes the model employs c3d20r and c3d8r finite elements 20 node and 8 node brick elements in abaqus with reduced integration in the bottom and top link respectively the fe analysis utilizes elastic plastic material definition with hardening using stress strain data from coupon wsl 2 fig 5 shows the material strength tests and stress strain relationship summarized by sachan and choo 2020 4 2 geometrical features and changes due to loading a feature can be something associated with the chain link geometry which may be monitored for change or extracted for meaningful information this section identifies length width interlink distance crown straight leg curvature overall shape and link rotation as major observable features in which monitoring associated change can help to identify a degraded link fig 6 shows the incremental change in the studless and studded link geometry with increasing in line load it is evident from fig 6 that for in line axial loading inelastic behavior is mainly concentrated in the interlink contact regions and crown area the best differentiating feature between studded and studless chain link is that the straight legs in the studded chain link remains straight due to the presence of stud different features and change estimates using fe analysis are length change length of an undeformed studded and studless link is 6d where d is the nominal diameter of the link bar the elongation or length change depends on the maximum load the link has been subjected to while in service fig 7 a shows the load as mbl vs ratio of elongated link length to initial length for both studded and studless links the load is normalized using minimum breaking load of 76 mm diameter studded and studless chain links in studded link length change is primarily due to post yield plastic material flow in the contact and crown regions on the other hand in studless links inward movement of straight legs further increases the total deformation thus explaining higher deformations as compared to studded links at similar load levels maximum overall length change is around 10 11 for both types of links which is sufficient for comparing a deformed and an undeformed link point clouds width change in studded links presence of stud at mid height of the straight leg restricts the collapse of legs hence change in width is approximately zero which renders measuring width futile for condition monitoring conversely link width proves to be an important feature in studless chain overload monitoring the initial width for 76 mm studless chain link is 256 mm code specification 3 35d 3 4d and total reduction in width at mbl is 43 mm which is around 17 18 indicating larger sensitivity to loading than length change fig 7 b shows the relationship between applied load and ratio of width to initial width interlink distance interlink distance is a suitable indicator of cross section reduction due to interlink wear in chain links the measurements of diameter in the direction of loading d 1 and perpendicular direction d 2 represents the state of loading and wear in the interlink region the study ignores wear and only considers the interlink distance variation from increasing axial loads fig 8 shows the reduction in interlink distance in mm for the studless and studded link with increasing load in operational conditions the interlink distance will be a combination of in line load and inter link wear the overall reduction in interlink distance is in the range of 8 9 for studded link and 11 12 for studless link curvature change the local curvature varies in the crown region upon load application in both studded and studless chain links change in curvature radius at crown and straight legs for studless links only is obtained by extracting the points along the outline and fitting a circle to those points curvature change in the crown region is one of the useful features which undergoes substantial change in both the links for the crown region relative change is in the range of 20 25 as illustrated in fig 9 a for both link types initial curvature change in studded link is small because of the presence of stud followed by rapid change after plastic yielding as the load approaches mbl relative curvature change is larger for the studded link fig 9 b shows the relative change in curvature in straight leg of studless link the initial curvature value is very large 30756 at 8 mbl and approaches to a relatively smaller value 1152 at around 98 mbl the straight leg curvature is highly sensitive to loading and the relative curvature is 90 at 50 of mbl overall shape and cross sectional change monitoring overall shape and comparing with the preliminary inspection of standard link can also provide reliable information the overall shape of the chain links for both studless and studded chain link is the most easily observable feature refer to fig 6 the deformations above the inflection points near the bend region could be easily correlated with the loading for both studded and studless links moreover the collapse of straight leg in the studless link is also a notable feature the cross section perpendicular to the link plane can be compared for deformations or cross sectional reduction in the contact regions as shown in fig 10 angle between two link torsion in multi component mooring lines leads to inter link rotation in the mooring chain the angle of rotation due to torsion in the mooring line can be estimated by monitoring two adjacent links as illustrated in fig 11 the inter link angles measured using relative rotation of adjacent chain link provide useful estimate of torque in the mooring lines the present study does not include torsional angle measurements due to lack of data however the twist angles measured during inspection can be correlated with the torque and residual strength of chain links table 1 summarizes the features and total change in the monitored features at maximum load 5 non contact 3d optical scanning for inspection and strength estimation 2d imaging is insignificant in providing accurate damage assessment the measurements using rov mounted calipers can only be provided at any one point in time and thus time consuming conversely the 3d optical method provides spatial coordinates which represent the geometry of an object in the form of 3d point cloud these spatial points on the surface of the body can be used to measure dimensions or monitor any change in geometry therefore in water 3d inspection data of chain links could be compared with the undeformed chain geometry or installation survey 3d data for meaningful observations fig 12 shows the 3d point cloud data of a failed and a deformed chain link 3d scanning methodology has several advantages over 2d imaging i it is fast and can capture more than 200 frames per second fps which makes it suitable for real time scanning applications ii the 3d point cloud data does not require scaling and it thus enables direct and accurate dimensional measurements accuracy of measurement is further enhanced by the time of flight measurement of light pulses using a precision timer which is generally accurate to 0 1 mm or less for normal hand held devices iii ambient light is not required for 3d scanning since the device works on laser or white light pulse based data acquisition which is sufficient to capture the intricate features of an object figs 13 a and 14 a shows an undeformed and a deformed link respectively which are used to generate quality 3d point cloud data as shown in figs 13 b and 14 b using a hand held artec eva scanner the 3d point clouds are post processed using autodesk meshmixer to remove duplicate faces duplicate vertices zero area faces or any self intersecting faces etc as 3d scanning is carried out in a controlled laboratory environment with good ambient lighting the additional post processing required for both undeformed and deformed link point cloud is minimal figs 13 c and 14 c show 3d point clouds with 94 reduced mesh roughly 10 20k points the undeformed and deformed link used for 3d scanning are from the same lot which were used for chain strength tests sachan and choo 2020 the 3d point clouds from an undeformed and deformed link are used to verify the feature change monitoring methodology and compare the features observed between the two links the features compared include link length width shape change cross section and crown curvature for degradation estimation the study does not verify the changes in studless links due the unavailability of studless links for the project and associated studless 3d point cloud data 5 1 geometrical change monitoring using 3d scan data since the deformed link used to generate 3d point cloud is from the strength tests the features extracted are largely associated with the overloading mechanisms however the techniques can readily be extended for links with different material properties under different loading conditions this section also compares the features obtained from 3d point clouds of undeformed deformed links fig 15 a and b show the post processed point clouds and the outer boundaries of the point clouds of deformed and undeformed links the length as obtained from the deformed and undeformed scans are 495 1 mm and 460 9 mm which is consistent with physical measurements after monotonically increasing load experiments the results are also consistent with numerical observations 7 4 elongation at approximately 95 of mbl the change in width in the deformed studded link is minimal due to the presence of stud and the two point clouds show a small difference of 2 1 mm in width undeformed point cloud width 270 9 mm deformed point cloud width 273 0 mm fig 15 c compares the two outer extremes or overall shape of the undeformed and deformed link scanning only the outer rim in the first stage of inspection will expedite inspection process in addition overall shape change monitoring will be far superior in studless link monitoring due to obvious and large geometrical changes under load application fig 16 a and b show the cross sections at the top and bottom crown regions for undeformed and deformed link respectively changes in cross sectional diameters and link length are evident when plotted together for comparison as shown in fig 16 c table 2 summarizes the diameters as obtained from point clouds and actual measurements monitoring cross section diameters in the interlink regions using 3d point clouds is convenient and provides required information as compared to rov mounted calipers the measured diameter values may be further utilized for chain link fitness tests as indicated in bv mooring classification code bv nr 493 2015 the diameters measured at 90 d 1 d 2 using 3d point cloud are slightly larger than the actual measurements with error under 0 7 as shown in table 2 fig 17 a and b show the curvature radius at the top and bottom crown of the undeformed and deformed links respectively from the 3d point cloud data the comparison between curvature radii is summarized in table 3 the undeformed link has top and bottom curvature radius of 123 mm and 124 mm respectively which are in agreement with the values from fe analysis for an undeformed link the curvature radius is 98 mm and 104 mm for top and bottom crown regions of the deformed studded link for studded links assuming the initial value to be 123 mm the change is 20 3 and 15 4 for top and bottom crown respectively corresponding to 95 of mbl the fe analysis shows maximum change of 25 4 for studded links compared to 13 4 for studless links at 98 of mbl the presence of stud in the studded link restricts the inward movement of the straight legs thus witnessing smaller curvature or larger curvature change at higher loading level whereas in studless links the straight legs can freely move thus providing a larger curvature to the crown region at higher loads 5 2 strength estimation of scanned links rosen et al 2015 and crapps et al 2017 generated fe models and used continuum mechanics for the fe analysis of chain links since the conventional continuum mechanics fails to model the material separation or failure it is difficult to define the ultimate strength of the chain links this section establishes the strength of links using abaqus explicit analysis which employs fe model generated from 3d scan data and a suitable material degradation model for failure modelling 5 2 1 fe model from 3d scans the spatial 3d point clouds are post processed in autodesk meshmixer after post processing the spatial point clouds are converted to solid 3d fe models using solidworks a solid modeling computer aided design and engineering program figs 18 and 19 show the solid 3d fe models of both the undeformed and deformed links the deformed chain link model has different cross sectional dimensions in the top and bottom crown regions as indicated in table 2 therefore two fe models deformed 1 and defromed 2 as shown in fig 19 are generated from the two halves of the deformed link deformed 1 and deformed 2 have minimum cross section diameters of 67 76 mm and 69 38 mm respectively fig 20 shows the 1 4th undeformed and deformed 1 fe models obtained from the link scans 5 2 2 material damage model and parameter estimation sachan and choo 2020 explored the use of porous metal plasticity pmp continuum damage mechanics cdm and shear failure sf models to compute the ultimate strength of chain links the study identified that continuum damage mechanics model would be suitable for use in conjunction with elastic plastic material properties obtained from material strength tests as shown to fig 5 for ductile failure modelling the cdm model treats damage as an internal variable describing the state of the continuum and phenomenologically models the void nucleation growth and coalescence in materials the ductile damage model incorporated in abaqus is similar to the ductile damage model proposed by lemaitre 1985 in abaqus the cdm model is divided into two stages of damage initiation detection and damage evolution the onset of damage is identified using a variable ω d ω d d ε p l ε d p l η ε p l 1 no damage 1 damage initiation where ε p l is the equivalent plastic strain at damage initiation which is assumed to be a function of both the stress triaxiality η and plastic strain rate ε p l once the damage initiation criterion has been reached the effective plastic displacement ε p l is defined with the evolution equation u p l l ε p l where l is the characteristic length of the element assuming linear evolution of the damage variable with respect to effective plastic displacement u f p l the u f p l at the point of failure full degradation can be specified and increase in damage is specified by the equation d l ε p l u f p l u p l u f p l this definition ensures that when the effective plastic displacement u f p l u f p l the material stiffness will be fully degraded with d 1 therefore in ductile damage model the material damage behaviour can be completely defined by three parameters ε d p l u f p l and critical damage d c at which separation occurs the present study investigates material parameters for different mesh densities due to mesh dependency of the model the effective plastic strain ε d p l at damage initiation is assumed to be the strain at which necking starts there is no rational approach to estimate the values of effective plastic displacement at failure u f p l for different mesh densities therefore the u f p l values for different mesh sizes are obtained using parametric analysis on coupon fe model the results of the parametric analysis for different model parameters are compared with results from tensile experiment wsl 2 as shown in fig 21 table 4 summarizes the modelling parameters for different mesh sizes 5 2 3 mesh suitability the fe models from 3d point cloud data has irregular surface finish due to minor corrosion pits and indentations the post processing in meshmixer is not intended for smoothing the point clouds and thus imposes restrictions in meshing with structured c3d8r elements for cases with meshing difficulties due to geometrical complexities tetrahedral elements provide good versatility however there are certain disadvantages of tetrahedral mesh it requires much larger number of elements as compared to structured hexahedral mesh for similar accuracy the first order linear tetrahedral elements c3d4 are stiff and very fine mesh is required moreover second order c3d10 elements are effective alternatives to linear types but the increased number of integration points further increases the computational costs therefore the fe analysis is carried out with very fine c3d4 element mesh for both the master and slave instances as shown in fig 20 and other methods to increase the computational efficiency are explored in explicit analysis stable time increment can be increased by increasing the characteristic length l e or element size of element or by increasing the mass density of model abaqus 2014 increasing element size is impractical and significantly reduces the accuracy therefore economical solutions for qausi static analysis in abaqus explicit often employ limited amount of mass scaling indiscriminate change in mass consequently increases the inertial forces which may alter the solution significantly and can considerably degrade the accuracy of the analysis the appropriateness of the response is judged by utilizing the energy balance in the system fig 22 shows typical energy plots for reliable quasi static simulations the kinetic energy e ke should be 5 10 of external work e w or internal energy e i as shown in fig 22 a in addition work done by external forces e w should be approximately equal to the internal energy e i further establishing the assumption of quasi static analysis e tot is almost equal to zero as compared to the e i and e w providing the key rationality check for the analysis table 5 summarizes the stable time increment and computational times for the analyses with varying mass scaling factors msfs mass scaling significantly improves the computational time without altering the behavior or significantly affecting the results as shown in fig 23 a for larger msfs load displacement response is consistent except flattening out of the minor fluctuations fig 23 b c and d show the total energy e tot work done by external forces e w and total internal energy e i of the system the e w is almost equal to e i which supports the assumption of quasi static analysis and total energy e tot is almost zero of the order 10 4 as compared to e i and e w which satisfies the key rationality check the kinetic energy of the system is also low as shown in fig 24 a in addition the ratio of e ke to e w or e i is well below the range of 5 10 as illustrated in fig 24 b the other method to increase the computational efficiency and improve the economy of the solution for quasi static analysis is by increasing the rate of the loading which is achieved by reducing the solution time mass scaling and rate of loading both alternatives yield similar results for rate independent materials however the present study preferred the mass scaling approach due to non availability of rate dependent material properties 5 2 4 ultimate strength of scanned links progressive damage and ductile fracture properties are assigned to the bottom link where link failure occurs and the top link has only elastic plastic material definition abaqus explicit analysis program with element removal from the mesh is used to simulate ductile failure in the bottom link and compute ultimate strength of the link the ultimate strength is estimated for three fe models a undef b def 1 and c def 2 with c3d4 mesh of element size 1 5 mm any further reduction in the mesh size leads to very high computational requirements table 6 provides the number of elements for different mesh sizes for the undef def 1 and def 2 fe models table 7 relates the minimum cross section diameter and failure load obtained from the abaqus explicit analysis the fe model with ductile damage slightly under predicted the strength 93 2 for the undeformed link however the experiments conducted on the 5 link chains of the same batch also showed lesser ultimate strength than specified mbl for the chains the average ultimate strength of the 5 link chains observed in the experimental study was 4625 kn which is 94 7 of the code specified mbl fig 25 shows the load displacement response of the undef def 1 and def 2 models as expected the minimum failure load is obtained for the link with least cross sectional diameter fig 26 a b and c show the failure mode mises stress contours and equivalent plastic strain for the undef def 1 and def 2 links in undef model the fracture starts near the edge of the contact with adjacent link for def 1 which has the least cross sectional diameter 67 76 mm fracture initiation location shifts internally towards the lower cross section in the contact region the fracture initiation location for def 2 is approximately same as for def 1 the static strength for the def 1 and def 2 is 80 8 and 84 2 of the mbl the ductile damage model proves to be suitable for ductile failure modeling and ultimate strength estimation of chain links 6 conclusions the present study proposes a two step methodology which identifies degraded chain links and computes their ultimate strength by using 3d scanned point clouds in the first step damaged or degraded links are identified using 3d imaging and feature recognition in the second step 3d imaging data is converted to fe models and further analyzed for ultimate strength to make better discard decision the present study supports the following findings and conclusions 1 the 3d general imaging 3d gi and associated detailed imaging 3d di is found to be a more suitable inspection methodology as compared to conventional visual inspections gvi and cvi 3d imaging circumvents the requirement of underwater optical or mechanical calipers and is capable of identifying even minor deterioration in the chain links 2 the present study establishes a methodology to identify damaged or degraded studded and studless links using feature monitoring in studded links inelastic deformations are concentrated in the contact regions only therefore changes in overall length shape and crown curvature radius are found to be the most readily observable features for studless links additional changes in width and straight leg curvature radius can also be monitored 3 during 3d point cloud post processing the number of points were reduced to only 6 of the total points captured the number of active points control the feature representation the locations with anomalies such as uniform or pitting corrosion damages etc may be modelled with larger number of points the reduced mesh can be further scaled re oriented or modified in solidworks before converting it to 3d fe models for strength evaluation 4 the study improves the subsea inspection methodology by making the inspection more holistic in nature the proposed inspection methodology when combined with reliable in water ndt capabilities has the ability to eliminate the requirement of in air inspections thus saving time and money spent on surveys credit authorship contribution statement
