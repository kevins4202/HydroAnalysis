14510,mgo was found to take up f from naf aqueous solutions due to the electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged mgo and f the f adsorption by mgo can be represented by pseudo first order reaction kinetics and the magnitude of the apparent activation energy 71 6 kj mol 1 confirms that this is a chemisorption process the thermodynamic behavior of this process follows langmuir type adsorption with the maximum adsorption amount of 5 6 mmol g 1 the f can be desorbed from mgo using naoh solution the regenerated mgo can still take up f from the solution despite the lowered adsorption capacity therefore it is possible to recycle the mgo for f adsorption keywords mgo f water treatment kinetics equilibrium 1 introduction f containing wastewater originates from the electronics industry the glass industry and from etching processes in general the effluent standard in japan for f is 8 mg l 1 the primary treatment involves capturing the f ions in the form of slightly soluble caf2 by adding calcium salts such as ca oh 2 and cacl2 to the wastewater in a second step aluminum salts such as polyaluminum chloride are added to the wastewater producing gelatinous aluminum hydroxide to capture the remaining f ions however this two step process is very cumbersome and a single step treatment for f containing wastewater is therefore in keen demand we have examined several new treatment methods for f containing wastewater using adsorbents for example we studied the possibility of recycling mg al layered double hydroxide mg al ldh and its calcination product mg al oxide for f treatment 1 2 and tested them in removing f in real wastewater 3 furthermore we found that mgo could remove f in aqueous solutions 4 in several subsequent studies li et al examined f removal by porous hollow mgo microspheres 5 and jin et al investigated the effective removal of f by porous mgo nanoplates and the adsorption mechanism 6 recently lee et al examined the synthesis of pillar and microsphere like mgo particles and their f adsorption performance in aqueous solutions 7 however the desorption and recycling of these materials after they are used for f removal have not been considered in this study we tested the reusability of mgo for removing aqueous f as shown in fig 1 the mgo adsorbed with f is then treated with an aqueous solution of naoh after the desorption of f the mgo is regenerated and reused we systematically examined the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of f removal by mgo the effects of the amount of mgo and the temperature were investigated finally the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption of f by mgo was examined which helps to reveal the adsorption mechanism 2 experimental all reagents were of chemical reagent grade and used without further purification mgo is purchased from kanto chemical co inc the average particle size is 28 5 μm and the specific surface area is 4 8 m2 g 2 1 removal of f from aqueous solution naf solutions were prepared by dissolving naf in deionized water for the kinetic measurements mgo was added to 100 mg l 1 naf solution 500 ml without initial ph control and the resultant suspension was stirred at 10 30 and 60 c for 100 h samples were withdrawn from the suspension at different time intervals and immediately filtered and then the filtrates were analyzed for residual f to study the thermodynamics of the adsorption process mgo was added to naf solutions with the molar ratio of mg f 1 5 10 and 20 to determine the adsorption isotherm 20 ml of a naf solution 0 005 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 2 g of mgo were placed in a 50 ml screw top tube and shaken at 30 c for 1 week 2 2 desorption of f from mgo the desorption of f from mgo was carried out using naoh solution after a mgo suspension in naf mg f 10 was kept at 30 c for 48 h the mgo was found to contain 0 8 wt of f this mgo adsorbed with f 0 1 g and 20 ml of naoh solution 1 0 m were placed in a 50 ml screw top tube and shaken at 30 c for 24 h 2 3 removal of f from aqueous solution by regenerated mgo mgo regenerated from the mgo adsorbed with f in 1 0 m naoh solution at 30 c for 12 h was suspended in 100 mg l 1 naf solution at mg f 10 and 30 c for comparison mg oh 2 was suspended in 100 mg l 1 naf solution at the same mg f molar ratio and temperature 2 4 effects of ionic strength on adsorption the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption of f by mgo was examined in 100 mg l 1 naf solutions prepared using 0 0 001 or 0 01 m nacl solution with initial ph of 2 12 mgo was suspended in this solution at mg f 5 and 30 c 2 5 analytical methods mgo before and after f adsorption was analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd measurements with cu kα radiation for the adsorption experiments the residual f and mg2 dissolved from mgo in the filtrates were separated using a dionex dx 120 ion chromatograph and a dionex model as 12 a column eluent 2 7 mm na2co3 and 0 3 mm nahco3 flow rate 1 3 ml min 1 their concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes the ph after the adsorption was also measured 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of f from aqueous solution fig 2 shows change in the f concentration over time in various mgo suspensions in naf at 30 c for all mg f molar ratios the concentration of f decreased with time and the concentration after a given time decreased with increasing mg f ratio when mg f 20 the concentration of f after 24 h treatment was less than the effluent standard in japan 8 mg l 1 therefore mgo was confirmed to effectively take up f from naf solutions fig s1 shows the change in the ph over time in the various suspension at 30 c for all mg f molar ratios the ph value first increased rapidly and then remained constant at around 11 this is attributed to the buffer action of mg2 fig s2 shows that at all mg f ratios and 30 c the mg2 concentration in the solution increased rapidly at first and then decreased with time the maximum amount of mg2 dissolved was around 3 for mg f 10 and this low value indicates that the dissolution of mg2 from mgo had little effect on the uptake of f from the solution fig s3 shows the xrd patterns for the solids from mgo suspension in naf at mg f 10 at 30 at 30 c for 0 48 h after 12 h the xrd peak ascribed to mg oh 2 was hardly observed but its intensity increased with time suggesting hydration on the surface of mgo particles which caused the dissolution of mg2 the xrd patterns fig s3 did not show the peak ascribed to the products composed of mg and f the zero point of charge zpc of mgo is known to be 12 4 8 since the ph values in fig s1 are all lower than this the surface of mgo particles should be positively charged therefore the uptake of f is attributed to the electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged mgo and f implying chemical adsorption fig 3 shows the change in f removal at mg f 10 at various temperatures for all temperatures the f adsorption increased with time particularly at 60 c at any time the f adsorption also increased with temperature the kinetics of f removal by mgo was examined by first order kinetics which depend on the concentration of f as 1 l n 1 x k t where x is the degree of f adsorption t h is the reaction time and k h 1 is the rate constant in the plots in fig 4 mg f 10 good linearity was obtained at each temperature indicating that f adsorption can be represented by pseudo first order reaction kinetics the respective apparent rate constants at 10 30 and 60 c were 8 0 10 3 7 1 10 2 and 7 8 10 1 h 1 clearly increasing with increasing temperature fig s4 shows the corresponding arrhenius plot of the apparent rate constant yielding an apparent activation energy of 71 6 kj mol 1 this value confirms that the uptake of f by mgo proceeded under chemical reaction control fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherm in which the equilibrium adsorption amount increased with increasing equilibrium concentration these isotherms showed langmuir type behavior which was confirmed by fitting to the langmuir equation expressed as 2 q e c e q m k l 1 c e k l where qe mmol g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption ce mmol l 1 is the equilibrium concentration qm mmol g 1 is the maximum adsorption and kl is the equilibrium adsorption constant this equation can also be expressed as 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m fig s5 plots ce qe versus ce for the adsorption isotherms good linearity was obtained indicating that this process followed langmuir type adsorption this also suggests that the adsorption of f by mgo is chemical adsorption the value of qm determined from the slope of the straight line in fig s5 was 5 6 mmol g 1 this value i e capacity for f removal is much higher than our previously reported maximum adsorption for related adsorbents 3 3 mmol g 1 for no3 mg al ldh and 3 2 mmol g 1 for cl mg al ldh 1 and 3 0 mmol g 1 for mg al oxide mg al 2 2 3 2 desorption of f from mgo fig 6 shows the f desorption from mgo in naoh solution over time the amount of desorbed f first increased rapidly with time and then remained constant after 24 h 11 8 of the adsorbed f was desorbed the ph value during the reaction 13 0 14 5 is higher than the zpc of mgo suggesting that the surface of mgo particles is now negatively charged and the resulting electrostatic repulsion caused the f to desorb from mgo 3 3 removal of f from aqueous solution by the mgo after regeneration fig 7 shows f removal over time using mgo before or after regeneration at mg f 10 and 30 c for the regenerated mgo the concentration of f in the solution decreased gradually with time after 48 h the concentrations of f were 5 8 and 30 9 mg l 1 for mgo before and after regeneration respectively hence the regenerated mgo had lower ability for f adsorption than the original mgo due to the progressive hydration of the surface of mgo particles into mg oh 2 for reference fig s6 compares the f concentration over time in naf suspensions with mgo or mg oh 2 at mg f 10 and 30 c the results indicate that mg oh 2 could only take up very little f from the solution in other words non hydrolyzed mgo surface is required for f adsorption nevertheless there was non negligible uptake of f by the regenerated mgo indicating that it is possible to recycle the mgo for f adsorption as shown in fig 1 by the way the adsorption rate for regenerated mgo was faster than the original mgo while in the initial adsorption 0 10 h as shown in fig 7 this behavior is similar to the adsorption behavior for mg oh 2 as shown in fig s6 fig s6 presents that the adsorption rate for mg oh 2 was faster than mgo while in the initial adsorption 0 4 h therefore the above phenomenon is attributed to the hydration of the surface of mgo into mg oh 2 for regenerated mgo 3 4 adsorption mechanism figs 8 and 9 show the change in the f adsorption and the final ph as a function of initial ph in mgo suspension in naf solution 100 mg l with various nacl concentrations at mg f 5 and 30 c upon decreasing the initial ph the f adsorption increased for all nacl concentrations and the final ph also decreased since all the final ph values were lower than the zpc of mgo the mgo surface should carry increasing positive charge as the initial ph is lowered resulting in more efficient f adsorption in this case the nacl was used to adjust the ionic strength when the nacl concentration changed from 0 001 to 0 01 m the f adsorption decreased here a higher ionic strength means more abundant cl which could compete with f for adsorption on the positively charged mgo surface generally ionic strength dependent adsorption suggests the formation of outer sphere complexes 9 12 therefore the results in figs 8 and 9 confirm that the f adsorption by mgo is not due to the direct combination of f onto the surface of mgo but to the electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged mgo and the f 4 conclusions mgo was confirmed to take up f from naf solutions the ph during the reaction remains lower than the zpc of mgo suggesting that the surface of mgo particle is positively charged and therefore the uptake of f is attributed to the electrostatic attractive force between mgo and f when the mg f molar ratio was 20 and the reaction time exceeded 24 h the final concentration of f was less than the effluent standards in japan 8 mg l 1 the f adsorption can be represented by pseudo first order reaction kinetics the apparent rate constants at 10 30 and 60 c were 8 0 10 3 7 1 10 2 and 7 8 10 1 h 1 respectively and the apparent activation energy was 71 6 kj mol 1 this value confirms that the uptake of f by mgo is chemical adsorption this process was found to follow a langmuir type adsorption with the maximum adsorption being 5 6 mmol g 1 the adsorbed f could be desorbed from the mgo using naoh solution by creating electrostatic repulsion between the f and negatively charged mgo while the regenerated mgo showed a lower ability for f adsorption possibly due to the progressive hydration of the mgo surface to form mg oh 2 it could still take up an appreciable amount of f indicating that mgo can be reused as an adsorbent to remove f finally the observed dependence of adsorption on the ionic strength implies that the f adsorption by mgo is driven by the electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged mgo and f instead of the direct combination of f onto the surface of mgo acknowledgments this research was supported by the environment research and technology development fund 5rfb 1201 of the ministry of

14511,commercial zerovalent iron zvi as steel wool and carbonyl iron powder activation of persulphate ps has been demonstrated to be effective in the degradation of four important water pollutants namely orange g og salicylic acid sa phenol ph and 1 naphthylamine 1na in the presence or absence of methanol meoh the addition of meoh mimics the presence of industrial solvents and or feedstuff in real industrial wastewater the alcohol had a more retarding effect on the degradation of an aromatic pollutant relatively resistant to oxidation such as sa due to the presence of an electron withdrawing group compared to a pollutant such as 1na that has an electron donating group the azo bond in og constituted a structural weakness leading to a comparatively more effective degradation of the aromatic moieties fe2 was not only less effective than the commercial zvi in activating ps it was also more significantly retarded in its activity by meoh in addition the surfaces of the zvi were not oxidised an advantage over zvi nanoparticles and they required no prior pretreatment indicating the probable suitability of waste iron filings for ps activation as an activator of ps zvi is optimised at a size range of 0 1 μm d 100 μm it was also demonstrated that the poor optimisation of ps concentration not only increases oxidant consumption or treatment time but also results in the persistence of undesirable aromatic degradation by products these results are important for the development of low cost and effective industrial wastewater treatment schemes keywords steel wool carbonyl iron powder persulfate azo dye salicylic acid 1 introduction the activation of persulphate ps by iron in its three common oxidation states has been the focus of numerous scientific investigations over the last two decades 1 scavenging or depletion of ps a short lived activation requiring repeated resupply and introduction of an additional anion are some of the challenges inherent in the use of ionic iron for ps activation 2 3 however the use of zerovalent iron zvi has been shown to overcome these challenges for efficient ps activation for the purpose of degrading a range of pollutants such as dibutyl phthalate 4 bentazon 5 p chloroaniline 6 acetaminophen 7 and acid orange 7 3 zvi materials as nanoparticles nzvi are more reactive than larger particles due to their higher surface area and the greater proportion of surface atoms 8 9 however the problem of passivation due to surface oxidation upon exposure to air increases as particle size decreases 8 for example li et al 3 reported that an analytical grade of nzvi showed no measurable reaction with ps without acid washing suggesting significant oxide passivation particle aggregation with attendant reduction in reactivity is another common problem implicit in the use of nzvi for pollutant degradation 8 10 11 consequently size optimisation is critical for industrial application of zvi activation of ps with the aim being that the particles are small enough to ensure rapid ps activation but large enough to minimise or eliminate surface passivation another important disadvantage of nzvi activation of ps relative to bulk zvi is the high cost of the nanoparticles 8 to advance the implementation of zvi activation of ps for industrial pollutant degradation the performances of two zvi materials that are low cost commercially available and with a size at least in one dimension 100 μm for rapid ps activation 3 12 and 1 μm to eliminate surface oxidation 8 have been evaluated one of the zvi materials evaluated is industrial grade carbonyl iron powder cip and the other is domestic grade steel wool sw the ultimate purpose was to promote the use of iron filings which are widely available as by products of iron processing and finishing for environmental remediation applications to highlight the practicality of zvi ps treatment of wastewater the degradation of a number of pollutants were evaluated namely orange g og salicylic acid sa phenol ph and 1 naphthylamine 1na the well studied og as a typical azo dye 12 14 was chosen to facilitate comparison to previous publications and because azo dyes constitute between 60 70 of global production of synthetic dyes 13 15 with about 20 lost to effluent in the textile industry amounting to substantial water pollution 15 16 sa is one of the first pharmaceuticals to be detected in sewage effluent 17 due to its widespread use as an important pharmaceutical either directly or in its acylated form as acetylsalicylic acid aspirin sa is ubiquitous in the environment including drinking water and is considered an eco risk and a contaminant of emerging concern 17 18 although 1na is described as a top priority potentially carcinogenic pollutant which is widely used as an industrial chemical intermediate and discharged from several industrial processes 19 21 studies of its degradation by chemical oxidants are rare ph and its derivatives find important use in many chemical processes and are therefore ubiquitous at toxic concentrations in wastewater effluent 22 23 a number of researchers have reported on how coexisting inorganic ions and organic materials usually natural organic matter nom influence the degradation of environmental pollutants 13 24 25 however for industrial wastewater nom may be less important compared to industrial organic solvents and feedstuffs 26 since wastewater from industries and hospitals are known to be major contributors to environmental contamination 17 26 27 it is important that degradation studies should analyse the effect of commonly used industrial solvents and feedstuff on the degradation of target pollutants alcohols such as methanol meoh are widely used industrial solvents and feedstuffs and have been identified in industrial wastewater 26 28 29 although meoh and other alcohols are commonly used in the laboratory as radical scavengers and reactions quenchers 30 the systematic investigation of their effects on the radical degradation of target pollutants are uncommon while it may be expected that the presence of meoh like nom 24 25 may reduce the degradation of the target pollutant it is not known if meoh will influence the nature of the degradation products or whether different pollutants will be differently affected this study includes an evaluation of the effect of meoh on the degradation of the aforementioned target pollutants the study is considered a first step towards understanding the complex matrix effect of real industrial wastewater samples 2 experimental procedures 2 1 materials cip of the cep om company s tag grade 98 fe 0 9 c from basf germany and sw of the finest 0000 company s tag grade from sifa pty ltd australia

meoh on the target pollutant degradation experiments with og 0 1 mm were conducted at varying initial ps concentration cps 0 of 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm to determine the effect of ps concentration on the effectiveness of the target pollutant degradation to determine the effect of ph on ps activation by zvi degradation experiments with sa 0 1 mm were conducted with and without ph modification 10 mm phosphate buffer composed of 5 mm of nah2po4 and 5 mm of na2hpo4 was used to stabilise the reaction ph for ph modified reactions 24 experiments with 1na and ph 0 2 mm were conducted in the presence of background meoh 25 mm except where otherwise stated proh 2000 mm and buoh 2100 mm 30 were used as radical scavengers in evaluating pollutant degradation mechanism at designated intervals during the degradation experiments 1 ml samples of the reacting suspensions were withdrawn using a syringe and filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter into 0 5 ml meoh to quench the reactions 7 the

organic carbon analyzer samples for tc analysis were filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter and quenched in an ice bath 32 with tc analyses typically conducted and completed few hours after samples collection no attempt was made in this study to determine the generation and transformation of fe2 in the course of the commercial zvi activation of ps as one of the primary aims was to compare the activation performance of the zvi materials and fe2 rather than develop a mechanism of the activation future studies that explore the mechanisms of zvi activation of ps will need determine the profile of oxidised iron evolution from the zvi materials 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterisation of zvi samples the xrd patterns for the two zvi samples are presented in fig 1 a showing peaks for iron indexed to iccdd 6 696 the shift in peak position for sw is believed to be due to inadequate height positioning arising from the woollen nature of the sample the absence of any detectable oxidised iron peak shows that the iron samples are stable in air and are consequently unpassivated unlike nzvi 3 8 the ftir spectra of the samples are shown in fig 1b unlike the xrd patterns which reveal the long range order of atoms or overall crystalline properties of the samples the ftir spectra highlight short range order structures and therefore could better identify features restricted to the material surface 33 35 important differences in surface properties are evident for the sw and cip spectra the sw spectra show peaks that are assignable to c h from alkane 36 which is indicative of surface coating probably by hydrocarbon no such organic peaks were developed in the cip spectra suggestive of cleaner surfaces however peaks that are assignable to iron carbonyls are developed in cip but not in sw which clearly confirm the carbonyl nature of the former but not the latter the absorbance in fig 1a is significantly low which is suggestive of low concentration of non iron components consistent with the cip specifications provided earlier the isotherm plot for sw and cip are shown in figure s 1 supplementary material the isotherm for cip can be described as a regular type ii isotherm for a non porous or macroporous adsorbent whose surface area can be described by bet 37 the measured bet surface area s for cip was 0 54 m2 g using 7 86 g cm3 as the density of iron ρ and the expression given in eq 1 38 the average diameter d of the cip particles is calculated as 1 4 μm unfortunately the isotherm plot for sw is irregular as shown in fig s 1 and thus the obtained bet value is not valid 1 d 6000 s ρ the optical images of the samples are shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows that the cip sample is composed of spherical particles with some degree of particle aggregation the cip particles as observed in the optical image as computed by bet and as specified by the supplier of the particles are 10 μm the sw material is made up of sparsely arranged cylindrical fibres the diameters of the fibres are 30 μm in addition fibres generally have surface chippings or irregularities which may be linked to the manufacturing process the projections or unevenness of the surface may contribute towards enhancing the chemical reactivity of the zvi fibres as it provides a comparatively higher surface area to volume with respect to the overall fibre size 8 3 2 degradation of orange g the results of the og batch degradation experiments for cps 0 1 mm under activation by sw cip and fe2 are presented in fig 3 a where the normalised og concentration cog t cog 0 is plotted against the reaction time t cog t represents the og concentration at a given time and cog 0 concentration at time 0 relative to the zvi samples the fe2 resulted in an early rapid degradation of og but the rate quickly declined suggesting exhaustion of reactive species with limited pollutant removal this is a characteristic shortcoming in the use of fe2 for ps activation 2 the observed early rapid degradation of og achieved by fe2 is a consequence of the dissolved nature of the ion infinite reacting surface compared to the limited surface area of the zvi the rapid reaction of dissolved fe2 is implicated for the exhaustion of the oxidant with limited pollutant degradation 2 since the standard reduction potential eo for the fe3 fe2 couple is 0 771 v 39 while the eo for the fe2 fe couple is 0 44 v 39 the electrochemical potential gradient δeo driving the redox reactions between ps and the iron species may be expressed as r1 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 2 s o 4 2 s o 4 δ e o 1 23 v r2 f e o 4 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 2 s o 4 2 2 s o 4 δ e o 2 44 v the expressions show that the δeo for the oxidation of zvi is almost double the driving force for the oxidation of fe2 the larger electrochemical driving force for zvi activation of ps compared to fe2 implies a more exothermic reaction for zvi activation which may amount to more energetic radicals that is radicals with more residual kinetic energy for pollutant degradation 1 furthermore since r2 results in the production of fe2 that can activate ps there are two distinct ps activators when zvi is used fe and fe2 but only one activator when fe2 is used consequently zvi activation of ps is a more effective route for pollutant degradation the degradation trends in fig 3a may be described by a pseudo first order reaction model as expressed in eq 2 2 l n c o g t c o g 0 k o b s t where kobs is the observed pseudo first order reaction constant min 1 and t is the reaction time in minutes the kobs for sw cip and fe2 activated ps degradation of og were 0 117 min 1 r2 0 9934 0 121 min 1 r2 0 9918 and 0 089 min 1 r2 0 7402 respectively the relatively poor r2 for fe2 suggests that the early burst in activation and subsequent exhaustion did not fit very well an exponential decline however the exponential model was maintained to facilitate comparison to the other activators the similarity in kobs for cip and sw suggests similar chemical behavior despite their different physical forms and surface features rodriguez et al 12 showed that og was not completely degraded after 100 min for an experiment with 0 1 mm og cps 0 1 mm and zvi activation while almost complete degradation was achieved in this study under 10 min although 1 mm zvi was used in the study by rodriguez et al 12 versus the 1 8 mm used in this study the difference cannot explain the dissimilarity in the degradation times particle size difference appears to be a better explanation 1 since the average particle size of the zvi used by rodriguez et al 12 was 740 μm which is 500 times larger than the computed average particle size 1 4 μm of the cip zvi used in this study in a recent study by ike et al 40 of ps degradation of og under the same condition as reported in this study but using as ps activators three nzvi samples with different phosphonic acid stabilisation the reported kobs for og degradation were 0 44 min 1 0 36 min 1 and 0 06 min 1 hence the commercial zvi used in this study with kobs of 0 12 min 1 outperformed one of the nzvi samples the three nzvi synthesised by ike et al 40 showed significant surface oxidation although the phosphonic acid stabilisation was said to prevent outright passivation in contrast to the complete passivation of the unstabilised nzvi reported by li et al 3 which required prior acid washing to be able to activate ps from the foregoing it is evident that zvi with average diameter of particles in the size range 0 1 μm d 100 μm as were sw and cip in this study or available as iron filings generated as by products of iron processing and finishing can provide for effective and fast ps activation without the need of surface stabilisation or pretreatment the hplc chromatograms for sw activated ps degradation of og is given in fig 3b f the chromatogram for cip is similar to those of sw and is given in figure s 2 which corroborates the assertion that the behavior of sw and cip in activating ps is similar at least for short term experiments tentative assignments of the degradation products have been provided based on the retention times of known chemicals under the same chromatographic conditions as the degraded pollutant solution as presented in table s 1 the general trend of the retention times reveals short retention times for more oxidised chemicals relatively hydrophilic and longer retention times for more reduced chemicals relatively hydrophobic from fig 3b for cps 0 1 mm under zvi activation the degradation products identified as a naphthalene derivative nd phenol hydroquinone and low molecular weight acids lmwa persisted after 60 min when cps 0 2 mm the nd peak disappeared but the phenol and hydroquinone peaks alongside the lmwa peak remained cps 0 5 mm saw the disappearance of all degradation peaks at the end of 60 min except the lmwa peak however for cps 0 10 mm a naphthol peak persisted after 60 min indicating that cps 0 5 mm is optimised for the degradation of og under the conditions of this study hence using suboptimal or above optimal concentration of ps will result not only in a low rate of pollutant degradation or a high consumption of the oxidant respectively but may also result in the persistence of aromatic degradation products from the chromatographic results the og 1 degradation refer to fig 4 for numbering possibly progressed by a rapid radical attack on the azo bond 13 resulting in the formation of n2 due to the very favourable energy change 41 and the formation of a one ring 2 and two rings 3 aromatic radical species 12 further radical attacks transformed the radical species through hydroquinone 6 to lmwa 8 which was subsequently mineralised to co2 and h2o 9 for cps 0 5 mm the radical species 2 and 3 were readily transformed to lmwa so that the latter was the only identified degradation products when so4 was limited the formation of stable phenol 4 hydroquinone 6 and nd 5 resulted from the probable interaction of 2 and 3 with water for cps 0 10 mm the relatively large concentration of the oxidant might have resulted in a rapid oxidation of the zvi producing a large amount of fe2 in a short time which in turn scavenged so4 resulting in a limited transformation of the organic pollutant and the persistence of naphthol the dad generated spectra shown in figure s 3 when compared with the spectra for known chemicals shown in figure s 4 indicate that the lmwa is more likely fumaric acid with the possibility of the presence of oxalic and or maleic acid the effect of the presence of meoh on the degradation of og for a ps fe og meoh molar ratio of 5 1 8 0 1 25 is presented in fig 5 a the kobs for og degradation by cps 0 5 mm activated by sw was 1 428 min 1 r2 0 9832 but in the presence of meoh the kobs was 0 631 min 1 r2 0 9891 indicating a 56 reduction when fe2 was used for ps activation in the presence of meoh kobs was only 0 020 min 1 r2 0 6612 which amounts to 99 reduction in degradation rates with respect to sw activation in the absence of meoh as expected meoh slowed the rate of degradation of og but the effect was more drastic when fe2 was used as ps activator once again this shows that zvi is a better ps activator than fe2 fig 5b and c are chromatograms of og degradation in the presence of meoh compared to fig 3 the presence of meoh did not appear to have influenced the nature of the degradation products at the end of 60 min while only lmwa is identifiable for sw activation for fe2 activation two other degradation peaks persisted in addition to undecomposed og for cps 0 5 mm the kobs for og degradation in the presence of an excess of buoh fig 5d was 0 0855 min 1 r2 0 9414 while in the presence of an excess of proh it was 0 004 min 1 r2 0 8407 og degradation rate in the presence of buoh is therefore 21 times the rate in the presence of proh since so4 reaction with buoh is limited compared to its reaction with α hydrogen containing alcohol such as proh it may be said that the principal oxidising radical for og degradation in this study was so4 30 the effect of the mode of ps addition to zvi activated reactions was studied by recording the tc reduction achieved in 60 min for 5 mm ps added at once or gradually to 1 8 mm sw the first mode hereafter referred to as e1 was the addition of the 5 mm ps all at once to start the radical reaction the second mode e2 involves the addition of 1 mm ps every 10 min for five times the third mode involves the addition of 2 mm ps to start the reaction another 2 mm ps after the first 10 min and an additional 1 mm ps at the end of 20 min a fourth experiment e4 was performed in which 50 mm ps was added suddenly to start the reaction the mineralisation achieved at the end of 60 min is shown in fig 5e having established above that sw is equivalent to cip and superior to fe2 in the activation of ps to degrade og to keep the content of the manuscript within reasonable bounds only sw was used in subsequent experiments the greatest mineralisation observed was for e4 due to its higher cps 0 however although the cps 0 for e4 is 10 times the value used in e1 the tc reduction for the latter is only slightly more than two times the tc reduction in e1 showing that mere increase in the ps concentration does not lead to proportionally higher mineralisation the tc reduction for e2 and e3 are slightly higher than for e1 although the same overall amount of ps was added the slightly poorer mineralisation achieved by e1 compared to e2 and e3 may be linked to a more radical scavenging effect due to the possible profusion of radicals following the sudden addition of 5 mm ps in the case of e1 however it was also noticed that the appearances of the solutions were very different e2 was particularly cloudy while e1 and e4 were clear solutions the syringe filter used to filter e2 was significantly coloured yellow see fig s 5 suggesting the formation of insoluble fe3 species while the e1 filter was uncoloured since e1 was relatively clear but with a ph value close those of e2 and e3 which were both relatively cloudy and different from that of e4 which was clear it follows that ph does not explain the precipitate formation observed consequently the mode of ps addition significantly influenced oxidised iron speciation a possible explanation for the difference in iron speciation may be advanced as follows the addition of 1 mm ps gradually oxidised some zvi to fe2 producing some so4 leading to the gradual degradation of og in addition to so4 oxidation of fe2 fe2 may be oxidised by dissolved o2 to low solubility fe3 species to give a cloudy solution 42 43 on the other hand an addition of a relatively large amount of ps results in the rapid consumption of zvi as well as og degradation in a short time producing intermediates with more complexing ability than og which prevents ionic iron precipitation 44 the differences in iron speciation arising from the mode of ps addition might be useful in controlling the amount of dissolved iron in the treated water the gradual addition of fe2 for the soluble iron activation of ps has been shown to improve pollutant degradation compared to a sudden fe2 addition 45 it appears interesting to evaluate the effect of gradual ps addition e2 compared to a sudden addition e1 3 3 degradation of salicylic acid the degradation of sa was investigated considering e1 and e2 modes of ps addition as shown in fig 6 a the chromatograms for e1 and e2 degradation of sa is given in figs 6b and c respectively showing complete degradation of sa for e1 mode with lmwa being the sole degradation product at 60 min for e2 mode sa degradation was incomplete at 60 min and a small hydroquinone peak could be identified the kobs for e1 was 0 228 min 1 r2 0 9955 and that for e2 was only 0 0231 min 1 r2 0 9964 as shown in fig 6g e1 achieved 40 mineralisation of sa while 37 mineralisation resulted from e2 the results indicate that for a degradation period of 60 min under the conditions of this study the sudden addition of ps is more effective for the degradation of sa than gradual addition however the leftover ps was 34 for e1 but it was 50 for e2 hence there is more possibility for further pollutant degradation by e2 if the experimental time were lengthened in the presence of 25 mm meoh the kobs for e1 mode of sa degradation was 0 048 min 1 r2 0 8671 which represents a 79 reduction with respect to the e1 mode of sa degradation in the absence of meoh the chromatogram in fig 6d shows that no change in the degradation products resulted from the presence of meoh only that the transformation to lmwa was slower due to radical consumption by meoh in the presence of 2000 mm proh practically no degradation of sa was observed over 60 min but with 2100 mm buoh a slight sa degradation of about 20 was observed in the course of 60 min the results can be interpreted to mean that the major oxidising radical for sa degradation like og degradation was so4 however it is evident that sa degradation in the presence of proh and buoh was much poorer compared to og degradation the results reflect the relative ease with which an oxidising radical can successfully attack the electron rich azo bond in og compared to a successful attack on the resonance stabilised benzene ring although og contains three benzene rings compared to the one benzene ring of sa in the presence of meoh the benzene rings in og were completely converted to lmwa within 60 min fig 5b in contrast for sa degradation in the presence of meoh benzene rings as sa and hydroquinone persisted after 60 min the results can be explained as follows the comparatively fast oxidation of the azo bond in og resulted in the relatively fast production of aromatic radical species as shown in fig 4 these aromatic radicals were expectedly more reactive than a regular benzene ring 41 and were therefore readily transformed to lmwa hence the azo bond is a weak link for an oxidative attack on og such a point of weakness is absent in sa requiring an attack on the resonance stabilised ring structure to begin the oxidative transformation to lmwa the degradation of sa is summarised in fig 7 showing the transformation to hydroquinone 2 and then to lmwa 3 before mineralisation the results of the study of the effect of phosphate stabilised ph on sw activation of ps for the degradation of sa is given in fig 6f scarcely any degradation was achieved within 60 min at the neutral and basic conditions kobs 6 51 10 4 min 1 r2 0 8595 and 5 24 10 4 min 1 r2 0 8830 respectively while 92 degradation was achieved at the acidic ph of 2 with a kobs of 0 015 min 1 r2 0 9826 the results indicate that sw activation of ps under neutral and basic conditions is practically negligible however when the results of the acidic ph degradation of sa is compared to a similar degradation experiment in the absence of the phosphate buffer it is seen that the rate of sa degradation decreased by 93 due to the radical scavenging effect of phosphate phosphate iron complex formation and phosphate passivation of sw surfaces 5 46 consequently the phosphate buffer may also have contributed to the poor degradation observed at the neutral and alkaline conditions as well regarding phosphate radical scavenging effect it has been reported that the rate of reaction of so4 with the phosphate ion depends on the degree of phosphate ion protonation as follows 5 47 r3 s o 4 hp o 4 2 s o 4 2 hp o 4 k 1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 r4 s o 4 h 2 p o 4 s o 4 2 hp o 4 h k 7 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 the pka1 pka2 and pka3 of the phosphate ion were computed as 1 80 6 95 and 12 90 respectively www chemicalize com from these data it may be surmised that at a neutral ph one half of the phosphate ion exist as hpo4 2 i e 5 mm of the phosphate ion exist in the more reactive form with k 1 2 106 m 1s 1 which is only one order of magnitude less reactive than methanol k 2 5 107 m 1s 1 48 at a ph of 11 most of the phosphate ions exist in the more reactive form under these conditions significant radical scavenging may result from the presence of the phosphate buffer which may account at least partly for the poor sa degradation observed at a ph of 2 the greater proportion of phosphate ions exist in the protonated and less reactive form of h2po4 however since a substantial retardation of the pollutant degradation 93 was still observed under the acidic condition it appears that the complexation and passivation effect of phosphate were probably more important than the scavenging effect 3 4 degradation of 1 naphthylamine and phenol the degradation of ph and 1na in the presence of 25 mm meoh is presented in fig 8 compared to sa degradation in the presence of meoh which was only 60 after 60 min significantly more ph degradation of 90 was achieved at the end of 60 min for both e1 and e2 modes of ps addition the relative resistance of sa to oxidation compared to ph can be attributed to the presence of the carbonyl group in the former but not in the latter 49 the resonance electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group in sa deactivates the molecule towards electrophilic oxidation by so4 49 although the e2 degradation of ph was slower at the earlier part of the experiment fig 8a it attained the same degradation at the end of the experiment as e1 and the chromatograms for the two degradations fig 8b and 8c are similar in both fig 8b and c it is observed that degradation products with much longer retention times than ph developed the observations suggest the possible combination of radicals derived from ph and possibly from meoh to generate more hydrophobic degradation products 41 50 to determine whether meoh participated in the generation of the possibly more hydrophobic degradation products ph degradation was repeated in the absence of meoh and the chromatogram presented as fig 8d degradation peaks greater than ph could still be seen which can be taken as a confirmation that meoh was not responsible for the higher retention time degradation products from the trends shown in fig 8d for the degradation of 1na both e1 and e2 attained a relatively fast degradation of the pollutant in the presence of meoh compared to the degradation of the other pollutants studied in this work the rapid degradation of 1na points to the strongly electron donating effect of nh2 attached to fused benzene rings due to resonance 49 combined with the strongly electron abstracting property of so4 47 the apparent general rule therefore is that pollutants that are readily oxidised by so4 such as 1na are preferentially degraded over meoh while for pollutants resistant to oxidation such as sa meoh is preferentially oxidised this generalisation should be taken into account when considering radical oxidation of industrial pollutants in wastewater as far as is known to the authors of this paper the interestingly rapid oxidation of 1na by activated ps under a radical scavenging condition has not been previously reported despite the significant challenge posed by the widespread use of 1na as industrial intermediate and its designation as a priority contaminant 21 the limited number of previous studies on the treatment of wastewater contaminated with 1na have focused on adsorption 20 21 and electrochemical oxidation 19 the chromatograms for e1 and e2 degradation of 1na as presented in fig 8f and 8 g respectively are largely similar however a short lived peak at higher retention time was observed for e2 due to the limited identification of the peaks in the chromatograms of ph and 1na degradation fig 8 using table s 1 further study is required to develop a degradation pathway for the pollutants the degree of mineralisation and the remaining ps at the end of 60 min for ph and 1na degradation in the presence of 25 meoh is presented in fig 9 fig 9a shows that the mineralisation obtained from the e2 mode of degradation of both ph and 1na were greater than the mineralisation achieved by e1 hence except for sa degradation e2 mode appears to achieve more effective mineralisation than e1 this can readily be interpreted to imply that the sudden addition of ps under the e1 mode resulted in ps sw mutual exhaustion the much higher concentrations of ps remaining after 60 min for the e2 mode of addition of ps compared to the e1 fig 9b clearly support this proposal 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that commercial zvi is an effective activator of ps for the degradation of four important environmental pollutants namely og sa ph and in the presence or absence of an alcohol radical scavenger meoh 1na one of the pollutants studied is a top priority contaminants which as far as is known by the authors has not been the subject of any previous advanced oxidation degradation study yet as established in this study is uniquely amenable to activated ps degradation the addition of meoh mimics the presence of industrial solvents and or feedstuff in real industrial wastewater which may influence the degradation of target environmental pollutants the results from this study indicate that the presence of meoh had no effect on the nature of the degradation products generated from ps oxidation but the degradation rates of the target pollutants were reduced that meoh had no effect on the nature of the degradation products is suggestive of the limited contribution of radical combination 41 51 to the process further study will be required to establish this conclusion and its theoretical basis as well as the generality of the phenomenon with respect to other industrial solvents and feedstock common in wastewater the alcohol had a more retarding effect on the degradation of the pollutant sa which is relatively resistant to radical oxidation due to the presence of an electron withdrawing group on its benzene ring compared to a pollutant such as 1na that has an electron donating group the azo bond in og was found to be a structural point of weakness leading to a comparatively more effective degradation of the aromatic moieties the apparent general rule is that pollutants that are readily oxidised by so4 were preferentially degraded over meoh while for pollutants resistant to oxidation meoh was preferentially oxidised this rule is applicable in the evaluation of whether a particular industrial wastewater is suitable for advanced oxidation treatment when it is desirable to achieve the elimination of certain contaminants the activation of ps by the commercial zvi samples studied in this work was found to be more effective in the degradation of pollutants compared to ps activation by fe2 in addition the zvi materials required no prior acid washing to remove oxidised surface layer that develops on nzvi nor any other form of pretreatment hence the results open up the possibility for the direct use of waste iron filings generated as by products of iron processing and finishing for ps activation it was demonstrated that the gradual addition of ps compared to a sudden addition always consumed less ps and provided for more effective mineralisation of pollutants except sa due to its greater resistance to oxidation and therefore required longer reaction time with direct relevance to the industrial application of ps advanced oxidation treatment of wastewater the study for the first time also provides the following demonstrations 1 as an activator of ps zvi is optimised at a size range of 0 1 μm d 100 μm 2 poor ps concentration optimisation not only increases the consumption of the oxidant or the time of treatment but also results in the persistence of undesirable aromatic degradation by products 3 fe2 is not only less effective than zvi in activating ps it is also more significantly retarded in its activity by meoh that may abound in industrial wastewater 4 for a zvi activated ps process the mode of ps addition can be used to control the stability and therefore the concentration of dissolved iron conflict of interest none acknowledgement the financial support provided by victoria university to ikechukwu a ike through the victoria university international

14511,commercial zerovalent iron zvi as steel wool and carbonyl iron powder activation of persulphate ps has been demonstrated to be effective in the degradation of four important water pollutants namely orange g og salicylic acid sa phenol ph and 1 naphthylamine 1na in the presence or absence of methanol meoh the addition of meoh mimics the presence of industrial solvents and or feedstuff in real industrial wastewater the alcohol had a more retarding effect on the degradation of an aromatic pollutant relatively resistant to oxidation such as sa due to the presence of an electron withdrawing group compared to a pollutant such as 1na that has an electron donating group the azo bond in og constituted a structural weakness leading to a comparatively more effective degradation of the aromatic moieties fe2 was not only less effective than the commercial zvi in activating ps it was also more significantly retarded in its activity by meoh in addition the surfaces of the zvi were not oxidised an advantage over zvi nanoparticles and they required no prior pretreatment indicating the probable suitability of waste iron filings for ps activation as an activator of ps zvi is optimised at a size range of 0 1 μm d 100 μm it was also demonstrated that the poor optimisation of ps concentration not only increases oxidant consumption or treatment time but also results in the persistence of undesirable aromatic degradation by products these results are important for the development of low cost and effective industrial wastewater treatment schemes keywords steel wool carbonyl iron powder persulfate azo dye salicylic acid 1 introduction the activation of persulphate ps by iron in its three common oxidation states has been the focus of numerous scientific investigations over the last two decades 1 scavenging or depletion of ps a short lived activation requiring repeated resupply and introduction of an additional anion are some of the challenges inherent in the use of ionic iron for ps activation 2 3 however the use of zerovalent iron zvi has been shown to overcome these challenges for efficient ps activation for the purpose of degrading a range of pollutants such as dibutyl phthalate 4 bentazon 5 p chloroaniline 6 acetaminophen 7 and acid orange 7 3 zvi materials as nanoparticles nzvi are more reactive than larger particles due to their higher surface area and the greater proportion of surface atoms 8 9 however the problem of passivation due to surface oxidation upon exposure to air increases as particle size decreases 8 for example li et al 3 reported that an analytical grade of nzvi showed no measurable reaction with ps without acid washing suggesting significant oxide passivation particle aggregation with attendant reduction in reactivity is another common problem implicit in the use of nzvi for pollutant degradation 8 10 11 consequently size optimisation is critical for industrial application of zvi activation of ps with the aim being that the particles are small enough to ensure rapid ps activation but large enough to minimise or eliminate surface passivation another important disadvantage of nzvi activation of ps relative to bulk zvi is the high cost of the nanoparticles 8 to advance the implementation of zvi activation of ps for industrial pollutant degradation the performances of two zvi materials that are low cost commercially available and with a size at least in one dimension 100 μm for rapid ps activation 3 12 and 1 μm to eliminate surface oxidation 8 have been evaluated one of the zvi materials evaluated is industrial grade carbonyl iron powder cip and the other is domestic grade steel wool sw the ultimate purpose was to promote the use of iron filings which are widely available as by products of iron processing and finishing for environmental remediation applications to highlight the practicality of zvi ps treatment of wastewater the degradation of a number of pollutants were evaluated namely orange g og salicylic acid sa phenol ph and 1 naphthylamine 1na the well studied og as a typical azo dye 12 14 was chosen to facilitate comparison to previous publications and because azo dyes constitute between 60 70 of global production of synthetic dyes 13 15 with about 20 lost to effluent in the textile industry amounting to substantial water pollution 15 16 sa is one of the first pharmaceuticals to be detected in sewage effluent 17 due to its widespread use as an important pharmaceutical either directly or in its acylated form as acetylsalicylic acid aspirin sa is ubiquitous in the environment including drinking water and is considered an eco risk and a contaminant of emerging concern 17 18 although 1na is described as a top priority potentially carcinogenic pollutant which is widely used as an industrial chemical intermediate and discharged from several industrial processes 19 21 studies of its degradation by chemical oxidants are rare ph and its derivatives find important use in many chemical processes and are therefore ubiquitous at toxic concentrations in wastewater effluent 22 23 a number of researchers have reported on how coexisting inorganic ions and organic materials usually natural organic matter nom influence the degradation of environmental pollutants 13 24 25 however for industrial wastewater nom may be less important compared to industrial organic solvents and feedstuffs 26 since wastewater from industries and hospitals are known to be major contributors to environmental contamination 17 26 27 it is important that degradation studies should analyse the effect of commonly used industrial solvents and feedstuff on the degradation of target pollutants alcohols such as methanol meoh are widely used industrial solvents and feedstuffs and have been identified in industrial wastewater 26 28 29 although meoh and other alcohols are commonly used in the laboratory as radical scavengers and reactions quenchers 30 the systematic investigation of their effects on the radical degradation of target pollutants are uncommon while it may be expected that the presence of meoh like nom 24 25 may reduce the degradation of the target pollutant it is not known if meoh will influence the nature of the degradation products or whether different pollutants will be differently affected this study includes an evaluation of the effect of meoh on the degradation of the aforementioned target pollutants the study is considered a first step towards understanding the complex matrix effect of real industrial wastewater samples 2 experimental procedures 2 1 materials cip of the cep om company s tag grade 98 fe 0 9 c from basf germany and sw of the finest 0000 company s tag grade from sifa pty ltd australia

micrometrics tristar surface area and porosity analyser with tristar 3000 version 6 04 analysis software optical images of the zvi samples were taken using motic ba310 advanced upright microscope with motic live imaging module batch degradation experiments were conducted at 24 c for a fixed zvi concentration of 0 1 g l 1 8 mm with or without a background meoh of 25 mm to determine the effect of meoh on the target pollutant degradation experiments with og 0 1 mm were conducted at varying initial ps concentration cps 0 of 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm to determine the effect of ps concentration on the effectiveness of the target pollutant degradation to determine the effect of ph on ps activation by zvi degradation experiments with sa 0 1 mm were conducted with and without ph modification 10 mm phosphate buffer composed of 5 mm of nah2po4 and 5 mm of na2hpo4 was used to stabilise the reaction ph for ph modified reactions 24 experiments with 1na and ph 0 2 mm were conducted in the presence of background meoh 25 mm except where otherwise stated proh 2000 mm and buoh 2100 mm 30 were used as radical scavengers in evaluating pollutant degradation mechanism at designated intervals during the degradation experiments 1 ml samples of the reacting suspensions were withdrawn using a syringe and filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter into 0 5 ml meoh to quench the reactions 7 the concentrations of ps in solution were determined by the iodometric method 31 the rates of og degradation were measured spectrophotometrically at the azo bond characteristic absorption wavelength of 478 nm 13 using biochrom libra s22 uv visible spectrophotometer high performance liquid chromatography hplc study of og sa 1na and ph degradations were conducted using a shimadzu prominence i lc 2030c liquid chromatograph with uv detector at 280 nm the column used was kinetex c18 5μ 100 å size 100 4 6 mm maintained at 25 c and preceded by a column guard binary solvent linear gradient flow at 0 8 ml min was employed in which the concentration of solvent a meoh was increased from 30 to 90 in 10 min maintained at 90 for 2 50 min and then rapidly decreased to 30 in 0 30 min at this composition a 30 the column was equilibrated for 7 30 min solvent b was 50 mm ammonium phosphate at a ph of 6 8 further peak analysis was conducted with a shimadzu lc 20at liquid chromatograph equipped with diode array detector dad under lc conditions already described an exception was the column temperature which was ambient in the dad analysis total carbon tc was determined using shimadzu toc vcshtotal organic carbon analyzer samples for tc analysis were filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter and quenched in an ice bath 32 with tc analyses typically conducted and completed few hours after samples collection no attempt was made in this study to determine the generation and transformation of fe2 in the course of the commercial zvi activation of ps as one of the primary aims was to compare the activation performance of the zvi materials and fe2 rather than develop a mechanism of the activation future studies that explore the mechanisms of zvi activation of ps will need determine the profile of oxidised iron evolution from the zvi materials 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterisation of zvi samples the xrd patterns for the two zvi samples are presented in fig 1 a showing peaks for iron indexed to iccdd 6 696 the shift in peak position for sw is believed to be due to inadequate height positioning arising from the woollen nature of the sample the absence of any detectable oxidised iron peak shows that the iron samples are stable in air and are consequently unpassivated unlike nzvi 3 8 the ftir spectra of the samples are shown in fig 1b unlike the xrd patterns which reveal the long range order of atoms or overall crystalline properties of the samples the ftir spectra highlight short range order structures and therefore could better identify features restricted to the material surface 33 35 important differences in surface properties are evident for the sw and cip spectra the sw spectra show peaks that are assignable to c h from alkane 36 which is indicative of surface coating probably by hydrocarbon no such organic peaks were developed in the cip spectra suggestive of cleaner surfaces however peaks that are assignable to iron carbonyls are developed in cip but not in sw which clearly confirm the carbonyl nature of the former but not the latter the absorbance in fig 1a is significantly low which is suggestive of low concentration of non iron components consistent with the cip specifications provided earlier the isotherm plot for sw and cip are shown in figure s 1 supplementary material the isotherm for cip can be described as a regular type ii isotherm for a non porous or macroporous adsorbent whose surface area can be described by bet 37 the measured bet surface area s for cip was 0 54 m2 g using 7 86 g cm3 as the density of iron ρ and the expression given in eq 1 38 the average diameter d of the cip particles is calculated as 1 4 μm unfortunately the isotherm plot for sw is irregular as shown in fig s 1 and thus the obtained bet value is not valid 1 d 6000 s ρ the optical images of the samples are shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows that the cip sample is composed of spherical particles with some degree of particle aggregation the cip particles as observed in the optical image as computed by bet and as specified by the supplier of the particles are 10 μm the sw material is made up of sparsely arranged cylindrical fibres the diameters of the fibres are 30 μm in addition fibres generally have surface chippings or irregularities which may be linked to the manufacturing process the projections or unevenness of the surface may contribute towards enhancing the chemical reactivity of the zvi fibres as it provides a comparatively higher surface area to volume with respect to the overall fibre size 8 3 2 degradation of orange g the results of the og batch degradation experiments for cps 0 1 mm under activation by sw cip and fe2 are presented in fig 3 a where the normalised og concentration cog t cog 0 is plotted against the reaction time t cog t represents the og concentration at a given time and cog 0 concentration at time 0 relative to the zvi samples the fe2 resulted in an early rapid degradation of og but the rate quickly declined suggesting exhaustion of reactive species with limited pollutant removal this is a characteristic shortcoming in the use of fe2 for ps activation 2 the observed early rapid degradation of og achieved by fe2 is a consequence of the dissolved nature of the ion infinite reacting surface compared to the limited surface area of the zvi the rapid reaction of dissolved fe2 is implicated for the exhaustion of the oxidant with limited pollutant degradation 2 since the standard reduction potential eo for the fe3 fe2 couple is 0 771 v 39 while the eo for the fe2 fe couple is 0 44 v 39 the electrochemical potential gradient δeo driving the redox reactions between ps and the iron species may be expressed as r1 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 2 s o 4 2 s o 4 δ e o 1 23 v r2 f e o 4 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 2 s o 4 2 2 s o 4 δ e o 2 44 v the expressions show that the δeo for the oxidation of zvi is almost double the driving force for the oxidation of fe2 the larger electrochemical driving force for zvi activation of ps compared to fe2 implies a more exothermic reaction for zvi activation which may amount to more energetic radicals that is radicals with more residual kinetic energy for pollutant degradation 1 furthermore since r2 results in the production of fe2 that can activate ps there are two distinct ps activators when zvi is used fe and fe2 but only one activator when fe2 is used consequently zvi activation of ps is a more effective route for pollutant degradation the degradation trends in fig 3a may be described by a pseudo first order reaction model as expressed in eq 2 2 l n c o g t c o g 0 k o b s t where kobs is the observed pseudo first order reaction constant min 1 and t is the reaction time in minutes the kobs for sw cip and fe2 activated ps degradation of og were 0 117 min 1 r2 0 9934 0 121 min 1 r2 0 9918 and 0 089 min 1 r2 0 7402 respectively the relatively poor r2 for fe2 suggests that the early burst in activation and subsequent exhaustion did not fit very well an exponential decline however the exponential model was maintained to facilitate comparison to the other activators the similarity in kobs for cip and sw suggests similar chemical behavior despite their different physical forms and surface features rodriguez et al 12 showed that og was not completely degraded after 100 min for an experiment with 0 1 mm og cps 0 1 mm and zvi activation while almost complete degradation was achieved in this study under 10 min although 1 mm zvi was used in the study by rodriguez et al 12 versus the 1 8 mm used in this study the difference cannot explain the dissimilarity in the degradation times particle size difference appears to be a better explanation 1 since the average particle size of the zvi used by rodriguez et al 12 was 740 μm which is 500 times larger than the computed average particle size 1 4 μm of the cip zvi used in this study in a recent study by ike et al 40 of ps degradation of og under the same condition as reported in this study but using as ps activators three nzvi samples with different phosphonic acid stabilisation the reported kobs for og degradation were 0 44 min 1 0 36 min 1 and 0 06 min 1 hence the commercial zvi used in this study with kobs of 0 12 min 1 outperformed one of the nzvi samples the three nzvi synthesised by ike et al 40 showed significant surface oxidation although the phosphonic acid stabilisation was said to prevent outright passivation in contrast to the complete passivation of the unstabilised nzvi reported by li et al 3 which required prior acid washing to be able to activate ps from the foregoing it is evident that zvi with average diameter of particles in the size range 0 1 μm d 100 μm as were sw and cip in this study or available as iron filings generated as by products of iron processing and finishing can provide for effective and fast ps activation without the need of surface stabilisation or pretreatment the hplc chromatograms for sw activated ps degradation of og is given in fig 3b f the chromatogram for cip is similar to those of sw and is given in figure s 2 which corroborates the assertion that the behavior of sw and cip in activating ps is similar at least for short term experiments tentative assignments of the degradation products have been provided based on the retention times of known chemicals under the same chromatographic conditions as the degraded pollutant solution as presented in table s 1 the general trend of the retention times reveals short retention times for more oxidised chemicals relatively hydrophilic and longer retention times for more reduced chemicals relatively hydrophobic from fig 3b for cps 0 1 mm under zvi activation the degradation products identified as a naphthalene derivative nd phenol hydroquinone and low molecular weight acids lmwa persisted after 60 min when cps 0 2 mm the nd peak disappeared but the phenol and hydroquinone peaks alongside the lmwa peak remained cps 0 5 mm saw the disappearance of all degradation peaks at the end of 60 min except the lmwa peak however for cps 0 10 mm a naphthol peak persisted after 60 min indicating that cps 0 5 mm is optimised for the degradation of og under the conditions of this study hence using suboptimal or above optimal concentration of ps will result not only in a low rate of pollutant degradation or a high consumption of the oxidant respectively but may also result in the persistence of aromatic degradation products from the chromatographic results the og 1 degradation refer to fig 4 for numbering possibly progressed by a rapid radical attack on the azo bond 13 resulting in the formation of n2 due to the very favourable energy change 41 and the formation of a one ring 2 and two rings 3 aromatic radical species 12 further radical attacks transformed the radical species through hydroquinone 6 to lmwa 8 which was subsequently mineralised to co2 and h2o 9 for cps 0 5 mm the radical species 2 and 3 were readily transformed to lmwa so that the latter was the only identified degradation products when so4 was limited the formation of stable phenol 4 hydroquinone 6 and nd 5 resulted from the probable interaction of 2 and 3 with water for cps 0 10 mm the relatively large concentration of the oxidant might have resulted in a rapid oxidation of the zvi producing a large amount of fe2 in a short time which in turn scavenged so4 resulting in a limited transformation of the organic pollutant and the persistence of naphthol the dad generated spectra shown in figure s 3 when compared with the spectra for known chemicals shown in figure s 4 indicate that the lmwa is more likely fumaric acid with the possibility of the presence of oxalic and or maleic acid the effect of the presence of meoh on the degradation of og for a ps fe og meoh molar ratio of 5 1 8 0 1 25 is presented in fig 5 a the kobs for og degradation by cps 0 5 mm activated by sw was 1 428 min 1 r2 0 9832 but in the presence of meoh the kobs was 0 631 min 1 r2 0 9891 indicating a 56 reduction when fe2 was used for ps activation in the presence of meoh kobs was only 0 020 min 1 r2 0 6612 which amounts to 99 reduction in degradation rates with respect to sw activation in the absence of meoh as expected meoh slowed the rate of degradation of og but the effect was more drastic when fe2 was used as ps activator once again this shows that zvi is a better ps activator than fe2 fig 5b and c are chromatograms of og degradation in the presence of meoh compared to fig 3 the presence of meoh did not appear to have influenced the nature of the degradation products at the end of 60 min while only lmwa is identifiable for sw activation for fe2 activation two other degradation peaks persisted in addition to undecomposed og for cps 0 5 mm the kobs for og degradation in the presence of an excess of buoh fig 5d was 0 0855 min 1 r2 0 9414 while in the presence of an excess of proh it was 0 004 min 1 r2 0 8407 og degradation rate in the presence of buoh is therefore 21 times the rate in the presence of proh since so4 reaction with buoh is limited compared to its reaction with α hydrogen containing alcohol such as proh it may be said that the principal oxidising radical for og degradation in this study was so4 30 the effect of the mode of ps addition to zvi activated reactions was studied by recording the tc reduction achieved in 60 min for 5 mm ps added at once or gradually to 1 8 mm sw the first mode hereafter referred to as e1 was the addition of the 5 mm ps all at once to start the radical reaction the second mode e2 involves the addition of 1 mm ps every 10 min for five times the third mode involves the addition of 2 mm ps to start the reaction another 2 mm ps after the first 10 min and an additional 1 mm ps at the end of 20 min a fourth experiment e4 was performed in which 50 mm ps was added suddenly to start the reaction the mineralisation achieved at the end of 60 min is shown in fig 5e having established above that sw is equivalent to cip and superior to fe2 in the activation of ps to degrade og to keep the content of the manuscript within reasonable bounds only sw was used in subsequent experiments the greatest mineralisation observed was for e4 due to its higher cps 0 however although the cps 0 for e4 is 10 times the value used in e1 the tc reduction for the latter is only slightly more than two times the tc reduction in e1 showing that mere increase in the ps concentration does not lead to proportionally higher mineralisation the tc reduction for e2 and e3 are slightly higher than for e1 although the same overall amount of ps was added the slightly poorer mineralisation achieved by e1 compared to e2 and e3 may be linked to a more radical scavenging effect due to the possible profusion of radicals following the sudden addition of 5 mm ps in the case of e1 however it was also noticed that the appearances of the solutions were very different e2 was particularly cloudy while e1 and e4 were clear solutions the syringe filter used to filter e2 was significantly coloured yellow see fig s 5 suggesting the formation of insoluble fe3 species while the e1 filter was uncoloured since e1 was relatively clear but with a ph value close those of e2 and e3 which were both relatively cloudy and different from that of e4 which was clear it follows that ph does not explain the precipitate formation observed consequently the mode of ps addition significantly influenced oxidised iron speciation a possible explanation for the difference in iron speciation may be advanced as follows the addition of 1 mm ps gradually oxidised some zvi to fe2 producing some so4 leading to the gradual degradation of og in addition to so4 oxidation of fe2 fe2 may be oxidised by dissolved o2 to low solubility fe3 species to give a cloudy solution 42 43 on the other hand an addition of a relatively large amount of ps results in the rapid consumption of zvi as well as og degradation in a short time producing intermediates with more complexing ability than og which prevents ionic iron precipitation 44 the differences in iron speciation arising from the mode of ps addition might be useful in controlling the amount of dissolved iron in the treated water the gradual addition of fe2 for the soluble iron activation of ps has been shown to improve pollutant degradation compared to a sudden fe2 addition 45 it appears interesting to evaluate the effect of gradual ps addition e2 compared to a sudden addition e1 3 3 degradation of salicylic acid the degradation of sa was investigated considering e1 and e2 modes of ps addition as shown in fig 6 a the chromatograms for e1 and e2 degradation of sa is given in figs 6b and c respectively showing complete degradation of sa for e1 mode with lmwa being the sole degradation product at 60 min for e2 mode sa degradation was incomplete at 60 min and a small hydroquinone peak could be identified the kobs for e1 was 0 228 min 1 r2 0 9955 and that for e2 was only 0 0231 min 1 r2 0 9964 as shown in fig 6g e1 achieved 40 mineralisation of sa while 37 mineralisation resulted from e2 the results indicate that for a degradation period of 60 min under the conditions of this study the sudden addition of ps is more effective for the degradation of sa than gradual addition however the leftover ps was 34 for e1 but it was 50 for e2 hence there is more possibility for further pollutant degradation by e2 if the experimental time were lengthened in the presence of 25 mm meoh the kobs for e1 mode of sa degradation was 0 048 min 1 r2 0 8671 which represents a 79 reduction with respect to the e1 mode of sa degradation in the absence of meoh the chromatogram in fig 6d shows that no change in the degradation products resulted from the presence of meoh only that the transformation to lmwa was slower due to radical consumption by meoh in the presence of 2000 mm proh practically no degradation of sa was observed over 60 min but with 2100 mm buoh a slight sa degradation of about 20 was observed in the course of 60 min the results can be interpreted to mean that the major oxidising radical for sa degradation like og degradation was so4 however it is evident that sa degradation in the presence of proh and buoh was much poorer compared to og degradation the results reflect the relative ease with which an oxidising radical can successfully attack the electron rich azo bond in og compared to a successful attack on the resonance stabilised benzene ring although og contains three benzene rings compared to the one benzene ring of sa in the presence of meoh the benzene rings in og were completely converted to lmwa within 60 min fig 5b in contrast for sa degradation in the presence of meoh benzene rings as sa and hydroquinone persisted after 60 min the results can be explained as follows the comparatively fast oxidation of the azo bond in og resulted in the relatively fast production of aromatic radical species as shown in fig 4 these aromatic radicals were expectedly more reactive than a regular benzene ring 41 and were therefore readily transformed to lmwa hence the azo bond is a weak link for an oxidative attack on og such a point of weakness is absent in sa requiring an attack on the resonance stabilised ring structure to begin the oxidative transformation to lmwa the degradation of sa is summarised in fig 7 showing the transformation to hydroquinone 2 and then to lmwa 3 before mineralisation the results of the study of the effect of phosphate stabilised ph on sw activation of ps for the degradation of sa is given in fig 6f scarcely any degradation was achieved within 60 min at the neutral and basic conditions kobs 6 51 10 4 min 1 r2 0 8595 and 5 24 10 4 min 1 r2 0 8830 respectively while 92 degradation was achieved at the acidic ph of 2 with a kobs of 0 015 min 1 r2 0 9826 the results indicate that sw activation of ps under neutral and basic conditions is practically negligible however when the results of the acidic ph degradation of sa is compared to a similar degradation experiment in the absence of the phosphate buffer it is seen that the rate of sa degradation decreased by 93 due to the radical scavenging effect of phosphate phosphate iron complex formation and phosphate passivation of sw surfaces 5 46 consequently the phosphate buffer may also have contributed to the poor degradation observed at the neutral and alkaline conditions as well regarding phosphate radical scavenging effect it has been reported that the rate of reaction of so4 with the phosphate ion depends on the degree of phosphate ion protonation as follows 5 47 r3 s o 4 hp o 4 2 s o 4 2 hp o 4 k 1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 r4 s o 4 h 2 p o 4 s o 4 2 hp o 4 h k 7 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 the pka1 pka2 and pka3 of the phosphate ion were computed as 1 80 6 95 and 12 90 respectively www chemicalize com from these data it may be surmised that at a neutral ph one half of the phosphate ion exist as hpo4 2 i e 5 mm of the phosphate ion exist in the more reactive form with k 1 2 106 m 1s 1 which is only one order of magnitude less reactive than methanol k 2 5 107 m 1s 1 48 at a ph of 11 most of the phosphate ions exist in the more reactive form under these conditions significant radical scavenging may result from the presence of the phosphate buffer which may account at least partly for the poor sa degradation observed at a ph of 2 the greater proportion of phosphate ions exist in the protonated and less reactive form of h2po4 however since a substantial retardation of the pollutant degradation 93 was still observed under the acidic condition it appears that the complexation and passivation effect of phosphate were probably more important than the scavenging effect 3 4 degradation of 1 naphthylamine and phenol the degradation of ph and 1na in the presence of 25 mm meoh is presented in fig 8 compared to sa degradation in the presence of meoh which was only 60 after 60 min significantly more ph degradation of 90 was achieved at the end of 60 min for both e1 and e2 modes of ps addition the relative resistance of sa to oxidation compared to ph can be attributed to the presence of the carbonyl group in the former but not in the latter 49 the resonance electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group in sa deactivates the molecule towards electrophilic oxidation by so4 49 although the e2 degradation of ph was slower at the earlier part of the experiment fig 8a it attained the same degradation at the end of the experiment as e1 and the chromatograms for the two degradations fig 8b and 8c are similar in both fig 8b and c it is observed that degradation products with much longer retention times than ph developed the observations suggest the possible combination of radicals derived from ph and possibly from meoh to generate more hydrophobic degradation products 41 50 to determine whether meoh participated in the generation of the possibly more hydrophobic degradation products ph degradation was repeated in the absence of meoh and the chromatogram presented as fig 8d degradation peaks greater than ph could still be seen which can be taken as a confirmation that meoh was not responsible for the higher retention time degradation products from the trends shown in fig 8d for the degradation of 1na both e1 and e2 attained a relatively fast degradation of the pollutant in the presence of meoh compared to the degradation of the other pollutants studied in this work the rapid degradation of 1na points to the strongly electron donating effect of nh2 attached to fused benzene rings due to resonance 49 combined with the strongly electron abstracting property of so4 47 the apparent general rule therefore is that pollutants that are readily oxidised by so4 such as 1na are preferentially degraded over meoh while for pollutants resistant to oxidation such as sa meoh is preferentially oxidised this generalisation should be taken into account when considering radical oxidation of industrial pollutants in wastewater as far as is known to the authors of this paper the interestingly rapid oxidation of 1na by activated ps under a radical scavenging condition has not been previously reported despite the significant challenge posed by the widespread use of 1na as industrial intermediate and its designation as a priority contaminant 21 the limited number of previous studies on the treatment of wastewater contaminated with 1na have focused on adsorption 20 21 and electrochemical oxidation 19 the chromatograms for e1 and e2 degradation of 1na as presented in fig 8f and 8 g respectively are largely similar however a short lived peak at higher retention time was observed for e2 due to the limited identification of the peaks in the chromatograms of ph and 1na degradation fig 8 using table s 1 further study is required to develop a degradation pathway for the pollutants the degree of mineralisation and the remaining ps at the end of 60 min for ph and 1na degradation in the presence of 25 meoh is presented in fig 9 fig 9a shows that the mineralisation obtained from the e2 mode of degradation of both ph and 1na were greater than the mineralisation achieved by e1 hence except for sa degradation e2 mode appears to achieve more effective mineralisation than e1 this can readily be interpreted to imply that the sudden addition of ps under the e1 mode resulted in ps sw mutual exhaustion the much higher concentrations of ps remaining after 60 min for the e2 mode of addition of ps compared to the e1 fig 9b clearly support this proposal 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that commercial zvi is an effective activator of ps for the degradation of four important environmental pollutants namely og sa ph and in the presence or absence of an alcohol radical scavenger meoh 1na one of the pollutants studied is a top priority contaminants which as far as is known by the authors has not been the subject of any previous advanced oxidation degradation study yet as established in this study is uniquely amenable to activated ps degradation the addition of meoh mimics the presence of industrial solvents and or feedstuff in real industrial wastewater which may influence the degradation of target environmental pollutants the results from this study indicate that the presence of meoh had no effect on the nature of the degradation products generated from ps oxidation but the degradation rates of the target pollutants were reduced that meoh had no effect on the nature of the degradation products is suggestive of the limited contribution of radical combination 41 51 to the process further study will be required to establish this conclusion and its theoretical basis as well as the generality of the phenomenon with respect to other industrial solvents and feedstock common in wastewater the alcohol had a more retarding effect on the degradation of the pollutant sa which is relatively resistant to radical oxidation due to the presence of an electron withdrawing group on its benzene ring compared to a pollutant such as 1na that has an electron donating group the azo bond in og was found to be a structural point of weakness leading to a comparatively more effective degradation of the aromatic moieties the apparent general rule is that pollutants that are readily oxidised by so4 were preferentially degraded over meoh while for pollutants resistant to oxidation meoh was preferentially oxidised this rule is applicable in the evaluation of whether a particular industrial wastewater is suitable for advanced oxidation treatment when it is desirable to achieve the elimination of certain contaminants the activation of ps by the commercial zvi samples studied in this work was found to be more effective in the degradation of pollutants compared to ps activation by fe2 in addition the zvi materials required no prior acid washing to remove oxidised surface layer that develops on nzvi nor any other form of pretreatment hence the results open up the possibility for the direct use of waste iron filings generated as by products of iron processing and finishing for ps activation it was demonstrated that the gradual addition of ps compared to a sudden addition always consumed less ps and provided for more effective mineralisation of pollutants except sa due to its greater resistance to oxidation and therefore required longer reaction time with direct relevance to the industrial application of ps advanced oxidation treatment of wastewater the study for the first time also provides the following demonstrations 1 as an activator of ps zvi is optimised at a size range of 0 1 μm d 100 μm 2 poor ps concentration optimisation not only increases the consumption of the oxidant or the time of treatment but also results in the persistence of undesirable aromatic degradation by products 3 fe2 is not only less effective than zvi in activating ps it is also more significantly retarded in its activity by meoh that may abound in industrial wastewater 4 for a zvi activated ps process the mode of ps addition can be used to control the stability and therefore the concentration of dissolved iron conflict of interest none acknowledgement the financial support provided by victoria university to ikechukwu a ike through the victoria university international

feed solution alfs mode as was also reflected by larger changes of their properties relative to their pristine conditions the ability to characterize fouled membrane using the single stage protocol could help to unravel mechanisms of fouling in fo for instance as demonstrated in this study fouling in alds mode occurred internally by penetrating support layer keywords forward osmosis membrane parameter concentration polarization membrane fouling membrane characterization 1 introduction in forward osmosis fo a semi permeable membrane separates a concentrated draw solution and a diluted feed solution the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions drives the permeation across the membrane a selective permeable membrane allows passage of water but largely rejects solute molecules or ions the fo process results in concentration of the feed and dilution of the draw streams fo has emerged as a promising alternative for various applications because of its several key advantages in comparison to other membrane processes fo has lower membrane fouling propensity when presence the fouling is more reversible and occurs in a lesser degree 1 4 besides fo process basically does not require hydraulic pressure to drive separation pressure is required only for streams circulation 5 which enable low energy foot print when draw solution recovery does not required fo also offers solution for concentrating of various recalcitrant s emerging contaminants in wastewater that often bypass all treatment processes and thus accumulate in the water grids 6 7 in recent years a great deal of research has been directed at the fabrication of fo membranes in particular to lower the membrane support structural parameters s and to select the most effective and efficient draw solute 5 8 9 these efforts have resulted in the development of substantially improved fo membranes tailored for the specific needs to name a few high performance thin film composite fo membrane 10 and aquaporin based biomimetic fo membrane 11 have been now commercialized because of the success in developing high performance fo membranes and emergence of fo based spin off companies recent focus has also expands toward optimization of membrane through module scale analyses 12 a convenient and consistent methodology to characterize fo membranes is of critical importance in module design and to advance this technology into its mature phase facilitating the sharing of data their interpretation and comparison 13 14 a general approach to evaluate fo membrane performance is based on its intrinsic properties the pure water permeability coefficient a lm 2 h 1 bar 1 and the solute permeability coefficient b lm 2 h 1 which describe the transport across the membrane active layer and s mm quantifying the effective length of transport path across the membrane support layer these three parameters are univocal and can be used with the respective governing equations to predict the water jw lm 2 h 1 and reverse salt flux js gm 2 h 1 of a membrane sample therefore the values of a b and s offer a universal set of criteria for characterization of fo membrane regardless of fo operating conditions 14 the traditional method to measure a b and s consists of a two step experiment a and b are first measured in reverse osmosis ro test followed by an fo test to determine s some standard condition regarding this method has also been proposed 15 this method henceforth referred to as ro fo method assumes that transport parameters are universally valid and transferable between fo and ro operation which proven less so because of different driving force between them 13 the water transport in ro is driven by a hydraulic pressure difference while the mass transport in fo is driven by an osmotic pressure difference these fundamental differences may lead to inaccuracy when evaluating a b and s when using the ro fo method as demonstrated by coday et al for some fo membrane jw increases with increasing hydraulic pressure difference δp in an ro test while js substantially declines with increasing δp 16 which respectively leads to inflation and deflation of a and b values inaccuracies of a and b values are thus lumped into s value in addition subjecting fo membranes intended for operation near ambient conditions to the high pressure typical of ro can alter membrane structure i e via compaction the ro fo method is also cumbersome and laborious requiring multiple experiments in different setups a method to simultaneously determine membrane parameters has recently been proposed 13 it is claimed to be simple effective and reliable because it only works under representative driving force and operating conditions in a single but multi stages fo protocol henceforth this protocol is referred to as multi stage it consists of several stages of fo tests with different draw solution concentrations to obtain four pairs of water fluxes and reverse salt fluxes data membrane parameters are then determined through non linear regression where a b and s are adjusted parameters for fitting the fo transport equations into the experimental data the effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by the enhanced fitting of the estimated jw and js values estimates to the measured values with less than 3 5 coefficient of variation cv the multi stage protocol enables characterization of a b and s exclusively by means of only fo experiments despite the claims of generality and the simple nature of the multi stage protocol it suffers from several shortcomings 1 the effect of draw solution dilution and feed solution concentration due to jw and js change during a batch test is disregarded and the impact would be worse for a highly performing membrane the impact can be minimized in a system where the volumes of the feed and draw are much larger than the volume of permeating water 2 the mass transport equations applied in this study ignores the impact of external polarization concentrations ecps on the feed side which only applicable for the test with high cross flow velocities and for membrane with a low b value this assumption is valid for membranes that exhibited low a value or having large s value relative to the external boundary layer thickness neglecting the ecps lumps them into the internal concentration polarization icp term resulting in an over estimation of s as found in 14 and b or underestimation of a those two limitations can be avoided by careful design of the experiments to ensure data accuracy as suggested elsewhere 13 another important aspect in fo process development is membrane fouling this is in particular important by considering the critical flux behaviour dependency of membrane fouling propensity to the applied flux in fo process 17 a phenomenon that occurs in pressure driven process 18 despite the fo advantage of more resistant to fouling reports show that fouling plays an important role in fo when treating real feed and thus need to be considered 2 3 19 24 for further fo process development in particular for designing a fo module 25 an accurate design of membrane module requires inputs of precise parameters i e the one that account for performance reduction by fouling therefore a method that counts for fouling contribution in lowering the fo productivity is required in this study we assess a more general method via non linear least square fitting to determine a b and s parameters simultaneously to proof generality of the method three protocols namely multiple filtrations multi stage and single stage were applied to obtain experimental data they differ only on the protocols to gather j w and j s data the second one was based on the protocol proposed elsewhere 13 while the rests are new we employ the most recent and complete mass transport model that counting for icp in the support side and ecps in the feed and the draw sides to improve the multi stage method our general objective is to show that any method can be used to generate data for the purpose fo membrane characterization as long as they are accurate later we also demonstrate the use of single stage method to characterize fouled fo membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two commercial fo membranes were used in this study 1 a commercial aquaporin inside fo membrane obtained from aquaporin a s further referred to as ap membrane 2 the novel thin film composite fo membrane from hydration technology inc further referred to as hti membrane membrane samples were stored wet in milliq water millipore at 4 when not in use all fo tests were done using nacl as draw solution sigma aldrich usa and the bovine serum albumin bsa solution used as the feed for fouling study sigma aldrich usa 2 2 experimental set up and operation we used several identical fo set ups with filtration chamber dimensions of length width and depth of 8 7 4 2 and 0 25 cm respectively giving an effective membrane area of 36 54 cm2 they were operated with counter current cross flow without mesh spacers variable peristaltic pumps longerpump yz1515x china were used to drive the feed and draw solutions flows in closed loops at a cross flow velocity of 4 6 cms 1 the set up was placed in a room with a constant temperature of 24 0 5 c the jw was determined by monitoring the rate of change in weight of the feed solution measured using a digital weighing balance kern 572 germany at 1 min interval and the solute concentration in the feed was measured at 1 min intervals with a conductivity meter orion star a212 thermo scientific usa the js was determined by applying mass balance of water and solute feed concentration and water flux data were logged once the water flux had stabilized nacl was chosen as draw solute because i it is highly rejected by the fo membranes ii it is capable generating high osmotic pressure iii it largely obeys van t hoff equation and v its concentration can be quantified from conductivity data for calculating js further elaboration on the advantages of using nacl as draw solute can be found elsewhere 13 26 as dictated by the nature of the mass transport equation the current method is not applicable to measure b value of other solutes that do not obey the van t hoff equation nevertheless as long as the mass transfer models for a solutes are available a non linear least square method is applicable to characterise a b and s parameters in addition because of the demand of the highly non linear mass transfer models the provided data must be highly accurate and requiring large range of data span as discussed later ones are also required to limit the range of a b and s during the optimization to obtain accurate value to compensate the high non linearity of the transport model 2 3 fo experiment to characterize fo membranes two protocols for gathering fo performance data were assessed namely single stage and multiple filtration methods they were compared with the multi stage method 13 the distinction between methods solely lays on the experimental protocols for obtaining js and jw data 2 3 1 multiple filtration protocol protocol 1 multiple filtration protocol is basically an fo test like the ones applied in most fo report which is performed in multiple solute concentrations in the draw solution in this study we applied five different nacl concentrations in the draw solution 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 m and used demineralised water as the feed solution both feed and draw solutions were 1 l in volume for all experiments each filtration was run just for 10 15 min the time was counted from the moment the filtration reach stable conditions typically less than 5 min indicated by stable reading of weighing balance and conductivity meter that leads to stable jw and js values a short filtration run was opt to minimize the dilution and concentration effects associated with batch test the dilution effect was 5 for all tests in our opinion as long as the jw and js values are accurate reproducible and comparable with others the use short testing period is justified the filtrations were performed in two modes active layer facing feed solution alfs also known as fo mode and active layer facing draw solution alds also known as pro mode each test was performed using pristine membrane coupons totalling of 10 coupons the flux was obtained as the average values over the testing duration 2 3 2 multi stage protocol protocol 2 the details on this protocol can be found elsewhere 13 the protocol applied in this study in principle is analogue to the aforecited reference except that the draw solute and the feed concentrations were similar to the one applied in the multiple filtrations the initial volumes of the draw and the feed solution were 0 5 and 1 l respectively the initial concentration of draw solute was 0 5 m which later incrementally increased to to 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 m by addition of appropriate amount of 5 m nacl stock solution into the draw solution container on the other hand the volume of feed solution gradually decreased as results of permeation we expanded the range of draw concentrations to enlarge data span of jw and js since the applied fo membranes were relatively low in a and b parameters known from preliminary study all tests were conducted in the alfs mode as suggested in 13 in addition to reduce the inherent impact of concentration and dilution inherent to batch wise test each stage was as short as necessary about 6 10 min after stable fluxes were observed five pristine membrane samples were used for this method 2 3 3 single stage protocol protocol 3 the single stage protocol was performed by measuring jw and js over a single batch fo test this protocol accounts the impact of concentration and dilution in a batch wise operation in fact this protocol employed those variations for generating variable jw and js data to generate sufficient number and substantially large span of jw and js data the draw concentration was set high at 3 m its volume was set low at 0 5 l and the test duration was set long enough to allow significant change of draw solute concentrations this way no make up of concentrated solute solution was required as in the multi stage protocol the jw and js data were taken by virtually diving the testing duration into multiple 10 min steps because the membrane area was defined and the jw and js data were be recorded over times the volume and concentration of the draw and the feed solution for the subsequent step could be calculated eqs 1 4 the result of jw and js were then used to calculate the following step and so on the solute concentrations on the feed and the draw side could also be calculated this way inaccuracy of jw and js from averaging as in the multiple filtration and multi stage protocols can be avoided this protocol allows enormous data generation depending on frequency of data logging and accuracy of the data acquisition system which beneficial for model fitting process to obtain substantial ranges of data a high nacl concentration was selected and the filtration was performed for longer duration of up to 4 h 1 δ v i j w i a δ t 2 δ c i j s i a δ t 3 c d i 1

respectively the values of vd 0 and vf 0 were 0 5 and 1 4 l respectively five pristine membrane coupons were used for filtration tests in this method 2 4 mass transport equations the mass transport across a membrane in fo is expressed in terms of the membrane properties hydrodynamics near membrane surfaces and experimentally accessible parameters the bulk solute concentration of the draw solution c d gl 1 feed solution concentration c f gl 1 and the corresponding osmotic pressures π d bar and π f bar respectively for the draw and the feed solution the derivations of mass transport equations can be found elsewhere 14 the expressions for jw and js are as below for the alfs mode 5 j w a l f s a π d b e x p j w 1 k d s d d π f b e x p j w k f 1 b j w e x p j w k f e x p j w 1 k d s

mass transfer coefficient on the feed and draw sides respectively the s is defined as tsτ ε with ts τ and ε are its thickness tortuosity and ε porosity respectively the mass transfer models eqs 5 8 account for icp and ecp on both active and support membrane sides unlike ones applied elsewhere 13 that neglects the contribution of ecps eqs 9 10 except the treatment on the ecps all mass transfer models adopt similar assumptions characterizations of fo membranes parameters using both sets of models the one proposed by 27 and 14 and implemented in the multi stage method by 13 were also performed in this study for comparison 9 j w a l d s a π d b e x p j w s d d π f b 1 b j w 1 e x p j w s d d 10 j s a l d s b c d b e x p j w s d d c f b 1 b j w 1 e x p j w s d d 2 5 calculating a b and s the algorithm used for calculating a b and s was similar to the one used elsewhere 13 the differences for the rests were only on the protocol to obtain jw and js data and on the applied mass transfer models from mass transport models jw and js could be obtained numerically by solving eqs 5 10 when all variable in the equations were known c π k d the thermodynamic properties of feed and draw solutions diffusion coefficient viscosity and density for calculation of k and d at various nacl concentrations were obtained from empirical equations provided by others 28 mass transfer coefficient was also calculated accordingly 28 ideally any sensible values can be used for initial input of a b and s for iterative calculation those parameters were altered as part of program in the non linear optimization the estimated values of jw and js estimates were fitted to the experimental data by least squares non linear fitting using a b and s as regression parameters with the objective function of minimizing global error e eq 11 the program finds a set of a b and s that minimize the e the e here represents the average percentage deviation of the estimate and the experimental data of jw ew and js es in other words the algorithm finds a b and s values that lead to minimum deviation between the estimates and experimental data 11 e w 1 n i 1 n 1 j w i c j w i e 2 100 where n is the number of data and the superscripts e and c indicate experimental data and calculated data estimates respectively the calculation for es is analogue to eq 11 the term j w i c j w i e which weights the data equally by pulling them to unity was introduced to anticipate biases arisen from different scales of data magnitude the goodness of the fit was evaluated using the coefficient of determination which for the water flux r w 2 is given by 12 r w 2 1 s e w s t w 1 i 1 n j w i c j w i e 2 i 1 n j w i e j w a v e r a g e e 2 where se w is the residual sum of squares and st w the total sum of squares the coefficient of determination for the reverse salt flux r s 2 was calculated analogously the algorithm was implemented using a solver tool in microsoft visual basic within microsoft excel microsoft corporation the code finds estimates of a b and s by minimizing parameters calculated using eq 11 in this study solver tool was run using generalized reduced gradient nonlinear algorithm that suitable for problems that are smooth non linear 29 the precision was set at 0 1 convergence at 0 1 and tolerance at 1 the number of iteration was set for 30 000 however multiple forward iterations were applied when necessary the ranges of estimated variables were set as follow 0 1 a 1 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 0 05 b 1 lm 2 h 1 and 0 1 s 1 mm these ranges were chosen after preliminary study of multiple trial and error tests and by considering the physical properties of the membrane samples i e s cannot be smaller than the membrane thickness 2 6 characterization of fouled fo membranes characterization of fo membranes was performed using the single stage method for both alfs and alds modes to avoid the impact of coupon variability the impact of fouling on membrane characteristic was evaluated per coupon firstly an fo test using background solution as the feed was performed followed by fo test the same ap membrane coupon using the fouling solution the background feed solution was tap water conductivity of 0 25 0 30 ms cm 1 and the fouling solution was 2 gl 1 bsa in tap water tap water was selected because of detection range of conductivity meter which ensured the b value can be characterized accurately the draw solutions were 1 2 and 3 m nacl in di water determination of a b and s parameters for the fouled membranes was the same as the one for the pristine membranes however the jw data from experiments were treated differently discussed in section 3 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pristine fo membranes the estimated jw and js data obtained from the mass transport models eqs 5 10 fit well with the measured data for the three protocols these findings suggest that the least square optimization is reliable to obtain membrane parameters irrespective of data acquisition protocols fig 1 the estimates plotted in fig 1 were obtained based on the characteristic parameters of a b and s summarized in tables 1 and 2 determined from the regression graphically the good agreement between estimates and measured data is represented by the closeness of the data to y x line slope 1 in a linear linear plot for instance we can see that the jw fits better than js in almost all cases because in average they are closure to the y x line relative deviations between experimental data and estimates are observed for the multiple filtration method especially on js such deviations can originate from experimental error or imperfect parameters the linear linear plot in fig 1 also shows sample to sample variability when testing multiple samples in this case for the multi stage and the single stage method including outlier fig 1 shows a proximity between samples for jw in the multi stage method but notable variations in js are observed among samples interestingly some outliers can also be spotted when the cluster of data points are too far away from the rests those outliers are sample 2 for hti membrane for jw and js and sample 3 for the ap membrane for js in the single stage protocol and sample 2 for hti membrane for js in the multi stage protocol those outliers were not included for obtaining average data summarized in table 3 the presence of large sample variations and outliers suggest that applying multiple samples is required for accurate fo membrane characterization and should be coupled with careful analyses of experimental data another way to judge the effectiveness of the protocol is by evaluating the e values as summarized in tables 1 and 2 the former is quantified as average deviation of the experimental data and estimates which serve as minimization objective in the least squared regression method low e values mean estimates are very close to experimental data or graphically they are located in close proximity to the y x line in the linear linear plot and vice versa the aim of the optimization process in general is to find set of a b and s value that lead to a minimum e value the e values for all runs range from 1 03 to 13 95 with average of 5 41 smaller e values were obtained for the multi stage and the single stage protocol relative to the multiple filtration protocol 10 63 13 95 because the latter accommodate the effect of sample to sample variations unlike the other protocols the data analyses for the multiple filtration were simultaneously performed from data of 10 different membrane coupons large variability due to sample variations is often observed in many reports such as 30 even for commercial membranes that produced in batches for the multi stage and single stage protocols the calculations of e value and r2 were performed per membrane coupon which thus excludes the impact of sample variations the same approach using single membrane coupon indeed can be employed in the multiple filtration protocol to isolate the effect of sample variability when required the effectiveness of the method can also be ascribed quantitatively from the r2 values tables 1 and 2 overall results show that r w 2 es are considerably better than the r s 2 es irrespective of the protocols the average value of r w 2 es is 0 88 with minimum value of 0 73 while the average value of r s 2 es is 0 45 in some cases sample 2 and 3 of ap membrane in the single stage protocol the r s 2 es are negative meaning that the residual sum of squares error is larger than the total sum of squares errors this finding somewhat quantifies the poor fit of the js data shown in fig 1 and is also confirmed by high coefficient of variation of b values in table 3 we identify that poor fits of js between estimates and experimental data originate from different possible sources large experimental error low value of js due to good solute rejection properties of the membrane low value of b and lastly because of protocol limitations especially for the single stage we noticed that water circulations and vibrations due to pumping affect the weight measurements greatly the errors propagated more profoundly because of the low permeate volume due to combination of small membrane area and low jw and low amount of salts low b value transferred between streams which made measurements difficult also the magnitude of js during the tests was very small and for some cases of the single stage protocol was even lower than the margin of error as proven from negative r s 2 values the small ranges of js are clearly visible from the data that cluster closely as in fig 1 this limitation can be anticipated by applying a very high draw solute concentration large membrane area or longer testing duration however because of small b value and its low impact on js and jw tailoring experimental design to obtain highly accurate data for js seems less important variations within samples were large table 2 when the results of multiple membrane coupons were evaluated a substantially large variability was found with coefficient of variation for a b and s values in the range of 4 41 the variability of b value was the highest irrespective of the membranes and the methods which can also be explained from factors discussed earlier percentage of b varies more than a or s also because of its relative small value close to limit of the analytical instrument detection particularly for ap membrane small change on the b value contributes largely in overall change in percentage these findings emphases the need to use multiple samples and encourages careful data analyses the large variability of fo membrane characteristics is often shown between independent studies for instance about 30 difference of b value obtained in reference 31 vs 24 in which the latter attributed it to the effect of different working temperatures in another case when proposing multi stage method and testing three samples of hti membrane tiraferri et al 13 found coefficient of variation for a b and s values of 18 8 26 8 and 7 5 respectively not far from the ones obtained in this study 3 2 protocol comparison the three protocols applied in this study provide very close results ascribed by their low cv cv it is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean average the variation between protocols is even smaller than the variation among different samples tested using the same protocol the cv values for a b s of ap membrane are 3 87 20 82 and 19 84 respectively while cv values for a b s of hti membrane are 6 73 15 47 and 5 41 respectively it follows that the extent of sample variability can be limited by taking the average of a large sample number in this case we used 10 coupons for the multiple filtration protocols and five coupons for both the multi stage and the single stage protocols the use of large sample numbers is also more accurate statistically to represent a large membrane sheet in a roll the small cv suggests that all applied protocols are effective for fo membrane characterizations confirming the generality of the least square fitting method this opens possibility to tune the experimental procedure with available set up or even characterizing membranes with available data without redoing the experiments generally any protocol to obtain js and jw data can be applied if they are accurate and sufficient meeting the necessary data required for optimization purpose a protocol can be selected depending on available tools set up without concern on the range of operational parameters as when applying a less complete mass transport model nevertheless special care is mandatory on securing the data accuracy and number the membrane characteristics obtained in this study somewhat differ to the ones obtained elsewhere despite the tests were performed using similar membrane and in principles similar protocol to assess the reliability of membrane characteristics we compare the characteristics of hti membrane obtained in this study to the ones obtained using similar protocol elsewhere 13 but using different mass transfer model the a b and s values from the corresponding protocol the multi stage are compared directly being 0 58 0 69 and 0 33 in this study and 1 34 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 1 36 lm 2 h 1 and 0 498 mm in the reference respectively for a b and s values the average differences for a b and s values with respect to reference are 52 4 48 8 and 99 9 one striking contrast is that there seems over compensating between a and s values in our study the low a is coupled with low s and vice versa for the reference data at this point it is hard to deduce why the data differ so greatly this problem might be rooted to the nature of optimization process that will be discussed later nevertheless it is worth noting that disparities between reports on fo membrane characteristics are well acknowledged for instance when applying the ro fo method large deviations between a values measured in ro tests for the hti membrane were reported to name a few 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively from 14 24 and 28 some authors attributed to slight differences in experimental conditions 24 but a comprehensive discussion regarding this issue remains lacking 3 2 1 the importance of data accuracy low deviations between estimates and experimental data can be achieved by combinations of a b and s values since the mathematical equations blind to physical limitation of those parameters it is possible to irrational value from an optimization process despite the good fit between estimates and experimental data judging from a low cv in a few cases we observed some set of a b and s that give minimum e value but did not reflect membrane physical properties correctly this occurred when applying multi stage and single stage protocols for instance a global optimum was reached at an s value smaller than the thickness of the membrane which is irrational we identify that poor data accuracy causes this situation coupled with the nature of mass transport equations that almost linear in a small range of data magnitude for systems with low water flux stability of weighing measurements device has come to the fore to ensure acceptable data accuracy as suggested by eqs 5 10 the impact of a and s for jw and b and s for js is nearly reciprocal a good fit through least squared optimization for jw can be obtained at combinations of high a and high s values or at at low a and low s values assuming the b value is very low and thus has low impact those relations lead the optimization process cumbersome in some cases we obtained membrane characteristics that only matched well with the data for alfs mode as the case here as they were fitted to the alfs experimental data but largely deviated from alds data this happened when employing the multi stage and the single stage protocols this situation can be anticipated by limiting the range of membrane parameters close to most likely values if known in this study we applied the range of a b and s of 0 1 1 0 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 0 05 0 50 lm 2 h 1 and 0 1 1 mm for both ap and hti membranes respectively those ranges were set base on the results obtained by the multiple filtration protocol and from preliminary trials however in the case of newly developed membranes investigators are blind on the properties of the membranes under this circumstance the problem can be avoided by employing multiple filtration method as we experienced in this study or by simultaneously performed optimization involving data from alfs and alds modes fig 2 demonstrates the results from simultaneous optimization of data from alds and alfs modes the experimental data was produced usingthe multi stage protocol it shows the linear linear plot between estimates and experimental data here we did not set any range for the expected a b and s values but used the data obtained in fig 1 as the initial values for optimization process the ap membrane tested here is from different batch than the ones used in fig 1 the large deviations with the result in fig 2 suggest the large variability of batch to batch production of this membrane by simultaneously optimizing membrane parameters we avoid the situation where the parameters are only fit to either alfs or alds the data obtained from alfs mode pivot the estimation of s values close to its actual because s has the most significant impact in this mode while the data obtained from alds mode pivot the estimation of a values close to its actual because a has the most significant impact in this mode the statement is only valid when b value is very small and thus has minimum impacts the reciprocating relation between a and s to some extent might explain the large discrepancy of our data for hti membrane in table 3 to the reference 13 we used different sets of expected values to pivot selection of parameters during the optimization process in our case we applied some ranges base on the data from multiple filtration protocol that we believe the most accurate because they were obtained from the highest sample number and from both alds and alfs modes and thus more universal we presume that the referenced data was also obtained base on output of a b and s value that close to the ones from the conventional ro fo method that promotes large a and s value we believe that a values were over estimated 1 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 in the referenced study since others reported much smaller values 24 28 the over estimation of a is compensated by increasing the s values in addition the fo membrane characteristics found in this study were also accurate to predict membrane performance in different filtration cell dimensions data not shown to give a good indication of their reliability another way of judging the accuracy of s value is by reflecting to its physical meaning s value equals to the effective length of path for water and solute to transport across the membrane the s value of 0 498 mm for hti membrane as obtained by the reference means that the total path length is over 12 times of the thickness 30 50 μm but shorter for the result in this study of around 8 times s 0 32 mm those extensions of the path length are contributed by the porosity and tortuosity factor being greater for a denser structure and a more tortuose path 3 2 2 the significance of the mass transfer model the use of less detailed mass transfer model can lumps all neglected parameters such as ecps into membrane characteristics as discussed in 14 it may result in depletion of a value or enlargement of b and s values the difference becomes significant when some assumptions are not fully satisfied i e because of set up system limitations for instance ecps might be ignored when the applied cross flow velocity is substantially high i e 17 5 cm s but might not be applicable in other set ups like ours the maximum cross flow velocity in our set up was merely 4 6 cms 1 to prove our point on the importance of adopting appropriate mass transport models we employ eqs 9 10 that exclude ecps to fit our experimental data for obtaining hti membrane characteristics full data not shown we obtained a b and s by employing eq 9 and 10 of 0 29 0 33 and 0 31 respectively corresponding to 49 51 and 7 reductions from the ones obtained using eqs 5 8 summarized in table 3 the depletion in membrane transport properties occurs because they shoulder the transport resistance due to ecps the resistances are lumped to the membrane characteristics the extent of reduction is so large because of significant differences in cross flow velocity hence the extent of ecps for generality we suggest to employ the complete mass transport model that account for both ecps as in eqs 5 8 proposed by 14 the extent of ecps can be estimated using film theory 32 34 this way the flow conditions become universal and the applied flows are not limited to the ones that serve mass transport model assumptions i e high enough to depress the ecps inaccuracy during membrane parameters characterization may lead to wrong guideline in membrane and or membrane module developments the inclusion of ecps in the mass transport model leads to a more universal measurement condition the cross flow velocity is unnecessarily very high to eliminate the effect of ecp i e 25 cm s as suggested elsewhere 15 but can be adjusted to the capability of available set up 3 3 fouled membrane characterizations we propose an approach to assess membrane fouling in fo by quantifying its impact on the dynamic membranes form due to membrane fouling it is assume that foulant layer on in the membrane alters the pristine membrane properties of a b and or s that alteration can be reflected in the changes of their a b and s parameters from the pristine condition it is also assumed as will be proven later that the fouling in fo occurs in two main stages 1 a rapid and transient stage in the beginning in which the dynamic membrane properties change drastically followed by 2 a quasi steady state in the latter stage we assume that the dynamic membrane properties change slowly so that the fouled fo membrane properties are almost constant assessment of fouled membrane properties is very important for module design and full scale fo performance analyses the use of pristine membrane characteristic to judge module scale performance treating real feed undermines the impact of membrane fouling the impact of fouling cannot be ignored even for alfs configuration especially at high draw solute concentrations fig 2 if our two main assumptions above are valid it is possible to characterise the fouled membrane properties for the second stage to reflect membrane properties over a large part of operation time to assess the impact of membrane fouling the filtration test was performed in two parts for each membrane coupon filtration using tap water as the feed background followed by fouling solution 2 gl 1 bsa in tap water as the feeds the use of similar membrane coupon was chosen to avoid the interference from sample variations while the use of tap water conductivity 0 2 0 6 mscm 1 as background solution was to ensure the accuracy and precision of conductivity data the applied conductivity meter has a high accuracy for conductivity values below 1 mscm 1 this way we can obtain the pristine membrane parameters from background test and the fouled membrane parameters can be obtained from the fouling test membrane fouling is more profound in the alds than in the alfs modes fig 3 which is consistent with earlier reports 19 21 23 membrane fouling becomes significant at draw solution concentration between 1 and 2 m for alds and between 2 and 3 m for alds the degree of flux reductions was also much more severe for the former the data in fig 3 were used as inputs for least squared optimization to characterize both pristine and fouled membranes the proofs of our hypothesis for dividing two stages of fouling in fo are demonstrated in fig 4 the fouling in fo can be divided into 1 rapid decline of water for the first hour of operation followed by 2 a slow decline the rapid water flux decline is attributed to the rapid adsorption of foulant on the active layer membrane surface for the alfs mode and or rapid intrusion and consolidation of foulant into membrane support for the alds mode as suggested elsewhere 25 the slow water flux decline can be attributed due to concentration and dilution effects an inherent characteristic of the batch operation concentration of the feed and dilution of the draw solutions under this circumstance after the first stage the properties of the fouled fo membrane can be considered constant in another words the operation have reached queasy steady state condition and its transport properties can then be characterized using the single stage method the single stage protocol is the most appropriate to characterize fouled membrane properties because membrane fouling in fo is function of draw solute concentration see results in fig 3 while multiple filtration and multi stage protocols require different draw solute concentrations single stage protocol employs only single initial concentration that slightly changes during operations the change of the concentrations during the test using single stage protocol should be sufficient to generate reliable data for fouled membrane characterizations the changes of jw and js when treating fouling solution in fo can be translated into the changes of characterises reflected by a b and s from pristine to fouled conditions table 4 calculation method of a b and s for the fouled membrane was exactly the same as the method of the pristine membrane characterization the only difference is in the input of fluxes data the pristine membrane characterization uses all data from beginning to the end of the background filtration while the fouled membrane characterization uses the data of the later stage of filtration when cake layer was firstly formed fig 4 they were obtained from applying least squared optimization method remarkable changes of the transport properties occur as results of membrane fouling table 4 in accord with the filtration data in fig 3 the changes of membrane parameters are more profound for the alds than for the alfs modes because of the low nature of its fouling propensity the overall change on parameters for membranes operated in alfs mode is rather moderate 9 17 for alds mode in contrary the a values were reduced by 47 73 b values were reduced by 17 36 and the most profoundly the s values were increased by 5 645 a study by lay et al 26 demonstrated that a gel layer atop the active layer of fo membranes significantly reduces the reverse salt transport across an fo membrane operated in alfs mode in an osmotic membrane bioreactor process the ability to quantify the changes of the membrane properties can improve our understanding of membrane fouling mechanism on physical level further analyses of the changes in membrane parameters from pristine to fouled conditions can help to unravel membrane fouling mechanism in fo significant increment on s values for the fouled membrane used in the alds mode suggests that foulant increase support layer thickness when located externally or lower membrane support porosity when located internally the intrusion of the foulant into the support layer enables it to directly interact with the active layer and alters the a values in this case it substantially lowers the a values suggesting that the fouling most likely occurred internally it means that direct interactions between active layer and foulant in the support side result in detrimental impact on the transport properties of the active layer among all membranes one sample in the alfs mode shows peculiar results data from 2 m a increases while s decreases but overall have lower relative changes in alfs mode foulant is in direct contact with the active layers because of the dense nature of the active layer a full rejection of the foulant is then expected foulant then accumulate on the top of active layer and no change on s value between pristine and fouled membrane is expected nevertheless substantial changes on the s values are shown from 5 to 42 which are very unlikely the peculiar finding for the data on the fouled membranes operated in alfs mode can be ascribed by inaccuracy of the mass transfer model the mass transfer models used for the analyses eqs 5 8 are less accurate for the fouled membrane in the alfs mode those models neglected the presence of cake layer atop the active layer that can contribute to further enhancements of polarization concentration commonly known as cake enhanced concentration polarization 35 on the other hand the mass transport models are suitable for the fouled membrane in the alds mode it follows that the impact of fouling layer can be counted and reflected by the changes of the support layer properties i e decrease in porosity due to internal fouling 3 4 practical consideration the results demonstrated that all protocols can be used to characterize fo membrane parameters the accuracy of the protocols depends strongly on the accuracy of the experimental measurements the multiple filtration and the multi stage protocols more profoundly because of cumulative effect of a longer filtration duration have inherent limitation by allowing concentration of feed solution and in larger extent dilution of the draw solution when operated batch wise this effect is enhanced in a system with high jw and js coupled with small area of membrane sample and small volumes of feed and draw solutions for both protocols when operated batch wise the impact of dilution and concentration can be limited by performing the test as short as possible but still adequate for obtaining accurate jw and js data for the former this can be avoided by conducting the fo test in continuous wise for both the feed and the draw streams or only the draw stream as performed elsewhere 36 in contrary to the multiple filtration and multi stage protocols the single stage protocols lays on the occurrence of concentration and dilution effect to obtain variable values of jw and js therefore to obtain adequate experimental data the concentration and dilution effects must be amplified it can be done by several means minimize the volume of the draw solution enlarging membrane area increasing draw solute concentration etc selection of a protocol can be done base on the capability of an available set up without necessarily concern on the condition state in the fo ro method or multi stage filtration protocol nevertheless adoption of the mass transport model that includes ecps is strongly recommended 4 conclusions several protocols for data collection to determine fo membrane parameters via least square fitting method are addressed namely multiple filtration multi stage and single stage they only differ on the procedure to obtain the jw and js data those data are used as inputs for least squared optimization to characterize fo membrane parameters a b and s overall results demonstrate that all protocol are effective for fo membrane characterizations demonstrating the generality of the least square fitting method with e values of less than 11 variations of a b and s values obtained from the three protocols were less than 21 and 15 for ap and hti membranes respectively suggesting that they are all equally reliable it implies that generally any experimental protocol can be employed as long as it results in accurate data to improve the accuracy minimizing experimental error is necessary for example by conducting more repeats and by enlarging operational data ranges we also suggest to simultaneously inputting data from both alfs and alds modes during the optimization to ensure that the obtained parameters close to the actual values large variability of membrane properties among different samples suggests the importance of applying multiple samples the single stage protocol can also be used to characterize fouled membrane as expected the fouling was more severe for the alds mode than the alfs mode as also reflected by larger changes of their properties relative to their pristine conditions to analyse the membrane fouling more accurately in alfs test mode a revised mass transport model is needed this model should account

14512,we assess three forward osmosis fo performance data collection protocols namely multiple filtration multi stage and single stage using non linear least square fitting method to simultaneously characterize water permeability coefficient a solute permeability coefficient b and structural parameter s of fo membranes they differ only on the procedure to acquire water and reverse salt flux data both set of fluxes data were later used as inputs in non linear least square fitting optimization to obtain the a b and s parameters the method were evaluated using two commercial fo membranes we employed the mass transport models that counting for internal and external concentration polarizations in the feed and the draw sides we also demonstrated the use of the single stage protocol to characterize fouled fo membranes overall results showed that all protocols are equally effective for characterizing fo membranes demonstrating generality of the least square fitting method furthermore the single stage protocol can be used for characterizing fouled fo membrane in situly as expected fouling was more severe for the active layer facing draw solution alds than the active layer facing feed solution alfs mode as was also reflected by larger changes of their properties relative to their pristine conditions the ability to characterize fouled membrane using the single stage protocol could help to unravel mechanisms of fouling in fo for instance as demonstrated in this study fouling in alds mode occurred internally by penetrating support layer keywords forward osmosis membrane parameter concentration polarization membrane fouling membrane characterization 1 introduction in forward osmosis fo a semi permeable membrane separates a concentrated draw solution and a diluted feed solution the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions drives the permeation across the membrane a selective permeable membrane allows passage of water but largely rejects solute molecules or ions the fo process results in concentration of the feed and dilution of the draw streams fo has emerged as a promising alternative for various applications because of its several key advantages in comparison to other membrane processes fo has lower membrane fouling propensity when presence the fouling is more reversible and occurs in a lesser degree 1 4 besides fo process basically does not require hydraulic pressure to drive separation pressure is required only for streams circulation 5 which enable low energy foot print when draw solution recovery does not required fo also offers solution for concentrating of various recalcitrant s emerging contaminants in wastewater that often bypass all treatment processes and thus accumulate in the water grids 6 7 in recent years a great deal of research has been directed at the fabrication of fo membranes in particular to lower the membrane support structural parameters s and to select the most effective and efficient draw solute 5 8 9 these efforts have resulted in the development of substantially improved fo membranes tailored for the specific needs to name a few high performance thin film composite fo membrane 10 and aquaporin based biomimetic fo membrane 11 have been now commercialized because of the success in developing high performance fo membranes and emergence of fo based spin off companies recent focus has also expands toward optimization of membrane through module scale analyses 12 a convenient and consistent methodology to characterize fo membranes is of critical importance in module design and to advance this technology into its mature phase facilitating the sharing of data their interpretation and comparison 13 14 a general approach to evaluate fo membrane performance is based on its intrinsic properties the pure water permeability coefficient a lm 2 h 1 bar 1 and the solute permeability coefficient b lm 2 h 1 which describe the transport across the membrane active layer and s mm quantifying the effective length of transport path across the membrane support layer these three parameters are univocal and can be used with the respective governing equations to predict the water jw lm 2 h 1 and reverse salt flux js gm 2 h 1 of a membrane sample therefore the values of a b and s offer a universal set of criteria for characterization of fo membrane regardless of fo operating conditions 14 the traditional method to measure a b and s consists of a two step experiment a and b are first measured in reverse osmosis ro test followed by an fo test to determine s some standard condition regarding this method has also been proposed 15 this method henceforth referred to as ro fo method assumes that transport parameters are universally valid and transferable between fo and ro operation which proven less so because of different driving force between them 13 the water transport in ro is driven by a hydraulic pressure difference while the mass transport in fo is driven by an osmotic pressure difference these fundamental differences may lead to inaccuracy when evaluating a b and s when using the ro fo method as demonstrated by coday et al for some fo membrane jw increases with increasing hydraulic pressure difference δp in an ro test while js substantially declines with increasing δp 16 which respectively leads to inflation and deflation of a and b values inaccuracies of a and b values are thus lumped into s value in addition subjecting fo membranes intended for operation near ambient conditions to the high pressure typical of ro can alter membrane structure i e via compaction the ro fo method is also cumbersome and laborious requiring multiple experiments in different setups a method to simultaneously determine membrane parameters has recently been proposed 13 it is claimed to be simple effective and reliable because it only works under representative driving force and operating conditions in a single but multi stages fo protocol henceforth this protocol is referred to as multi stage it consists of several stages of fo tests with different draw solution concentrations to obtain four pairs of water fluxes and reverse salt fluxes data membrane parameters are then determined through non linear regression where a b and s are adjusted parameters for fitting the fo transport equations into the experimental data the effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by the enhanced fitting of the estimated jw and js values estimates to the measured values with less than 3 5 coefficient of variation cv the multi stage protocol enables characterization of a b and s exclusively by means of only fo experiments despite the claims of generality and the simple nature of the multi stage protocol it suffers from several shortcomings 1 the effect of draw solution dilution and feed solution concentration due to jw and js change during a batch test is disregarded and the impact would be worse for a highly performing membrane the impact can be minimized in a system where the volumes of the feed and draw are much larger than the volume of permeating water 2 the mass transport equations applied in this study ignores the impact of external polarization concentrations ecps on the feed side which only applicable for the test with high cross flow velocities and for membrane with a low b value this assumption is valid for membranes that exhibited low a value or having large s value relative to the external boundary layer thickness neglecting the ecps lumps them into the internal concentration polarization icp term resulting in an over estimation of s as found in 14 and b or underestimation of a those two limitations can be avoided by careful design of the experiments to ensure data accuracy as suggested elsewhere 13 another important aspect in fo process development is membrane fouling this is in particular important by considering the critical flux behaviour dependency of membrane fouling propensity to the applied flux in fo process 17 a phenomenon that occurs in pressure driven process 18 despite the fo advantage of more resistant to fouling reports show that fouling plays an important role in fo when treating real feed and thus need to be considered 2 3 19 24 for further fo process development in particular for designing a fo module 25 an accurate design of membrane module requires inputs of precise parameters i e the one that account for performance reduction by fouling therefore a method that counts for fouling contribution in lowering the fo productivity is required in this study we assess a more general method via non linear least square fitting to determine a b and s parameters simultaneously to proof generality of the method three protocols namely multiple filtrations multi stage and single stage were applied to obtain experimental data they differ only on the protocols to gather j w and j s data the second one was based on the protocol proposed elsewhere 13 while the rests are new we employ the most recent and complete mass transport model that counting for icp in the support side and ecps in the feed and the draw sides to improve the multi stage method our general objective is to show that any method can be used to generate data for the purpose fo membrane characterization as long as they are accurate later we also demonstrate the use of single stage method to characterize fouled fo membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two commercial fo membranes were used in this study 1 a commercial aquaporin inside fo membrane obtained from aquaporin a s further referred to as ap membrane 2 the novel thin film composite fo membrane from hydration technology inc further referred to as hti membrane membrane samples were stored wet in milliq water millipore at 4 when not in use all fo tests were done using nacl as draw solution sigma aldrich usa and the bovine serum albumin bsa solution used as the feed for fouling study sigma aldrich usa 2 2 experimental set up and operation we used several identical fo set ups with filtration chamber dimensions of length width and depth of 8 7 4 2 and 0 25 cm respectively giving an effective membrane area of 36 54 cm2 they were operated with counter current cross flow without mesh spacers variable peristaltic pumps longerpump yz1515x china were used to drive the feed and draw solutions flows in closed loops at a cross flow velocity of 4 6 cms 1 the set up was placed in a room with a constant temperature of 24 0 5 c the jw was determined by monitoring the rate of change in weight of the feed solution measured using a digital weighing balance kern 572 germany at 1 min interval and the solute concentration in the feed was measured at 1 min intervals with a conductivity meter orion star a212 thermo scientific usa the js was determined by applying mass balance of water and solute feed concentration and water flux data were logged once the water flux had stabilized nacl was chosen as draw solute because i it is highly rejected by the fo membranes ii it is capable generating high osmotic pressure iii it largely obeys van t hoff equation and v its concentration can be quantified from conductivity data for calculating js further elaboration on the advantages of using nacl as draw solute can be found elsewhere 13 26 as dictated by the nature of the mass transport equation the current method is not applicable to measure b value of other solutes that do not obey the van t hoff equation nevertheless as long as the mass transfer models for a solutes are available a non linear least square method is applicable to characterise a b and s parameters in addition because of the demand of the highly non linear mass transfer models the provided data must be highly accurate and requiring large range of data span as discussed later ones are also required to limit the range of a b and s during the optimization to obtain accurate value to compensate the high non linearity of the transport model 2 3 fo experiment to characterize fo membranes two protocols for gathering fo performance data were assessed namely single stage and multiple filtration methods they were compared with the multi stage method 13 the distinction between methods solely lays on the experimental protocols for obtaining js and jw data 2 3 1 multiple filtration protocol protocol 1 multiple filtration protocol is basically an fo test like the ones applied in most fo report which is performed in multiple solute concentrations in the draw solution in this study we applied five different nacl concentrations in the draw solution 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 m and used demineralised water as the feed solution both feed and draw solutions were 1 l in volume for all experiments each filtration was run just for 10 15 min the time was counted from the moment the filtration reach stable conditions typically less than 5 min indicated by stable reading of weighing balance and conductivity meter that leads to stable jw and js values a short filtration run was opt to minimize the dilution and concentration effects associated with batch test the dilution effect was 5 for all tests in our opinion as long as the jw and js values are accurate reproducible and comparable with others the use short testing period is justified the filtrations were performed in two modes active layer facing feed solution alfs also known as fo mode and active layer facing draw solution alds also known as pro mode each test was performed using pristine membrane coupons totalling of 10 coupons the flux was obtained as the average values over the testing duration 2 3 2 multi stage protocol protocol 2 the details on this protocol can be found elsewhere 13 the protocol applied in this study in principle is analogue to the aforecited reference except that the draw solute and the feed concentrations were similar to the one applied in the multiple filtrations the initial volumes of the draw and the feed solution were 0 5 and 1 l respectively the initial concentration of draw solute was 0 5 m which later incrementally increased to to 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 m by addition of appropriate amount of 5 m nacl stock solution into the draw solution container on the other hand the volume of feed solution gradually decreased as results of permeation we expanded the range of draw concentrations to enlarge data span of jw and js since the applied fo membranes were relatively low in a and b parameters known from preliminary study all tests were conducted in the alfs mode as suggested in 13 in addition to reduce the inherent impact of concentration and dilution inherent to batch wise test each stage was as short as necessary about 6 10 min after stable fluxes were observed five pristine membrane samples were used for this method 2 3 3 single stage protocol protocol 3 the single stage protocol was performed by measuring jw and js over a single batch fo test this protocol accounts the impact of concentration and dilution in a batch wise operation in fact this protocol employed those variations for generating variable jw and js data to generate sufficient number and substantially large span of jw and js data the draw concentration was set high at 3 m its volume was set low at 0 5 l and the test duration was set long enough to allow significant change of draw solute concentrations this way no make up of concentrated solute solution was required as in the multi stage protocol the jw and js data were taken by virtually diving the testing duration into multiple 10 min steps because the membrane area was defined and the jw and js data were be recorded over times the volume and concentration of the draw and the feed solution for the subsequent step could be calculated eqs 1 4 the result of jw and js were then used to calculate the following step and so on the solute concentrations on the feed and the draw side could also be calculated this way inaccuracy of jw and js from averaging as in the multiple filtration and multi stage protocols can be avoided this protocol allows enormous data generation depending on frequency of data logging and accuracy of the data acquisition system which beneficial for model fitting process to obtain substantial ranges of data a high nacl concentration was selected and the filtration was performed for longer duration of up to 4 h 1 δ v i j w i a δ t 2 δ c i j s i a δ t 3 c d i 1

respectively the values of vd 0 and vf 0 were 0 5 and 1 4 l respectively five pristine membrane coupons were used for filtration tests in this method 2 4 mass transport equations the mass transport across a membrane in fo is expressed in terms of the membrane properties hydrodynamics near membrane surfaces and experimentally accessible parameters the bulk solute concentration of the draw solution c d gl 1 feed solution concentration c f gl 1 and the corresponding osmotic pressures π d bar and π f bar respectively for the draw and the feed solution the derivations of mass transport equations can be found elsewhere 14 the expressions for jw and js are as below for the alfs mode 5 j w a l f s a π d b e x p j w 1 k d s d d π f b e x p j w k f 1 b j w e x p j w k f e x p j w 1 k d s

mass transfer coefficient on the feed and draw sides respectively the s is defined as tsτ ε with ts τ and ε are its thickness tortuosity and ε porosity respectively the mass transfer models eqs 5 8 account for icp and ecp on both active and support membrane sides unlike ones applied elsewhere 13 that neglects the contribution of ecps eqs 9 10 except the treatment on the ecps all mass transfer models adopt similar assumptions characterizations of fo membranes parameters using both sets of models the one proposed by 27 and 14 and implemented in the multi stage method by 13 were also performed in this study for comparison 9 j w a l d s a π d b e x p j w s d d π f b 1 b j w 1 e x p j w s d d 10 j s a l d s b c d b e x p j w s d d c f b 1 b j w 1 e x p j w s d d 2 5 calculating a b and s the algorithm used for calculating a b and s was similar to the one used elsewhere 13 the differences for the rests were only on the protocol to obtain jw and js data and on the applied mass transfer models from mass transport models jw and js could be obtained numerically by solving eqs 5 10 when all variable in the equations were known c π k d the thermodynamic properties of feed and draw solutions diffusion coefficient viscosity and density for calculation of k and d at various nacl concentrations were obtained from empirical equations provided by others 28 mass transfer coefficient was also calculated accordingly 28 ideally any sensible values can be used for initial input of a b and s for iterative calculation those parameters were altered as part of program in the non linear optimization the estimated values of jw and js estimates were fitted to the experimental data by least squares non linear fitting using a b and s as regression parameters with the objective function of minimizing global error e eq 11 the program finds a set of a b and s that minimize the e the e here represents the average percentage deviation of the estimate and the experimental data of jw ew and js es in other words the algorithm finds a b and s values that lead to minimum deviation between the estimates and experimental data 11 e w 1 n i 1 n 1 j w i c j w i e 2 100 where n is the number of data and the superscripts e and c indicate experimental data and calculated data estimates respectively the calculation for es is analogue to eq 11 the term j w i c j w i e which weights the data equally by pulling them to unity was introduced to anticipate biases arisen from different scales of data magnitude the goodness of the fit was evaluated using the coefficient of determination which for the water flux r w 2 is given by 12 r w 2 1 s e w s t w 1 i 1 n j w i c j w i e 2 i 1 n j w i e j w a v e r a g e e 2 where se w is the residual sum of squares and st w the total sum of squares the coefficient of determination for the reverse salt flux r s 2 was calculated analogously the algorithm was implemented using a solver tool in microsoft visual basic within microsoft excel microsoft corporation the code finds estimates of a b and s by minimizing parameters calculated using eq 11 in this study solver tool was run using generalized reduced gradient nonlinear algorithm that suitable for problems that are smooth non linear 29 the precision was set at 0 1 convergence at 0 1 and tolerance at 1 the number of iteration was set for 30 000 however multiple forward iterations were applied when necessary the ranges of estimated variables were set as follow 0 1 a 1 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 0 05 b 1 lm 2 h 1 and 0 1 s 1 mm these ranges were chosen after preliminary study of multiple trial and error tests and by considering the physical properties of the membrane samples i e s cannot be smaller than the membrane thickness 2 6 characterization of fouled fo membranes characterization of fo membranes was performed using the single stage method for both alfs and alds modes to avoid the impact of coupon variability the impact of fouling on membrane characteristic was evaluated per coupon firstly an fo test using background solution as the feed was performed followed by fo test the same ap membrane coupon using the fouling solution the background feed solution was tap water conductivity of 0 25 0 30 ms cm 1 and the fouling solution was 2 gl 1 bsa in tap water tap water was selected because of detection range of conductivity meter which ensured the b value can be characterized accurately the draw solutions were 1 2 and 3 m nacl in di water determination of a b and s parameters for the fouled membranes was the same as the one for the pristine membranes however the jw data from experiments were treated differently discussed in section 3 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pristine fo membranes the estimated jw and js data obtained from the mass transport models eqs 5 10 fit well with the measured data for the three protocols these findings suggest that the least square optimization is reliable to obtain membrane parameters irrespective of data acquisition protocols fig 1 the estimates plotted in fig 1 were obtained based on the characteristic parameters of a b and s summarized in tables 1 and 2 determined from the regression graphically the good agreement between estimates and measured data is represented by the closeness of the data to y x line slope 1 in a linear linear plot for instance we can see that the jw fits better than js in almost all cases because in average they are closure to the y x line relative deviations between experimental data and estimates are observed for the multiple filtration method especially on js such deviations can originate from experimental error or imperfect parameters the linear linear plot in fig 1 also shows sample to sample variability when testing multiple samples in this case for the multi stage and the single stage method including outlier fig 1 shows a proximity between samples for jw in the multi stage method but notable variations in js are observed among samples interestingly some outliers can also be spotted when the cluster of data points are too far away from the rests those outliers are sample 2 for hti membrane for jw and js and sample 3 for the ap membrane for js in the single stage protocol and sample 2 for hti membrane for js in the multi stage protocol those outliers were not included for obtaining average data summarized in table 3 the presence of large sample variations and outliers suggest that applying multiple samples is required for accurate fo membrane characterization and should be coupled with careful analyses of experimental data another way to judge the effectiveness of the protocol is by evaluating the e values as summarized in tables 1 and 2 the former is quantified as average deviation of the experimental data and estimates which serve as minimization objective in the least squared regression method low e values mean estimates are very close to experimental data or graphically they are located in close proximity to the y x line in the linear linear plot and vice versa the aim of the optimization process in general is to find set of a b and s value that lead to a minimum e value the e values for all runs range from 1 03 to 13 95 with average of 5 41 smaller e values were obtained for the multi stage and the single stage protocol relative to the multiple filtration protocol 10 63 13 95 because the latter accommodate the effect of sample to sample variations unlike the other protocols the data analyses for the multiple filtration were simultaneously performed from data of 10 different membrane coupons large variability due to sample variations is often observed in many reports such as 30 even for commercial membranes that produced in batches for the multi stage and single stage protocols the calculations of e value and r2 were performed per membrane coupon which thus excludes the impact of sample variations the same approach using single membrane coupon indeed can be employed in the multiple filtration protocol to isolate the effect of sample variability when required the effectiveness of the method can also be ascribed quantitatively from the r2 values tables 1 and 2 overall results show that r w 2 es are considerably better than the r s 2 es irrespective of the protocols the average value of r w 2 es is 0 88 with minimum value of 0 73 while the average value of r s 2 es is 0 45 in some cases sample 2 and 3 of ap membrane in the single stage protocol the r s 2 es are negative meaning that the residual sum of squares error is larger than the total sum of squares errors this finding somewhat quantifies the poor fit of the js data shown in fig 1 and is also confirmed by high coefficient of variation of b values in table 3 we identify that poor fits of js between estimates and experimental data originate from different possible sources large experimental error low value of js due to good solute rejection properties of the membrane low value of b and lastly because of protocol limitations especially for the single stage we noticed that water circulations and vibrations due to pumping affect the weight measurements greatly the errors propagated more profoundly because of the low permeate volume due to combination of small membrane area and low jw and low amount of salts low b value transferred between streams which made measurements difficult also the magnitude of js during the tests was very small and for some cases of the single stage protocol was even lower than the margin of error as proven from negative r s 2 values the small ranges of js are clearly visible from the data that cluster closely as in fig 1 this limitation can be anticipated by applying a very high draw solute concentration large membrane area or longer testing duration however because of small b value and its low impact on js and jw tailoring experimental design to obtain highly accurate data for js seems less important variations within samples were large table 2 when the results of multiple membrane coupons were evaluated a substantially large variability was found with coefficient of variation for a b and s values in the range of 4 41 the variability of b value was the highest irrespective of the membranes and the methods which can also be explained from factors discussed earlier percentage of b varies more than a or s also because of its relative small value close to limit of the analytical instrument detection particularly for ap membrane small change on the b value contributes largely in overall change in percentage these findings emphases the need to use multiple samples and encourages careful data analyses the large variability of fo membrane characteristics is often shown between independent studies for instance about 30 difference of b value obtained in reference 31 vs 24 in which the latter attributed it to the effect of different working temperatures in another case when proposing multi stage method and testing three samples of hti membrane tiraferri et al 13 found coefficient of variation for a b and s values of 18 8 26 8 and 7 5 respectively not far from the ones obtained in this study 3 2 protocol comparison the three protocols applied in this study provide very close results ascribed by their low cv cv it is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean average the variation between protocols is even smaller than the variation among different samples tested using the same protocol the cv values for a b s of ap membrane are 3 87 20 82 and 19 84 respectively while cv values for a b s of hti membrane are 6 73 15 47 and 5 41 respectively it follows that the extent of sample variability can be limited by taking the average of a large sample number in this case we used 10 coupons for the multiple filtration protocols and five coupons for both the multi stage and the single stage protocols the use of large sample numbers is also more accurate statistically to represent a large membrane sheet in a roll the small cv suggests that all applied protocols are effective for fo membrane characterizations confirming the generality of the least square fitting method this opens possibility to tune the experimental procedure with available set up or even characterizing membranes with available data without redoing the experiments generally any protocol to obtain js and jw data can be applied if they are accurate and sufficient meeting the necessary data required for optimization purpose a protocol can be selected depending on available tools set up without concern on the range of operational parameters as when applying a less complete mass transport model nevertheless special care is mandatory on securing the data accuracy and number the membrane characteristics obtained in this study somewhat differ to the ones obtained elsewhere despite the tests were performed using similar membrane and in principles similar protocol to assess the reliability of membrane characteristics we compare the characteristics of hti membrane obtained in this study to the ones obtained using similar protocol elsewhere 13 but using different mass transfer model the a b and s values from the corresponding protocol the multi stage are compared directly being 0 58 0 69 and 0 33 in this study and 1 34 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 1 36 lm 2 h 1 and 0 498 mm in the reference respectively for a b and s values the average differences for a b and s values with respect to reference are 52 4 48 8 and 99 9 one striking contrast is that there seems over compensating between a and s values in our study the low a is coupled with low s and vice versa for the reference data at this point it is hard to deduce why the data differ so greatly this problem might be rooted to the nature of optimization process that will be discussed later nevertheless it is worth noting that disparities between reports on fo membrane characteristics are well acknowledged for instance when applying the ro fo method large deviations between a values measured in ro tests for the hti membrane were reported to name a few 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively from 14 24 and 28 some authors attributed to slight differences in experimental conditions 24 but a comprehensive discussion regarding this issue remains lacking 3 2 1 the importance of data accuracy low deviations between estimates and experimental data can be achieved by combinations of a b and s values since the mathematical equations blind to physical limitation of those parameters it is possible to irrational value from an optimization process despite the good fit between estimates and experimental data judging from a low cv in a few cases we observed some set of a b and s that give minimum e value but did not reflect membrane physical properties correctly this occurred when applying multi stage and single stage protocols for instance a global optimum was reached at an s value smaller than the thickness of the membrane which is irrational we identify that poor data accuracy causes this situation coupled with the nature of mass transport equations that almost linear in a small range of data magnitude for systems with low water flux stability of weighing measurements device has come to the fore to ensure acceptable data accuracy as suggested by eqs 5 10 the impact of a and s for jw and b and s for js is nearly reciprocal a good fit through least squared optimization for jw can be obtained at combinations of high a and high s values or at at low a and low s values assuming the b value is very low and thus has low impact those relations lead the optimization process cumbersome in some cases we obtained membrane characteristics that only matched well with the data for alfs mode as the case here as they were fitted to the alfs experimental data but largely deviated from alds data this happened when employing the multi stage and the single stage protocols this situation can be anticipated by limiting the range of membrane parameters close to most likely values if known in this study we applied the range of a b and s of 0 1 1 0 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 0 05 0 50 lm 2 h 1 and 0 1 1 mm for both ap and hti membranes respectively those ranges were set base on the results obtained by the multiple filtration protocol and from preliminary trials however in the case of newly developed membranes investigators are blind on the properties of the membranes under this circumstance the problem can be avoided by employing multiple filtration method as we experienced in this study or by simultaneously performed optimization involving data from alfs and alds modes fig 2 demonstrates the results from simultaneous optimization of data from alds and alfs modes the experimental data was produced usingthe multi stage protocol it shows the linear linear plot between estimates and experimental data here we did not set any range for the expected a b and s values but used the data obtained in fig 1 as the initial values for optimization process the ap membrane tested here is from different batch than the ones used in fig 1 the large deviations with the result in fig 2 suggest the large variability of batch to batch production of this membrane by simultaneously optimizing membrane parameters we avoid the situation where the parameters are only fit to either alfs or alds the data obtained from alfs mode pivot the estimation of s values close to its actual because s has the most significant impact in this mode while the data obtained from alds mode pivot the estimation of a values close to its actual because a has the most significant impact in this mode the statement is only valid when b value is very small and thus has minimum impacts the reciprocating relation between a and s to some extent might explain the large discrepancy of our data for hti membrane in table 3 to the reference 13 we used different sets of expected values to pivot selection of parameters during the optimization process in our case we applied some ranges base on the data from multiple filtration protocol that we believe the most accurate because they were obtained from the highest sample number and from both alds and alfs modes and thus more universal we presume that the referenced data was also obtained base on output of a b and s value that close to the ones from the conventional ro fo method that promotes large a and s value we believe that a values were over estimated 1 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 in the referenced study since others reported much smaller values 24 28 the over estimation of a is compensated by increasing the s values in addition the fo membrane characteristics found in this study were also accurate to predict membrane performance in different filtration cell dimensions data not shown to give a good indication of their reliability another way of judging the accuracy of s value is by reflecting to its physical meaning s value equals to the effective length of path for water and solute to transport across the membrane the s value of 0 498 mm for hti membrane as obtained by the reference means that the total path length is over 12 times of the thickness 30 50 μm but shorter for the result in this study of around 8 times s 0 32 mm those extensions of the path length are contributed by the porosity and tortuosity factor being greater for a denser structure and a more tortuose path 3 2 2 the significance of the mass transfer model the use of less detailed mass transfer model can lumps all neglected parameters such as ecps into membrane characteristics as discussed in 14 it may result in depletion of a value or enlargement of b and s values the difference becomes significant when some assumptions are not fully satisfied i e because of set up system limitations for instance ecps might be ignored when the applied cross flow velocity is substantially high i e 17 5 cm s but might not be applicable in other set ups like ours the maximum cross flow velocity in our set up was merely 4 6 cms 1 to prove our point on the importance of adopting appropriate mass transport models we employ eqs 9 10 that exclude ecps to fit our experimental data for obtaining hti membrane characteristics full data not shown we obtained a b and s by employing eq 9 and 10 of 0 29 0 33 and 0 31 respectively corresponding to 49 51 and 7 reductions from the ones obtained using eqs 5 8 summarized in table 3 the depletion in membrane transport properties occurs because they shoulder the transport resistance due to ecps the resistances are lumped to the membrane characteristics the extent of reduction is so large because of significant differences in cross flow velocity hence the extent of ecps for generality we suggest to employ the complete mass transport model that account for both ecps as in eqs 5 8 proposed by 14 the extent of ecps can be estimated using film theory 32 34 this way the flow conditions become universal and the applied flows are not limited to the ones that serve mass transport model assumptions i e high enough to depress the ecps inaccuracy during membrane parameters characterization may lead to wrong guideline in membrane and or membrane module developments the inclusion of ecps in the mass transport model leads to a more universal measurement condition the cross flow velocity is unnecessarily very high to eliminate the effect of ecp i e 25 cm s as suggested elsewhere 15 but can be adjusted to the capability of available set up 3 3 fouled membrane characterizations we propose an approach to assess membrane fouling in fo by quantifying its impact on the dynamic membranes form due to membrane fouling it is assume that foulant layer on in the membrane alters the pristine membrane properties of a b and or s that alteration can be reflected in the changes of their a b and s parameters from the pristine condition it is also assumed as will be proven later that the fouling in fo occurs in two main stages 1 a rapid and transient stage in the beginning in which the dynamic membrane properties change drastically followed by 2 a quasi steady state in the latter stage we assume that the dynamic membrane properties change slowly so that the fouled fo membrane properties are almost constant assessment of fouled membrane properties is very important for module design and full scale fo performance analyses the use of pristine membrane characteristic to judge module scale performance treating real feed undermines the impact of membrane fouling the impact of fouling cannot be ignored even for alfs configuration especially at high draw solute concentrations fig 2 if our two main assumptions above are valid it is possible to characterise the fouled membrane properties for the second stage to reflect membrane properties over a large part of operation time to assess the impact of membrane fouling the filtration test was performed in two parts for each membrane coupon filtration using tap water as the feed background followed by fouling solution 2 gl 1 bsa in tap water as the feeds the use of similar membrane coupon was chosen to avoid the interference from sample variations while the use of tap water conductivity 0 2 0 6 mscm 1 as background solution was to ensure the accuracy and precision of conductivity data the applied conductivity meter has a high accuracy for conductivity values below 1 mscm 1 this way we can obtain the pristine membrane parameters from background test and the fouled membrane parameters can be obtained from the fouling test membrane fouling is more profound in the alds than in the alfs modes fig 3 which is consistent with earlier reports 19 21 23 membrane fouling becomes significant at draw solution concentration between 1 and 2 m for alds and between 2 and 3 m for alds the degree of flux reductions was also much more severe for the former the data in fig 3 were used as inputs for least squared optimization to characterize both pristine and fouled membranes the proofs of our hypothesis for dividing two stages of fouling in fo are demonstrated in fig 4 the fouling in fo can be divided into 1 rapid decline of water for the first hour of operation followed by 2 a slow decline the rapid water flux decline is attributed to the rapid adsorption of foulant on the active layer membrane surface for the alfs mode and or rapid intrusion and consolidation of foulant into membrane support for the alds mode as suggested elsewhere 25 the slow water flux decline can be attributed due to concentration and dilution effects an inherent characteristic of the batch operation concentration of the feed and dilution of the draw solutions under this circumstance after the first stage the properties of the fouled fo membrane can be considered constant in another words the operation have reached queasy steady state condition and its transport properties can then be characterized using the single stage method the single stage protocol is the most appropriate to characterize fouled membrane properties because membrane fouling in fo is function of draw solute concentration see results in fig 3 while multiple filtration and multi stage protocols require different draw solute concentrations single stage protocol employs only single initial concentration that slightly changes during operations the change of the concentrations during the test using single stage protocol should be sufficient to generate reliable data for fouled membrane characterizations the changes of jw and js when treating fouling solution in fo can be translated into the changes of characterises reflected by a b and s from pristine to fouled conditions table 4 calculation method of a b and s for the fouled membrane was exactly the same as the method of the pristine membrane characterization the only difference is in the input of fluxes data the pristine membrane characterization uses all data from beginning to the end of the background filtration while the fouled membrane characterization uses the data of the later stage of filtration when cake layer was firstly formed fig 4 they were obtained from applying least squared optimization method remarkable changes of the transport properties occur as results of membrane fouling table 4 in accord with the filtration data in fig 3 the changes of membrane parameters are more profound for the alds than for the alfs modes because of the low nature of its fouling propensity the overall change on parameters for membranes operated in alfs mode is rather moderate 9 17 for alds mode in contrary the a values were reduced by 47 73 b values were reduced by 17 36 and the most profoundly the s values were increased by 5 645 a study by lay et al 26 demonstrated that a gel layer atop the active layer of fo membranes significantly reduces the reverse salt transport across an fo membrane operated in alfs mode in an osmotic membrane bioreactor process the ability to quantify the changes of the membrane properties can improve our understanding of membrane fouling mechanism on physical level further analyses of the changes in membrane parameters from pristine to fouled conditions can help to unravel membrane fouling mechanism in fo significant increment on s values for the fouled membrane used in the alds mode suggests that foulant increase support layer thickness when located externally or lower membrane support porosity when located internally the intrusion of the foulant into the support layer enables it to directly interact with the active layer and alters the a values in this case it substantially lowers the a values suggesting that the fouling most likely occurred internally it means that direct interactions between active layer and foulant in the support side result in detrimental impact on the transport properties of the active layer among all membranes one sample in the alfs mode shows peculiar results data from 2 m a increases while s decreases but overall have lower relative changes in alfs mode foulant is in direct contact with the active layers because of the dense nature of the active layer a full rejection of the foulant is then expected foulant then accumulate on the top of active layer and no change on s value between pristine and fouled membrane is expected nevertheless substantial changes on the s values are shown from 5 to 42 which are very unlikely the peculiar finding for the data on the fouled membranes operated in alfs mode can be ascribed by inaccuracy of the mass transfer model the mass transfer models used for the analyses eqs 5 8 are less accurate for the fouled membrane in the alfs mode those models neglected the presence of cake layer atop the active layer that can contribute to further enhancements of polarization concentration commonly known as cake enhanced concentration polarization 35 on the other hand the mass transport models are suitable for the fouled membrane in the alds mode it follows that the impact of fouling layer can be counted and reflected by the changes of the support layer properties i e decrease in porosity due to internal fouling 3 4 practical consideration the results demonstrated that all protocols can be used to characterize fo membrane parameters the accuracy of the protocols depends strongly on the accuracy of the experimental measurements the multiple filtration and the multi stage protocols more profoundly because of cumulative effect of a longer filtration duration have inherent limitation by allowing concentration of feed solution and in larger extent dilution of the draw solution when operated batch wise this effect is enhanced in a system with high jw and js coupled with small area of membrane sample and small volumes of feed and draw solutions for both protocols when operated batch wise the impact of dilution and concentration can be limited by performing the test as short as possible but still adequate for obtaining accurate jw and js data for the former this can be avoided by conducting the fo test in continuous wise for both the feed and the draw streams or only the draw stream as performed elsewhere 36 in contrary to the multiple filtration and multi stage protocols the single stage protocols lays on the occurrence of concentration and dilution effect to obtain variable values of jw and js therefore to obtain adequate experimental data the concentration and dilution effects must be amplified it can be done by several means minimize the volume of the draw solution enlarging membrane area increasing draw solute concentration etc selection of a protocol can be done base on the capability of an available set up without necessarily concern on the condition state in the fo ro method or multi stage filtration protocol nevertheless adoption of the mass transport model that includes ecps is strongly recommended 4 conclusions several protocols for data collection to determine fo membrane parameters via least square fitting method are addressed namely multiple filtration multi stage and single stage they only differ on the procedure to obtain the jw and js data those data are used as inputs for least squared optimization to characterize fo membrane parameters a b and s overall results demonstrate that all protocol are effective for fo membrane characterizations demonstrating the generality of the least square fitting method with e values of less than 11 variations of a b and s values obtained from the three protocols were less than 21 and 15 for ap and hti membranes respectively suggesting that they are all equally reliable it implies that generally any experimental protocol can be employed as long as it results in accurate data to improve the accuracy minimizing experimental error is necessary for example by conducting more repeats and by enlarging operational data ranges we also suggest to simultaneously inputting data from both alfs and alds modes during the optimization to ensure that the obtained parameters close to the actual values large variability of membrane properties among different samples suggests the importance of applying multiple samples the single stage protocol can also be used to characterize fouled membrane as expected the fouling was more severe for the alds mode than the alfs mode as also reflected by larger changes of their properties relative to their pristine conditions to analyse the membrane fouling more accurately in alfs test mode a revised mass transport model is needed this model should account

14513,this investigation handles the performance of ozone functionalized commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwnts based filters for benzene removal from aqueous solutions room temperature ozone treatment was used to modify and functionalize the surface of mwnts and enhance its adsorption property the enhancement of oxygen content as well as functional groups was confirmed by fourier transform infrared and dispersive electron x rays spectroscopy these functional groups in ozone treated mwnts filters were found to play a pivotal role to remove benzene from aqueous solutions it was found that compared to the pristine p mwnts the ozone functionalized mwnts o3 mwnts have a lower degree of entanglement and reduced nanotube diameters raman spectroscopy was used as a quantitative technique to make concentration measurements of benzene in aqueous solutions the removal efficiency of benzene by o3 mwnts could reach 99 the adsorption capacity of benzene by o3 mwnts could reach 193 mg g which is high compared with other adsorbents langmuir isotherm model and its characteristic parameters for benzene adsorption were determined a specific π π electronic interaction between benzene molecules and higher specific surface area of o3 mwnts was proposed as the adsorption mechanism o3 mwnts filters possess good potential applications for wastewater treatment and could be used for cleaning up environmental pollution keywords multiwalled carbon nanotubes filters ozone functionalization benzene removal aqueous solution raman spectrometry 1 introduction the pollution of water due to petroleum contaminants has been causing worldwide concern benzene is one of the most typical groundwater petroleum contaminants which have toxic and carcinogenic properties 1 2 benzene pollutes groundwater through the leakage from underground storage pipelines and improper waste disposal 3 there are concerns about adverse health effects of benzene including cancer respiratory problems and disruption of liver and kidney 4 a number of methods have been employed for the removal of these common petroleum contaminants from groundwater including bioremediation natural attenuation volatilization chemical oxidation as well as adsorption 5 6 however in practice the utilization of these removal processes on a large scale presents certain advantages and disadvantages as far as applicability efficiency and cost parameters are concerned carbon nanotubes cnts have numerous potential applications such as nanoscale electronic devices nanocomposite materials and wastewater treatment filters 7 9 however the application of as grown nanotubes is practically difficult due to the presence of impurities and the nonreactive nature of the cnt surface to overcome these problems the use of oxidation reactions is often utilized as a purification and chemical functionalization method for cleaning raw cnt which is useful for water treatment applications 9 cnts are promising organic adsorbents for environmental protection applications 10 12 the ozone oxidation is an alternative treatment to resolve the issues associated with the chemical oxidation 13 other methods of oxidation such as acid refluxing 14 16 require either long process times and are primarily bulk processes ozone oxidation has been shown to oxidize nanotubes at room temperature and can be performed on individual nanotubes besides low capital cost and sustainability 17 ozone improves surface properties of carbon nanotubes such as specific surface area pore volume and surface functional groups hemraj benny et al 2008 18 survived the effect of ozonolysis on the pore structure surface chemistry and bundling of single walled carbon nanotubes and found that ozonolysis likely opens end caps and introduces holes into the sidewalls of tubes which may occur through an oxidation of carbon atoms located on the nanotube surface resulting in the formation of oxygen containing functional groups previous reports showed that functionalized cnts are more effective for the removal of natural organic matter nom than activated carbon 19 raman spectroscopy is investigated as an alternative technique to determine benzene concentration in c6h6 h2o solutions 20 21 the oh stretch in the water molecule gives rise to a broad peak at about 3400 cm 1 using blue laser with wavelength 473 nm the most vibration modes centered at 992 cm 1 and 3067 cm 1 for ring stretch and ch stretch respectively the ring stretch peak at 3067 cm 1 is combined with the water spectrum and could disappear at low concentrations of benzene solution so in current study we interested in the ring vibration peak as its intensity is proportional to the number of benzene molecules this study aims to evaluate the performance of ozone functionalized cnt based filters for benzene removal and to determine the optimum conditions ph mwnt filter dose and benzene concentrations for removal efficiency this method is less time consuming than the other oxidation methods like hno3 treatment raman spectroscopy was applied as a new quantitative technique to estimate the removal efficiency as a function of benzene and distilled water peak intensities ratio 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of the functionalized taunit filter the initial material of the present study was an industrial carbon nanotube taunit m produced by nanotech tambov russia http www nanotc ru producrions 87 cnm taunit in a form of powder composed of grainy agglomerates of mwnts with a length of several micrometers average external diameters 15 25 nm and specific surface area bet 239 6 m2 g as provided by the manufacturer taunit m was compressed using high pressure piston to the form of circular tablet with the diameter 20 mm the thickness of 2 to 4 mm and masses from 0 1 to 0 3 g as optimum lower and higher filter masses 8 to perform the ozone functionalization of mwnt a flow of diluted ozone was generated under an ozone generator using pure oxygen as the gas source the tablet surface of mwnts taunit were placed in a quartz u type reactor and treated in a stream 12 l h of ozone oxygen mixture with ozone concentration in mixture about 90 mg l for reaction time 7 h at room temperature which are the optimum conditions for ozone treatment physical morphology and structure analysis of pristine and functionalized mwnt samples prepared as described as pervious was carried out using scanning electron microscope sem tescan with the digimizer software which applied to detect the diameter of the mwnts energy dispersive x ray eds equipped with sem was also performed to verify the enhancement of oxygen content in mwnts samples fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded using ifs 66 v s bruker ftir spectrometer the specific surface area of pristine mwnts used in this investigation was determined using nitrogen adsorption method was found to be 223 5 g m2 2 2 experimental conditions and benzene concentration analysis the filter design and the filtering system used in our investigations were reported before in 22 a solution of benzene for 500 as low concentration 1000 1500 1800 ppm solubility limit was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of benzene 98 purity purchased from sigma aldrich in distilled water high purity with resistivity not less than 18 mω cm the mixture was dissolved using an ultrasonic bath for 60 min and then stirred continuously for another 60 min at 25 c after shaking the solution was put in ultrasonic bath again for 30 min to study the effect of ph on the filtration of benzene ph of the solution was varied from 5 to 9 which is near the ph of tap water by using 1 m solution of nitric acid and 1 m solution of sodium hydroxide all of the batch experiments were performed in 50 ml syringe filtering system in each experiment various amounts of pristine and functionalized mwnts tablets from 0 1 to 0 3 g were placed in the syringe 50 ml of benzene solution with initial concentrations of 500 ppm for low concentration and 1800 ppm for high one were added for each concentration low or high the removal efficiency was studied with different ph varying from 5 to 9 before and after each filtration experiment benzene concentration was determined using raman spectroscopy nt mdt ntegra with a blue laser radiating at 473 nm and a power of about 10 mw the concentration of benzene in aqueous solution c was determined using the ratio between ring stretch peak of benzene ib and oh peak of distilled water ioh intensities as 1 c i b i o h normalizing the oh peak of water to 1 the concentration of benzene in aqueous solution c is proportional to the ring intensity peak of benzene ib the removal efficiency r of benzene from aqueous solutions is defined as 2 r c b 0 c b c b 0 100 a n d r i b 0 i b i b 0 100 where c b and cb are the concentrations of benzene in the solution initial and after filtration i b and ib are the peak intensities of benzene before and after filtration increasing the filtration volume and time the cb and r shall approach a certain saturation values cs and rs when a vacant adsorption sites will be exhausted and filtration process enters a dynamic equilibrium stage at this stage the adsorption capacity qs mg g can be estimated from 3 q s v c 0 c s m 4 q s v c s r s m where m in g is the mass of the adsorbent and v in l is the volume of the liquid solution 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of pristine and ozone functionalized mwnt filters morphology of the pristine taunit m p mwnts and ozone functionalized mwnts o3 mwnts was characterized by sem fig 1 and eds analysis fig 2 sem images show that o3 mwnts samples shows the same worm like bundling structure which resembles p mwnts fig 1a b this demonstrated that after ozone treatment the structure of long hollow tube is still preserved a clear decrease in nanotube diameters was observed after ozone functionalization in accordance with ling et al 23 that reduce the particle size and enhance the adsorption efficiency the specific surface area of mwnts after ozone treatment was about 300 g m2 which are high comparable with pristine one the eds analysis offers a quantitative study of the oxygen content of the functionalized mwnts due to the synthesis procedure mwnts as prepared contain a tiny oxygen content fig 2a it is clearly seen in fig 2b that the oxygen content increased due to functional groups as will be further supported by ftir analysis fig 3 a attaching carboxylic groups by ozone treatment increase the π π interaction between the benzene molecules and the o3 mwnts ftir spectrometry is investigated to account for the functional groups attached to mwnts produced by ozone oxidation process the ozone treated samples show new peaks in comparison with the ftir spectrum of the untreated one fig 3a this demonstrates that oxygen groups have been introduced on the nanotube surface similar observations of the ftir spectra for mwnt cooh were reported in 24 3 2 benzene concentration analysis using raman spectroscopy to investigate the benzene concentration in aqueous solution raman spectra of four concentrations were recorded three measurements for each concentration were made and the mean values of these measurements for each concentration was plotted fig 4 a the ratio of the benzene to h2o peak intensities versus the concentration of benzene in aqueous solution is plotted in fig 4b the plot shows well defined linear proportionality between the ratio and the concentration of benzene as it was expected 3 3 effect of concentration on removal efficiency of benzene and adsorption capacity a comparative study of the filtration efficiency of p mwnts and o3 mwnts filters is performed for benzene removal as a function of benzene concentration in aqueous solutions the effect of high concentration 1800 ppm and low concentration 500 ppm on the removal efficiency r of benzene was investigated at ph 7 at 1800 ppm concentration fig 5 a r is only 30 for 0 3 g p mwnts but for the same amount of o3 mwnts r increases to reach 65 for low concentration of 500 ppm fig 5b r of p mwnts could reach as high as 99 it is illustrated in fig 5b where the ch stretch peak of benzene at 3067 cm 1 practically disappeared after filtration as follows from the comparison of figs 5a b the removal efficiency decreases when the concentration of benzene aqueous solution increases high concentration limits benzene molecules transfer to o3 mwnt surfaces lu et al 14 used naocl oxidized cnts for benzene and toluene removal and obtained qualitatively similar results though a quantitative figure of efficiency was not reported for benzene concentration of 500 mg l which considered the saturation concentration and the volume of benzene solution 50 ml at ph 7 and 0 3 g filter mass using eqs 3 4 the adsorption capacity can be estimated as 162 5 mg g for p mwnts and 193 2 mg g for o3 mwnts which is high compared to the other adsorbents see table 1 this suggests that the o3 mwnts are efficient benzene adsorbents 3 4 effect of ph and filter dosage on removal efficiency of benzene benzene removal by o3 mwnt filters as a function of ph ranging from 5 to 9 which is a typical ph range for mostly industrial water for 500 ppm concentration and 0 3 g filter mass is given in fig 6 b it is evident that the removal efficiency is almost constant in this ph range to investigate the adsorption mechanism of benzene on o3 mwnts the solution ph was measured at the beginning and at the end of each filtration experiment since no significant ph variation during filtration 28 as well as direct connection between benzene adsorption and the presence of surface functional groups of the mwnts was observed fig 3b it can be suggested that the π π electron donor acceptor mechanism involving the carboxylic oxygen atom of the mwnts surface as electron donor and the aromatic ring of benzene as electron acceptor is responsible for the uptake of benzene by o3 mwnts furthermore the electrostatic interaction between the benzene molecules and the cnt surface may also explain the observation of high benzene adsorption via the o3 mwnts also the physical adsorption plays a critical role in the adsorption of benzene on the functionalized mwnts from fig 3b the functionalization process occurred at the surface active sites including caps and defects of p mwnts which were of high electron density thus preferentially reacted with ozone 29 attacked by ozone molecules caps and wall defects are etched away to a large extent and the surface of o3 mwnts becomes functionalized by carboxylic groups the ozone functionalization process enhances significantly the oxygen content and further alters the surface charges in agreement with existing literature 30 the impact of filter dosage on the removal efficiency was analyzed using different amount of adsorbents 0 1 to 0 3 g fig 6a represents the effect of filter dosage on removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of o3 mwnts mwnts treated with hno3 and p mwnts it is seen that with increase in the filter dosage the filtration efficiency increases indicating on creation of more active adsorption sites at higher filter dosage as a dominating mechanism of benzene removal the removal efficiency of o3 mwnt filter reaches the value as high as 99 for 0 3 g filter mass at ph 7 and 500 ppm concentration hno3 treated filters reach similar efficiency only at twice larger dosage proving the higher efficiency of o3 mwnt filters and the efficiencies of both o3 mwnts and hno3 treated filters are much higher than that of p mwnts one the preference o3 mwnts filters can be justified due to creation of more active adsorption sites besides the higher efficiency the advantage of the o3 treatment is that it is a dry and hence more environment friendly technology compared with hno3 economically the costs o3 mwnts filters are less than hno3 treated filters so o3 mwnts are low cost adsorbent and offer a promising technique for industrial wastewaters cleanup 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption capacity qe of benzene on the p mwnts and o3 mwnts were fitted by applying the langmuir isotherm model fig 7 31 eq 5 which is the usual model for aqueous phase adsorption this adsorption model gives a representation of the adsorption equilibrium between an adsorbate in solution and the surface active sites of the adsorbent 5 q e a b c e 1 b c e where qe mg g is the specific equilibrium amount of benzene adsorbed ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of benzene in aqueous solution a mg g is the maximal adsorption capacity and b is the langmuir constant l mg langmuir equation relates the coverage of molecules on a solid surface to concentration of a medium above the solid surface at a fixed temperature and adsorption is limited to monolayer coverage and intermolecular forces decrease with the distance from the adsorption surface from table 2 the value of a which represent the adsorption capacity a are significantly enhances after the ozone treatment of cnts which could be attributed to the increase of surface oxygen groups the a of p mwnts and o3 mwnts respectively are 200 5 260 5 mg g the constant b which is associated to the energy of interaction between benzene molecules and the cnt surface has the same trend as a indicating that o3 mwnts have a higher affinity for benzene adsorption than p mwnts a

the performance of cnt based filters for benzene removal functionalization of the cnt surface is essential feature ozone functionalized mwnts were used as an effective filters for benzene removal from aqueous solutions high removal efficiency reaching 99 was observed for functionalized mwnts filters and somewhat less about 87 for pristine mwnt filters for the solution with benzene concentration of 500 ppm and filter mass 0 3 g at ph 7 the ftir sem and eds analyses showed that the physicochemical properties of the mwnts such as structure and surface properties were greatly improved after functionalization which resulted in benzene adsorption enhancement by about 12 moreover it is presented that langmuir isotherm can be used to fit the data and estimate model parameters based on the dominated π π bond interaction mechanism between benzene and functionalized mwnt filters we concluded that these filters are efficient for benzene removal and could be a new kind of commercial filters

14513,this investigation handles the performance of ozone functionalized commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwnts based filters for benzene removal from aqueous solutions room temperature ozone treatment was used to modify and functionalize the surface of mwnts and enhance its adsorption property the enhancement of oxygen content as well as functional groups was confirmed by fourier transform infrared and dispersive electron x rays spectroscopy these functional groups in ozone treated mwnts filters were found to play a pivotal role to remove benzene from aqueous solutions it was found that compared to the pristine p mwnts the ozone functionalized mwnts o3 mwnts have a lower degree of entanglement and reduced nanotube diameters raman spectroscopy was used as a quantitative technique to make concentration measurements of benzene in aqueous solutions the removal efficiency of benzene by o3 mwnts could reach 99 the adsorption capacity of benzene by o3 mwnts could reach 193 mg g which is high compared with other adsorbents langmuir isotherm model and its characteristic parameters for benzene adsorption were determined a specific π π electronic interaction between benzene molecules and higher specific surface area of o3 mwnts was proposed as the adsorption mechanism o3 mwnts filters possess good potential applications for wastewater treatment and could be used for cleaning up environmental pollution keywords multiwalled carbon nanotubes filters ozone functionalization benzene removal aqueous solution raman spectrometry 1 introduction the pollution of water due to petroleum contaminants has been causing worldwide concern benzene is one of the most typical groundwater petroleum contaminants which have toxic and carcinogenic properties 1 2 benzene pollutes groundwater through the leakage from underground storage pipelines and improper waste disposal 3 there are concerns about adverse health effects of benzene including cancer respiratory problems and disruption of liver and kidney 4 a number of methods have been employed for the removal of these common petroleum contaminants from groundwater including bioremediation natural attenuation volatilization chemical oxidation as well as adsorption 5 6 however in practice the utilization of these removal processes on a large scale presents certain advantages and disadvantages as far as applicability efficiency and cost parameters are concerned carbon nanotubes cnts have numerous potential applications such as nanoscale electronic devices nanocomposite materials and wastewater treatment filters 7 9 however the application of as grown nanotubes is practically difficult due to the presence of impurities and the nonreactive nature of the cnt surface to overcome these problems the use of oxidation reactions is often utilized as a purification and chemical functionalization method for cleaning raw cnt which is useful for water treatment applications 9 cnts are promising organic adsorbents for environmental protection applications 10 12 the ozone oxidation is an alternative treatment to resolve the issues associated with the chemical oxidation 13 other methods of oxidation such as acid refluxing 14 16 require either long process times and are primarily bulk processes ozone oxidation has been shown to oxidize nanotubes at room temperature and can be performed on individual nanotubes besides low capital cost and sustainability 17 ozone improves surface properties of carbon nanotubes such as specific surface area pore volume and surface functional groups hemraj benny et al 2008 18 survived the effect of ozonolysis on the pore structure surface chemistry and bundling of single walled carbon nanotubes and found that ozonolysis likely opens end caps and introduces holes into the sidewalls of tubes which may occur through an oxidation of carbon atoms located on the nanotube surface resulting in the formation of oxygen containing functional groups previous reports showed that functionalized cnts are more effective for the removal of natural organic matter nom than activated carbon 19 raman spectroscopy is investigated as an alternative technique to determine benzene concentration in c6h6 h2o solutions 20 21 the oh stretch in the water molecule gives rise to a broad peak at about 3400 cm 1 using blue laser with wavelength 473 nm the most vibration modes centered at 992 cm 1 and 3067 cm 1 for ring stretch and ch stretch respectively the ring stretch peak at 3067 cm 1 is combined with the water spectrum and could disappear at low concentrations of benzene solution so in current study we interested in the ring vibration peak as its intensity is proportional to the number of benzene molecules this study aims to evaluate the performance of ozone functionalized cnt based filters for benzene removal and to determine the optimum conditions ph mwnt filter dose and benzene concentrations for removal efficiency this method is less time consuming than the other oxidation methods like hno3 treatment raman spectroscopy was applied as a new quantitative technique to estimate the removal efficiency as a function of benzene and distilled water peak intensities ratio 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of the functionalized taunit filter the initial material of the present study was an industrial carbon nanotube taunit m produced by nanotech tambov russia http www nanotc ru producrions 87 cnm taunit in a form of powder composed of grainy agglomerates of mwnts with a length of several micrometers average external diameters 15 25 nm and specific surface area bet 239 6 m2 g as provided by the manufacturer taunit m was compressed using high pressure piston to the form of circular tablet with the diameter 20 mm the thickness of 2 to 4 mm and masses from 0 1 to 0 3 g as optimum lower and higher filter masses 8 to perform the ozone functionalization of mwnt a flow of diluted ozone was generated under an ozone generator using pure oxygen as the gas source the tablet surface of mwnts taunit were placed in a quartz u type reactor and treated in a stream 12 l h of ozone oxygen mixture with ozone concentration in mixture about 90 mg l for reaction time 7 h at room temperature which are the optimum conditions for ozone treatment physical morphology and structure analysis of pristine and functionalized mwnt samples prepared as described as pervious was carried out using scanning electron microscope sem tescan with the digimizer software which applied to detect the diameter of the mwnts energy dispersive x ray eds equipped with sem was also performed to verify the enhancement of oxygen content in mwnts samples fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded using ifs 66 v s bruker ftir spectrometer the specific surface area of pristine mwnts used in this investigation was determined using nitrogen adsorption method was found to be 223 5 g m2 2 2 experimental conditions and benzene concentration analysis the filter design and the filtering system used in our investigations were reported before in 22 a solution of benzene for 500 as low concentration 1000 1500 1800 ppm solubility limit was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of benzene 98 purity purchased from sigma aldrich in distilled water high purity with resistivity not less than 18 mω cm the mixture was dissolved using an ultrasonic bath for 60 min and then stirred continuously for another 60 min at 25 c after shaking the solution was put in ultrasonic bath again for 30 min to study the effect of ph on the filtration of benzene ph of the solution was varied from 5 to 9 which is near the ph of tap water by using 1 m solution of nitric acid and 1 m solution of sodium hydroxide all of the batch experiments were performed in 50 ml syringe filtering system in each experiment various amounts of pristine and functionalized mwnts tablets from 0 1 to 0 3 g were placed in the syringe 50 ml of benzene solution with initial concentrations of 500 ppm for low concentration and 1800 ppm for high one were added for each concentration low or high the removal efficiency was studied with different ph varying from 5 to 9 before and after each filtration experiment benzene concentration was determined using raman spectroscopy nt mdt ntegra with a blue laser radiating at 473 nm and a power of about 10 mw the concentration of benzene in aqueous solution c was determined using the ratio between ring stretch peak of benzene ib and oh peak of distilled water ioh intensities as 1 c i b i o h normalizing the oh peak of water to 1 the concentration of benzene in aqueous solution c is proportional to the ring intensity peak of benzene ib the removal efficiency r of benzene from aqueous solutions is defined as 2 r c b 0 c b c b 0 100 a n d r i b 0 i b i b 0 100 where c b and cb are the concentrations of benzene in the solution initial and after filtration i b and ib are the peak intensities of benzene before and after filtration increasing the filtration volume and time the cb and r shall approach a certain saturation values cs and rs when a vacant adsorption sites will be exhausted and filtration process enters a dynamic equilibrium stage at this stage the adsorption capacity qs mg g can be estimated from 3 q s v c 0 c s m 4 q s v c s r s m where m in g is the mass of the adsorbent and v in l is the volume of the liquid solution 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of pristine and ozone functionalized mwnt filters morphology of the pristine taunit m p mwnts and ozone functionalized mwnts o3 mwnts was characterized by sem fig 1 and eds analysis fig 2 sem images show that o3 mwnts samples shows the same worm like bundling structure which resembles p mwnts fig 1a b this demonstrated that after ozone treatment the structure of long hollow tube is still preserved a clear decrease in nanotube diameters was observed after ozone functionalization in accordance with ling et al 23 that reduce the particle size and enhance the adsorption efficiency the specific surface area of mwnts after ozone treatment was about 300 g m2 which are high comparable with pristine one the eds analysis offers a quantitative study of the oxygen content of the functionalized mwnts due to the synthesis procedure mwnts as prepared contain a tiny oxygen content fig 2a it is clearly seen in fig 2b that the oxygen content increased due to functional groups as will be further supported by ftir analysis fig 3 a attaching carboxylic groups by ozone treatment increase the π π interaction between the benzene molecules and the o3 mwnts ftir spectrometry is investigated to account for the functional groups attached to mwnts produced by ozone oxidation process the ozone treated samples show new peaks in comparison with the ftir spectrum of the untreated one fig 3a this demonstrates that oxygen groups have been introduced on the nanotube surface similar observations of the ftir spectra for mwnt cooh were reported in 24 3 2 benzene concentration analysis using raman spectroscopy to investigate the benzene concentration in aqueous solution raman spectra of four concentrations were recorded three measurements for each concentration were made and the mean values of these measurements for each concentration was plotted fig 4 a the ratio of the benzene to h2o peak intensities versus the concentration of benzene in aqueous solution is plotted in fig 4b the plot shows well defined linear proportionality between the ratio and the concentration of benzene as it was expected 3 3 effect of concentration on removal efficiency of benzene and adsorption capacity a comparative study of the filtration efficiency of p mwnts and o3 mwnts filters is performed for benzene removal as a function of benzene concentration in aqueous solutions the effect of high concentration 1800 ppm and low concentration 500 ppm on the removal efficiency r of benzene was investigated at ph 7 at 1800 ppm concentration fig 5 a r is only 30 for 0 3 g p mwnts but for the same amount of o3 mwnts r increases to reach 65 for low concentration of 500 ppm fig 5b r of p mwnts could reach as high as 99 it is illustrated in fig 5b where the ch stretch peak of benzene at 3067 cm 1 practically disappeared after filtration as follows from the comparison of figs 5a b the removal efficiency decreases when the concentration of benzene aqueous solution increases high concentration limits benzene molecules transfer to o3 mwnt surfaces lu et al 14 used naocl oxidized cnts for benzene and toluene removal and obtained qualitatively similar results though a quantitative figure of efficiency was not reported for benzene concentration of 500 mg l which considered the saturation concentration and the volume of benzene solution 50 ml at ph 7 and 0 3 g filter mass using eqs 3 4 the adsorption capacity can be estimated as 162 5 mg g for p mwnts and 193 2 mg g for o3 mwnts which is high compared to the other adsorbents see table 1 this suggests that the o3 mwnts are efficient benzene adsorbents 3 4 effect of ph and filter dosage on removal efficiency of benzene benzene removal by o3 mwnt filters as a function of ph ranging from 5 to 9 which is a typical ph range for mostly industrial water for 500 ppm concentration and 0 3 g filter mass is given in fig 6 b it is evident that the removal efficiency is almost constant in this ph range to investigate the adsorption mechanism of benzene on o3 mwnts the solution ph was measured at the beginning and at the end of each filtration experiment since no significant ph variation during filtration 28 as well as direct connection between benzene adsorption and the presence of surface functional groups of the mwnts was observed fig 3b it can be suggested that the π π electron donor acceptor mechanism involving the carboxylic oxygen atom of the mwnts surface as electron donor and the aromatic ring of benzene as electron acceptor is responsible for the uptake of benzene by o3 mwnts furthermore the electrostatic interaction between the benzene molecules and the cnt surface may also explain the observation of high benzene adsorption via the o3 mwnts also the physical adsorption plays a critical role in the adsorption of benzene on the functionalized mwnts from fig 3b the functionalization process occurred at the surface active sites including caps and defects of p mwnts which were of high electron density thus preferentially reacted with ozone 29 attacked by ozone molecules caps and wall defects are etched away to a large extent and the surface of o3 mwnts becomes functionalized by carboxylic groups the ozone functionalization process enhances significantly the oxygen content and further alters the surface charges in agreement with existing literature 30 the impact of filter dosage on the removal efficiency was analyzed using different amount of adsorbents 0 1 to 0 3 g fig 6a represents the effect of filter dosage on removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of o3 mwnts mwnts treated with hno3 and p mwnts it is seen that with increase in the filter dosage the filtration efficiency increases indicating on creation of more active adsorption sites at higher filter dosage as a dominating mechanism of benzene removal the removal efficiency of o3 mwnt filter reaches the value as high as 99 for 0 3 g filter mass at ph 7 and 500 ppm concentration hno3 treated filters reach similar efficiency only at twice larger dosage proving the higher efficiency of o3 mwnt filters and the efficiencies of both o3 mwnts and hno3 treated filters are much higher than that of p mwnts one the preference o3 mwnts filters can be justified due to creation of more active adsorption sites besides the higher efficiency the advantage of the o3 treatment is that it is a dry and hence more environment friendly technology compared with hno3 economically the costs o3 mwnts filters are less than hno3 treated filters so o3 mwnts are low cost adsorbent and offer a promising technique for industrial wastewaters cleanup 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption capacity qe of benzene on the p mwnts and o3 mwnts were fitted by applying the langmuir isotherm model fig 7 31 eq 5 which is the usual model for aqueous phase adsorption this adsorption model gives a representation of the adsorption equilibrium between an adsorbate in solution and the surface active sites of the adsorbent 5 q e a b c e 1 b c e where qe mg g is the specific equilibrium amount of benzene adsorbed ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of benzene in aqueous solution a mg g is the maximal adsorption capacity and b is the langmuir constant l mg langmuir equation relates the coverage of molecules on a solid surface to concentration of a medium above the solid surface at a fixed temperature and adsorption is limited to monolayer coverage and intermolecular forces decrease with the distance from the adsorption surface from table 2 the value of a which represent the adsorption capacity a are significantly enhances after the ozone treatment of cnts which could be attributed to the increase of surface oxygen groups the a of p mwnts and o3 mwnts respectively are 200 5 260 5 mg g the constant b which is associated to the energy of interaction between benzene molecules and the cnt surface has the same trend as a indicating that o3 mwnts have a higher affinity for benzene adsorption than p mwnts a dimensionless constant called separation factor or equilibrium parameter rl langmuir adsorption isotherm parameter which is expressed by the following relationship 32 6 r l 1 1 b c i where ci is the initial concentration the value of rl indicated the type of langmuir isotherm to be irreversible rl 0 linear rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 or favorable 0 rl 1 32 the rl values between 0 and 1 indicate favorable adsorption the rl value in the present investigation was found to be 0 946 for o3 mwnts showing that the adsorption of benzene ion on o3 mwnts is favorable 4 conclusions in order to enhance the performance of cnt based filters for benzene removal functionalization of the cnt surface is essential feature ozone functionalized mwnts were used as an effective filters for benzene removal from aqueous solutions high removal efficiency reaching 99 was observed for functionalized mwnts filters and somewhat less about 87 for pristine mwnt filters for the solution with benzene concentration of

14514,in this work photodegradation of a synthetic textile wastewater composed of a mixture of three reactive azo dyes ro 122 rr 195 and ry 145 was performed using silver doped zinc oxide ag zno thin films the photocatalyst preparation was conducted through sol gel method and was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx and ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy the photocatalytic activity of ag zno thin film was assessed by measuring the decolorization rate constant of the dyes mixture spectrophotometrically the chemical structure of each dye influences the photodegradation rate either in mixture or in individual dyes solutions several parameters which influence photocatalytic degradation such as catalyst dose dyes concentrations as well as addition of hydrogen peroxide as an electron acceptor have been studied the results revealed that these parameters should be optimized to obtain the maximum photocatalytic degradation keywords zno thin film silver photocatalysis textile wastewater azo dyes 1 introduction textile industry is one of the industries that consumes large amounts of fresh water in the processing operations it also discharges colored water that obstruct the light transmittance in water and therefore causes an imbalance in the ecosystem 1 currently great majority of synthetic dyes used in the industry belongs to azo derivatives 2 at the time that the strong stability of azo derivatives dyes considers a great advantage in the dying process discharging of these dyes to the aquatic environment causes many problems because of their high toxicity and heavy color 3 therefore efficient treatment processes are required to reuse the high amounts of consumed water and to preserve the environment as well many researchers tried to develop effective and economical techniques for the treatment of dye containing wastewater 4 6 photocatalysis had been attracting growing attention for the degradation of organic dyes 7 8 due to its fruitful features such as ability for full decomposition of various organic pollutants present in water and wastewater within short time no formation of persistent by products and accessibility of scaling up 9 11 this technique is based on the generation of powerful oxidizing species e g hydroxyl radicals during the photon irradiation on the surface of a semiconducting material which decompose the organic pollutants although photocatalysis possesses various advantages many researchers imputed the limited rate of photocatalytic degradation to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs 12 13 recently borthakur and das 2018 have studied the photodegradation efficiency of nis2 rgo and cos rgo nanocomposite toward azo dye congo red cr under natural sunlight irradiation 14 they have found that the photocatalytic efficiency increased by 40 higher than nis2 and cos nanoparticles without reduced graphene oxide rgo support and they have attributed that to the presence of rgo sheets which prevent the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes in our previous work 15 we proved the enhanced photocatalytic activity of zno thin film when doped with silver this was attributed to the ability of silver nanoparticles to reduce the electron hole recombination rate by attracting the positively charged holes and hence increases the lifetime of the electrons in the conduction band which in turn improves the photocatalytic properties of zno on the other hand several studies have used peroxides such as h2o2 successfully as strong oxidants and electron scavengers 16 18 all of these researches have reported that addition of h2o2 enhances the rate constant of photodegradation reaction and they ascribed this improvement to reaction of h2o2 with the electrons of conduction band producing very reactive hydroxyl radicals which oxidize most of the organic pollutants according to the equations 1 h 2 o 2 e o h o h 2 o h o r g a n i c c o m p o u n d m i n e r a l i z e d c o m p o u n d however increasing of hydrogen peroxide concentration so much may decrease the rate of photocatalytic degradation due to scavenging effect 19 although photocatalysts are usually used in powder form to maintain high surface to volume ratio they suffer from many limitations during the application such as difficult separation of the powder from the system after degradation process and aggregation of catalyst particles during stirring which reduces the photocatalyst efficiency coating the photocatalysts on various substrates can overcome the problems associated with powder systems thin film shape photocatalyst can improve the transmittance of light and prevent its scattering leading to enhanced reaction efficiency moreover it can be easily removed after photodegradation process 20 in this paper we used 6 wt ag zno thin film prepared by sol gel spin coating method for degradation of three azo dyes rr195 ry145 and ro122 present together in a mixture as a synthetic textile wastewater all photocatalytic experiments were carried out under simulated solar irradiation effects of different operational conditions such as catalyst dose initial concentration of the dyes and addition of oxidants like hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on the photocatalytic reaction have been investigated 2 experimental 2 1 materials zinc acetate dihydrate silver nitrate diethanolamine isopropanol and hydrogen peroxide solution 30 w w were purchased from sigma aldrich company reactive red 195 rr195 reactive yellow 145 ry145 and reactive orange 122 ro122 dyes were kindly supplied by a local factory for dyes for the chemical structure see figure s1 in supplementary information naoh and hcl solutions were used for ph adjustment double distilled water was used throughout this study for the preparation of dyes solutions 2 2 catalyst preparation the photocatalyst was prepared by sol gel spin coating method 21 zno solution was prepared from the mixture of zinc acetate dehydrate as a precursor solution isopropanol as a solvent and diethanolamine as a stabilizer the molar ratio of diethanolamine zinc acetate dihydrate was maintained at 1 1 in a typical experiment 8 78 g 0 04 mol of zinc acetate were dissolved in 50 ml of isopropanol and stirred for 30 min to obtain solution a solution b was prepared by dissolving 0 245 g 0 0014 mol of silver nitrate in 50 ml of isopropanol and stirred for 30 min both solutions were mixed together in order to yield 6 ag zn weight ratio the thin film photocatalyst was deposited by sol gel spin coating method onto glass substrates pre cleaned by detergent ethanol acetone and finally with distilled water and then sonicated using bandelin sonorex rk100 for 10 min in water and then dried for film formation the sol solution was dropped within 30 s onto a glass substrate rotating at 2000 rpm using the spin coater at room temperature the obtained films were then dried at 100 c for 10 min in order to remove the solvent this procedure was repeated seven times to obtain a homogeneous film then annealed in air at 450 c for 1 h in a tubular furnace pure zno thin film photocatalyst was prepared according to the same procedure without the addition of silver nitrate 2 3 thin film characterization the crystal structure of the prepared thin films was characterized using a phillips pw3719 x pert materials research x ray diffractometer xrd using cukα radiation λ 1 5418 ǻ radiation and a scanning range of 2θ between 25 and 70 the thickness of films was measured using dektak 150 stylus profilmeter which has capability to measure thin film thickness with an error 10 angstroms optical transmittance spectra were recorded using uv vis nir spectrophotometer jasco 760 over the wavelength range between 200 and 2500 nm from the transmission spectra the absorption coefficient α was calculated using the following formula 3 α l n t d where t is the optical transmittance and d is thickness of the film 0 2 μm by using the absorption coefficient α and for the direct transitions the optical band gaps eg of our film can be calculated by using the conventional tauc equation 4 α h ν 2 a h ν e g where a is a constant eg is the direct optical band gap energy hν is the incident photon energy the surface morphology of the films morphologies was examined by scanning electron microscope sem xl30tmp energy dispersive x ray analysis edx by electron probe microanalyzer model jeol jxa 840 a which utilized was used to examine the composition of the films 2 4 photocatalytic measurement photocatalytic efficiencies of the obtained thin films were evaluated by measuring the color fading of a mixture from the three mentioned dyes in a typical experiment 75 ml of the dyes mixture were placed in a glass petri dish a catalyst of square geometry 6 25 cm2 was immersed in the dyes solution adjusted at ph 7 the thin film was located to face the irradiation source hqi t 400 w daylight lamp osram germany the luminous flux of irradiation was 20 000 lm with luminous efficacy of 82 lm w the distance between surface of the dye solution and the lamp was fixed at 15 cm the typical set up scheme is presented in figure s2 in the supplementary information after immersing the thin film into the dyes solution and prior to start irradiation the solution was allowed to be in a contact with the photocatalyst for 60 min in the dark to allow the adsorption desorption equilibrium on the photocatalyst surface then the lamp was switched on to start the photodegradation process certain quantities of aliquot were collected at regular intervals under dark and irradiation conditions color removal was monitored by measuring the light absorbance versus wavelength using uv vis spectrophotometer jasco v630 japan in a control experiment the dyes solution was directly irradiated for 1 h in absence of the photocatalyst i e photolysis process 3 result and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst properties the crystal structures of zno and 6 wt ag zno thin films were confirmed using xrd as presented in fig 1 a the xrd pattern for zno thin film can be indexed as a hexagonal wurtzite structure jcpds card number 36 1451 the xrd pattern for 6 wt ag zno thin film revealed three noticeable peaks at 2θ 38 1 44 2 and 64 4 which can be assigned to the most intense diffraction planes of metallic silver jcpds card number 4 0783 it is well known that ag can be incorporated into the zno lattice either as a substitute for zn2 ion or as an interstitial atom this can be examined by monitoring the diffraction peak position of zno the remarkable shift to lower or higher 2θ can be ascribed to substitutional or interstitial incorporation respectively 22 23 on the other hand ag can be segregated to the grain boundaries of zno crystal without any observed positional shift in 2θ values which indicates the formation of ag cluster 24 according to our results it can be seen that incorporation of ag resulted in a shift of the zno peak position to lower 2θ value from 36 29 to 36 21 for zno and 6 wt ag zno respectively the reason could be because of the difference in ionic radii between zn2 0 72 a and ag 1 22 a where the other part of ag atoms segregated to the grain boundaries of zno crystal which indicates the formation of ag cluster which appeared as separated ag peaks fig 1b shows the transmittance spectra for zno and 6 wt ag zno thin films it is observed that the absorption edge shifted to longer wavelength red shift after the insertion of ag as a result the transmittance decreased from 93 to 60 by ag addition this could be due to the grain boundary scattering and the surface plasmonic resonance spr of ag nanoparticles which improved the absorption of light in the visible region 25 the spr is very clear in case of increasing the ag content in the zno matrix as shown in figure s3 in supplementary information the optical band gap energies eg of the thin films were determined by extrapolation of the linear portion of αhν 2 curve where α is the absorption coefficient versus the photon energy hν as presented in fig 1c eg was found to be 3 30 ev for the pure zno thin film and reduced to 3 21 ev for 6 wt ag zno thin film the reduction of eg by addition of ag may be indicated that ag has substituted the zn in the lattice which confirmed by xrd results discussed above that creates oxygen vacancies due to the valence difference between ag and zn2 the created oxygen vacancies play an important role in the narrowing of eg because they act as trap centers that reduce the recombination rate of photo generated charge carriers by capturing the electrons 26 furthermore ag states may interact with zno host states leading to creating energy levels in zno band gap which reduce its optical band gap 27 the reduction of band gap energy is expected to improve the photocatalytic properties of zno by widen the spectrum of the visible light response sem micrographs presented in fig 2 a b show the surface morphology of zno and 6 wt ag zno thin films the sem images clearly show the deposition of ag into the zno surface as a white cluster as reported by other studies 28 29 edx analysis was used as a direct method to determine the thin film composition the edx patterns for zno and 6 wt ag zno thin films are shown in fig 2 c d respectively it is observed that only zn and o elements were detected in pure zno film while ag element was noticed in addition to zn and o elements in case of 6 wt ag zno 3 2 photocatalytic degradation according to our previous work the addition of silver improved the photocatalytic activity of zno as one can see in fig 3 the degradation rate constant k of ro 122 rr 195 and ry 145 always higher in case of 6 wt ag zno than pure zno 13 the enhancement in the photocatalytic activity could be due to better charge separation caused by silver atoms based on these results 6 ag zno was selected for the photocatalytic degradation of a mixture of three azo dyes as a synthetic textile waste water uv vis spectra of the commercial dyes used in this study and the photocatalytic degradation of their mixture are presented in fig 4 and figure s4 in supplementary information respectively it is obvious that there are overlap among the maximum absorption peaks of the studied dyes in order to follow the degradation of each dye during the reaction course mathematical equations have been derived using three solutions of different dyes concentration according to the literature 30 as follows solution 1 5 mg l ro 122 2 mg l ry 145 1 mg l rr 195 solution 2 2 mg l ro 122 1 mg l ry 145 5 mg l rr 195 solution 3 1 mg l ro 122 5 mg l ry 145 2 mg l rr 195 the absorption of each solution at the wavelength of maximum absorption λmax of each dye can be represented as follows 5 a b s 1 a 1 c a 1 b 1 c b 1 c 1 c c 1 6 a b s 2 a 1 c a 2 b 1 c b 2 c 1 c c 2 7 a b s 3 a 1 c a 3 b 1 c b 3 c 1 c c 3 8 a b s n a 1 c a n b 1 c b n c 1 c c n where absn is the absorbance of solution n at λ1 can is the concentration of ro 122 dye in solution n cbn is the concentration of ry 145 dye in solution n and ccn is the concentration of rr 195 dye in solution n therefore the contribution of each dye a1 b1 and c1 can be estimated at each wavelength accordingly the following mathematical relationships could be estimated 9 a b s 420 n m 7 2 x 10 3 c a 8 3 x 10 3 c b 4 3 x 10 3 c c 10 a b s 487 n m 4 5 x 10 3 c a 13 5 x 10 3 c b 12 5 x 10 3 c c 11 a b s 540 n m 3 x 10 3 c a 2 87 x 10 3 c b 18 1 x 10 3 c c it was important to measure the effect of the irradiation on the degradation of the dyes mixture in absence of the catalyst photolysis in addition adsorption of the dyes at the surface of catalyst had been measured the adsorption was determined by allowing the dye solution or a mixture of the three dyes to be contacted with the catalyst in the dark for 60 min the results figure s5 in supplementary information showed that both of photolysis and adsorption produced only 1 color removal therefore their influence on the dyes degradation could be neglected 3 2 1 effect of catalyst dose catalyst dose is a crucial factor which should not exceed a specific limit during the wastewater treatment to avoid adding excess catalyst amount that has a negative effect on the performance of the treatment process as well as on the final cost in this study catalyst dose was expressed in terms of number of glass slides carrying the photoactive thin film each thin film slide has square area 6 25 cm2 the change in each dye concentration during the photodegradation reaction of the dye mixture was calculated using eqs 9 11 and presented in fig 5 a c the kinetics of this reaction was found to follow the pseudo first order model the dependence of first order kinetic constant on the photocatalyst dose is presented in fig 5d it is obvious that the decolorization rate constant increases with the increase of the photoactive thin film area a possible explanation is that by increasing the area of thin film in the reaction medium the amount of catalyst exposed to light increases leading to activation of higher number of active sites this subsequently produces more oh radicals which enhances the photocatalytic efficiency 31 in case of powder shape photocatalyst the rate constant of photodegradation process increases by adding more catalyst until reaching a specific value then the rate decreases this performance is due to the high turbidity caused by photocatalyst particles in solution therefore the light path inside the photoreactor could be obstructed by the photocatalyst itself which defined as shielding effect 32 also at high concentration of powder photocatalyst many small particles tend to aggregate together forming larger particles with smaller surface area and less active sites which also decline the photocatalytic activity on contrary in case of thin film photocatalyst there is neither aggregation of catalyst particles nor shielding of photons as a result increasing the catalyst amount in case of thin film shape could lead to a continuous increase in the reaction rate it is worth noting also that decolorization rate constants fig 5d follow the order ro 122 rr 195 ry 145 this behavior depends mainly on the chemical structure of each dye see figure s1 in the supplementary information for instance ry 145 is the least degradable dye where it contains conh2 group that make resonance with azo group giving more stabilization this decreases the ability of oh radical to attack the azo group rr195 dye contains five electophilic sulfo groups so3na compared to only four groups in case of ro122 causing difficulty for the addition reaction of oh radical to the azo group therefore ro122 is more susceptible to oh radical attack than rr 195 that exists in the same solution 3 2 2 effect of dye concentration the effect of initial dyes concentration on the rate constant of the reaction and on the percentage of color removal is another important factor in the treatment of textile wastewater therefore the effect of initial dyes concentration in a mixture was studied by varying the initial concentration from 5 to 15 mg l for each dye in the mixture the obtained results are represented in fig 6 the rate of decolorization was found to decrease with increasing the initial dyes concentration similar results were observed by rajabi et al 33 during the photocatalytic degradation of methyl violet dye using zns quantum dots a possible explanation for this behavior is that as the initial dye concentration increases the path length of photons entering the solution decreases and the opposite is true in case of low initial dyes concentration 34 by that means the number of photons absorbed by the catalyst increases in diluted dye solutions 35 furthermore the high initial dye concentration requires large amount of catalyst to be degraded since the illumination time and amount of catalyst are constant the oh radicals generated on the surface of the catalyst is also constant therefore the relative number of free radicals attacking the dye molecules decreases with increase the initial dye concentration 3 2 3 comparison between the photoctalytic degradation behaviors of individual and mixed dyes fig 7 shows the decolorization behavior of each dye in case of individual solutions compared to its behavior with other dyes in a mixture generally the decolorization rate constant of individual dyes is higher than that when the dye exists in a mixture in particular for the dyes ry 145 and rr 195 in case of dyes mixture there is a competition among the three dyes for the reaction with the same amount of oh radicals produced by the photocatalyst therefore each dye may react with less number of oh radicals than it may do when presents as individual it is worth noting that the difference in decolorization behavior between individual and mixed dyes follows the order ry 145 rr 195 ro 122 this order is the reverse to the dye susceptibility to oh attack deduced from the chemical structures since ro 122 dye is the most susceptible dye for oh attack it is expected that this dye will consume the largest portion of photogenerated oh and will not be significantly affected by the presence of other dyes in the mixture other dyes are expected to obey the same rule 3 2 4 effect of hydrogen peroxide addition addition of h2o2 was considered by many researchers as a promoter for the photocatalysis process 36 37 38 thereby the photocatalytic degradation of the dyes mixture has been studied at different hydrogen peroxide quantities in the range of 0 005 0 16 ml 20 700 mg l according to the results presented in figs 8 and 9 the decolorization rate of dyes increases with the increase of h2o2 volume up to 0 010 ml 45 mg l beyond this concentration the rate decreases the higher reaction rate after the addition of hydrogen peroxide could be due to the increase in the concentration of oh radical generated from h2o2 itself this is because h2o2 produces reactive oh radicals rapidly under illumination eq 12 39 the oxidizing power of these radicals is strong enough to break the azo groups in the reactive dyes leading to the formation of ammonium and nitrate ions 12 h 2 o 2 h ν 2 o h at higher h2o2 dosage a remarkable decrease has been observed in the decolourization rate and therefore on the degradation efficiency of the three dyes this could be explained as at high h2o2 concentration the oh radicals can scavenge the hydrogen peroxide producing h o 2 radicals which are less active than oh therefore the number of oh radicals which is responsible for degradation of organic molecules decreases according to eq 13 40 13 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o conclusively in order to keep the efficiency of the added hydrogen peroxide it was necessary to adjust the proper dosage of hydrogen peroxide the obtained results consistent with the previously reported studies 18 38 4 conclusions 6 wt ag zno thin film was used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of dyes mixture composed of three azo dyes ro 122 rr 195 and ry 145 as a synthetic textile wastewater there are several parameters affect the photocatalytic degradation process such as catalyst dose dye concentration and addition of h2o2 the results showed that increased catalyst dose produced more surface area available for oh radicals and consequently increases the rate of reaction the increase of dye concentration decreases the rate of reaction because of the photons entering the solution can be interrupted by the large number of dye molecules presented in the solution leading to a reduction in the rate of degradation finally the optimum quantity of h2o2 45 mg l causes an increase in the rate or photodegradation reaction while by addition of larger quantity the rate decreases

14514,in this work photodegradation of a synthetic textile wastewater composed of a mixture of three reactive azo dyes ro 122 rr 195 and ry 145 was performed using silver doped zinc oxide ag zno thin films the photocatalyst preparation was conducted through sol gel method and was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx and ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy the photocatalytic activity of ag zno thin film was assessed by measuring the decolorization rate constant of the dyes mixture spectrophotometrically the chemical structure of each dye influences the photodegradation rate either in mixture or in individual dyes solutions several parameters which influence photocatalytic degradation such as catalyst dose dyes concentrations as well as addition of hydrogen peroxide as an electron acceptor have been studied the results revealed that these parameters should be optimized to obtain the maximum photocatalytic degradation keywords zno thin film silver photocatalysis textile wastewater azo dyes 1 introduction textile industry is one of the industries that consumes large amounts of fresh water in the processing operations it also discharges colored water that obstruct the light transmittance in water and therefore causes an imbalance in the ecosystem 1 currently great majority of synthetic dyes used in the industry belongs to azo derivatives 2 at the time that the strong stability of azo derivatives dyes considers a great advantage in the dying process discharging of these dyes to the aquatic environment causes many problems because of their high toxicity and heavy color 3 therefore efficient treatment processes are required to reuse the high amounts of consumed water and to preserve the environment as well many researchers tried to develop effective and economical techniques for the treatment of dye containing wastewater 4 6 photocatalysis had been attracting growing attention for the degradation of organic dyes 7 8 due to its fruitful features such as ability for full decomposition of various organic pollutants present in water and wastewater within short time no formation of persistent by products and accessibility of scaling up 9 11 this technique is based on the generation of powerful oxidizing species e g hydroxyl radicals during the photon irradiation on the surface of a semiconducting material which decompose the organic pollutants although photocatalysis possesses various advantages many researchers imputed the limited rate of photocatalytic degradation to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs 12 13 recently borthakur and das 2018 have studied the photodegradation efficiency of nis2 rgo and cos rgo nanocomposite toward azo dye congo red cr under natural sunlight irradiation 14 they have found that the photocatalytic efficiency increased by 40 higher than nis2 and cos nanoparticles without reduced graphene oxide rgo support and they have attributed that to the presence of rgo sheets which prevent the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes in our previous work 15 we proved the enhanced photocatalytic activity of zno thin film when doped with silver this was attributed to the ability of silver nanoparticles to reduce the electron hole recombination rate by attracting the positively charged holes and hence increases the lifetime of the electrons in the conduction band which in turn improves the photocatalytic properties of zno on the other hand several studies have used peroxides such as h2o2 successfully as strong oxidants and electron scavengers 16 18 all of these researches have reported that addition of h2o2 enhances the rate constant of photodegradation reaction and they ascribed this improvement to reaction of h2o2 with the electrons of conduction band producing very reactive hydroxyl radicals which oxidize most of the organic pollutants according to the equations 1 h 2 o 2 e o h o h 2 o h o r g a n i c c o m p o u n d m i n e r a l i z e d c o m p o u n d however increasing of hydrogen peroxide concentration so much may decrease the rate of photocatalytic degradation due to scavenging effect 19 although photocatalysts are usually used in powder form to maintain high surface to volume ratio they suffer from many limitations during the application such as difficult separation of the powder from the system after degradation process and aggregation of catalyst particles during stirring which reduces the photocatalyst efficiency coating the photocatalysts on various substrates can overcome the problems associated with powder systems thin film shape photocatalyst can improve the transmittance of light and prevent its scattering leading to enhanced reaction efficiency moreover it can be easily removed after photodegradation process 20 in this paper we used 6 wt ag zno thin film prepared by sol gel spin coating method for degradation of three azo dyes rr195 ry145 and ro122 present together in a mixture as a synthetic textile wastewater all photocatalytic experiments were carried out under simulated solar irradiation effects of different operational conditions such as catalyst dose initial concentration of the dyes and addition of oxidants like hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on the photocatalytic reaction have been investigated 2 experimental 2 1 materials zinc acetate dihydrate silver nitrate diethanolamine isopropanol and hydrogen peroxide solution 30 w w were purchased from sigma aldrich company reactive red 195 rr195 reactive yellow 145 ry145 and reactive orange 122 ro122 dyes were kindly supplied by a local factory for dyes for the chemical structure see figure s1 in supplementary information naoh and hcl solutions were used for ph adjustment double distilled water was used throughout this study for the preparation of dyes solutions 2 2 catalyst preparation the photocatalyst was prepared by sol gel spin coating method 21 zno solution was prepared from the mixture of zinc acetate dehydrate as a precursor solution isopropanol as a solvent and diethanolamine as a stabilizer the molar ratio of diethanolamine zinc acetate dihydrate was maintained at 1 1 in a typical experiment 8 78 g 0 04 mol of zinc acetate were dissolved in 50 ml of isopropanol and stirred for 30 min to obtain solution a solution b was prepared by dissolving 0 245 g 0 0014 mol of silver nitrate in 50 ml of isopropanol and stirred for 30 min both solutions were mixed together in order to yield 6 ag zn weight ratio the thin film photocatalyst was deposited by sol gel spin coating method onto glass substrates pre cleaned by detergent ethanol acetone and finally with distilled water and then sonicated using bandelin sonorex rk100 for 10 min in water and then dried for film formation the sol solution was dropped within 30 s onto a glass substrate rotating at 2000 rpm using the spin coater at room temperature the obtained films were then dried at 100 c for 10 min in order to remove the solvent this procedure was repeated seven times to obtain a homogeneous film then annealed in air at 450 c for 1 h in a tubular furnace pure zno thin film photocatalyst was prepared according to the same procedure without the addition of silver nitrate 2 3 thin film characterization the crystal structure of the prepared thin films was characterized using a phillips pw3719 x pert materials research x ray diffractometer xrd using cukα radiation λ 1 5418 ǻ radiation and a scanning range of 2θ between 25 and 70 the thickness of films was measured using dektak 150 stylus profilmeter which has capability to measure thin film thickness with an error 10 angstroms optical transmittance spectra were recorded using uv vis nir spectrophotometer jasco 760 over the wavelength range between 200 and 2500 nm from the transmission spectra the absorption coefficient α was calculated using the following formula 3 α l n t d where t is the optical transmittance and d is thickness of the film 0 2 μm by using the absorption coefficient α and for the direct transitions the optical band gaps eg of our film can be calculated by using the conventional tauc equation 4 α h ν 2 a h ν e g where a is a constant eg is the direct optical band gap energy hν is the incident photon energy the surface morphology of the films morphologies was examined by scanning electron microscope sem xl30tmp energy dispersive x ray analysis edx by electron probe microanalyzer model jeol jxa 840 a which utilized was used to examine the composition of the films 2 4 photocatalytic measurement photocatalytic efficiencies of the obtained thin films were evaluated by measuring the color fading of a mixture from the three mentioned dyes in a typical experiment 75 ml of the dyes mixture were placed in a glass petri dish a catalyst of square geometry 6 25 cm2 was immersed in the dyes solution adjusted at ph 7 the thin film was located to face the irradiation source hqi t 400 w daylight lamp osram germany the luminous flux of irradiation was 20 000 lm with luminous efficacy of 82 lm w the distance between surface of the dye solution and the lamp was fixed at 15 cm the typical set up scheme is presented in figure s2 in the supplementary information after immersing the thin film into the dyes solution and prior to start irradiation the solution was allowed to be in a contact with the photocatalyst for 60 min in the dark to allow the adsorption desorption equilibrium on the photocatalyst surface then the lamp was switched on to start the photodegradation process certain quantities of aliquot were collected at regular intervals under dark and irradiation conditions color removal was monitored by measuring the light absorbance versus wavelength using uv vis spectrophotometer jasco v630 japan in a control experiment the dyes solution was directly irradiated for 1 h in absence of the photocatalyst i e photolysis process 3 result and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst properties the crystal structures of zno and 6 wt ag zno thin films were confirmed using xrd as presented in fig 1 a the xrd pattern for zno thin film can be indexed as a hexagonal wurtzite structure jcpds card number 36 1451 the xrd pattern for 6 wt ag zno thin film revealed three noticeable peaks at 2θ 38 1 44 2 and 64 4 which can be assigned to the most intense diffraction planes of metallic silver jcpds card number 4 0783 it is well known that ag can be incorporated into the zno lattice either as a substitute for zn2 ion or as an interstitial atom this can be examined by monitoring the diffraction peak position of zno the remarkable shift to lower or higher 2θ can be ascribed to substitutional or interstitial incorporation respectively 22 23 on the other hand ag can be segregated to the grain boundaries of zno crystal without any observed positional shift in 2θ values which indicates the formation of ag cluster 24 according to our results it can be seen that incorporation of ag resulted in a shift of the zno peak position to lower 2θ value from 36 29 to 36 21 for zno and 6 wt ag zno respectively the reason could be because of the difference in ionic radii between zn2 0 72 a and ag 1 22 a where the other part of ag atoms segregated to the grain boundaries of zno crystal which indicates the formation of ag cluster which appeared as separated ag peaks fig 1b shows the transmittance spectra for zno and 6 wt ag zno thin films it is observed that the absorption edge shifted to longer wavelength red shift after the insertion of ag as a result the transmittance decreased from 93 to 60 by ag addition this could be due to the grain boundary scattering and the surface plasmonic resonance spr of ag nanoparticles which improved the absorption of light in the visible region 25 the spr is very clear in case of increasing the ag content in the zno matrix as shown in figure s3 in supplementary information the optical band gap energies eg of the thin films were determined by extrapolation of the linear portion of αhν 2 curve where α is the absorption coefficient versus the photon energy hν as presented in fig 1c eg was found to be 3 30 ev for the pure zno thin film and reduced to 3 21 ev for 6 wt ag zno thin film the reduction of eg by addition of ag may be indicated that ag has substituted the zn in the lattice which confirmed by xrd results discussed above that creates oxygen vacancies due to the valence difference between ag and zn2 the created oxygen vacancies play an important role in the narrowing of eg because they act as trap centers that reduce the recombination rate of photo generated charge carriers by capturing the electrons 26 furthermore ag states may interact with zno host states leading to creating energy levels in zno band gap which reduce its optical band gap 27 the reduction of band gap energy is expected to improve the photocatalytic properties of zno by widen the spectrum of the visible light response sem micrographs presented in fig 2 a b show the surface morphology of zno and 6 wt ag zno thin films the sem images clearly show the deposition of ag into the zno surface as a white cluster as reported by other studies 28 29 edx analysis was used as a direct method to determine the thin film composition the edx patterns for zno and 6 wt ag zno thin films are shown in fig 2 c d respectively it is observed that only zn and o elements were detected in pure zno film while ag element was noticed in addition to zn and o elements in case of 6 wt ag zno 3 2 photocatalytic degradation according to our previous work the addition of silver improved the photocatalytic activity of zno as one can see in fig 3 the degradation rate constant k of ro 122 rr 195 and ry 145 always higher in case of 6 wt ag zno than pure zno 13 the enhancement in the photocatalytic activity could be due to better charge separation caused by silver atoms based on these results 6 ag zno was selected for the photocatalytic degradation of a mixture of three azo dyes as a synthetic textile waste water uv vis spectra of the commercial dyes used in this study and the photocatalytic degradation of their mixture are presented in fig 4 and figure s4 in supplementary information respectively it is obvious that there are overlap among the maximum absorption peaks of the studied dyes in order to follow the degradation of each dye during the reaction course mathematical equations have been derived using three solutions of different dyes concentration according to the literature 30 as follows solution 1 5 mg l ro 122 2 mg l ry 145 1 mg l rr 195 solution 2 2 mg l ro 122 1 mg l ry 145 5 mg l rr 195 solution 3 1 mg l ro 122 5 mg l ry 145 2 mg l rr 195 the absorption of each solution at the wavelength of maximum absorption λmax of each dye can be represented as follows 5 a b s 1 a 1 c a 1 b 1 c b 1 c 1 c c 1 6 a b s 2 a 1 c a 2 b 1 c b 2 c 1 c c 2 7 a b s 3 a 1 c a 3 b 1 c b 3 c 1 c c 3 8 a b s n a 1 c a n b 1 c b n c 1 c c n where absn is the absorbance of solution n at λ1 can is the concentration of ro 122 dye in solution n cbn is the concentration of ry 145 dye in solution n and ccn is the concentration of rr 195 dye in solution n therefore the contribution of each dye a1 b1 and c1 can be estimated at each wavelength accordingly the following mathematical relationships could be estimated 9 a b s 420 n m 7 2 x 10 3 c a 8 3 x 10 3 c b 4 3 x 10 3 c c 10 a b s 487 n m 4 5 x 10 3 c a 13 5 x 10 3 c b 12 5 x 10 3 c c 11 a b s 540 n m 3 x 10 3 c a 2 87 x 10 3 c b 18 1 x 10 3 c c it was important to measure the effect of the irradiation on the degradation of the dyes mixture in absence of the catalyst photolysis in addition adsorption of the dyes at the surface of catalyst had been measured the adsorption was determined by allowing the dye solution or a mixture of the three dyes to be contacted with the catalyst in the dark for 60 min the results figure s5 in supplementary information showed that both of photolysis and adsorption produced only 1 color removal therefore their influence on the dyes degradation could be neglected 3 2 1 effect of catalyst dose catalyst dose is a crucial factor which should not exceed a specific limit during the wastewater treatment to avoid adding excess catalyst amount that has a negative effect on the performance of the treatment process as well as on the final cost in this study catalyst dose was expressed in terms of number of glass slides carrying the photoactive thin film each thin film slide has square area 6 25 cm2 the change in each dye concentration during the photodegradation reaction of the dye mixture was calculated using eqs 9 11 and presented in fig 5 a c the kinetics of this
