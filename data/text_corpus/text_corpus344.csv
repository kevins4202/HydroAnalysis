1720,the lifespan of oxbow lakes in a meandering system typically exhibits considerable disparity due to the diverse evolutionary processes that lead to their terrestrialization although oxbow lakes generally undergo a long term gradual shrinking trend their hydrologic connectivity and morphologic variations under variable hydrologic conditions of the river are not well understood here we focus on a group of oxbow lakes in a pristine alpine fluvial system in the qinghai tibet plateau to examine the hydrogeomorphic response of oxbow lakes to a variable hydrologic regime of an active meandering channel we find that the oxbow lakes are characterized by extensively developed compound forms and connecting tie channels and that the lateral migration of the main channel discernably impacts lake morphology and evolution with increasing discharges in the main channel the oxbow lakes generally show increases in length under relatively lower flows ri 10 years and more dramatic increases in width under higher flows ri 10 years which collectively lead to their expansion regardless of their hydrologic connectivity this implies hydrogeomorphic processes other than surface water connection between oxbow lakes and the main channel in adjusting water levels of the lakes to quantify hydrologic connectivity we propose a probability based index and find the overall low hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes owing to the unique paleogeographic setting of the study area the infrequent but pulsed sedimentation within the lakes and the relatively slow lateral migration of the meandering channel catalyze an inactive floodplain of the study reach keywords oxbow lake hydrologic connectivity morphologic variation meandering rivers qinghai tibet plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction oxbow lakes are abandoned channel sections commonly seen in meandering river floodplains as relics of meander bend cutoff liverpool and edwards 1995 stølum 1996 constantine and dunne 2008 they produce ecologically crucial aquatic environments for sustaining a great diversity of habitats miranda 2005 bhattacharya et al 2016 and are an important geomorphic unit of fluvial systems oxbow lakes can signify hydrogeomorphic properties of river channels poff et al 1997 constantine et al 2010 hudson et al 2012 dieras et al 2013 constantine et al 2014 preserve the threshold morphology of meander bends prior to cutoff weihaupt 1977 stølum 1998 and archive the history of overbank floods wolfe et al 2006 toonen et al 2012 ishii and hori 2016 shen et al 2021 therefore their morphology evolution and hydrologic interactions with the active main channels have drawn considerable attention in fluvial geomorphology river engineering stream ecology and sedimentology oxbow lakes created from meander cutoffs may experience diverse evolutionary processes with a variety of planform morphology bai and wang 2014 li et al 2017 konsoer et al 2016 as such their lifespans vary from a few years to centuries e g gagliano and howard 1984 riquier et al 2017 amoros et al 2000 the evolution of oxbow lakes is generally classified into four consecutive stages active meander bend stage i cutoff stage ii lacustrine stage iii and terrestrial stage iv phases gagliano and howard 1984 wren et al 2008 richards and konsoer 2020 among them stage ii begins when chute or neck cutoff occurs and usually lasts between one and ten years during which the former main channel is gradually transformed from an open waterbody that constantly receives upstream water sediment and nutrient into an isolated lacustrine environment due to plug bar formation at the entrance i e inlet and exit i e outlet of the lake gagliano and howard 1984 hooke 1995 richards et al 2022 the development of plug bars plays a vital role in the isolation process that is controlled by the morphodynamic properties of the channel such as sediment supply and diversion angle constantine et al 2010 dieras et al 2013 ishii and hori 2016 dépret et al 2017 li and gao 2019a a large diversion angle often formed by neck cutoff may promote rapid development of plug bars at the lake entrance which subsequently reduces the supply of the coarse material loads i e bed load to the abandoned channel conversely a small diversion angle normally associated with chute cutoff causes a slower formation of plug bars allowing the abandoned channel to receive more coarse materials from the active channel stage iii starts from the isolation of the lake during which the oxbow lake may only reconnect to the main channel when overbank floods occur sedimentation within the lake would continuously infill the oxbow lake allowing for vegetation encroachment that eventually leads to a complete terrestrialization of the oxbow lake namely stage iv with the oxbow lake gradually transformed from the lacustrine setting into a terrestrial environment the sediment source gradually switches from the exogenous dominated supply from the main channel by overbank flows to the endogenous dominated deposition due to the reduced frequency of overbank flows gautier et al 2007 richards et al 2022 hydrologically oxbow lakes in stage iii receive water from a variety of sources including direct precipitation overland flow through the catchment upslope of the lakes surface water supply i e hydrologic connection between the lake and channel and groundwater recharge depending on the rate of lake sedimentation the duration of stage iii may last for a wide range of periods among different fluvial settings e g gagliano and howard 1984 dieras 2013 kobus et al 2016 fluvial processes associated with the early two stages i e stages i and ii have been extensively studied thus far e g constantine and dunne 2008 grenfell et al 2012 dieras et al 2013 sylvester et al 2019 whereas limited understanding has been established about the intra stage evolutionary processes for oxbow lakes in stage iii although oxbow lakes in this stage are known to undergo an overall shrinking trend given continuous lake infilling e g wren et al 2008 constantine et al 2010 ishii and hori 2016 the dynamics of lake morphology in response to variable hydrologic conditions of the main channel remain elusive therefore a quantitative assessment of their morphologic responses to fluctuations of river discharge over a short period e g intra annual is still needed for revealing and inferring the driving processes involved in the long term shrinking trend additionally hydrologic connectivity a concept used for characterizing hydrologic interactions between hydrological elements e g oxbow lakes and channels freeman et al 2007 bracken et al 2013 highlights streamflow pulses in generating water and sediment interactions between channels and oxbow lakes e g junk et al 1989 wainwright et al 2011 especially for newer formed lakes hudson et al 2012 however this concept bears different meanings in different quantification approaches and mostly relies on the presence of surface water connection which omits hydrologic processes other than surface water dynamics in controlling oxbow lake hydrology the relations between hydrologic connectivity and oxbow lake variation under a variable hydrologic regime have yet to be explored either hence a full understanding of the evolutionary processes of oxbow lakes requires the answers to the question how does the hydrogeomorphology of oxbow lakes respond to a variable hydrologic regime of the neighboring meandering channel in this study we seek to provide the answers by 1 characterizing the morphology of oxbow lakes in relation to the active channel 2 quantifying their morphologic variations in response to variable hydrologic conditions and 3 revealing variable degrees of hydrologic connectivity among oxbow lakes under variable flow conditions in a pristine meandering reach finally based on the collected samples of lake deposits we illustrate processes revealed by morphologic properties of the oxbow lakes and examine the long term evolution of the meandering river floodplain 2 study area the zoige basin is located on the northeastern edge of the asian water tower and the world s third pole the qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 a with a mean elevation of 3 400 m the basin has a relatively flat topography surrounded by high mountains including the minshan mountains the origin of the studied black river fig 1b as a unique area in the qinghai tibet plateau the zoige basin fosters the world s largest alpine peatland which was formed by lacustrine deposits of a paleolake that collapsed and drained 37 ka before present chen et al 1999 nicoll et al 2013 zeng et al 2017 wang et al 2023 with a relatively cold alpine climate dwc in köppen classification the basin has an annual mean temperature of 0 7 and annually receives 645 mm of precipitation on average li et al 2014 most precipitation occurs in summer due to the prevalent east asian monsoon making the zoige basin one of the moistest regions in the qinghai tibet plateau the land cover of the basin is dominated by herbaceous plants including grassland peatland and a mixture of both although human disturbances are limited due to the harsh living condition peatland degradation is still evident in the upstream hillslopes possibly related to the excavation of artificial ditches and gully erosion over the past five decades qiu et al 2009 li and gao 2019b li et al 2020 the black river is the largest tributary of the upper yellow river in its source region fig 1b with a drainage area of 7 600 km2 and a mean annual discharge of 58 m3 s the middle and lower reaches of the river develop highly sinuous meandering patterns which are primarily characterized by extensively developed point and scroll bars compound bends and oxbow lakes fig 1c precipitation is the major water source of streamflow in the region followed by late spring snowmelt and groundwater supply this study focuses on oxbow lakes developed along a 120 km reach of the downstream black river from the town of dazhasi the seat of the zoige county hereafter referred to as the lower black river the reach averaged channel gradient width and sinuosity are 0 09 86 m and 2 03 respectively channel banks of the lower black river typically consist of a two layer structure with the upper layer being a cohesive vegetation soil mixture and the lower layer comprising fine sand and silt consequently cantilever arms can be easily formed as the lower layer is subject to continuous fluvial erosion leading to bank collapse once the threshold is reached this fluvial mass failure mechanism dominates the rates of bank retreat and meander bend evolution e g gao et al 2021 yang et al 2022 because the cycle of bank collapse takes time usually several years meander bends within the reach evolve slowly giving rise to a mean rate of lateral migration at bend apices of 0 011 width year meander cutoff dominated by neck cutoff has occurred only three times over the last 40 years guo et al 2021 li et al 2023 3 methods 3 1 hydrological analysis characterizing morphologic variations and hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes is built upon the hydrologic conditions of the main channel of the lower black river flood frequency analysis was conducted using the record of annual peak discharges 1980 2020 obtained from the zoige gauge station 33 595 n 102 536 e near the town of dazhasi among the commonly used probability density functions chow et al 1988 the lognormal function is proven to best fit the discharge data the constructed flood frequency curve was subsequently used to determine discharges of given recurrence intervals ris by matching the available satellite images with the calculated recurrence intervals see details in the following section four representative hydrologic conditions were selected which are the mean annual discharge qam 27 1 m3 s assuming the recurrence interval is 0 1 the discharge with 1 year recurrence interval q 1 53 7 m3 s the discharge with 10 year recurrence interval q 10 256 3 m3 s and the record high discharge equivalent to the discharge with about 45 year recurrence interval q 45 376 0 m3 s respectively 3 2 remote sensing acquisition and analysis a total of 86 oxbow lakes were identified along the lower black river for this study using high resolution 10 m images from google earth these lakes encompass all abandoned channels preserved within the floodplains that are identifiable by their presence of water or the desiccated beds and remaining banks we used sequential sentinel 2 imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 m to extract oxbow lake morphology based on water extents under the four flow levels reported above we were unable to find satellite images that correspond to other flow levels e g discharges with 5 year and 20 year ris due to the instantaneous flow pulses that are unable to be captured by the sensor given its revisit time as well as the prevailing cloud cover during the rainy season for each image we generated water masks for oxbow lakes by visual interpretation assisted by the modified normalized difference water index mndwi a widely used spectral index for water delineation based on green and shortwave infrared bands e g xu 2006 rokni et al 2014 singh et al 2015 the planform morphology and the temporal changes of each oxbow lake were subsequently extracted and determined in arcgis pro potential uncertainties may arise from the registration of the original data and errors associated with digitizing subjectivity downward et al 1994 lea and legleiter 2016 donovan et al 2019 the total error calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual error remains 10 m for this study using the same methods as what we adopted for the digitization of anabranching and meandering channels in the same study area guo et al 2021 2023 the planform morphology of oxbow lakes can be described using static and dynamic metrics specifically static metrics are based on the shapes of oxbow lakes and their spatial relationships with the main channel regardless of their surface water levels they include 1 simple or compound oxbow lakes 2 oxbow lakes with and without connecting channels 3 the shortest distance between an oxbow lake and the main channel dc and 4 the distance between the two entrances i e inlet and outlet of an oxbow lake dl specifically a simple oxbow lake must contain one former meander bend defined as an arc 60 while a compound oxbow lake should involve multiple former bends as defined by guo et al 2021 a connecting channel which was also referred to as tie channel or tributary channel e g dietrich et al 1999 rowland et al 2005 2009 is a smaller channel connecting an oxbow lake to the main active channel fig 2 which could be easily detected in google earth both dc and dl were measured based on the remaining banks and beds of the former channel identifiable in google earth which are not affected by water level fluctuations of the lakes the value of dl is the distance between the two ends of the oxbow lake centerline whose minimum value should approximate the width of the main channel at the time when the oxbow lake was formed by neck cutoff the dynamic metrics capture the changes in oxbow lake planform morphology at different water levels which include lake length width and area defined by water masks under the record high flow i e q 45 many oxbow lakes were completely inundated making their morphology unidentifiable in this case we assigned a very large value for their area 1 km2 length 10 km and width 1 km to make them distinct from other non inundated oxbow lakes for each selected oxbow lake we performed linear regression analysis between lake areas at the four flow levels and their corresponding recurrence intervals the established model is generally strong with statistical significance the slope of each model s reflects the rate of change in area for each oxbow lake with a greater s indicating a higher rate of lake expansion with increasing discharge in the main channel hydrologic connectivity generally describes the transport of water and materials involved in the hydrologic cycle freeman et al 2007 bracken et al 2013 for oxbow lakes the hydrologic connectivity is referred to as the degree to which oxbow lakes reconnect to river channels which is a critical process controlling the geomorphic and ecologic properties of meandering river floodplains miranda 2005 glińska lewczuk 2009 riquier et al 2017 wang et al 2020 szewczyk et al 2022 here we quantify the hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes based on surface water connection along a path between an oxbow lake and the adjacent main channel which must be clearly observed from the remotely sensed images according to our preliminary investigation hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes remains low even under relatively high flows i e qam but q 2 in summer to quantify it we proposed a probability based index for hydrologic connectivity phc which is defined as phc 1 r i where the ri of each oxbow lake indicates the magnitude of the main channel discharge under which the lake becomes hydrologically connected to the main channel for example an oxbow lake with phc 1 i e ri 1 means the lake connects to the main channel at discharges q 1 and an oxbow lake with phc 0 022 i e ri 45 means the lake connects to the main channel only at q 45 or higher discharges while remaining disconnected at the other three lower flow levels for oxbow lakes that remain disconnected from the main channel at all four flow levels we assigned a very large ri value i e 100 which means phc 0 01 to make them distinct from others 3 3 field data acquisition and analysis to compensate for the limitations of planform morphology derived from remotely sensed data we collected vertical samples of bed deposits in two oxbow lakes during fieldwork in the summers of 2021 and 2022 two sediment cores were collected in an oxbow lake for particle size analysis cores 1 2 see section 5 3 for details and the relevant discussion and two more sediment cores were collected in two different oxbow lakes for dating analysis cores 3 4 see section 5 4 for details and the relevant discussion specifically cores 1 and 2 are both 120 cm deep while cores 3 and 4 are 140 and 100 cm deep respectively all cores were sliced into sequences of 5 cm sections which were subsequently preprocessed and analyzed using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer for particle size analysis at hohai university china and gamma spectrometry for 137cs dating at chengdu institute of mountain hazards and environment chinese academy of sciences 4 results 4 1 characterizing planform morphology of oxbow lakes most of the 86 identified oxbow lakes 72 were located in the floodplain next to the upstream half section of the study reach from the upstream end dazhasi to the mid point of the reach see fig 1b these lakes were typically clustered in the areas where the main channel contained highly convoluted meander bends demonstrating the correlation between the production rate of oxbow lakes and meandering channel sinuosity constantine and dunne 2008 among all 86 oxbow lakes 39 were located right next to the main channel i e dc 0 while the rest had variable distances from the main channel with the mean dc 0 22 km and the maximum dc 0 99 km fig 3 because oxbow lakes in the study reach were predominately formed by neck cutoff they should have the initial dl of no more than one channel width i e 100 m their subsequent evolution followed different pathways leading to a variety of the current dl ranging from 100 m to 1 52 km with a mean value of 0 34 km fig 3 by plotting dl against dc we show that some oxbow lakes seemed to have two types of unusual morphologic relationships with the first type having small dl but very large dc and the second type characterized by large dl but small dc the first type is possibly the consequence of a relatively fast lateral shifting of the main channel away from the oxbow lakes that made the oxbow lakes unable to receive sufficient sediment from the main channel for infilling the second type suggests the lateral migration of the main channel moving towards the oxbow lakes engulfing the original lake entrances the studied oxbow lakes exhibited two main morphologic characteristics the distinction of compound lakes from simple ones and the prevalence of connecting channels between lakes and channels particularly compound lakes accounted for nearly 49 i e 42 86 while simple ones took about 51 i e 44 86 of the total number of lakes compared with the proportion i e 34 of meander bends that displayed compound forms in the same study reach guo et al 2021 the larger proportion of compound oxbow lakes suggests the prevalence of compound form development in meander bends as an approach other than cutoff to stabilize themselves the compound oxbow lakes also exhibited significantly p 0 05 larger dl i e 0 43 km on average than that i e 0 25 km on average of the simple ones though their dc did not differ significantly for the second characteristic we find that the majority i e 58 86 of oxbow lakes developed small channels connecting the lake and the main channel with a mean width generally of 10 m these channels were commonly formed at lake inlets or outlets where previously developed plug bars were cut through to drain water from the oxbow lakes when the flow stage of the main channel is lower than the water level of the oxbow lakes occasionally they could become pathways to transfer water and sediment from the main channel into the oxbow lakes during high flows thereby initiating surface water connection between the two geomorphic units the connecting channels of the studied oxbow lakes were commonly sinuous and rarely connected with tributaries of the black river in the watershed upslope to the oxbow lakes oxbow lakes with connecting channels had significantly p 0 05 larger dl i e 0 39 km on average than those without connecting channels i e 0 23 km on average fig 3 suggesting the morphologic similarity between oxbow lakes with compound forms compound lakes were larger in dl than simple ones and those with connecting channels their dc values however did not differ significantly among the 58 oxbow lakes with connecting channels thirty two developed connecting channels at the lake inlet twenty created them at the lake outlet and six lakes generated them on both sides the variable locations of the connecting channels indicate the complex interactions among the main channel hydraulics the lake diversion angle the shortest path and the hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes in controlling the formative and evolutionary patterns of the connecting channels moreover the connecting channels seemed to favor compound oxbow lakes over simple ones which was likely related to the greater size and more water volume of the compound oxbow lakes 4 2 morphologic variations of oxbow lakes under variable hydrologic conditions although oxbow lakes gradually shrink in size because of continuous sediment infilling after their plug bar formation i e the end of stage ii their planform morphology is found to vary greatly with fluctuating flow levels fig 4 generally the oxbow lakes along the lower black river showed expansion with the increase of river discharge leading to greater potentials for the lakes to connect to the main channels via surface water however the magnitudes of morphologic changed among the oxbow lakes under different flow levels were different based on their morphologic characteristics described previously figs 5 and 6 the length and area of compound lakes were significantly p 0 05 larger than those of simple lakes at all four flow levels as indicated by the linear regression lines and median values in figs 5 and 6 these differences also increased with the water discharge of the main channel nonetheless lake widths between simple and compound ones did not differ significantly at all flow levels suggesting that the two types of oxbow lakes had similar rates of transverse deposition similarly oxbow lakes with connecting channels had significantly larger p 0 05 lengths and areas at all four flow levels than the lakes without connecting channels figs 5 and 6 whereas their widths were statistically identical especially at q 10 and q 45 these morphologic distinctions reveal that connecting channels tended to develop in larger oxbow lakes and that the formation and evolution of the connecting channels were controlled not only by the magnitude and sediment concentrations of sediment laden flows from the main channel but by the morphologic responses of oxbow lakes therefore it is important to specify the hydrologic conditions when describing the morphologic variations of oxbow lakes overall for all 86 oxbow lakes in the study reach their lengths and widths increased with the water discharge of the main channel figs 5 and 6 with the mean length of 0 475 0 580 1 123 and 1 465 km not including completely inundated lakes and the associated mean width of 0 019 0 022 0 049 and 0 079 km for qam q 1 q 10 and q 45 respectively furthermore lake width increased faster by magnitude than lake length when the discharge of the main channel q 10 suggesting a more rapid widening of the oxbow lakes possibly due to the occurrence of lake overbank flows under very large flows the considerable expansion of lake width due to overbank flow was obvious at q 45 fig 4 the record high flow q 45 that occurred in july 2018 with the discharge nearly 13 times greater than qam marks an unprecedented hydrologic condition in the observed history of the lower black river under such flow the length width and area of all oxbow lakes increased dramatically figs 5 and 6 causing the mean area of all oxbow lakes at the record high flow 5 4 fold greater than that of the lakes at qam the total inundated area along the study reach was 85 3 km2 4 5 fold greater than the water surface area of the channel at qam the inundation was particularly extensive in the floodplains along the upstream section of the study reach causing complete inundation of 15 oxbow lakes that made them unable to be identified in the downstream section of the study reach morphologic variations of the oxbow lakes were limited and no lake was completely inundated even at the record high flow level demonstrating the spatial heterogeneity of channel floodplain interactions in the study reach the degree of morphologic change s of the oxbow lakes ranged between about zero and 0 014 that averaged at 0 0023 oxbow lakes with compound forms and connecting channels were found to have significantly p 0 05 larger s than those having simple forms and without connecting channels respectively fig 7 which indicates higher magnitudes of expansion of the oxbow lakes in the former types the general pattern between s and dc could be expressed as a simple reciprocal function in which s decreased swiftly before dc 0 12 and then decreased with much lower rates for greater dc fig 7a the relationship between s and dl was highly scattered and could be depicted by a statistically significant linear trend with three outliers whose s values were much higher fig 7b 4 3 hydrologic connectivity of the oxbow lakes hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes using the proposed approach phc ranged from 0 01 never connected to the main channel among the four flow levels to 10 always connected to the main channel among the four flow levels with the majority of lakes having their phcs of 0 02 and 0 1 71 out of 86 oxbow lakes fig 8 these trends suggest that for most oxbow lakes there was no hydrologic connection with the main channels at qam and q 1 which reflects a very inactive hydrologic interaction between the oxbow lakes and their adjacent main channel in the lower black river by contrast early studies have reported comparatively higher intra annual hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes in other regions e g junk et al 1989 hudson et al 2012 among all 86 oxbow lakes fourteen 16 3 were never hydrologically connected to the main channel i e phc 0 01 fig 8 these oxbow lakes either remained distant from the main channel or were separated from the main channel by adequate plug bars or higher channel banks leading to their complete isolation even at q 45 thirty 34 9 oxbow lakes which were mostly located in the upper section of the study reach were only hydrologically connected to the main channel at q 45 while remaining disconnected at the other water levels i e phc 0 02 additionally 41 47 7 lakes had phc 0 1 indicating that they could be hydrologically connected to the main channel at q 10 and greater interestingly while no oxbow lake has phc 1 started to achieve hydrologic connection at q 1 there exists one lake i e lake 19 fig 9 that remained hydrologically connected with the main channel at all four water levels i e phc 10 its high degree of hydrologic connectivity was caused by lateral shifting of the main channel that reactivated the previously isolated oxbow lake exemplifying the strong but infrequent effect of the lateral migration of the main channel on oxbow lake evolution for all studied oxbow lakes while no correlation was found between phc and dl their phc and the associated dc exhibited a negative correlation fig 10 suggesting that dc may infer the hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes the oxbow lakes with connecting channels had considerably higher hydrologic connectivity the average times among the four flow levels is 1 43 than those without connecting channels the average time is 1 18 thus whether a connecting channel is developed or not may be another morphologic indicator for the hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes 5 discussion 5 1 the nature of hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes as a critical hydrogeomorphic and ecologic property of oxbow lakes hydrologic connectivity has been characterized and quantified using a variety of approaches including classifying connecting patterns between lakes and channels determining the threshold discharge estimating the frequency and magnitude of floods that induce connectivity and interpreting the depositional patterns of oxbow lake infills e g dembkowski and miranda 2011 hudson et al 2012 phillips 2013 shen et al 2021 however there are no consistent metrics that can be used for directly comparing the degrees of hydrologic connectivity among various oxbow lakes in floodplains of different fluvial systems the probability based index phc proposed in this study quantifies the variable degrees of hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes in terms of recurrence interval a common hydrological concept that is comparable among rivers in any region although our results are site specific the index phc is transformable for quantifying the hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes in other fluvial systems with different hydrologic regimes in our case oxbow lakes in the floodplain of the lower black river exhibited extremely low hydrologic connectivity with most lakes remaining disconnected from the main channel at qam and q 1 fig 8 by contrast many oxbow lakes in lowland floodplains reported in the literature have higher hydrologic connectivity e g miranda 2005 hudson et al 2012 czuba et al 2019 oxbow lakes with comparably low hydrologic connectivity may include the artificially regulated ones in highly populated areas such as the floodplain of the middle yangtze river i e the jingjiang reach where the embankment had significantly deactivated channel floodplain interactions e g xia et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the low hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes is likely attributable to the unique fluvial setting of the lower black river numerous studies have demonstrated that tributaries of the upper yellow river including the black river were subject to the knickpoint incision due to intense channel downcutting induced by the combined climatic and tectonic movements since the collapse of the zoige paleolake 37 ka before present e g chen et al 1999 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2023 consequently the lower black river becomes an underfit river davis 1913 beaty 1990 srivastava et al 2014 in which the flows can rarely reach the bankfull stage under the prevailing hydrologic regime li and gao 2019a this fact explains the scarcity of large area inundation in the study reach and why it may only occur at the unprecedented record high peak flow 5 2 interactions between hydrologic connectivity and morphologic variations of oxbow lakes oxbow lakes in the study reach are found to increase in size i e length width and area as discharges increase in the main channel figs 4 6 although their hydrologic connectivity is relatively low fig 8 it follows that the expansion of the lakes was not always caused by surface water supplied via the lake channel connection but more by direct precipitation on the oxbow lakes and upslope overland flow draining into the lakes during various storm events therefore the hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes is not the only mechanism driving dynamic changes of oxbow lakes one missing piece might be the role of groundwater in oxbow lake variations during the prolonged non rainfall periods the high spatial and temporal variations of groundwater levels in the study area suggest that the impact of groundwater on oxbow lakes could be complex li and gao 2020 which awaits more field based data although connecting channels between the studied oxbow lakes and the main channel may promote hydrologic connectivity their presence does not signify continuous hydrologic connectivity all year round indeed we have observed in the field that the connecting channels commonly remained desiccated or had very little water flowing towards the main channel even during some higher flow periods when the main channel discharge exceeds qam in these periods hydrologic connectivity should not be considered to have occurred because 1 oxbow lakes did not receive channel water under these hydrologic conditions due to the higher water stage of the oxbow lake than that of the main channel and 2 the major portion of the connecting channels remained desiccated the conditions featuring the stage differences between the oxbow lake and the main channel was unique from those observed in large fluvial settings especially in large anabranching systems where the hydrologic connectivity of floodplain lakes is generally high with the synchronous water stages between main channel and lakes e g hu et al 2015 park and latrubesse 2017 park 2020 additionally the actual longitudinal profiles of connecting channels i e oxbow lake end higher than main channel end developed in the study reach seemed to differ from those of tie channels i e main channel end higher than oxbow lake end formed by sediment laden flows from the main channel suggesting distinct formative mechanisms and hydrologic patterns of the connecting channels in the lower black river from previously studied tie channel or tributary channel dietrich et al 1999 rowland et al 2005 2009 the higher s associated with oxbow lakes in compound forms fig 7 was likely attributed to their larger areas that allowed for more desiccated lakes beds to be inundated from a lower flow e g qam and q 1 to a higher flow e g q 10 similarly the higher s associated with oxbow lakes that develop connecting channels may be related not only to their greater areas but to the higher hydrologic connectivity which enabled relatively active water supply from the main channel via surface water connection the fact that a larger dc correlates with generally a smaller s fig 7a and a smaller phc fig 10 demonstrates that dc is an important morphologic index for inferring morphologic variation and hydrology of oxbow lakes moreover the generally higher s associated with small dc but large dl fig 7 highlights greater morphologic variation occurring in the oxbow lakes that are prone to lateral migration of the main channel see fig 3 by linking the mean s to phc for all studied oxbow lakes a general positive correlation can be found fig 11 for phc 0 1 the increase of phc may lead to linearly increased mean s suggesting that morphologic changes of oxbow lakes were more sensitive to phc when its degree was relatively low when phc 0 1 even a greater increase of phc would not cause a significant increase of the mean s implying that higher degrees of hydrologic connectivity had a very limited impact on morphologic changes of oxbow lakes it should be noted that this trend is only based on a single point with phc 10 the apparently limited impact might suggest that hydrologic connectivity is merely one driving force that controls morphologic variations of oxbow lakes 5 3 impact of main channel migration on oxbow lake evolution the production of an oxbow lake in the floodplain of a meandering river relies on the flow regime of the meandering river and its key morphodynamic properties such as the channel sinuosity and the rates of sediment transport and lateral migration constantine and dunne 2008 hooke 2013 in fully developed oxbow lakes i e in stage iii sedimentation patterns may still be influenced by the diversion angle between the lake inlet and the main channel fisk 1947 constantine et al 2010 schwendel et al 2018 however the diversion angle could continuously change owing to the evolution of oxbow lakes and meandering channels which in turn affects the rate and pattern of sedimentation in oxbow lakes furthermore as plug bars grow to the elevation that disconnects the oxbow lake from the main channel the in lake sedimentation will be much less dependent on the diversion angle in this study we examine these changes through the spatial relationships between oxbow lake and the main channel values of dl and dc of an oxbow lake in their initiation i e after the emergence of plug bars stage ought to be about one channel width i e 100 m and zero unidentifiable from the remotely sensed data respectively subsequently both dl and dc should increase over time because the development of plug bars leads to the gradual retreat of oxbow lake entrances before reaching the position of the peak dl resulting in a positive correlation between the two i e the red points in fig 12 this relationship holds when the rate of the lateral migration of the main channel is much less than that of in lake sedimentation however many oxbow lakes follow two different spatial relationships with one having very small dl but large dc and the other showing very small including zero dc but large dl fig 12 in the first relationship the oxbow lakes remain largely in their original sizes without notable in lake sedimentation but are distant from the main channel due to its laterally migrating away from the lakes in the second one the oxbow lakes are located right next to the channels but their inlets are distant from the outlets because the main channel migrates towards them these two different processes of channel migration affect the evolution of oxbow lakes differently with the former reducing the degree of hydrologic connectivity and the latter enhancing it the absence of a general dl dc relationship fig 12 suggests the important role of lateral migration of the main channel in oxbow lake evolution as highlighted in previous studies gagliano and howard 1984 erskine et al 1992 richards et al 2022 interestingly the evolution of oxbow lakes may also be uniquely disturbed by direct contact of the main channel in positions away from the inlet and outlet where plug bars do not exist resulting in the reactivation of the lake as exemplified by oxbow lake 19 fig 9 this process significantly intensified the hydrologic connectivity of the oxbow lake by allowing water in the main channel to move into the oxbow lake more frequently making it the only case with phc 10 among all studied oxbow lakes the sediment core core 1 collected at site a where the lake was reactivated shows notable fine particle d 50 ranges between 11 and 23 µm layers below the level of 30 cm from the surface and two peaks of coarser particles d 50 58 and 39 µm respectively in the shallower layers of 10 15 cm and 25 30 cm deep fig 13 the two peaks may be attributable to the record high flow in 2018 during which the higher flows caused rapid deposition of coarse sediments within the lake and the pre 2018 event that triggered the reactivation of the oxbow lake respectively at site b the deep layer below the 30 cm level from the surface deposits are slightly courser than those at site a possibly because site b was prone to the incoming flow from the main channel before the oxbow lake was reactivated two peaks in d 50 d 50 52 and 45 µm respectively are present at the layers of 5 10 cm and 45 50 cm below the surface of site b as well fig 13 which may also be related to the same events as described in site a but underwent different sedimentation rates this unique case suggests that although the reactivation event does not occur frequently in the lower black river its impact on the sedimentation patterns and the resultant evolutionary trajectory of the oxbow lake is significant in the future with the continuous growth of the natural levee of the main channel and the formation of a new plug bar near site a this oxbow lake will likely undergo a reduced rate of sedimentation while the main channel will continue to erode the lake 5 4 implications for floodplain evolution of meandering rivers lateral migration of river channels overbank sediment deposition and production and sedimentation of oxbow lakes are the key processes controlling the evolution of floodplains of meandering systems e g hooke 2013 constantine et al 2014 ielpi et al 2022 2023 in order to assess the sedimentation rate of oxbow lakes in the study reach we collected bed deposits of two oxbow lakes i e 3 and 48 formed at different times specifically according to satellite records oxbow lake 3 was possibly formed more than 50 years ago which has a dc of zero and a dl of 0 13 km relatively small whereas oxbow lake 48 was formed in the early 1990s because the peak concentration of 137cs can be accurately dated to the year 1963 for lake deposits in east asia due to the maximum global fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests he et al 1996 lan et al 2020 we found the 1963 peak in 137cs for oxbow lake 3 and estimated its post 1963 average sedimentation rate of about 0 99 cm year fig 14 a for oxbow lake 48 the absence of a prominent peak in 137cs indicates that its formation time must be later than 1963 fig 14b which is consistent with our observation from the satellite images given that the deepest layer i e the layer of 95 100 cm below the surface may not reach the bottom of post cutoff deposits a minimum sedimentation rate of about 4 8 cm year can be calculated based on the total depth of the sediment core and the earliest possible year of deposition at the 95 100 cm layer clearly the dramatic difference in sedimentation rate between the two oxbow lakes illustrates a fast to slow transition of sedimentation rate of oxbow lakes as they evolve which is in accord with the patterns seen in typical lowland rivers of various sizes e g wren et al 2008 ishii and hori 2016 shen et al 2021 although oxbow lakes in the lower black river generally exhibit low hydrologic connectivity and very infrequent overbank flows the significant amount of in lake sedimentation compared with oxbow lakes in other fluvial systems reported e g erskineet al 1992 citterio and piégay 2009 ishii and hori 2016 may still be contributed from the occasional hydrologic connection to the main channels during high magnitude flow pulses e g q 10 and q 45 the spatiotemporal variations of the channel migration determine dynamic patterns of not only oxbow lake infilling but floodplain reworking e g mertes et al 1996 gautier et al 2007 in the lower black river the estimated rate of the channel migration at apices of meander bends averages at 0 011 widths year with a maximum of 0 034 widths year this is an extremely slow rate compared to those of most meandering rivers worldwide guo et al 2021 the low migration rate would be equivalent to a recycling period of 8 000 years for the river s alluvial plain assuming the valley width is approximately 90 times the channel bankfull width while this recycling period is considerably longer than those of other studied meandering reaches e g mertes et al 1996 gautier et al 2007 aalto et al 2008 vayssière et al 2020 it could even be longer due to the spatially uneven rates of channel migration the occurrence of meander cutoffs and the long term centennial to millennial climatic and physiographic changes the extensive peatland preserved within the valley of the black river best demonstrates the limited impact of channel migration on floodplain reworking overall the floodplain of the lower black river is characterized by inactive reworking of the meandering channel infrequent but pulsed sedimentation patterns within oxbow lakes and very rare overbank sedimentation in floodplains without oxbow lakes although floods equivalent to the 2018 record high flow which caused dramatic sedimentation across inundated areas within the floodplains can rarely occur based on the observable history the possibility of occurrence is likely to increase soon under the prevailing warming wetting and polarizing trends of climate change in the qinghai tibet plateau zhou and zhang 2021 yao et al 2022 this may eventually lead to more rapid sedimentation via overbank flow and channel migration across floodplains due to intensified fluvial erosion which collectively contribute to a more dynamic floodplain of the lower black river 6 conclusions although there is a consensus that the evolution of oxbow lakes involves four stages including the meander bend cutoff lacustrine and terrestrial phases knowledge of the processes controlling morphologic variation of oxbow lakes at stage iii and its relation to hydrologic connectivity remains limited in this study we examine a group of pristine oxbow lakes in a highly sinuous meandering reach in the upper yellow river watershed by characterizing their morphology and hydrologic connectivity and revealing the key processes driving the intra stage evolution of the oxbow lakes we find that the development of compound forms and connecting channels are the main morphologic characteristics of the oxbow lakes and that the distance between the oxbow lake and the main channel dc correlates positively with the distance between oxbow lake entrances dl when the lateral migration of the main channel is inactive their relationship may be complicated when the main channel is locally more active which could lead to distinct evolutional trajectories of the oxbow lakes in their lacustrine phase i e stage iii using four hydrologic benchmarks based on flood frequency analysis and remotely sensed data we observe a consistent expansion of the oxbow lakes with increasing discharges of the main channel the expansion is mainly attributable to increased length at flows q 10 and to increased width at flows q 10 the rate of morphologic variation s of the oxbow lakes correlates negatively and nonlinearly with dc while positively and linearly with dl suggesting that the lateral migration of the main channel enhances the magnitude of oxbow lake expansion their expansion is persistent with increasing river discharge regardless of whether the oxbow lake connects to the main channel via surface water this demonstrates that oxbow lake hydrology is not only controlled by hydrologic connectivity but by direct precipitation and supply of hillslope overland flow moreover the existing approaches conceptualizing hydrologic connectivity based on surface water connection ignore the potential impact of groundwater interactions between oxbow lakes and main channels which awaits future investigations derived from field data a new probability based index phc that can potentially be used for oxbow lakes in other fluvial systems is proposed to quantify the degree of hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes the studied ones are found to have low hydrologic connectivity which can be inferred from dc and connecting channel presence the low degree of hydrologic connectivity is caused by the climatic and tectonic driven channel downcutting of the upper yellow river with the slow migration of the meandering channel a comparatively inactive

1720,the lifespan of oxbow lakes in a meandering system typically exhibits considerable disparity due to the diverse evolutionary processes that lead to their terrestrialization although oxbow lakes generally undergo a long term gradual shrinking trend their hydrologic connectivity and morphologic variations under variable hydrologic conditions of the river are not well understood here we focus on a group of oxbow lakes in a pristine alpine fluvial system in the qinghai tibet plateau to examine the hydrogeomorphic response of oxbow lakes to a variable hydrologic regime of an active meandering channel we find that the oxbow lakes are characterized by extensively developed compound forms and connecting tie channels and that the lateral migration of the main channel discernably impacts lake morphology and evolution with increasing discharges in the main channel the oxbow lakes generally show increases in length under relatively lower flows ri 10 years and more dramatic increases in width under higher flows ri 10 years which collectively lead to their expansion regardless of their hydrologic connectivity this implies hydrogeomorphic processes other than surface water connection between oxbow lakes and the main channel in adjusting water levels of the lakes to quantify hydrologic connectivity we propose a probability based index and find the overall low hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes owing to the unique paleogeographic setting of the study area the infrequent but pulsed sedimentation within the lakes and the relatively slow lateral migration of the meandering channel catalyze an inactive floodplain of the study reach keywords oxbow lake hydrologic connectivity morphologic variation meandering rivers qinghai tibet plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction oxbow lakes are abandoned channel sections commonly seen in meandering river floodplains as relics of meander bend cutoff liverpool and edwards 1995 stølum 1996 constantine and dunne 2008 they produce ecologically crucial aquatic environments for sustaining a great diversity of habitats miranda 2005 bhattacharya et al 2016 and are an important geomorphic unit of fluvial systems oxbow lakes can signify hydrogeomorphic properties of river channels poff et al 1997 constantine et al 2010 hudson et al 2012 dieras et al 2013 constantine et al 2014 preserve the threshold morphology of meander bends prior to cutoff weihaupt 1977 stølum 1998 and archive the history of overbank floods wolfe et al 2006 toonen et al 2012 ishii and hori 2016 shen et al 2021 therefore their morphology evolution and hydrologic interactions with the active main channels have drawn considerable attention in fluvial geomorphology river engineering stream ecology and sedimentology oxbow lakes created from meander cutoffs may experience diverse evolutionary processes with a variety of planform morphology bai and wang 2014 li et al 2017 konsoer et al 2016 as such their lifespans vary from a few years to centuries e g gagliano and howard 1984 riquier et al 2017 amoros et al 2000 the evolution of oxbow lakes is generally classified into four consecutive stages active meander bend stage i cutoff stage ii lacustrine stage iii and terrestrial stage iv phases gagliano and howard 1984 wren et al 2008 richards and konsoer 2020 among them stage ii begins when chute or neck cutoff occurs and usually lasts between one and ten years during which the former main channel is gradually transformed from an open waterbody that constantly receives upstream water sediment and nutrient into an isolated lacustrine environment due to plug bar formation at the entrance i e inlet and exit i e outlet of the lake gagliano and howard 1984 hooke 1995 richards et al 2022 the development of plug bars plays a vital role in the isolation process that is controlled by the morphodynamic properties of the channel such as sediment supply and diversion angle constantine et al 2010 dieras et al 2013 ishii and hori 2016 dépret et al 2017 li and gao 2019a a large diversion angle often formed by neck cutoff may promote rapid development of plug bars at the lake entrance which subsequently reduces the supply of the coarse material loads i e bed load to the abandoned channel conversely a small diversion angle normally associated with chute cutoff causes a slower formation of plug bars allowing the abandoned channel to receive more coarse materials from the active channel stage iii starts from the isolation of the lake during which the oxbow lake may only reconnect to the main channel when overbank floods occur sedimentation within the lake would continuously infill the oxbow lake allowing for vegetation encroachment that eventually leads to a complete terrestrialization of the oxbow lake namely stage iv with the oxbow lake gradually transformed from the lacustrine setting into a terrestrial environment the sediment source gradually switches from the exogenous dominated supply from the main channel by overbank flows to the endogenous dominated deposition due to the reduced frequency of overbank flows gautier et al 2007 richards et al 2022 hydrologically oxbow lakes in stage iii receive water from a variety of sources including direct precipitation overland flow through the catchment upslope of the lakes surface water supply i e hydrologic connection between the lake and channel and groundwater recharge depending on the rate of lake sedimentation the duration of stage iii may last for a wide range of periods among different fluvial settings e g gagliano and howard 1984 dieras 2013 kobus et al 2016 fluvial processes associated with the early two stages i e stages i and ii have been extensively studied thus far e g constantine and dunne 2008 grenfell et al 2012 dieras et al 2013 sylvester et al 2019 whereas limited understanding has been established about the intra stage evolutionary processes for oxbow lakes in stage iii although oxbow lakes in this stage are known to undergo an overall shrinking trend given continuous lake infilling e g wren et al 2008 constantine et al 2010 ishii and hori 2016 the dynamics of lake morphology in response to variable hydrologic conditions of the main channel remain elusive therefore a quantitative assessment of their morphologic responses to fluctuations of river discharge over a short period e g intra annual is still needed for revealing and inferring the driving processes involved in the long term shrinking trend additionally hydrologic connectivity a concept used for characterizing hydrologic interactions between hydrological elements e g oxbow lakes and channels freeman et al 2007 bracken et al 2013 highlights streamflow pulses in generating water and sediment interactions between channels and oxbow lakes e g junk et al 1989 wainwright et al 2011 especially for newer formed lakes hudson et al 2012 however this concept bears different meanings in different quantification approaches and mostly relies on the presence of surface water connection which omits hydrologic processes other than surface water dynamics in controlling oxbow lake hydrology the relations between hydrologic connectivity and oxbow lake variation under a variable hydrologic regime have yet to be explored either hence a full understanding of the evolutionary processes of oxbow lakes requires the answers to the question how does the hydrogeomorphology of oxbow lakes respond to a variable hydrologic regime of the neighboring meandering channel in this study we seek to provide the answers by 1 characterizing the morphology of oxbow lakes in relation to the active channel 2 quantifying their morphologic variations in response to variable hydrologic conditions and 3 revealing variable degrees of hydrologic connectivity among oxbow lakes under variable flow conditions in a pristine meandering reach finally based on the collected samples of lake deposits we illustrate processes revealed by morphologic properties of the oxbow lakes and examine the long term evolution of the meandering river floodplain 2 study area the zoige basin is located on the northeastern edge of the asian water tower and the world s third pole the qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 a with a mean elevation of 3 400 m the basin has a relatively flat topography surrounded by high mountains including the minshan mountains the origin of the studied black river fig 1b as a unique area in the qinghai tibet plateau the zoige basin fosters the world s largest alpine peatland which was formed by lacustrine deposits of a paleolake that collapsed and drained 37 ka before present chen et al 1999 nicoll et al 2013 zeng et al 2017 wang et al 2023 with a relatively cold alpine climate dwc in köppen classification the basin has an annual mean temperature of 0 7 and annually receives 645 mm of precipitation on average li et al 2014 most precipitation occurs in summer due to the prevalent east asian monsoon making the zoige basin one of the moistest regions in the qinghai tibet plateau the land cover of the basin is dominated by herbaceous plants including grassland peatland and a mixture of both although human disturbances are limited due to the harsh living condition peatland degradation is still evident in the upstream hillslopes possibly related to the excavation of artificial ditches and gully erosion over the past five decades qiu et al 2009 li and gao 2019b li et al 2020 the black river is the largest tributary of the upper yellow river in its source region fig 1b with a drainage area of 7 600 km2 and a mean annual discharge of 58 m3 s the middle and lower reaches of the river develop highly sinuous meandering patterns which are primarily characterized by extensively developed point and scroll bars compound bends and oxbow lakes fig 1c precipitation is the major water source of streamflow in the region followed by late spring snowmelt and groundwater supply this study focuses on oxbow lakes developed along a 120 km reach of the downstream black river from the town of dazhasi the seat of the zoige county hereafter referred to as the lower black river the reach averaged channel gradient width and sinuosity are 0 09 86 m and 2 03 respectively channel banks of the lower black river typically consist of a two layer structure with the upper layer being a cohesive vegetation soil mixture and the lower layer comprising fine sand and silt consequently cantilever arms can be easily formed as the lower layer is subject to continuous fluvial erosion leading to bank collapse once the threshold is reached this fluvial mass failure mechanism dominates the rates of bank retreat and meander bend evolution e g gao et al 2021 yang et al 2022 because the cycle of bank collapse takes time usually several years meander bends within the reach evolve slowly giving rise to a mean rate of lateral migration at bend apices of 0 011 width year meander cutoff dominated by neck cutoff has occurred only three times over the last 40 years guo et al 2021 li et al 2023 3 methods 3 1 hydrological analysis characterizing morphologic variations and hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes is built upon the hydrologic conditions of the main channel of the lower black river flood frequency analysis was conducted using the record of annual peak discharges 1980 2020 obtained from the zoige gauge station 33 595 n 102 536 e near the town of dazhasi among the commonly used probability density functions chow et al 1988 the lognormal function is proven to best fit the discharge data the constructed flood frequency curve was subsequently used to determine discharges of given recurrence intervals ris by matching the available satellite images with the calculated recurrence intervals see details in the following section four representative hydrologic conditions were selected which are the mean annual discharge qam 27 1 m3 s assuming the recurrence interval is 0 1 the discharge with 1 year recurrence interval q 1 53 7 m3 s the discharge with 10 year recurrence interval q 10 256 3 m3 s and the record high discharge equivalent to the discharge with about 45 year recurrence interval q 45 376 0 m3 s respectively 3 2 remote sensing acquisition and analysis a total of 86 oxbow lakes were identified along the lower black river for this study using high resolution 10 m images from google earth these lakes encompass all abandoned channels preserved within the floodplains that are identifiable by their presence of water or the desiccated beds and remaining banks we used sequential sentinel 2 imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 m to extract oxbow lake morphology based on water extents under the four flow levels reported above we were unable to find satellite images that correspond to other flow levels e g discharges with 5 year and 20 year ris due to the instantaneous flow pulses that are unable to be captured by the sensor given its revisit time as well as the prevailing cloud cover during the rainy season for each image we generated water masks for oxbow lakes by visual interpretation assisted by the modified normalized difference water index mndwi a widely used spectral index for water delineation based on green and shortwave infrared bands e g xu 2006 rokni et al 2014 singh et al 2015 the planform morphology and the temporal changes of each oxbow lake were subsequently extracted and determined in arcgis pro potential uncertainties may arise from the registration of the original data and errors associated with digitizing subjectivity downward et al 1994 lea and legleiter 2016 donovan et al 2019 the total error calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual error remains 10 m for this study using the same methods as what we adopted for the digitization of anabranching and meandering channels in the same study area guo et al 2021 2023 the planform morphology of oxbow lakes can be described using static and dynamic metrics specifically static metrics are based on the shapes of oxbow lakes and their spatial relationships with the main channel regardless of their surface water levels they include 1 simple or compound oxbow lakes 2 oxbow lakes with and without connecting channels 3 the shortest distance between an oxbow lake and the main channel dc and 4 the distance between the two entrances i e inlet and outlet of an oxbow lake dl specifically a simple oxbow lake must contain one former meander bend defined as an arc 60 while a compound oxbow lake should involve multiple former bends as defined by guo et al 2021 a connecting channel which was also referred to as tie channel or tributary channel e g dietrich et al 1999 rowland et al 2005 2009 is a smaller channel connecting an oxbow lake to the main active channel fig 2 which could be easily detected in google earth both dc and dl were measured based on the remaining banks and beds of the former channel identifiable in google earth which are not affected by water level fluctuations of the lakes the value of dl is the distance between the two ends of the oxbow lake centerline whose minimum value should approximate the width of the main channel at the time when the oxbow lake was formed by neck cutoff the dynamic metrics capture the changes in oxbow lake planform morphology at different water levels which include lake length width and area defined by water masks under the record high flow i e q 45 many oxbow lakes were completely inundated making their morphology unidentifiable in this case we assigned a very large value for their area 1 km2 length 10 km and width 1 km to make them distinct from other non inundated oxbow lakes for each selected oxbow lake we performed linear regression analysis between lake areas at the four flow levels and their corresponding recurrence intervals the established model is generally strong with statistical significance the slope of each model s reflects the rate of change in area for each oxbow lake with a greater s indicating a higher rate of lake expansion with increasing discharge in the main channel hydrologic connectivity generally describes the transport of water and materials involved in the hydrologic cycle freeman et al 2007 bracken et al 2013 for oxbow lakes the hydrologic connectivity is referred to as the degree to which oxbow lakes reconnect to river channels which is a critical process controlling the geomorphic and ecologic properties of meandering river floodplains miranda 2005 glińska lewczuk 2009 riquier et al 2017 wang et al 2020 szewczyk et al 2022 here we quantify the hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes based on surface water connection along a path between an oxbow lake and the adjacent main channel which must be clearly observed from the remotely sensed images according to our preliminary investigation hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes remains low even under relatively high flows i e qam but q 2 in summer to quantify it we proposed a probability based index for hydrologic connectivity phc which is defined as phc 1 r i where the ri of each oxbow lake indicates the magnitude of the main channel discharge under which the lake becomes hydrologically connected to the main channel for example an oxbow lake with phc 1 i e ri 1 means the lake connects to the main channel at discharges q 1 and an oxbow lake with phc 0 022 i e ri 45 means the lake connects to the main channel only at q 45 or higher discharges while remaining disconnected at the other three lower flow levels for oxbow lakes that remain disconnected from the main channel at all four flow levels we assigned a very large ri value i e 100 which means phc 0 01 to make them distinct from others 3 3 field data acquisition and analysis to compensate for the limitations of planform morphology derived from remotely sensed data we collected vertical samples of bed deposits in two oxbow lakes during fieldwork in the summers of 2021 and 2022 two sediment cores were collected in an oxbow lake for particle size analysis cores 1 2 see section 5 3 for details and the relevant discussion and two more sediment cores were collected in two different oxbow lakes for dating analysis cores 3 4 see section 5 4 for details and the relevant discussion specifically cores 1 and 2 are both 120 cm deep while cores 3 and 4 are 140 and 100 cm deep respectively all cores were sliced into sequences of 5 cm sections which were subsequently preprocessed and analyzed using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer for particle size analysis at hohai university china and gamma spectrometry for 137cs dating at chengdu institute of mountain hazards and environment chinese academy of sciences 4 results 4 1 characterizing planform morphology of oxbow lakes most of the 86 identified oxbow lakes 72 were located in the floodplain next to the upstream half section of the study reach from the upstream end dazhasi to the mid point of the reach see fig 1b these lakes were typically clustered in the areas where the main channel contained highly convoluted meander bends demonstrating the correlation between the production rate of oxbow lakes and meandering channel sinuosity constantine and dunne 2008 among all 86 oxbow lakes 39 were located right next to the main channel i e dc 0 while the rest had variable distances from the main channel with the mean dc 0 22 km and the maximum dc 0 99 km fig 3 because oxbow lakes in the study reach were predominately formed by neck cutoff they should have the initial dl of no more than one channel width i e 100 m their subsequent evolution followed different pathways leading to a variety of the current dl ranging from 100 m to 1 52 km with a mean value of 0 34 km fig 3 by plotting dl against dc we show that some oxbow lakes seemed to have two types of unusual morphologic relationships with the first type having small dl but very large dc and the second type characterized by large dl but small dc the first type is possibly the consequence of a relatively fast lateral shifting of the main channel away from the oxbow lakes that made the oxbow lakes unable to receive sufficient sediment from the main channel for infilling the second type suggests the lateral migration of the main channel moving towards the oxbow lakes engulfing the original lake entrances the studied oxbow lakes exhibited two main morphologic characteristics the distinction of compound lakes from simple ones and the prevalence of connecting channels between lakes and channels particularly compound lakes accounted for nearly 49 i e 42 86 while simple ones took about 51 i e 44 86 of the total number of lakes compared with the proportion i e 34 of meander bends that displayed compound forms in the same study reach guo et al 2021 the larger proportion of compound oxbow lakes suggests the prevalence of compound form development in meander bends as an approach other than cutoff to stabilize themselves the compound oxbow lakes also exhibited significantly p 0 05 larger dl i e 0 43 km on average than that i e 0 25 km on average of the simple ones though their dc did not differ significantly for the second characteristic we find that the majority i e 58 86 of oxbow lakes developed small channels connecting the lake and the main channel with a mean width generally of 10 m these channels were commonly formed at lake inlets or outlets where previously developed plug bars were cut through to drain water from the oxbow lakes when the flow stage of the main channel is lower than the water level of the oxbow lakes occasionally they could become pathways to transfer water and sediment from the main channel into the oxbow lakes during high flows thereby initiating surface water connection between the two geomorphic units the connecting channels of the studied oxbow lakes were commonly sinuous and rarely connected with tributaries of the black river in the watershed upslope to the oxbow lakes oxbow lakes with connecting channels had significantly p 0 05 larger dl i e 0 39 km on average than those without connecting channels i e 0 23 km on average fig 3 suggesting the morphologic similarity between oxbow lakes with compound forms compound lakes were larger in dl than simple ones and those with connecting channels their dc values however did not differ significantly among the 58 oxbow lakes with connecting channels thirty two developed connecting channels at the lake inlet twenty created them at the lake outlet and six lakes generated them on both sides the variable locations of the connecting channels indicate the complex interactions among the main channel hydraulics the lake diversion angle the shortest path and the hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes in controlling the formative and evolutionary patterns of the connecting channels moreover the connecting channels seemed to favor compound oxbow lakes over simple ones which was likely related to the greater size and more water volume of the compound oxbow lakes 4 2 morphologic variations of oxbow lakes under variable hydrologic conditions although oxbow lakes gradually shrink in size because of continuous sediment infilling after their plug bar formation i e the end of stage ii their planform morphology is found to vary greatly with fluctuating flow levels fig 4 generally the oxbow lakes along the lower black river showed expansion with the increase of river discharge leading to greater potentials for the lakes to connect to the main channels via surface water however the magnitudes of morphologic changed among the oxbow lakes under different flow levels were different based on their morphologic characteristics described previously figs 5 and 6 the length and area of compound lakes were significantly p 0 05 larger than those of simple lakes at all four flow levels as indicated by the linear regression lines and median values in figs 5 and 6 these differences also increased with the water discharge of the main channel nonetheless lake widths between simple and compound ones did not differ significantly at all flow levels suggesting that the two types of oxbow lakes had similar rates of transverse deposition similarly oxbow lakes with connecting channels had significantly larger p 0 05 lengths and areas at all four flow levels than the lakes without connecting channels figs 5 and 6 whereas their widths were statistically identical especially at q 10 and q 45 these morphologic distinctions reveal that connecting channels tended to develop in larger oxbow lakes and that the formation and evolution of the connecting channels were controlled not only by the magnitude and sediment concentrations of sediment laden flows from the main channel but by the morphologic responses of oxbow lakes therefore it is important to specify the hydrologic conditions when describing the morphologic variations of oxbow lakes overall for all 86 oxbow lakes in the study reach their lengths and widths increased with the water discharge of the main channel figs 5 and 6 with the mean length of 0 475 0 580 1 123 and 1 465 km not including completely inundated lakes and the associated mean width of 0 019 0 022 0 049 and 0 079 km for qam q 1 q 10 and q 45 respectively furthermore lake width increased faster by magnitude than lake length when the discharge of the main channel q 10 suggesting a more rapid widening of the oxbow lakes possibly due to the occurrence of lake overbank flows under very large flows the considerable expansion of lake width due to overbank flow was obvious at q 45 fig 4 the record high flow q 45 that occurred in july 2018 with the discharge nearly 13 times greater than qam marks an unprecedented hydrologic condition in the observed history of the lower black river under such flow the length width and area of all oxbow lakes increased dramatically figs 5 and 6 causing the mean area of all oxbow lakes at the record high flow 5 4 fold greater than that of the lakes at qam the total inundated area along the study reach was 85 3 km2 4 5 fold greater than the water surface area of the channel at qam the inundation was particularly extensive in the floodplains along the upstream section of the study reach causing complete inundation of 15 oxbow lakes that made them unable to be identified in the downstream section of the study reach morphologic variations of the oxbow lakes were limited and no lake was completely inundated even at the record high flow level demonstrating the spatial heterogeneity of channel floodplain interactions in the study reach the degree of morphologic change s of the oxbow lakes ranged between about zero and 0 014 that averaged at 0 0023 oxbow lakes with compound forms and connecting channels were found to have significantly p 0 05 larger s than those having simple forms and without connecting channels respectively fig 7 which indicates higher magnitudes of expansion of the oxbow lakes in the former types the general pattern between s and dc could be expressed as a simple reciprocal function in which s decreased swiftly before dc 0 12 and then decreased with much lower rates for greater dc fig 7a the relationship between s and dl was highly scattered and could be depicted by a statistically significant linear trend with three outliers whose s values were much higher fig 7b 4 3 hydrologic connectivity of the oxbow lakes hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes using the proposed approach phc ranged from 0 01 never connected to the main channel among the four flow levels to 10 always connected to the main channel among the four flow levels with the majority of lakes having their phcs of 0 02 and 0 1 71 out of 86 oxbow lakes fig 8 these trends suggest that for most oxbow lakes there was no hydrologic connection with the main channels at qam and q 1 which reflects a very inactive hydrologic interaction between the oxbow lakes and their adjacent main channel in the lower black river by contrast early studies have reported comparatively higher intra annual hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes in other regions e g junk et al 1989 hudson et al 2012 among all 86 oxbow lakes fourteen 16 3 were never hydrologically connected to the main channel i e phc 0 01 fig 8 these oxbow lakes either remained distant from the main channel or were separated from the main channel by adequate plug bars or higher channel banks leading to their complete isolation even at q 45 thirty 34 9 oxbow lakes which were mostly located in the upper section of the study reach were only hydrologically connected to the main channel at q 45 while remaining disconnected at the other water levels i e phc 0 02 additionally 41 47 7 lakes had phc 0 1 indicating that they could be hydrologically connected to the main channel at q 10 and greater interestingly while no oxbow lake has phc 1 started to achieve hydrologic connection at q 1 there exists one lake i e lake 19 fig 9 that remained hydrologically connected with the main channel at all four water levels i e phc 10 its high degree of hydrologic connectivity was caused by lateral shifting of the main channel that reactivated the previously isolated oxbow lake exemplifying the strong but infrequent effect of the lateral migration of the main channel on oxbow lake evolution for all studied oxbow lakes while no correlation was found between phc and dl their phc and the associated dc exhibited a negative correlation fig 10 suggesting that dc may infer the hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes the oxbow lakes with connecting channels had considerably higher hydrologic connectivity the average times among the four flow levels is 1 43 than those without connecting channels the average time is 1 18 thus whether a connecting channel is developed or not may be another morphologic indicator for the hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes 5 discussion 5 1 the nature of hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes as a critical hydrogeomorphic and ecologic property of oxbow lakes hydrologic connectivity has been characterized and quantified using a variety of approaches including classifying connecting patterns between lakes and channels determining the threshold discharge estimating the frequency and magnitude of floods that induce connectivity and interpreting the depositional patterns of oxbow lake infills e g dembkowski and miranda 2011 hudson et al 2012 phillips 2013 shen et al 2021 however there are no consistent metrics that can be used for directly comparing the degrees of hydrologic connectivity among various oxbow lakes in floodplains of different fluvial systems the probability based index phc proposed in this study quantifies the variable degrees of hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes in terms of recurrence interval a common hydrological concept that is comparable among rivers in any region although our results are site specific the index phc is transformable for quantifying the hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes in other fluvial systems with different hydrologic regimes in our case oxbow lakes in the floodplain of the lower black river exhibited extremely low hydrologic connectivity with most lakes remaining disconnected from the main channel at qam and q 1 fig 8 by contrast many oxbow lakes in lowland floodplains reported in the literature have higher hydrologic connectivity e g miranda 2005 hudson et al 2012 czuba et al 2019 oxbow lakes with comparably low hydrologic connectivity may include the artificially regulated ones in highly populated areas such as the floodplain of the middle yangtze river i e the jingjiang reach where the embankment had significantly deactivated channel floodplain interactions e g xia et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the low hydrologic connectivity of the studied oxbow lakes is likely attributable to the unique fluvial setting of the lower black river numerous studies have demonstrated that tributaries of the upper yellow river including the black river were subject to the knickpoint incision due to intense channel downcutting induced by the combined climatic and tectonic movements since the collapse of the zoige paleolake 37 ka before present e g chen et al 1999 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2023 consequently the lower black river becomes an underfit river davis 1913 beaty 1990 srivastava et al 2014 in which the flows can rarely reach the bankfull stage under the prevailing hydrologic regime li and gao 2019a this fact explains the scarcity of large area inundation in the study reach and why it may only occur at the unprecedented record high peak flow 5 2 interactions between hydrologic connectivity and morphologic variations of oxbow lakes oxbow lakes in the study reach are found to increase in size i e length width and area as discharges increase in the main channel figs 4 6 although their hydrologic connectivity is relatively low fig 8 it follows that the expansion of the lakes was not always caused by surface water supplied via the lake channel connection but more by direct precipitation on the oxbow lakes and upslope overland flow draining into the lakes during various storm events therefore the hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes is not the only mechanism driving dynamic changes of oxbow lakes one missing piece might be the role of groundwater in oxbow lake variations during the prolonged non rainfall periods the high spatial and temporal variations of groundwater levels in the study area suggest that the impact of groundwater on oxbow lakes could be complex li and gao 2020 which awaits more field based data although connecting channels between the studied oxbow lakes and the main channel may promote hydrologic connectivity their presence does not signify continuous hydrologic connectivity all year round indeed we have observed in the field that the connecting channels commonly remained desiccated or had very little water flowing towards the main channel even during some higher flow periods when the main channel discharge exceeds qam in these periods hydrologic connectivity should not be considered to have occurred because 1 oxbow lakes did not receive channel water under these hydrologic conditions due to the higher water stage of the oxbow lake than that of the main channel and 2 the major portion of the connecting channels remained desiccated the conditions featuring the stage differences between the oxbow lake and the main channel was unique from those observed in large fluvial settings especially in large anabranching systems where the hydrologic connectivity of floodplain lakes is generally high with the synchronous water stages between main channel and lakes e g hu et al 2015 park and latrubesse 2017 park 2020 additionally the actual longitudinal profiles of connecting channels i e oxbow lake end higher than main channel end developed in the study reach seemed to differ from those of tie channels i e main channel end higher than oxbow lake end formed by sediment laden flows from the main channel suggesting distinct formative mechanisms and hydrologic patterns of the connecting channels in the lower black river from previously studied tie channel or tributary channel dietrich et al 1999 rowland et al 2005 2009 the higher s associated with oxbow lakes in compound forms fig 7 was likely attributed to their larger areas that allowed for more desiccated lakes beds to be inundated from a lower flow e g qam and q 1 to a higher flow e g q 10 similarly the higher s associated with oxbow lakes that develop connecting channels may be related not only to their greater areas but to the higher hydrologic connectivity which enabled relatively active water supply from the main channel via surface water connection the fact that a larger dc correlates with generally a smaller s fig 7a and a smaller phc fig 10 demonstrates that dc is an important morphologic index for inferring morphologic variation and hydrology of oxbow lakes moreover the generally higher s associated with small dc but large dl fig 7 highlights greater morphologic variation occurring in the oxbow lakes that are prone to lateral migration of the main channel see fig 3 by linking the mean s to phc for all studied oxbow lakes a general positive correlation can be found fig 11 for phc 0 1 the increase of phc may lead to linearly increased mean s suggesting that morphologic changes of oxbow lakes were more sensitive to phc when its degree was relatively low when phc 0 1 even a greater increase of phc would not cause a significant increase of the mean s implying that higher degrees of hydrologic connectivity had a very limited impact on morphologic changes of oxbow lakes it should be noted that this trend is only based on a single point with phc 10 the apparently limited impact might suggest that hydrologic connectivity is merely one driving force that controls morphologic variations of oxbow lakes 5 3 impact of main channel migration on oxbow lake evolution the production of an oxbow lake in the floodplain of a meandering river relies on the flow regime of the meandering river and its key morphodynamic properties such as the channel sinuosity and the rates of sediment transport and lateral migration constantine and dunne 2008 hooke 2013 in fully developed oxbow lakes i e in stage iii sedimentation patterns may still be influenced by the diversion angle between the lake inlet and the main channel fisk 1947 constantine et al 2010 schwendel et al 2018 however the diversion angle could continuously change owing to the evolution of oxbow lakes and meandering channels which in turn affects the rate and pattern of sedimentation in oxbow lakes furthermore as plug bars grow to the elevation that disconnects the oxbow lake from the main channel the in lake sedimentation will be much less dependent on the diversion angle in this study we examine these changes through the spatial relationships between oxbow lake and the main channel values of dl and dc of an oxbow lake in their initiation i e after the emergence of plug bars stage ought to be about one channel width i e 100 m and zero unidentifiable from the remotely sensed data respectively subsequently both dl and dc should increase over time because the development of plug bars leads to the gradual retreat of oxbow lake entrances before reaching the position of the peak dl resulting in a positive correlation between the two i e the red points in fig 12 this relationship holds when the rate of the lateral migration of the main channel is much less than that of in lake sedimentation however many oxbow lakes follow two different spatial relationships with one having very small dl but large dc and the other showing very small including zero dc but large dl fig 12 in the first relationship the oxbow lakes remain largely in their original sizes without notable in lake sedimentation but are distant from the main channel due to its laterally migrating away from the lakes in the second one the oxbow lakes are located right next to the channels but their inlets are distant from the outlets because the main channel migrates towards them these two different processes of channel migration affect the evolution of oxbow lakes differently with the former reducing the degree of hydrologic connectivity and the latter enhancing it the absence of a general dl dc relationship fig 12 suggests the important role of lateral migration of the main channel in oxbow lake evolution as highlighted in previous studies gagliano and howard 1984 erskine et al 1992 richards et al 2022 interestingly the evolution of oxbow lakes may also be uniquely disturbed by direct contact of the main channel in positions away from the inlet and outlet where plug bars do not exist resulting in the reactivation of the lake as exemplified by oxbow lake 19 fig 9 this process significantly intensified the hydrologic connectivity of the oxbow lake by allowing water in the main channel to move into the oxbow lake more frequently making it the only case with phc 10 among all studied oxbow lakes the sediment core core 1 collected at site a where the lake was reactivated shows notable fine particle d 50 ranges between 11 and 23 µm layers below the level of 30 cm from the surface and two peaks of coarser particles d 50 58 and 39 µm respectively in the shallower layers of 10 15 cm and 25 30 cm deep fig 13 the two peaks may be attributable to the record high flow in 2018 during which the higher flows caused rapid deposition of coarse sediments within the lake and the pre 2018 event that triggered the reactivation of the oxbow lake respectively at site b the deep layer below the 30 cm level from the surface deposits are slightly courser than those at site a possibly because site b was prone to the incoming flow from the main channel before the oxbow lake was reactivated two peaks in d 50 d 50 52 and 45 µm respectively are present at the layers of 5 10 cm and 45 50 cm below the surface of site b as well fig 13 which may also be related to the same events as described in site a but underwent different sedimentation rates this unique case suggests that although the reactivation event does not occur frequently in the lower black river its impact on the sedimentation patterns and the resultant evolutionary trajectory of the oxbow lake is significant in the future with the continuous growth of the natural levee of the main channel and the formation of a new plug bar near site a this oxbow lake will likely undergo a reduced rate of sedimentation while the main channel will continue to erode the lake 5 4 implications for floodplain evolution of meandering rivers lateral migration of river channels overbank sediment deposition and production and sedimentation of oxbow lakes are the key processes controlling the evolution of floodplains of meandering systems e g hooke 2013 constantine et al 2014 ielpi et al 2022 2023 in order to assess the sedimentation rate of oxbow lakes in the study reach we collected bed deposits of two oxbow lakes i e 3 and 48 formed at different times specifically according to satellite records oxbow lake 3 was possibly formed more than 50 years ago which has a dc of zero and a dl of 0 13 km relatively small whereas oxbow lake 48 was formed in the early 1990s because the peak concentration of 137cs can be accurately dated to the year 1963 for lake deposits in east asia due to the maximum global fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests he et al 1996 lan et al 2020 we found the 1963 peak in 137cs for oxbow lake 3 and estimated its post 1963 average sedimentation rate of about 0 99 cm year fig 14 a for oxbow lake 48 the absence of a prominent peak in 137cs indicates that its formation time must be later than 1963 fig 14b which is consistent with our observation from the satellite images given that the deepest layer i e the layer of 95 100 cm below the surface may not reach the bottom of post cutoff deposits a minimum sedimentation rate of about 4 8 cm year can be calculated based on the total depth of the sediment core and the earliest possible year of deposition at the 95 100 cm layer clearly the dramatic difference in sedimentation rate between the two oxbow lakes illustrates a fast to slow transition of sedimentation rate of oxbow lakes as they evolve which is in accord with the patterns seen in typical lowland rivers of various sizes e g wren et al 2008 ishii and hori 2016 shen et al 2021 although oxbow lakes in the lower black river generally exhibit low hydrologic connectivity and very infrequent overbank flows the significant amount of in lake sedimentation compared with oxbow lakes in other fluvial systems reported e g erskineet al 1992 citterio and piégay 2009 ishii and hori 2016 may still be contributed from the occasional hydrologic connection to the main channels during high magnitude flow pulses e g q 10 and q 45 the spatiotemporal variations of the channel migration determine dynamic patterns of not only oxbow lake infilling but floodplain reworking e g mertes et al 1996 gautier et al 2007 in the lower black river the estimated rate of the channel migration at apices of meander bends averages at 0 011 widths year with a maximum of 0 034 widths year this is an extremely slow rate compared to those of most meandering rivers worldwide guo et al 2021 the low migration rate would be equivalent to a recycling period of 8 000 years for the river s alluvial plain assuming the valley width is approximately 90 times the channel bankfull width while this recycling period is considerably longer than those of other studied meandering reaches e g mertes et al 1996 gautier et al 2007 aalto et al 2008 vayssière et al 2020 it could even be longer due to the spatially uneven rates of channel migration the occurrence of meander cutoffs and the long term centennial to millennial climatic and physiographic changes the extensive peatland preserved within the valley of the black river best demonstrates the limited impact of channel migration on floodplain reworking overall the floodplain of the lower black river is characterized by inactive reworking of the meandering channel infrequent but pulsed sedimentation patterns within oxbow lakes and very rare overbank sedimentation in floodplains without oxbow lakes although floods equivalent to the 2018 record high flow which caused dramatic sedimentation across inundated areas within the floodplains can rarely occur based on the observable history the possibility of occurrence is likely to increase soon under the prevailing warming wetting and polarizing trends of climate change in the qinghai tibet plateau zhou and zhang 2021 yao et al 2022 this may eventually lead to more rapid sedimentation via overbank flow and channel migration across floodplains due to intensified fluvial erosion which collectively contribute to a more dynamic floodplain of the lower black river 6 conclusions although there is a consensus that the evolution of oxbow lakes involves four stages including the meander bend cutoff lacustrine and terrestrial phases knowledge of the processes controlling morphologic variation of oxbow lakes at stage iii and its relation to hydrologic connectivity remains limited in this study we examine a group of pristine oxbow lakes in a highly sinuous meandering reach in the upper yellow river watershed by characterizing their morphology and hydrologic connectivity and revealing the key processes driving the intra stage evolution of the oxbow lakes we find that the development of compound forms and connecting channels are the main morphologic characteristics of the oxbow lakes and that the distance between the oxbow lake and the main channel dc correlates positively with the distance between oxbow lake entrances dl when the lateral migration of the main channel is inactive their relationship may be complicated when the main channel is locally more active which could lead to distinct evolutional trajectories of the oxbow lakes in their lacustrine phase i e stage iii using four hydrologic benchmarks based on flood frequency analysis and remotely sensed data we observe a consistent expansion of the oxbow lakes with increasing discharges of the main channel the expansion is mainly attributable to increased length at flows q 10 and to increased width at flows q 10 the rate of morphologic variation s of the oxbow lakes correlates negatively and nonlinearly with dc while positively and linearly with dl suggesting that the lateral migration of the main channel enhances the magnitude of oxbow lake expansion their expansion is persistent with increasing river discharge regardless of whether the oxbow lake connects to the main channel via surface water this demonstrates that oxbow lake hydrology is not only controlled by hydrologic connectivity but by direct precipitation and supply of hillslope overland flow moreover the existing approaches conceptualizing hydrologic connectivity based on surface water connection ignore the potential impact of groundwater interactions between oxbow lakes and main channels which awaits future investigations derived from field data a new probability based index phc that can potentially be used for oxbow lakes in other fluvial systems is proposed to quantify the degree of hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes the studied ones are found to have low hydrologic connectivity which can be inferred from dc and connecting channel presence the low degree of hydrologic connectivity is caused by the climatic and tectonic driven channel downcutting of the upper yellow river with the slow migration of the meandering channel a comparatively inactive

1721,accurately identifying the sources of trace elements in groundwater is difficult especially in the areas with intensive human activities this study proposes a framework to identify and quantify the contributions of potential sources of trace elements in groundwater health risk assessment is first conducted to identify the trace elements with the highest threats to groundwater quality and then the geographical detector is used to qualitatively investigate the potential sources and processes dominating the pollution from identified trace elements and the absolute principal component scores multivariate linear regression apcs mlr is used to quantify the contributions of different sources to the accumulation of trace elements the proposed approach was applied to china s loess plateau a typical water limited area with rapid urbanization and intensive agricultural activities after conducting two groundwater sampling campaigns in a flood and a dry season the trace element concentrations in groundwater exhibited significant spatial and seasonal differences health risk assessment revealed that cr and as through oral ingestion were responsible for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in different seasons land use was the primary factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of cr in the flood season while elevation and distance from city were dominant factors in the dry season normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and distance from city contributed the most to as change in the flood season but ndvi was the major contributor in the dry season the average contributions of potential pollution sources to trace elements in groundwater were in the order of natural source 35 geogenic process 17 industrial source 13 in the flood season but mixed sources 47 agricultural activities 18 in the dry season distinguished from the traditional source apportionment methods the newly proposed approach is not limited to identification of pollutant sources but also can obtain the exact contributions of different sources the findings provide useful information for groundwater management in the loess plateau keywords health risk assessment driving factors source apportionment pca apcs mlr geographical detector data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a significant component of water resources groundwater plays an important role in agricultural irrigation industrial development and domestic drinking especially in the arid areas with scarce rainfall and surface water adimalla and qian 2020 more than half of the world s population uses groundwater for drinking purpose and the population will increase in near future due to global environmental change and rapid population growth jasechko and perrone 2021 oki and kanae 2006 however the declining quality of groundwater has reduced the availability of water resources and posed a great threat to human health alarcón herrera et al 2013 although some trace elements are essential for maintaining the normal operation of human functions their enrichment in groundwater will have adverse effects jabbo et al 2022 tong et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 for instance long term consumption of high as groundwater can cause cardiovascular hematological respiratory neurological and renal diseases mink et al 2008 excessive cr in drinking water is prone to skin respiratory and digestive diseases jobby et al 2018 pb polluted groundwater can harm the kidney and nervous system xiao et al 2019 thus in order to reduce environmental risks and ensure human health attention should be paid to trace elements in groundwater a considerable number of natural e g elevation precipitation slope soil type and distance from rivers and anthropogenic factors e g land use emission sources distance from city and distance from mine can influence the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of trace elements in groundwater bing et al 2019 higgins et al 2022 mukherjee et al 2018 in many cases the changes in trace element concentrations are affected by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors zhang et al 2016 moreover these factors can interact with each other greatly complicating the driving mechanism of the spatiotemporal patterns of trace elements in groundwater xiao et al 2022 previous studies have qualitatively explored the effects of driving factors chi et al 2018 based on multivariate analysis methods including cluster analysis principal component analysis and correlation analysis bastami et al 2015 chai et al 2021 chi et al 2018 wu et al 2017 nevertheless few studies have quantitatively explored the interactions of driving factors on the spatiotemporal distribution of trace elements in groundwater which resulted in a poor understanding of the driving mechanism of trace element concentrations to overcome these limitations the geographical detector will be employed in this study to test the spatial consistency between trace element concentrations and driving factors wang et al 2016 compared with the traditional statistical methods the outstanding advantage of the geographical detector is the ability to calculate the contribution of individual driving factor and the interaction among different driving factors quantifying the sources of pollutants is an imperative step in groundwater quality protection and management the sources of trace elements in groundwater are generally diverse including natural origin e g parent rocks weathering mineral dissolution adsorption desorption mukherjee et al 2018 su et al 2019 and anthropogenic origin e g agricultural activities industry discharges domestic sewage bing et al 2019 higgins et al 2022 qiao et al 2019 the source apportionment of pollutants in groundwater has been previously carried out through the investigation of potential pollution sources and comparison of test indicators with groundwater quality standards however it is difficult to effectively interpret and extract useful information from pollution sources for traditional methods because of the complexity of measurement and survey datasets wallace et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 because groundwater quality can be considered as a function of natural and human sources jin et al 2019 the receptor models show outstanding advantages in terms of source allocation through determining the physicochemical characteristics of groundwater samples and potential pollution sources chai et al 2021 zanotti et al 2019 some source apportionment models such as positive matrix factorization pmf and principal component analysis pca can quantify the contribution of potential sources of pollutants however the above quantitative source allocation methods are based on the concentration relationship of the trace elements involved in the calculation and can only roughly calculate the number of sources for trace element accumulation in groundwater in other words these mathematical methods ignore the spatial characteristics of pollution sources and external environmental influences which may result in inaccurate definition of pollution sources therefore the absolute principal component scores multivariate linear regression apcs mlr will be employed in this study to quantify the contribution of potential pollution sources identified by pca the loess plateau in china has the most typical and widely distributed loess in the world accounting for 6 6 of land area and supporting 8 5 of population of china groundwater in this area constitutes the main source of water supply for agricultural production industrial development ecological security and domestic purposes li et al 2022 rapid urbanization industrialization and intensive agricultural activities have significantly caused the degradation of groundwater quality liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 recently trace element pollution has been observed in groundwater on the loess plateau xiao et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 yan et al 2022 however until now systematic studies on the characteristics controlling factors and sources of trace elements in groundwater are still scarce on the loess plateau in order to more accurately identify and quantify the sources of trace elements in groundwater this study will propose a framework by combining health risk assessment model geographic detector and pca apcs mlr specifically taking china s loess plateau as an example this study will i describe the spatial and seasonal pattern of trace elements in groundwater ii identify the sources of trace elements and iii partition the contribution of different trace element sources to groundwater pollution the potential novelty of this study is that the proposed framework will technically support similar studies and the findings can be referred for groundwater quality management in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau 33 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e is located in northwest china and covers an area of 6 4 105 km2 fig 1 a including the provinces of inner mongolia ningxia shaanxi shanxi and gansu li et al 2022 the area is under the influence of the continental monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation of 154 3 947 1 mm and 50 of the precipitation occurs from july to september jin et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a the annual average potential evapotranspiration varies from 865 1 to 1274 0 mm significantly exceeding the annual average precipitation li et al 2017 the landforms are mainly classified into three categories mountains loess hilly and gully areas and alluvial basins li and qian 2018 the main land use is grassland 41 7 followed by cultivated land 32 3 and forestland 15 1 fig 1b the cultivated land is mostly located in the guanzhong basin hetao plain ningxia plain and along the fen river the extensive utilization of fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural activities is deteriorating groundwater quality moreover groundwater pollution attributed to industrial and mining activities e g coal extraction has also been reported in the loess plateau hua et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 according to the hydrogeological characteristics the groundwater in the study area is classified into quaternary loose sediment pore water and bedrock fissure water with a thickness of 10 50 m and a shallow burial depth of 2 8 m the quaternary pore water aquifer is mainly recharged by precipitation the bedrock fissure aquifer mainly distributed in the loess hilly and gully area are regarded as an excellent source of water for residents due to its large storage capacity and low salinity su et al 2017 the general direction of groundwater flow roughly matches the topographic trend i e a west to east direction fig 1c 2 2 groundwater sampling and measurement to eliminate the effects of river recharge we collected groundwater in high altitude areas with a water table at least 10 m deep the groundwater in these areas is the only water source for drinking irrigation and production for residents thus highlighting the influence of anthropogenic activities considering the seasonal effects two groundwater sampling campaigns have been carried out during a flood season august 2018 37 samples and a dry season april 2019 27 samples fig 1a considering the adverse effects of water accumulation in the well we pumped water for 30 min before collecting the formal samples all groundwater samples were filtered in situ via a 0 45 μm nylon filter whatman to remove insoluble particulate matter from groundwater samples for trace elements analysis were stocked in clean polyethylene bottles with acidification to ph 2 samples for anion measurement were stocked in clean polyethylene bottles without acidification after sampling all samples were stocked in a portable refrigerator at 4 c in the field information on the location of sampling sites including latitude longitude and elevation was stored in the gps navigator the total dissolved solids tds and ph of groundwater were measured by a multi parameter portable measuring instrument hanna hi98129 the main anions cl so4 2 and no3 were determined with ion chromatography ics 1100 usa with a detection limit of 1 mg l the concentration of trace elements cr mn fe ni cu zn as sr cd and pb was determined with a full spectrum plasma generating spectrometer icap 6300 usa with a detection limit of 1 μg l the flowchart of data analysis was presented in fig 2 since the data failed to meet the assumption of normal distribution the kruskal wallis nonparametric test was used to compare water quality parameters in dry and flood seasons the spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters was obtained with inverse distance weighted idw interpolation fig 3 2 3 health risk assessment humans can be exposed to pollutants in groundwater via a variety of pathways of all exposure pathways dermal absorption and oral ingestion are the primary pathways of contaminants the health risk assessment proposed by the usepa 2004 has been extensively applied to quantitatively evaluate the potential hazards of groundwater contaminants varol and tokatlı 2022 in this study we focused on the non carcinogenic hazard index hi and carcinogenic risk cr of trace elements in groundwater by different age groups adults and children based on behavioral and physiological differences the hi and cr of all elements in groundwater via each exposure pathway were summed to calculate the total cancer risk tcr and total hazard index hitotal the consensus based subsidiary parameters and mathematical expressions are shown in the supplementary material text 1 in the deterministic approach the parameters in the health risk assessment are represented by most likely or average values usepa 1997 this approach is simple and easy to understand but an oversight of the differences among members of the same population leads to uncertainties kaur et al 2020 therefore a more realistic technique is required to overcome the problem in this study the probabilistic method known as monte carlo simulation technique was used for this purpose the monte carlo simulation analysis was performed for 10 000 iterations for selected values of each variable based on random distribution functions the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to adults and children from trace elements in groundwater via oral ingestion and dermal absorption routes were assessed moreover sensitivity analysis based on spearman rank correlation was employed to identify the variables mostly affecting non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks the monte carlo simulation analysis was implemented using oracle crystal ball software version 11 1 2 4 source apportionment geographical detector was employed to evaluate the dominance and interaction of multiple environmental factors on the spatial and seasonal differences of high risk trace elements in groundwater further the correlation analysis ca pca and apcs mlr were applied to estimate the source contribution of heavy metals in groundwater 2 4 1 geographical detector the geographical detector is a statistical method for detecting spatial heterogeneity and revealing the explanatory power of driving factors wang and xu 2017 this approach was applied to explore whether the spatiotemporal distribution of the independent variable x environmental factors and the dependent variable y trace elements tend to be consistent in this study the factor detector and interaction detector were employed to explore the explanatory power of eight factors on the concentration of high risk trace elements and the strength of their interactions the geographical detector was implemented using the gd package in the r software and the results of parameter optimization were shown in table s3 s7 more thorough description of the software can be found in wang et al 2010 and wang and xu 2017 and the related equations and methods applied to this study were presented in the supplementary material text 2 2 4 2 principal component analysis pca is effective to reduce the dimensionality of original hydrochemical data and transform the interrelated hydrochemical variables into uncorrelated principal components pcs vega et al 1998 in this study pca was use to reveal the origin of trace elements in groundwater and their influencing factors the kmo kaiser meyer olkin and bartlett s sphericity test were applied to evaluate the suitability of hydrochemical data for pca kaiser 1974 shrestha and kazama 2007 in this study the bartlett s sphericity test values were 0 in the flood and dry seasons while the kmo values were 0 39 and 0 7 in the corresponding seasons respectively it suggested that the data in the flood season were unsuitable for pca and redesigning the variable structure should be considered therefore eight trace elements except for sr and zn were selected for pca in the flood season because their kmo value was 0 51 the dispersion of trace elements in groundwater was identified by pca through calculating the variance the representative pcs were extracted on the basis of eigenvalues greater than unity helena et al 2000 the varimax rotation was used to facilitate interpretation of the underlying factors affecting trace elements in groundwater factor loadings 0 75 0 50 0 75 and 0 30 0 50 were considered to be strong moderate and weak loadings respectively haji gholizadeh et al 2016 2 4 3 absolute principal component scores multivariate linear regression the apcs mlr receptor model described by thurston and spengler 1985 was performed for quantitative source assignment based on absolute principal component scores apcs in pca and multiple linear regression mlr zhang et al 2020a the detailed calculation of the apcs mlr was presented in the supplementary material of text 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics table 1 listed the statistics of the hydrochemical parameters of groundwater in different seasons the groundwater was weakly alkaline with ph ranging 6 7 8 6 average 7 6 and 7 2 8 1 average 7 6 in the flood and dry seasons respectively tds ranged from 247 to 1410 mg l average 449 9 mg l in the flood season and 220 to 1015 mg l average 400 4 mg l in the dry season according to the average concentration trace elements can be classified into three categories xiao et al 2019 the average concentrations of zn and sr were 100 μg l which were high abundance elements the average concentrations of cr mn fe ni cu and as ranged 1 100 μg l belonging to medium abundance elements the cd and pb were low abundance elements with concentrations 1 μg l the comparison of trace element contents in groundwater of the loess plateau with other regions was presented in table 2 the contents of cr ni and cu was much higher than the average level in china and even higher than those in most regions of the world tong et al 2021 the content of cr and ni in this study was only lower than the pampean plain argentina and the northeast nigeria respectively jabbo et al 2022 the contents of fe mn cd and pb were relatively low compared to the listed areas in general the pollution level of most trace elements in groundwater on the loess plateau was moderate while that of cr was prominent blanes et al 2011 nadiri et al 2018 the average concentrations of all the selected elements were within the permissible limits of the drinking water guidelines by who 2011 usepa 2021 and chinese standards css 2017 except that of zn in the flood season and ni in the dry season 3 2 spatial and seasonal variations in trace elements fig 3 showed the spatial and seasonal patterns of trace elements in groundwater on the loess plateau spatially the groundwater samples with high cd cr mn and sr concentrations were mainly observed in the eastern and southern plains with heavy rainfall low elevation and dense population while high pb as cu ni fe and zn concentrations were mainly found in the western and eastern hilly areas seasonally the percentage differences between two seasons were positive for most trace elements suggesting that higher concentrations existed in the flood season moreover the kruskal wallis nonparametric test suggested that differences in concentrations of as cr cu fe and pb were significant p 0 05 in both seasons which was consistent with the higher percentage difference of these elements 3 3 assessed health risk fig s1 showed the results of the non carcinogenic health risk assessment of trace elements via direct ingestion and dermal absorption pathways as and cr were the major contributors to non carcinogenic risks via oral ingestion and dermal absorption in both seasons the mean values of hqingestion hqdermal and hi for all trace elements in different seasons were smaller than the acceptable limit indicating negligible non carcinogenic risks from individual elements however the hitotal calculated by adding hi of all elements was 1 06 for children in the flood season suggesting the potential non carcinogenic risks of multiple elements in groundwater the hi values of each trace element for both adults and children were in the order of as cr ni other elements fig s1 the average hi values of all trace elements were within the acceptable level in both seasons however the maximum hi values were 1 38 for adults and 1 44 for children in the flood season for as while the values were 1 16 and 1 91 for children in the flood and dry seasons for cr respectively this suggested that some groundwater samples may pose non carcinogenic risks to local residents in the flood season high non carcinogenic risk areas were mainly observed in the western area with area proportions of 6 and 33 for adults and children respectively fig 4 in the dry season the proportion of high non carcinogenic risk areas decreased to 0 4 for adults and 2 for children fig 4 overall children were more vulnerable to non carcinogenic risks than adults moreover the non carcinogenic risks of trace elements in the flood season were higher than the dry season table s8 showed the statistics of cr and tcr for adults and children in the flood and dry seasons the oral ingestion was the dominant pathway of carcinogenic risk to humans the average tcr values for adults were higher than those for children in both seasons which implied that adults were more vulnerable to carcinogenic risk than children moreover 95 of average tcr in the flood season and 75 in the dry season were attributed to as suggesting that as was a major contributor to cancer risk for adults approximately 86 of samples had tcr values exceeding the acceptable limit of 10 4 manifesting high carcinogenic risk fig 5 a in case of children all tcr values were within or below the medium risk range of 1 10 5 to 1 10 4 fig 5b the maximum tcr values of pb were 8 57 10 8 for adults and 7 96 10 9 for children in both seasons indicating that the carcinogenic risk of pb was within the acceptable risk level for as and cr larger tcr values maximum tcras 6 19 10 4 tcrcr 1 16 10 4 were observed indicating that as and cr had a greater carcinogenic risk therefore as and cr in groundwater were screened as high risk elements fig 6 showed the spatial distribution of tcr of as cr and pb for adults and children in the flood and dry seasons for adults and children the highest tcr was found in the northwest in the flood season but in the northwest and southeast in the dry season the proportions of high tcr areas were higher in the flood season moreover adults faced a higher carcinogenic risk than children which is due to differences in physiological parameters between age groups the high variability of population related parameters in terms of health risk characteristics may result in uncertainties zuzolo et al 2020 the monte carlo simulation was employed to evaluate the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks for adults and children text 4 and the results showed that the deterministic approach slightly overestimated health risks in addition the complex chemical composition of groundwater has synergistic and antagonistic effects in maintaining human health e g zn may reduce the toxicity of arsenic peng et al 2022 these factors would affect the evaluation results 3 4 identified factors influencing cr and as as cr and as were identified as high risk elements y they were used as main indicators to explore the controlling factors of trace elements the geographical detector was employed to evaluate the effects and interactions of nine variables i e x1 land use x2 elevation x3 precipitation x4 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi x5 slope x6 distance from city x7 distance from river and x8 distance from mine on the spatial and seasonal differentiation of cr and as concentrations the results were presented in fig 7 where the values in bold represented the explanatory power q value of a single factor and other values denoted the effects of a pair of factors x1 exhibited stronger explanatory power for the spatial variation of cr concentration during the flood season with a q value of 0 20 p 0 05 suggesting that anthropogenic factors i e land use may dominate the spatial heterogeneity of cr concentrations in the dry season x2 q 0 61 and x6 q 0 62 were the dominant factors indicating that natural i e elevation and anthropogenic factors i e distance from city jointly affected the spatial distribution of cr concentrations for as x4 q 0 70 p 0 05 and x6 q 0 91 p 0 05 in the flood season while x4 q 0 75 p 0 05 in the dry season were the major drivers implying that natural i e ndvi and anthropogenic factors i e distance from city greatly affected the spatial differentiation of as concentration in the flood season while ndvi with the highest explanatory power in the dry season in areas with high vegetation coverage the as concentration in groundwater was lower fig s6d and fig s7d which was inseparable from the enrichment of contaminants e g as by vegetation in the water soil system wang and zhao 2009 the interactions between x1 and other explanatory variables exhibited linearly enhanced effects on cr in the flood season in the dry season although x6 was not significant its interaction with x3 and x8 exhibited a significantly enhanced effect in the flood season x6 only exhibited linearly enhanced interactions with x3 p 0 99 and x5 p 0 96 on as while showed a unidirectional weakening effect with other explanatory variables this implied that the interaction between natural factors i e precipitation slope and anthropogenic factors i e distance from city had an important influence on as distribution fig s6e showed that the comprehensive pollution index of groundwater in the gentle slope area was significantly higher than that in the steep slope area indicating that the pollutants migrated along the slope to enrich into groundwater jia et al 2017 murray et al 2019 in the dry season the significant linearly enhanced effects were observed between x4 x5 and x4 x7 suggesting that the interactions between different natural factors i e ndvi slope and ndvi distance from river had significant effects on the spatial pattern of as 3 5 source of trace elements three pcs with eigenvalues 1 were extracted in the flood season table 3 which explained 35 17 and 13 of the total variance respectively pc1 exhibited strong positive loadings with ni 0 91 and cu 0 88 and moderate negative loadings with cr 0 57 these elements mainly originated from natural processes chromium in the form of silicates bound and strongly adsorbed in aquifers constituted the main source of cr in groundwater yan et al 2022 as a siderophile element ni is mainly derived from the weathering of parent material chai et al 2021 cu was considered to be of natural origin owing to the significant correlation between cu and ni in groundwater fig 8 a jin et al 2019 shi et al 2022 pc2 showed significant positive loadings with pb 0 71 as 0 69 and fe 0 61 these elements are mainly of geological origin chlorite as a common fe bearing clay mineral in loess can provide an abundant source of fe in groundwater ye et al 2020 as is mainly related to leaching and weathering of loess moreover the alkaline conditions and high na ca ratios in the study area are conducive to the desorption of adsorbed as in loess resulting in the enrichment of as in groundwater zhang et al 2022b the natural origin of pb can be confirmed by the good correlation between pb and fe fig 8a zhang et al 2020b pc3 exhibited significant positive loadings with mn 0 78 and cd 0 64 these elements were considered to be of industrial sources e g industry effluents xiao et al 2021 in the dry season two pcs with eigenvalues 1 were extracted pc1 explaining 47 of the variance showed strong loadings with fe 0 91 zn 0 88 mn 0 87 ni 0 86 cd 0 82 and cu 0 80 natural and anthropogenic inputs should be responsible for these elements the loess and parent material weathering are the major contributors of fe cu and ni in groundwater vehicular discharge and municipal emission constitute a significant source of zn in groundwater xiao et al 2019 mn and cd were mainly from metal industry pc2 accounted for 18 of the variance and was mainly associated with cr 0 86 sr 0 84 pb 0 40 and as 0 37 the good correlations between cr and no3 indicated agricultural source of cr in groundwater fig 8b the agricultural origin of sr and as can be confirmed by their good correlation with cr fig 8b the contributions of sources identified by pca to individual trace element were estimated by the apcs mlr table 4 the r2 values for most water quality parameters from apcs mlr model were 0 5 and the ratio of the mean measured and predicted values of all variables was close to 1 indicating that the results of the apcs mlr model were robust for source apportionment tokatlı et al 2023 varol et al 2022 in the flood season the contributions of natural sources pc1 to cr ni and cu were 20 34 and 35 respectively higher values of pc1 exhibited in the northern deep loess layer fig 9 a the geogenic process pc2 contributed the most to fe 67 as 47 and pb 86 and the sampling points with the highest pc2 were located in the arid northwest with saline soil fig 9b the industrial activities pc3 were the main source of pollution representing mn 56 and cd 33 and the sampling points with higher pc3 were in the lower plains with more industrial areas fig 9c in the dry season the contributions of mixed sources natural processes and anthropogenic input pc1 were 82 for mn 86 for fe 51 for ni 77 for cu 73 for zn 32 for as and 82 for cd and the values increased from southwest to northeast fig 9d agricultural activities pc2 mainly contributed to cr 74 sr 71 and pb 29 distributed in the southern agricultural regions fig 9e in addition the contributions of unexplained variables to trace elements ranged 2 50 in the flood season and 5 52 in the dry season with an average of 28 and 22 respectively accordingly the mean contribution of pollution sources showed significant differences over two seasons in the flood season the contributions of pollution sources were in the order of natural source 35 geogenic process 17 industrial source 13 while they were mixed sources 47 agricultural activities 18 in the dry season therefore trace elements in groundwater of the loess plateau originated from both natural and human sources 3 6 implications the arid regions such as the loess plateau under investigation are more vulnerable to the threat of degraded water quality in this study cr and as were the dominant heavy metals contributing to human health risks in groundwater on the loess plateau with significant spatial and seasonal variability therefore it is important to develop monitoring programs for arsenic and chromium in groundwater as chronic exposure to geological contamination of groundwater has been observed in the northwest of the loess plateau the combined use of different water sources such as rainwater should be considered for the safety of the drinking water supply li and wu 2019 in particular the pollution sources from industry and agriculture should be treated for the southeast of the loess plateau with dense population and agricultural activities the pca apcs mlr are commonly employed as traceability tools in groundwater quality studies with the ability to identify multiple factors but these factors need to be further defined and specified the geographical detector can identify drivers and support spatial recommendations to reduce the likelihood that factors cannot be judged zhang et al 2022c which has been previously applied to the traceability of heavy metals in soil yang et al 2020 zeng et al 2022 in this study the framework had a good suitability in groundwater but the choice of geographic factors and the spatial data discretization strategy can affect the interpretation of the results zhang et al 2022c the validity and reliability of discrete continuous numerical variables remain challenging 4 conclusions in this study a framework combining the health risk assessment model geographical detector pca and apcs mlr was proposed to explore the spatial and seasonal distribution potential health hazards controlling factors and sources of trace elements in groundwater on china s loess plateau significant spatial and seasonal variations of trace elements in groundwater were observed in both seasons health risk assessment suggested that cr and as were major contributors to the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks for both age clusters land use was the major factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of cr in the flood season while elevation and distance from city played a significant role in the dry season ndvi and distance from city were responsible for the spatial distribution of as in the flood season and ndvi was the main contributor in the dry season the effects of interacted explanatory indicators exceeded those of any individual factors the average contributions of potential pollution sources estimated by pca and apcs mlr models were ranked as natural source 35 geogenic process 17 industrial source 13 in the flood season while they were mixed sources 47 agricultural activities 18 in the dry season our study provided

1721,accurately identifying the sources of trace elements in groundwater is difficult especially in the areas with intensive human activities this study proposes a framework to identify and quantify the contributions of potential sources of trace elements in groundwater health risk assessment is first conducted to identify the trace elements with the highest threats to groundwater quality and then the geographical detector is used to qualitatively investigate the potential sources and processes dominating the pollution from identified trace elements and the absolute principal component scores multivariate linear regression apcs mlr is used to quantify the contributions of different sources to the accumulation of trace elements the proposed approach was applied to china s loess plateau a typical water limited area with rapid urbanization and intensive agricultural activities after conducting two groundwater sampling campaigns in a flood and a dry season the trace element concentrations in groundwater exhibited significant spatial and seasonal differences health risk assessment revealed that cr and as through oral ingestion were responsible for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in different seasons land use was the primary factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of cr in the flood season while elevation and distance from city were dominant factors in the dry season normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and distance from city contributed the most to as change in the flood season but ndvi was the major contributor in the dry season the average contributions of potential pollution sources to trace elements in groundwater were in the order of natural source 35 geogenic process 17 industrial source 13 in the flood season but mixed sources 47 agricultural activities 18 in the dry season distinguished from the traditional source apportionment methods the newly proposed approach is not limited to identification of pollutant sources but also can obtain the exact contributions of different sources the findings provide useful information for groundwater management in the loess plateau keywords health risk assessment driving factors source apportionment pca apcs mlr geographical detector data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a significant component of water resources groundwater plays an important role in agricultural irrigation industrial development and domestic drinking especially in the arid areas with scarce rainfall and surface water adimalla and qian 2020 more than half of the world s population uses groundwater for drinking purpose and the population will increase in near future due to global environmental change and rapid population growth jasechko and perrone 2021 oki and kanae 2006 however the declining quality of groundwater has reduced the availability of water resources and posed a great threat to human health alarcón herrera et al 2013 although some trace elements are essential for maintaining the normal operation of human functions their enrichment in groundwater will have adverse effects jabbo et al 2022 tong et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 for instance long term consumption of high as groundwater can cause cardiovascular hematological respiratory neurological and renal diseases mink et al 2008 excessive cr in drinking water is prone to skin respiratory and digestive diseases jobby et al 2018 pb polluted groundwater can harm the kidney and nervous system xiao et al 2019 thus in order to reduce environmental risks and ensure human health attention should be paid to trace elements in groundwater a considerable number of natural e g elevation precipitation slope soil type and distance from rivers and anthropogenic factors e g land use emission sources distance from city and distance from mine can influence the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of trace elements in groundwater bing et al 2019 higgins et al 2022 mukherjee et al 2018 in many cases the changes in trace element concentrations are affected by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors zhang et al 2016 moreover these factors can interact with each other greatly complicating the driving mechanism of the spatiotemporal patterns of trace elements in groundwater xiao et al 2022 previous studies have qualitatively explored the effects of driving factors chi et al 2018 based on multivariate analysis methods including cluster analysis principal component analysis and correlation analysis bastami et al 2015 chai et al 2021 chi et al 2018 wu et al 2017 nevertheless few studies have quantitatively explored the interactions of driving factors on the spatiotemporal distribution of trace elements in groundwater which resulted in a poor understanding of the driving mechanism of trace element concentrations to overcome these limitations the geographical detector will be employed in this study to test the spatial consistency between trace element concentrations and driving factors wang et al 2016 compared with the traditional statistical methods the outstanding advantage of the geographical detector is the ability to calculate the contribution of individual driving factor and the interaction among different driving factors quantifying the sources of pollutants is an imperative step in groundwater quality protection and management the sources of trace elements in groundwater are generally diverse including natural origin e g parent rocks weathering mineral dissolution adsorption desorption mukherjee et al 2018 su et al 2019 and anthropogenic origin e g agricultural activities industry discharges domestic sewage bing et al 2019 higgins et al 2022 qiao et al 2019 the source apportionment of pollutants in groundwater has been previously carried out through the investigation of potential pollution sources and comparison of test indicators with groundwater quality standards however it is difficult to effectively interpret and extract useful information from pollution sources for traditional methods because of the complexity of measurement and survey datasets wallace et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 because groundwater quality can be considered as a function of natural and human sources jin et al 2019 the receptor models show outstanding advantages in terms of source allocation through determining the physicochemical characteristics of groundwater samples and potential pollution sources chai et al 2021 zanotti et al 2019 some source apportionment models such as positive matrix factorization pmf and principal component analysis pca can quantify the contribution of potential sources of pollutants however the above quantitative source allocation methods are based on the concentration relationship of the trace elements involved in the calculation and can only roughly calculate the number of sources for trace element accumulation in groundwater in other words these mathematical methods ignore the spatial characteristics of pollution sources and external environmental influences which may result in inaccurate definition of pollution sources therefore the absolute principal component scores multivariate linear regression apcs mlr will be employed in this study to quantify the contribution of potential pollution sources identified by pca the loess plateau in china has the most typical and widely distributed loess in the world accounting for 6 6 of land area and supporting 8 5 of population of china groundwater in this area constitutes the main source of water supply for agricultural production industrial development ecological security and domestic purposes li et al 2022 rapid urbanization industrialization and intensive agricultural activities have significantly caused the degradation of groundwater quality liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 recently trace element pollution has been observed in groundwater on the loess plateau xiao et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 yan et al 2022 however until now systematic studies on the characteristics controlling factors and sources of trace elements in groundwater are still scarce on the loess plateau in order to more accurately identify and quantify the sources of trace elements in groundwater this study will propose a framework by combining health risk assessment model geographic detector and pca apcs mlr specifically taking china s loess plateau as an example this study will i describe the spatial and seasonal pattern of trace elements in groundwater ii identify the sources of trace elements and iii partition the contribution of different trace element sources to groundwater pollution the potential novelty of this study is that the proposed framework will technically support similar studies and the findings can be referred for groundwater quality management in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau 33 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e is located in northwest china and covers an area of 6 4 105 km2 fig 1 a including the provinces of inner mongolia ningxia shaanxi shanxi and gansu li et al 2022 the area is under the influence of the continental monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation of 154 3 947 1 mm and 50 of the precipitation occurs from july to september jin et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a the annual average potential evapotranspiration varies from 865 1 to 1274 0 mm significantly exceeding the annual average precipitation li et al 2017 the landforms are mainly classified into three categories mountains loess hilly and gully areas and alluvial basins li and qian 2018 the main land use is grassland 41 7 followed by cultivated land 32 3 and forestland 15 1 fig 1b the cultivated land is mostly located in the guanzhong basin hetao plain ningxia plain and along the fen river the extensive utilization of fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural activities is deteriorating groundwater quality moreover groundwater pollution attributed to industrial and mining activities e g coal extraction has also been reported in the loess plateau hua et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 according to the hydrogeological characteristics the groundwater in the study area is classified into quaternary loose sediment pore water and bedrock fissure water with a thickness of 10 50 m and a shallow burial depth of 2 8 m the quaternary pore water aquifer is mainly recharged by precipitation the bedrock fissure aquifer mainly distributed in the loess hilly and gully area are regarded as an excellent source of water for residents due to its large storage capacity and low salinity su et al 2017 the general direction of groundwater flow roughly matches the topographic trend i e a west to east direction fig 1c 2 2 groundwater sampling and measurement to eliminate the effects of river recharge we collected groundwater in high altitude areas with a water table at least 10 m deep the groundwater in these areas is the only water source for drinking irrigation and production for residents thus highlighting the influence of anthropogenic activities considering the seasonal effects two groundwater sampling campaigns have been carried out during a flood season august 2018 37 samples and a dry season april 2019 27 samples fig 1a considering the adverse effects of water accumulation in the well we pumped water for 30 min before collecting the formal samples all groundwater samples were filtered in situ via a 0 45 μm nylon filter whatman to remove insoluble particulate matter from groundwater samples for trace elements analysis were stocked in clean polyethylene bottles with acidification to ph 2 samples for anion measurement were stocked in clean polyethylene bottles without acidification after sampling all samples were stocked in a portable refrigerator at 4 c in the field information on the location of sampling sites including latitude longitude and elevation was stored in the gps navigator the total dissolved solids tds and ph of groundwater were measured by a multi parameter portable measuring instrument hanna hi98129 the main anions cl so4 2 and no3 were determined with ion chromatography ics 1100 usa with a detection limit of 1 mg l the concentration of trace elements cr mn fe ni cu zn as sr cd and pb was determined with a full spectrum plasma generating spectrometer icap 6300 usa with a detection limit of 1 μg l the flowchart of data analysis was presented in fig 2 since the data failed to meet the assumption of normal distribution the kruskal wallis nonparametric test was used to compare water quality parameters in dry and flood seasons the spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters was obtained with inverse distance weighted idw interpolation fig 3 2 3 health risk assessment humans can be exposed to pollutants in groundwater via a variety of pathways of all exposure pathways dermal absorption and oral ingestion are the primary pathways of contaminants the health risk assessment proposed by the usepa 2004 has been extensively applied to quantitatively evaluate the potential hazards of groundwater contaminants varol and tokatlı 2022 in this study we focused on the non carcinogenic hazard index hi and carcinogenic risk cr of trace elements in groundwater by different age groups adults and children based on behavioral and physiological differences the hi and cr of all elements in groundwater via each exposure pathway were summed to calculate the total cancer risk tcr and total hazard index hitotal the consensus based subsidiary parameters and mathematical expressions are shown in the supplementary material text 1 in the deterministic approach the parameters in the health risk assessment are represented by most likely or average values usepa 1997 this approach is simple and easy to understand but an oversight of the differences among members of the same population leads to uncertainties kaur et al 2020 therefore a more realistic technique is required to overcome the problem in this study the probabilistic method known as monte carlo simulation technique was used for this purpose the monte carlo simulation analysis was performed for 10 000 iterations for selected values of each variable based on random distribution functions the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to adults and children from trace elements in groundwater via oral ingestion and dermal absorption routes were assessed moreover sensitivity analysis based on spearman rank correlation was employed to identify the variables mostly affecting non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks the monte carlo simulation analysis was implemented using oracle crystal ball software version 11 1 2 4 source apportionment geographical detector was employed to evaluate the dominance and interaction of multiple environmental factors on the spatial and seasonal differences of high risk trace elements in groundwater further the correlation analysis ca pca and apcs mlr were applied to estimate the source contribution of heavy metals in groundwater 2 4 1 geographical detector the geographical detector is a statistical method for detecting spatial heterogeneity and revealing the explanatory power of driving factors wang and xu 2017 this approach was applied to explore whether the spatiotemporal distribution of the independent variable x environmental factors and the dependent variable y trace elements tend to be consistent in this study the factor detector and interaction detector were employed to explore the explanatory power of eight factors on the concentration of high risk trace elements and the strength of their interactions the geographical detector was implemented using the gd package in the r software and the results of parameter optimization were shown in table s3 s7 more thorough description of the software can be found in wang et al 2010 and wang and xu 2017 and the related equations and methods applied to this study were presented in the supplementary material text 2 2 4 2 principal component analysis pca is effective to reduce the dimensionality of original hydrochemical data and transform the interrelated hydrochemical variables into uncorrelated principal components pcs vega et al 1998 in this study pca was use to reveal the origin of trace elements in groundwater and their influencing factors the kmo kaiser meyer olkin and bartlett s sphericity test were applied to evaluate the suitability of hydrochemical data for pca kaiser 1974 shrestha and kazama 2007 in this study the bartlett s sphericity test values were 0 in the flood and dry seasons while the kmo values were 0 39 and 0 7 in the corresponding seasons respectively it suggested that the data in the flood season were unsuitable for pca and redesigning the variable structure should be considered therefore eight trace elements except for sr and zn were selected for pca in the flood season because their kmo value was 0 51 the dispersion of trace elements in groundwater was identified by pca through calculating the variance the representative pcs were extracted on the basis of eigenvalues greater than unity helena et al 2000 the varimax rotation was used to facilitate interpretation of the underlying factors affecting trace elements in groundwater factor loadings 0 75 0 50 0 75 and 0 30 0 50 were considered to be strong moderate and weak loadings respectively haji gholizadeh et al 2016 2 4 3 absolute principal component scores multivariate linear regression the apcs mlr receptor model described by thurston and spengler 1985 was performed for quantitative source assignment based on absolute principal component scores apcs in pca and multiple linear regression mlr zhang et al 2020a the detailed calculation of the apcs mlr was presented in the supplementary material of text 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics table 1 listed the statistics of the hydrochemical parameters of groundwater in different seasons the groundwater was weakly alkaline with ph ranging 6 7 8 6 average 7 6 and 7 2 8 1 average 7 6 in the flood and dry seasons respectively tds ranged from 247 to 1410 mg l average 449 9 mg l in the flood season and 220 to 1015 mg l average 400 4 mg l in the dry season according to the average concentration trace elements can be classified into three categories xiao et al 2019 the average concentrations of zn and sr were 100 μg l which were high abundance elements the average concentrations of cr mn fe ni cu and as ranged 1 100 μg l belonging to medium abundance elements the cd and pb were low abundance elements with concentrations 1 μg l the comparison of trace element contents in groundwater of the loess plateau with other regions was presented in table 2 the contents of cr ni and cu was much higher than the average level in china and even higher than those in most regions of the world tong et al 2021 the content of cr and ni in this study was only lower than the pampean plain argentina and the northeast nigeria respectively jabbo et al 2022 the contents of fe mn cd and pb were relatively low compared to the listed areas in general the pollution level of most trace elements in groundwater on the loess plateau was moderate while that of cr was prominent blanes et al 2011 nadiri et al 2018 the average concentrations of all the selected elements were within the permissible limits of the drinking water guidelines by who 2011 usepa 2021 and chinese standards css 2017 except that of zn in the flood season and ni in the dry season 3 2 spatial and seasonal variations in trace elements fig 3 showed the spatial and seasonal patterns of trace elements in groundwater on the loess plateau spatially the groundwater samples with high cd cr mn and sr concentrations were mainly observed in the eastern and southern plains with heavy rainfall low elevation and dense population while high pb as cu ni fe and zn concentrations were mainly found in the western and eastern hilly areas seasonally the percentage differences between two seasons were positive for most trace elements suggesting that higher concentrations existed in the flood season moreover the kruskal wallis nonparametric test suggested that differences in concentrations of as cr cu fe and pb were significant p 0 05 in both seasons which was consistent with the higher percentage difference of these elements 3 3 assessed health risk fig s1 showed the results of the non carcinogenic health risk assessment of trace elements via direct ingestion and dermal absorption pathways as and cr were the major contributors to non carcinogenic risks via oral ingestion and dermal absorption in both seasons the mean values of hqingestion hqdermal and hi for all trace elements in different seasons were smaller than the acceptable limit indicating negligible non carcinogenic risks from individual elements however the hitotal calculated by adding hi of all elements was 1 06 for children in the flood season suggesting the potential non carcinogenic risks of multiple elements in groundwater the hi values of each trace element for both adults and children were in the order of as cr ni other elements fig s1 the average hi values of all trace elements were within the acceptable level in both seasons however the maximum hi values were 1 38 for adults and 1 44 for children in the flood season for as while the values were 1 16 and 1 91 for children in the flood and dry seasons for cr respectively this suggested that some groundwater samples may pose non carcinogenic risks to local residents in the flood season high non carcinogenic risk areas were mainly observed in the western area with area proportions of 6 and 33 for adults and children respectively fig 4 in the dry season the proportion of high non carcinogenic risk areas decreased to 0 4 for adults and 2 for children fig 4 overall children were more vulnerable to non carcinogenic risks than adults moreover the non carcinogenic risks of trace elements in the flood season were higher than the dry season table s8 showed the statistics of cr and tcr for adults and children in the flood and dry seasons the oral ingestion was the dominant pathway of carcinogenic risk to humans the average tcr values for adults were higher than those for children in both seasons which implied that adults were more vulnerable to carcinogenic risk than children moreover 95 of average tcr in the flood season and 75 in the dry season were attributed to as suggesting that as was a major contributor to cancer risk for adults approximately 86 of samples had tcr values exceeding the acceptable limit of 10 4 manifesting high carcinogenic risk fig 5 a in case of children all tcr values were within or below the medium risk range of 1 10 5 to 1 10 4 fig 5b the maximum tcr values of pb were 8 57 10 8 for adults and 7 96 10 9 for children in both seasons indicating that the carcinogenic risk of pb was within the acceptable risk level for as and cr larger tcr values maximum tcras 6 19 10 4 tcrcr 1 16 10 4 were observed indicating that as and cr had a greater carcinogenic risk therefore as and cr in groundwater were screened as high risk elements fig 6 showed the spatial distribution of tcr of as cr and pb for adults and children in the flood and dry seasons for adults and children the highest tcr was found in the northwest in the flood season but in the northwest and southeast in the dry season the proportions of high tcr areas were higher in the flood season moreover adults faced a higher carcinogenic risk than children which is due to differences in physiological parameters between age groups the high variability of population related parameters in terms of health risk characteristics may result in uncertainties zuzolo et al 2020 the monte carlo simulation was employed to evaluate the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks for adults and children text 4 and the results showed that the deterministic approach slightly overestimated health risks in addition the complex chemical composition of groundwater has synergistic and antagonistic effects in maintaining human health e g zn may reduce the toxicity of arsenic peng et al 2022 these factors would affect the evaluation results 3 4 identified factors influencing cr and as as cr and as were identified as high risk elements y they were used as main indicators to explore the controlling factors of trace elements the geographical detector was employed to evaluate the effects and interactions of nine variables i e x1 land use x2 elevation x3 precipitation x4 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi x5 slope x6 distance from city x7 distance from river and x8 distance from mine on the spatial and seasonal differentiation of cr and as concentrations the results were presented in fig 7 where the values in bold represented the explanatory power q value of a single factor and other values denoted the effects of a pair of factors x1 exhibited stronger explanatory power for the spatial variation of cr concentration during the flood season with a q value of 0 20 p 0 05 suggesting that anthropogenic factors i e land use may dominate the spatial heterogeneity of cr concentrations in the dry season x2 q 0 61 and x6 q 0 62 were the dominant factors indicating that natural i e elevation and anthropogenic factors i e distance from city jointly affected the spatial distribution of cr concentrations for as x4 q 0 70 p 0 05 and x6 q 0 91 p 0 05 in the flood season while x4 q 0 75 p 0 05 in the dry season were the major drivers implying that natural i e ndvi and anthropogenic factors i e distance from city greatly affected the spatial differentiation of as concentration in the flood season while ndvi with the highest explanatory power in the dry season in areas with high vegetation coverage the as concentration in groundwater was lower fig s6d and fig s7d which was inseparable from the enrichment of contaminants e g as by vegetation in the water soil system wang and zhao 2009 the interactions between x1 and other explanatory variables exhibited linearly enhanced effects on cr in the flood season in the dry season although x6 was not significant its interaction with x3 and x8 exhibited a significantly enhanced effect in the flood season x6 only exhibited linearly enhanced interactions with x3 p 0 99 and x5 p 0 96 on as while showed a unidirectional weakening effect with other explanatory variables this implied that the interaction between natural factors i e precipitation slope and anthropogenic factors i e distance from city had an important influence on as distribution fig s6e showed that the comprehensive pollution index of groundwater in the gentle slope area was significantly higher than that in the steep slope area indicating that the pollutants migrated along the slope to enrich into groundwater jia et al 2017 murray et al 2019 in the dry season the significant linearly enhanced effects were observed between x4 x5 and x4 x7 suggesting that the interactions between different natural factors i e ndvi slope and ndvi distance from river had significant effects on the spatial pattern of as 3 5 source of trace elements three pcs with eigenvalues 1 were extracted in the flood season table 3 which explained 35 17 and 13 of the total variance respectively pc1 exhibited strong positive loadings with ni 0 91 and cu 0 88 and moderate negative loadings with cr 0 57 these elements mainly originated from natural processes chromium in the form of silicates bound and strongly adsorbed in aquifers constituted the main source of cr in groundwater yan et al 2022 as a siderophile element ni is mainly derived from the weathering of parent material chai et al 2021 cu was considered to be of natural origin owing to the significant correlation between cu and ni in groundwater fig 8 a jin et al 2019 shi et al 2022 pc2 showed significant positive loadings with pb 0 71 as 0 69 and fe 0 61 these elements are mainly of geological origin chlorite as a common fe bearing clay mineral in loess can provide an abundant source of fe in groundwater ye et al 2020 as is mainly related to leaching and weathering of loess moreover the alkaline conditions and high na ca ratios in the study area are conducive to the desorption of adsorbed as in loess resulting in the enrichment of as in groundwater zhang et al 2022b the natural origin of pb can be confirmed by the good correlation between pb and fe fig 8a zhang et al 2020b pc3 exhibited significant positive loadings with mn 0 78 and cd 0 64 these elements were considered to be of industrial sources e g industry effluents xiao et al 2021 in the dry season two pcs with eigenvalues 1 were extracted pc1 explaining 47 of the variance showed strong loadings with fe 0 91 zn 0 88 mn 0 87 ni 0 86 cd 0 82 and cu 0 80 natural and anthropogenic inputs should be responsible for these elements the loess and parent material weathering are the major contributors of fe cu and ni in groundwater vehicular discharge and municipal emission constitute a significant source of zn in groundwater xiao et al 2019 mn and cd were mainly from metal industry pc2 accounted for 18 of the variance and was mainly associated with cr 0 86 sr 0 84 pb 0 40 and as 0 37 the good correlations between cr and no3 indicated agricultural source of cr in groundwater fig 8b the agricultural origin of sr and as can be confirmed by their good correlation with cr fig 8b the contributions of sources identified by pca to individual trace element were estimated by the apcs mlr table 4 the r2 values for most water quality parameters from apcs mlr model were 0 5 and the ratio of the mean measured and predicted values of all variables was close to 1 indicating that the results of the apcs mlr model were robust for source apportionment tokatlı et al 2023 varol et al 2022 in the flood season the contributions of natural sources pc1 to cr ni and cu were 20 34 and 35 respectively higher values of pc1 exhibited in the northern deep loess layer fig 9 a the geogenic process pc2 contributed the most to fe 67 as 47 and pb 86 and the sampling points with the highest pc2 were located in the arid northwest with saline soil fig 9b the industrial activities pc3 were the main source of pollution representing mn 56 and cd 33 and the sampling points with higher pc3 were in the lower plains with more industrial areas fig 9c in the dry season the contributions of mixed sources natural processes and anthropogenic input pc1 were 82 for mn 86 for fe 51 for ni 77 for cu 73 for zn 32 for as and 82 for cd and the values increased from southwest to northeast fig 9d agricultural activities pc2 mainly contributed to cr 74 sr 71 and pb 29 distributed in the southern agricultural regions fig 9e in addition the contributions of unexplained variables to trace elements ranged 2 50 in the flood season and 5 52 in the dry season with an average of 28 and 22 respectively accordingly the mean contribution of pollution sources showed significant differences over two seasons in the flood season the contributions of pollution sources were in the order of natural source 35 geogenic process 17 industrial source 13 while they were mixed sources 47 agricultural activities 18 in the dry season therefore trace elements in groundwater of the loess plateau originated from both natural and human sources 3 6 implications the arid regions such as the loess plateau under investigation are more vulnerable to the threat of degraded water quality in this study cr and as were the dominant heavy metals contributing to human health risks in groundwater on the loess plateau with significant spatial and seasonal variability therefore it is important to develop monitoring programs for arsenic and chromium in groundwater as chronic exposure to geological contamination of groundwater has been observed in the northwest of the loess plateau the combined use of different water sources such as rainwater should be considered for the safety of the drinking water supply li and wu 2019 in particular the pollution sources from industry and agriculture should be treated for the southeast of the loess plateau with dense population and agricultural activities the pca apcs mlr are commonly employed as traceability tools in groundwater quality studies with the ability to identify multiple factors but these factors need to be further defined and specified the geographical detector can identify drivers and support spatial recommendations to reduce the likelihood that factors cannot be judged zhang et al 2022c which has been previously applied to the traceability of heavy metals in soil yang et al 2020 zeng et al 2022 in this study the framework had a good suitability in groundwater but the choice of geographic factors and the spatial data discretization strategy can affect the interpretation of the results zhang et al 2022c the validity and reliability of discrete continuous numerical variables remain challenging 4 conclusions in this study a framework combining the health risk assessment model geographical detector pca and apcs mlr was proposed to explore the spatial and seasonal distribution potential health hazards controlling factors and sources of trace elements in groundwater on china s loess plateau significant spatial and seasonal variations of trace elements in groundwater were observed in both seasons health risk assessment suggested that cr and as were major contributors to the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks for both age clusters land use was the major factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of cr in the flood season while elevation and distance from city played a significant role in the dry season ndvi and distance from city were responsible for the spatial distribution of as in the flood season and ndvi was the main contributor in the dry season the effects of interacted explanatory indicators exceeded those of any individual factors the average contributions of potential pollution sources estimated by pca and apcs mlr models were ranked as natural source 35 geogenic process 17 industrial source 13 in the flood season while they were mixed sources 47 agricultural activities 18 in the dry season our study provided

1722,estuarine salinity is one of the key factors affecting coastal ecosystems however due to impenetrable situation of mixing streamflow from river basins and seawater currents our capability of evaluating salinity variation is far behind requirement in preventing coastal environment thus this paper presents an integrated study on salinity variation in the pearl river estuary pre in south china in the rainy season since the estuary would experience more salinity variation at the time the pre has a complicated water body with eight river outlets four ones in the east and the others in the west the paper develops a new research framework to evaluate the impacts of streamflow on the salinity variation including adjusting diversion ratios of freshwater discharges to the estuary and using two numerical models for simulating basin hydrologic processes and estuary salinity variations with the salinity observation from a field cruise in the pre in july 2017 and the newly developed framework this study validates the numerical simulation results detects the salinity variation under different scenarios of freshwater discharge and discloses the environmental factors related to salinity variation specifically the study shows the distinct characteristics of salinity variation in association with freshwater discharge and environmental factors including seawater current velocity and topography in the east a funnel shaped bay consists of four narrow deep channels and west a sub estuary of the modaomen waterway part of the estuary the results indicate that salinity in the east part is more sensitive to streamflow variation with a farther freshwater saltwater divide about 25 km away from the outlets than that in the west part 14 km the estuary area affected by salinity variation due to different streamflow diversion ratios is more significant in the east 1 266 km2 which is 7 6 times larger than that in the west 166 km2 however the values of salinity change due to different discharges are greater in the west more than 2 0 psu in 34 of the affected area than those in the east all less than 2 0 psu moreover the study shows that the seawater salinity variation in the east is greatly influenced by the distance to the outlet freshwater discharge and seawater depth while in the west the salinity variation is largely determined by seawater current velocity keywords estuary salinity freshwater discharge multiple river outlets swat efdc rainy season data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuary salinity is one of the most important environmental factors for coastal waters and the combined response to terrestrial hydrologic processes and coastal features chevalier et al 2014 khan et al 2020 telesh and khlebovich 2010 the temporal and spatial salinity variations can influence coastal water stratification density and suspended sediments zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b and also biological habitats through structuring microbial communities in an estuary li et al 2019 rojas jimenez et al 2019 telesh and khlebovich 2010 zhang et al 2021a moreover salinity sensitive species in coastal areas would not even survive under sudden salinity change ayache et al 2019 chen et al 2019a as a critical ecological driver salinity variation depends on both estuarine and marine inputs di iorio and castelao 2013 fichez et al 2017 xu et al 2018 various hydrodynamic models have been developed for different estuaries to study the salinity responses to multiple influencing factors jackson et al 2021 vargas et al 2017 xu et al 2018 however few studies focused on the impacts from both the terrestrial and estuarine processes especially for multi outlet estuaries with complex upstream river networks which have internal interactive influences on estuarine salinity from upstream river branches moreover due to rapid population growth and urbanization in the past several decades sun et al 2020 anthropogenic activities are intensive specifically in coastal regions therefore with dense river networks and intensive human activities from upstream river basins it is necessary to conduct a systematic study on salinity variations in complex estuaries with multiple outlets the pearl river estuary pre is near to the pearl river delta prd with eight river outlets and the pre can be further separated into the east and west parts some previous studies explored salinity variation of lingdingyang which is located in the east part niu et al 2020 xu et al 2022 you 2012 or modaomen which is the primary outlet in the west part gong et al 2022 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 however the freshwater discharge from the pearl river pr through the eight outlets is closely related to the anthropogenic activities in the prd and then the salinity variation in the west and east parts should therefore show some relationship thus it is valuable to evaluate how the salinity variation is affected by anthropogenic activities in the pr basin prb and how different the salinity variations are in both parts under the influence of freshwater discharge change lu et al 2018 however up to date a systematic exploration of salinity variation in the pre through consideration of anthropogenic influences on discharge has not been available yet moreover since there is more freshwater discharging into the pre during the rainy season and the salinity observations at some locations in the pre in july 2017 are available the study focuses on detecting the features of salinity variations in july for both the west and east parts of the region the paper is structed as follows section 2 presents the study area and section 3 introduces the data and analysis method terrestrial and estuarine models as well as their combination section 4 shows the study results including the influences of freshwater discharge on salinity variation the affected area under different scenarios due to anthropogenic activities and the influences from freshwater discharge water depth distance to the outlet and current velocity finally section 5 summarizes the findings 2 study area the pr is the second largest river in terms of streamflow volume in china with a length of 2 214 km and a drainage area of 453 690 km2 niu et al 2017 zhao 1990 and the prb consists of 4 river systems the west river north river east river and prd niu and chen 2016 fig 1 a the pre is the linkage and transition zone where the freshwater from the prb and saltwater from the south china sea scs converge the pre receives the freshwater from the eight river discharge outlets in the prd including humen jiaomen hongqimen hengmen modaomen jitimen hutiaomen and yamen with two major longitudinal channels which are humen in the east and modaomen in the west fig 1 b since the geographic locations of the east outlets namely humen jiaomen hongqimen and hengmen and the west outlets namely modaomen jitimen hutiaomen and yamen are relatively separated this study pays more attention to the independent investigation of salinity variations in the east and west parts of the pre the complex distribution of the river networks in the prd fig 1 b and the intensive human activities in the prb make it even harder to rationally evaluate the discharge of each outlet to the pre during the past several decades the prd has experienced rapid economic growth and urban development chen et al 2011 sun et al 2020 and various anthropogenic activities including channel dredging sand excavation and adjusting the connection of river channels have been implemented which therefore have altered the geometries of the river networks in the delta consequently the river discharges from west and east outlets into the pre have been significantly changed wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 which would lead to considerable salinity variation in part of the estuary 3 methodology 3 1 a hydrologic model swat for prb this study adopted a hydrologic model swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 to simulate the discharges from the prb originally developed by arnold 1994 for agricultural research service ars of the united sates department of agriculture usda swat is a physically based comprehensive and semi distributed model requiring specific input parameters of weather topography soil properties land use and management of a river basin swat has been widely applied for several decades as one of the most popular basin scale models abbaspour et al 2015 rahaman et al 2019 schuol et al 2008 moreover swat was successfully applied calibrated and validated for the terrestrial processes over the prb tributaries the east river basin chen and wu 2012 wu et al 2019 wu and chen 2012a wu and chen 2013a wu and chen 2013b wu et al 2013 the north river basin chen et al 2021 and the west river basin touseef et al 2020 the input datasets of swat include dem digital elevation model data from srtm shuttle radar topography mission with a resolution of 90 m the land use data from the chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 1 km and soil data from both fao food and agriculture organization and hwsd harmonized world soil database with a resolution of 1 km the meteorological data are obtained from the cmads the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model meng et al 2019 for the period from 2007 to 2018 the swat model was used at a daily time step from 2007 to 2018 with a 1 year warm up period as shown in fig 1 c the prb is delineated into 350 subbasins with an average area of 1 222 km2 and 5902 hydrologic response units hrus with an average area of 72 km2 based on the unique combination of land use and soil type there are 8 outlets of the prd however due to the relatively small elevation difference and complex river network in the prd only four of the river outlets are delineated using dem data fig 1 c 3 2 a hydrodynamic model efdc for pre to evaluate the salinity in the pre the study adopted the efdc environmental and fluid dynamics code to simulate seawater conditions including current velocity and salinity the efdc was initially developed at the virginia institute of marine science in the united states for estuarine and coastal applications hamrick 1992 the model has been extensively tested and documented with various applications in simulating hydrodynamics salinity temperature sediment transport oxygen and nutrient processes and the transport of toxic contaminants in water and sediment phases chen et al 2016b hong and shen 2013 li et al 2011 liu et al 2008 the efdc were successfully applied to study salinity intrusion in the west outlets of the pre in the dry season gong and shen 2011 liu et al 2019 fig 1 d shows the simulation domain of the pre for running efdc including the entire pre and adjacent scs and the study explored the salinity variation near different outlets bathymetry and coastline data of the pre were obtained from the maritime safety administration of the people s republic of china a curvilinear orthogonal coordinate was set up in the horizontal dimension and a sigma coordinate was set up in the vertical direction with 10 equal layers the domain area is 9 060 km2 with 22 992 grids and the average gird area is 0 39 km2 wind boundaries were set up for two directions at daily time step with the observations obtained from hong kong observatory tidal data were obtained from four tidal stations near the pre namely sanzao dawanshan wailingding and kuichong and interpolated for the tidal boundary in the adjacent domain further based on the cruise observations the salinity at the river flow boundaries and the open sea boundary were set to be 0 10 psu and 35 psu notably the daily freshwater discharge from the prb was downscaled for fitting to the simulation time step and vertical layers the efdc model used cold start for initial condition with a constant salinity of 30 psu for the entire domain and time step of 5 s 1 year warm up period was selected to reach a dynamic quasi steady state several salinity measuring sites see fig 1 d for the locations during an interdisciplinary field survey cruise were selected and fig 1 e shows the water depths and the distances of those sites to the related main river outlets notably the survey cruise was conducted in july 2017 by the research team of ocean hk ocean circulation ecosystem and hypoxia around hong kong waters project chen et al 2019b shi et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 the project is funded by a theme based research scheme of the research grants council rgc in hksar to explore the physical biogeochemical sediment and pollutant dynamics and their variability in the pre and hong kong waters this paper used the observed salinity data to validate the efdc simulation results 3 3 linkage of prb and pre for evaluating diversion ratios of river discharge estuary waters are strongly affected by river discharges especially during rainy seasons with larger discharges nevertheless it is challenging to monitor the river discharges at an estuary due to the mixture of seawater intrusion to the river delta moreover the simulation of river basin discharge to an estuary is rather difficult due to the complicated river network in the delta with multi outlets therefore on the one hand this is a research gap in the world to rationally estimate the river discharges from different outlets into an estuary on the other hand it is of great importance to have rational freshwater discharges from outlets to an estuary for evaluating the influence of river basins on the salinity variation and estuary ecosystem previous studies liu and gan 2020 liu et al 2018 perera et al 2009 yang and chui 2016 for coastal models usually used the flowrates at upstream control stations normally 40 130 km far from the outlets normally without the tide influence on those flowrates as a reference to set up flow boundary and the linkage of hydrologic models at the river delta often lacked in this study the prd is located at a plain terrain with a small elevation variation and the intensive anthropogenic activities sun et al 2020 including channel dredging and sand excavation are severe as a result it is difficult to generate an accurate river network and simulate rational river discharge from each outlet in the prd to the pre notably for a certain period which could be several years long the ratio of freshwater discharge from one outlet to the total freshwater discharge which is the sum of the river discharges from all the outlets to an estuary would not change severely wu 2013 such a ratio is called as a river diversion ratio and certainly the sum of the diversion ratios of all the outlets is 1 0 table 1 lists the historical diversion ratios of river discharge in the east and west outlets of the prd in the 1980 s and 2000 s wu 2013 from the table it can be observed that the discharge from modaomen is dominant in the west part to simplify the simulation the study takes modaomen outlet instead of total four outlets in the west part to analyze the discharge impacts on salinity variation and assigns the total diversion ratio of the west part to modaomen outlet to compare simulation results of different diversion ratios and explore anthropogenic activities the study adopted five scenarios see table 2 to adjust freshwater discharges as input data to efdc among them two scenarios e1 and e2 use the diversion ratios in the 2000 s and 1980 s see table 1 respectively therefore intuitively scenario e1 can be regarded as a proxy of current discharge ratio situation in the prd another scenario e3 uses the original results from swat which has freshwater discharge from four outlets fig 1 c to study the sensitivities of salinity in the west and east parts of the pre the remaining two scenarios e4 and e5 use 50 namely half and 200 double of the river discharge used in scenario e1 respectively fig 2 shows the framework of combining the hydrologic model and hydrodynamic model using river diversion ratio for exploring salinity variations 3 4 model evaluation the swat model was evaluated by the observed daily streamflow data obtained from the control stations gaoyao of the west river shijiao of the north river and boluo of the east river as shown in fig 1 a three widely used statistical parameters were selected to evaluate the performance of the model the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the percentage bias pbias which can be calculated using the following equations khadka et al 2021 niu and chen 2010 qiu and wan 2013 zhou et al 2020 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 pbias 1 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 where o i is the observed value p i is the simulated value o and p denote the mean of the observed and simulated values respectively n is the total number of sample data as mentioned above the field survey cruise was conducted in july 2017 for the theme based research scheme project to validate the model results from efdc this study obtained observations from 14 cruise sites fig 1 d table 3 lists the cruise information for those sites chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b liu and gan 2020 shi et al 2019 at each site the salinity of the vertical profile was measured with a conductivity temperature depth ctd profiler every 0 5 m from the water surface to the bottom sites a1 to a9 are located in the east part from the river outlet and sites f1 to f5 are located in the west part the efdc simulated salinity using the scenarios of e1 e2 and e3 at the measured time of the field survey table 3 were compared with the observed salinity data for surface average and bottom of the seawater columns at those 14 sites 3 5 salinity stratification estuarine water as a mixture of freshwater and seawater is strongly affected by river discharge from the upstream basin and ocean current from the sea freshwater discharge can greatly affect the vertical distribution of coastal salinity in a seawater column resulting in a phenomenon of salinity stratification the study explored the pattern of salinity stratification which is described as st a non dimensional coefficient to characterize the vertical salt distribution of a seawater column gong et al 2014 hansen and rattray jr 1966 and the equation of computing s t is given below 4 s t δ s s 0 s bot s sur s 0 where s bot s sur and s 0 are the bottom surface and average salinities of the water column respectively if s t is close to 0 the saline and fresh water are well mixed if s t is larger than 1 the seawater is characterized by highly saline stratification 3 6 multiple regression to evaluate the possible influencing factors of salinity near estuaries chen et al 2016a this study adopted the multiple regression method the five independent variables namely flow rate of freshwater discharge seawater depth the distance to the outlet and current velocity including the velocity components of zonal and meridional directions and dependent variable salinity of 31 days in july 2017 for 14 sites a1 to a9 f1 to f5 see fig 1 d obtained from efdc simulation were used for multiple regression analysis f test is adopted for analysis of variance anova to evaluate whether the independent variable is significantly predictive of the dependent variable in the proposed regression model chen et al 2016a tranmer and elliot 2008 the statistical significance p of the individual regression coefficient is examined by t test tranmer and elliot 2008 the relationship between five independent variables and salinity was then analyzed using the following multiple regression equation andrews 1974 baig et al 2021 tranmer and elliot 2008 5 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 5 x 5 the standardized regression coefficients beta coefficients β are estimated using equation 6 siegel 2016 to evaluate the importance of each independent variable of the dependent variable salinity s x i and s y are the standard deviations of x i and y respectively 6 β i b i s x i s y 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance the swat model was evaluated at three control stations during the calibration 2008 to 2011 and validation 2012 to 2015 periods due to the availability of monthly streamflow observations we conducted evaluation of the streamflow simulation for both periods at monthly scale and table 4 presents the statistical values of model performance normally nse with the value larger than 0 50 and pbias with the absolute value smaller than 25 is regarded as satisfactory simulation moriasi et al 2007 wu and chen 2012b the results of the control stations from three major subbasins presented in the table indicate that the swat model is reliable in simulating the streamflow of the prb with the different diversion ratios of three scenarios e1 e2 and e3 the simulated salinities at sites a1 to a9 and f1 to f5 are compared with the cruise observed salinities fig 3 the significance values p of three groups of data are less than 0 001 and this indicates that the relationship between simulation and observation is statistically significant fig 3 a c show the comparison of simulated and observed salinity during the measuring time given in table 3 the figure includes the statistical parameters of model performance at the surface average and bottom of the seawater column for three scenarios e1 e2 and e3 from the figure it can be observed that the simulation of e1 fig 3 a matches the cruise observations better than those of e2 fig 3 b and e3 fig 3 c in terms of model evaluation indicators e1 results in larger values of r 2 0 82 and nse 0 88 than other two scenarios indicating a better correlation between simulated and observed salinity the negative value of pbias means the model could be overestimated but the result of e1 is still better than those of e2 and e3 fig 3 d presents the individual comparison of simulated and observed salinity at different layers surface average and bottom with the mixture of freshwater and seawater the estuarine salinity of the surface layer is usually in a dynamic variation which brings difficulties for model simulation from the graphical comparison we can observe that the simulation of e1 matches the observations better than those of e2 using the diversion ratio of the 1980 s and e3 using the original results from swat in terms of model evaluation indicators it is noted that the r 2 values of the layer of average and bottom may be good for e2 and e3 but the model performance varies considerably in simulating surface salinity generally e1 has a greater r 2 0 82 value than the other scenarios have and this indicates a better correlation between simulated and observed salinity with the validation of the simulated salinity in the pre in july 2017 it is confirmed that the efdc model with the river diversion ratio of e1 is appropriate and can rationally evaluate the salinity in the pre 4 2 rainfall freshwater discharge and salinity in july 2017 according to the meteorological data meng et al 2019 the total rainfall in july 2017 was 246 3 mm for the whole prb and 256 4 mm 230 7 mm and 247 8 mm for the east river basin the north river basin and the west river basin respectively moreover the rainfall is rather larger in the prd region with a total amount of 301 3 mm which is larger than the normal july rainfall by 29 particularly there were two large daily rainfall depths in the prd region on july 2 46 7 mm day and 17 45 9 mm day which could lead to more freshwater discharges to the pre to detect the relationship of salinity variation with rainfall and flow discharge in the rainy season taking july as an example in the study fig 4 shows the average daily rainfall and swat simulated total flow discharge from the prb and the daily maximum tidal range near the east and west outlets in july 2017 then according to the variation of flow discharge and tidal range we separated the period of july into seven periods moreover table 5 lists the average daily salinity stratification coefficients s t for the six periods at the 14 sites obtained from the efdc simulation from fig 4 it is noticed that there are three periods i iii and v with larger average daily rainfall greater than10 mm day of the prb and two periods i and iii with considerable flow variation greater than1000 m3 s as for the tides both the tidal ranges in the east and west outlets were kept in a relatively high level in two periods iii and vi in period i a heavy rainfall from july 1 to 2 led to a flood discharge to the pre especially on july 2 with a total freshwater discharge from the prb of 7 617 million m3 day which is near 3 times the average discharge 2 528 million m3 day in july in the meantime salinity values at sites a1 to a6 near the east outlets showed a large vertical fluctuation s t greater than 1 0 in period i especially for the sites near the outlet namely a1 to a4 with the average s t value of 2 7 2 4 2 1 and 2 0 see table 5 during periods ii and iii site a2 to a6 still kept a high stratification with the s t value of 0 9 2 0 while salinity at site a1 was highly stratified in period ii but gradually mixed in period iii table 5 however for other periods even period v with another relative larger daily rainfall the salinity vertical distribution near sites a1 to a4 with s t values smaller than 0 5 showed little impact from freshwater discharge variation notably the seawater near sites a5 and a6 always kept a significant stratified level even when flow discharge in a low level and this indicates that the sites could receive combined impacts from both current and flow discharge comparatively salinity near sites a7 to a9 was also stratified under flow and tidal variation but in a relatively lower level table 5 thus the seawater near a5 and a6 could be the most fluctuated zone under the influence of mixing seawater and freshwater in the west part the s t values of f1 to f5 during the eight periods are less than 0 6 and specifically during periods iii iv v vi and vii the s t values at sites f3 to f5 are zero table 5 salinity in f1 could also be affected by tides due to the relatively higher stratification in periods vi and vii when the flow discharge is low the lower s t values indicate that the seawater was normally well mixed and the influence of both the freshwater and tidal variations on stratification was not significant in the west part of the pre 4 3 longitudinal salinity distribution in east and west parts of the pre besides a detailed elaboration of vertical salinity variation at those observation sites presented in section 4 2 it is also of great significance to quantify the affected area in the pre due to freshwater discharge to evaluate impacts of different freshwater discharges fig 5 shows the average longitudinal salinity from humen a main east outlet and modaomen a main west outlet to the seawater in the pre under different scenarios as per the studies of dahl 1956 lee et al 2013 and rybak 2018 here we adopted 0 5 psu as the threshold for separating freshwater and saltwater and then analyzed the sensitivity of saline water under different scenarios namely if the salinity is smaller than 0 5 psu the water is regarded as freshwater otherwise the seawater the arrows in fig 5 indicate the divides between freshwater and seawater for the results from different scenarios on one hand near the east outlets mainly humen outlet fig 5 a the salinity shows a similar spatial variation with different freshwater discharges in july from scenarios e4 e1 to e5 referring to freshwater discharge increase see table 2 the distances for the divide are from 6 km 25 km to 55 km respectively on the other hand near the west outlet mainly modaomen outlet fig 5 b increasing freshwater discharge firstly shows little influence the distances of the divide are 10 km for e4 and 14 km for both e1 and e5 away from the outlet it can be observed that in the west part when the distance away from the outlet is larger than 34 km see fig 5 b the salinity keeps at a relatively stable level about 35 psu namely the seawater salinity without impacts of freshwater 4 4 salinity changes under anthropogenic impacts from the 1980 s to the 2000 s the diversion ratios of the freshwater discharges from eight outlets have been considerably changed table 1 the ratio of freshwater discharge from modaomen in the western prd decreased by around 10 while the ratios for the outlets in the eastern prd increased at a range of 3 3 to 6 6 except for jiaomen outlet in general the freshwater discharge from the east shows a 10 increase the possible reasons for this variation to a large extent are due to intensive anthropogenic activities in the prd during the past decades including channel dredging and sand excavation zhang et al 2010 since the freshwater discharge is a vital factor of a coastal ecosystem through affecting the salinity sediment and nutrients here we presented the salinity difference under the scenarios of e2 with the diversion ratios in the 1980 s and e1 with the diversion ratios in the 2000 s fig 6 presents the spatial difference of salinity between both scenarios e1 and e2 for seawater of the surface fig 6 a bottom fig 6 b and average fig 6 c notably the positive value in the figure indicates the salinity decrease from the 1980 s to the 2000 s and the negative value shows the salinity increase from the figure we can observe that salinity in the east part generally decreased while in the west increased and the influence of freshwater discharge has a more significant impact on the salinity value difference the largest salinity increase could reach 8 61 psu in the west part than that a maximum of 2 11 psu in the east the affected area of the surface layer is much larger than that of the bottom layer and the situation of salinity average fig 6 c is close to the that of the bottom layer fig 6 b to further quantitively identify the impacts of anthropogenic activities fig 7 shows the areas of salinity change under scenarios e1 and e2 for the surface fig 7 a bottom fig 7 b and average fig 7 c of the seawater column it can be observed that the surface salinity is affected most by the smallest area without salinity change 6 24 565 km2 9 060 km2 fig 7 a while the bottom salinity receives less impacts by the largest area without salinity change 32 67 2 960 km2 9 060 km2 fig 7 b the areas with salinity variation greater than0 psu for the surface bottom and average are 8 495 km2 6 101 km2 and 7 566 km2 respectively among them the areas with salinity variation more than 1 0 psu are 1 098 km2 494 km2 and 667 km2 respectively the results obtained from figs 6 and 7 indicate that the surface salinity is affected more in terms of the area when the freshwater discharge varies due to the specific topography of two parts of the pre the way of salinity change shows different fig 7 d presents the affected areas of average salinity change 0 5 psu near both east and west estuaries from the 1980 s e2 to the 2000 s e1 it can be observed that the affected areas with the absolute values of the salinity change near the east and west outlets from 0 5 to 1 0 psu are 689 km2 and 65 km2 from 1 0 to 2 0 psu are 577 km2 and 45 km2 more than 2 0 psu are 0 and 56 km2 respectively therefore the total area effected by anthropogenic activities is much larger near the east outlets 1 266 km2 than that near the west 166 km2 however almost all the affected area has a salinity change less than 2 0 psu in the east while 34 of the affected area in the west has a salinity variation from 2 0 to 5 5 psu this difference is furthered explored in section 4 5 4 5 multiple regression analysis to investigate the possible relationships between influencing factors namely freshwater discharge water depth the distance to the outlet and current velocity and salinity variation near outlets the study adopted the multiple linear regression method with the daily average freshwater discharge current velocity water depth and the distance to the outlet of those selected sites the daily average salinity in july can be estimated by the equation below 7 s 5 773 f 0 515 w d 0 235 d i s 16 967 v x 55 003 v y 0 186 where s is the average salinity f is the freshwater flow rate w d and dis are the local seawater depth and the distance to the outlet respectively v x and v y are the zonal velocity from west to east and meridional velocity from south to north of the seawater current respectively table 6 a lists the summary of coefficients and statistics of the multiple regression analysis results the values of statistical significance p for t test and f test are less than 0 05 in the regression indicating that the independent variables are significantly predictive of salinity to identify the importance of different factors the coefficient values of beta β were calculated using equation 6 from table 6 a we can observe that the meridional velocity of sea current v y with the β value of 0 587 plays a key role in determining salinity variation followed by the distance from the outlet dis seawater depth w d and zonal velocity v x the freshwater discharge f with a negative β value plays an opposite role in affecting the salinity change during the flood period namely freshwater increasing the salinity decreases the distance dis shows a critical impact on salinity variation and the positive beta coefficient illustrates a positive correlation between salinity variation and the distance to the outlets for the different divides between seawater and freshwater and the distance of full seawater with the salinity of 35 psu discussed in section 4 3 it can be explained by another essential influencing factor on salinity variation the water depth w d from the 1980 s to 2000 s with less freshwater discharge from modaomen outlet in the west part it would have a considerable impact on salinity and the affected area is not large due to the larger seawater depth which could make freshwater and saltwater mix in a rather short time and distance since the seawater depth near the west outlets is generally larger than that near the east outlets as shown in fig 1 e the salinity variation therefore has a smaller area in the west outlets fig 6 and a shorter distance for the divide between freshwater and saltwater from the outlet to the sea fig 5 as discussed in section 4 3 the salinity in the west part of the pre keeps at a relatively stable level of 35 psu when the distance from the outlet modaomen is larger than 34 km notably the distances of sites f2 to f5 to the outlet are larger than 34 km see fig 1 e to further detect the particular features of variable impacts on salinity the separate multiple linear regressions for the east part a1 a9 and west part f1 f5 were conducted and tables 5 b c summarize the statistical result fig 8 shows the fitting curves of the pre fig 8 a east part fig 8 b and west part fig 8 c the coefficient of determination r 2 for the east part is 0 868 table 5 b which is obviously better than that in the west one table 5 c however in the east part the values of the statistical significance p of the seawater velocity of both zonal 0 667 and meridional 0 781 components are far larger than 0 05 table 6 b revealing that their contributions to predicting the dependent variable are not significant the salinity was largely determined by the distance from the outlet with β value of 0 885 and the water depth still has a positive correlation with the salinity if the water depth and the distance from the outlet are unchanged freshwater discharge is the decisive factor of the salinity variation and the influences from the current velocity could be ignored in the west part in contrast the water depth and the distance away from the outlet make the smallest contribution to the salinity variation with the p value of 0 723 and 0 840 table 6 c the freshwater and seawater mix rather faster and the current velocity is a key factor in determining the salinity 5 conclusions this study explored salinity variation features in the pre which is featured with multi outlets under the influences of freshwater discharge change from the prb in the rainy season using two numerical models and the simulation results were validated using the cruise salinity observations in july 2017 the study first detected the correlations between freshwater discharge and salinity and then investigated the spatial impacts of freshwater discharge from the prb on salinity variation near both the west and east parts of the pre in july under five different discharge scenarios the result disclosed that the divide between freshwater and saltwater is more sensitive in the east part than in the west part of the pre moreover the distance of the divide in the west part tends to be stationary due to the profound influence of the seawater depth furthermore increasing anthropogenic activities from the 1980 s to 2000 s have resulted in more streamflow discharging into the estuary through the east outlets affecting more areas of salinity variation in the east part of the pre this study also quantified the impacts of four factors namely freshwater discharge seawater depth the distance away from the outlet and current velocity on salinity variations in both west and east parts of the pre using the multiple regression method the analysis revealed that the key factor in influencing salinity values is different in both parts of the pre for the estuary with relative shallow seawater depth around 10 km and less than 15 km namely the east part of the pre the distance away from the outlet is the major factor in determining the salinity of the site based on the findings of this study it can be concluded that salinity variations in the pre are strongly influenced by freshwater discharge from the prb in the rainy season the study revealed that the impact of freshwater discharge on the divide between freshwater and saltwater is more distinct in the east part of the pre compared to the west part additionally the study highlighted the role of anthropogenic activities in increasing streamflow discharge through the east outlets which has led to a greater influence on salinity variation in the east part furthermore the study used multiple regression analysis to quantify the impacts of different factors on salinity changes in the west and east parts overall this study provided a method of adjusting diversion ratios for rational evaluation of freshwater discharge from a complex river network over a delta to an estuary which would overcome the gap in the combination of modeling terrestrial and estuarine processes with important implications for understanding and conserving the estuary environment besides freshwater discharge of sediment and nutrient from river basin models could also be applied in this way to rationally determine the sources of estuarine eutrophication hypoxia and other ecosystem consequences this study would also be helpful to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic activities in complex river deltas with multiple outlets on salinity variations of other estuaries in the world credit

1722,estuarine salinity is one of the key factors affecting coastal ecosystems however due to impenetrable situation of mixing streamflow from river basins and seawater currents our capability of evaluating salinity variation is far behind requirement in preventing coastal environment thus this paper presents an integrated study on salinity variation in the pearl river estuary pre in south china in the rainy season since the estuary would experience more salinity variation at the time the pre has a complicated water body with eight river outlets four ones in the east and the others in the west the paper develops a new research framework to evaluate the impacts of streamflow on the salinity variation including adjusting diversion ratios of freshwater discharges to the estuary and using two numerical models for simulating basin hydrologic processes and estuary salinity variations with the salinity observation from a field cruise in the pre in july 2017 and the newly developed framework this study validates the numerical simulation results detects the salinity variation under different scenarios of freshwater discharge and discloses the environmental factors related to salinity variation specifically the study shows the distinct characteristics of salinity variation in association with freshwater discharge and environmental factors including seawater current velocity and topography in the east a funnel shaped bay consists of four narrow deep channels and west a sub estuary of the modaomen waterway part of the estuary the results indicate that salinity in the east part is more sensitive to streamflow variation with a farther freshwater saltwater divide about 25 km away from the outlets than that in the west part 14 km the estuary area affected by salinity variation due to different streamflow diversion ratios is more significant in the east 1 266 km2 which is 7 6 times larger than that in the west 166 km2 however the values of salinity change due to different discharges are greater in the west more than 2 0 psu in 34 of the affected area than those in the east all less than 2 0 psu moreover the study shows that the seawater salinity variation in the east is greatly influenced by the distance to the outlet freshwater discharge and seawater depth while in the west the salinity variation is largely determined by seawater current velocity keywords estuary salinity freshwater discharge multiple river outlets swat efdc rainy season data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuary salinity is one of the most important environmental factors for coastal waters and the combined response to terrestrial hydrologic processes and coastal features chevalier et al 2014 khan et al 2020 telesh and khlebovich 2010 the temporal and spatial salinity variations can influence coastal water stratification density and suspended sediments zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b and also biological habitats through structuring microbial communities in an estuary li et al 2019 rojas jimenez et al 2019 telesh and khlebovich 2010 zhang et al 2021a moreover salinity sensitive species in coastal areas would not even survive under sudden salinity change ayache et al 2019 chen et al 2019a as a critical ecological driver salinity variation depends on both estuarine and marine inputs di iorio and castelao 2013 fichez et al 2017 xu et al 2018 various hydrodynamic models have been developed for different estuaries to study the salinity responses to multiple influencing factors jackson et al 2021 vargas et al 2017 xu et al 2018 however few studies focused on the impacts from both the terrestrial and estuarine processes especially for multi outlet estuaries with complex upstream river networks which have internal interactive influences on estuarine salinity from upstream river branches moreover due to rapid population growth and urbanization in the past several decades sun et al 2020 anthropogenic activities are intensive specifically in coastal regions therefore with dense river networks and intensive human activities from upstream river basins it is necessary to conduct a systematic study on salinity variations in complex estuaries with multiple outlets the pearl river estuary pre is near to the pearl river delta prd with eight river outlets and the pre can be further separated into the east and west parts some previous studies explored salinity variation of lingdingyang which is located in the east part niu et al 2020 xu et al 2022 you 2012 or modaomen which is the primary outlet in the west part gong et al 2022 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 however the freshwater discharge from the pearl river pr through the eight outlets is closely related to the anthropogenic activities in the prd and then the salinity variation in the west and east parts should therefore show some relationship thus it is valuable to evaluate how the salinity variation is affected by anthropogenic activities in the pr basin prb and how different the salinity variations are in both parts under the influence of freshwater discharge change lu et al 2018 however up to date a systematic exploration of salinity variation in the pre through consideration of anthropogenic influences on discharge has not been available yet moreover since there is more freshwater discharging into the pre during the rainy season and the salinity observations at some locations in the pre in july 2017 are available the study focuses on detecting the features of salinity variations in july for both the west and east parts of the region the paper is structed as follows section 2 presents the study area and section 3 introduces the data and analysis method terrestrial and estuarine models as well as their combination section 4 shows the study results including the influences of freshwater discharge on salinity variation the affected area under different scenarios due to anthropogenic activities and the influences from freshwater discharge water depth distance to the outlet and current velocity finally section 5 summarizes the findings 2 study area the pr is the second largest river in terms of streamflow volume in china with a length of 2 214 km and a drainage area of 453 690 km2 niu et al 2017 zhao 1990 and the prb consists of 4 river systems the west river north river east river and prd niu and chen 2016 fig 1 a the pre is the linkage and transition zone where the freshwater from the prb and saltwater from the south china sea scs converge the pre receives the freshwater from the eight river discharge outlets in the prd including humen jiaomen hongqimen hengmen modaomen jitimen hutiaomen and yamen with two major longitudinal channels which are humen in the east and modaomen in the west fig 1 b since the geographic locations of the east outlets namely humen jiaomen hongqimen and hengmen and the west outlets namely modaomen jitimen hutiaomen and yamen are relatively separated this study pays more attention to the independent investigation of salinity variations in the east and west parts of the pre the complex distribution of the river networks in the prd fig 1 b and the intensive human activities in the prb make it even harder to rationally evaluate the discharge of each outlet to the pre during the past several decades the prd has experienced rapid economic growth and urban development chen et al 2011 sun et al 2020 and various anthropogenic activities including channel dredging sand excavation and adjusting the connection of river channels have been implemented which therefore have altered the geometries of the river networks in the delta consequently the river discharges from west and east outlets into the pre have been significantly changed wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 which would lead to considerable salinity variation in part of the estuary 3 methodology 3 1 a hydrologic model swat for prb this study adopted a hydrologic model swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 to simulate the discharges from the prb originally developed by arnold 1994 for agricultural research service ars of the united sates department of agriculture usda swat is a physically based comprehensive and semi distributed model requiring specific input parameters of weather topography soil properties land use and management of a river basin swat has been widely applied for several decades as one of the most popular basin scale models abbaspour et al 2015 rahaman et al 2019 schuol et al 2008 moreover swat was successfully applied calibrated and validated for the terrestrial processes over the prb tributaries the east river basin chen and wu 2012 wu et al 2019 wu and chen 2012a wu and chen 2013a wu and chen 2013b wu et al 2013 the north river basin chen et al 2021 and the west river basin touseef et al 2020 the input datasets of swat include dem digital elevation model data from srtm shuttle radar topography mission with a resolution of 90 m the land use data from the chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 1 km and soil data from both fao food and agriculture organization and hwsd harmonized world soil database with a resolution of 1 km the meteorological data are obtained from the cmads the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model meng et al 2019 for the period from 2007 to 2018 the swat model was used at a daily time step from 2007 to 2018 with a 1 year warm up period as shown in fig 1 c the prb is delineated into 350 subbasins with an average area of 1 222 km2 and 5902 hydrologic response units hrus with an average area of 72 km2 based on the unique combination of land use and soil type there are 8 outlets of the prd however due to the relatively small elevation difference and complex river network in the prd only four of the river outlets are delineated using dem data fig 1 c 3 2 a hydrodynamic model efdc for pre to evaluate the salinity in the pre the study adopted the efdc environmental and fluid dynamics code to simulate seawater conditions including current velocity and salinity the efdc was initially developed at the virginia institute of marine science in the united states for estuarine and coastal applications hamrick 1992 the model has been extensively tested and documented with various applications in simulating hydrodynamics salinity temperature sediment transport oxygen and nutrient processes and the transport of toxic contaminants in water and sediment phases chen et al 2016b hong and shen 2013 li et al 2011 liu et al 2008 the efdc were successfully applied to study salinity intrusion in the west outlets of the pre in the dry season gong and shen 2011 liu et al 2019 fig 1 d shows the simulation domain of the pre for running efdc including the entire pre and adjacent scs and the study explored the salinity variation near different outlets bathymetry and coastline data of the pre were obtained from the maritime safety administration of the people s republic of china a curvilinear orthogonal coordinate was set up in the horizontal dimension and a sigma coordinate was set up in the vertical direction with 10 equal layers the domain area is 9 060 km2 with 22 992 grids and the average gird area is 0 39 km2 wind boundaries were set up for two directions at daily time step with the observations obtained from hong kong observatory tidal data were obtained from four tidal stations near the pre namely sanzao dawanshan wailingding and kuichong and interpolated for the tidal boundary in the adjacent domain further based on the cruise observations the salinity at the river flow boundaries and the open sea boundary were set to be 0 10 psu and 35 psu notably the daily freshwater discharge from the prb was downscaled for fitting to the simulation time step and vertical layers the efdc model used cold start for initial condition with a constant salinity of 30 psu for the entire domain and time step of 5 s 1 year warm up period was selected to reach a dynamic quasi steady state several salinity measuring sites see fig 1 d for the locations during an interdisciplinary field survey cruise were selected and fig 1 e shows the water depths and the distances of those sites to the related main river outlets notably the survey cruise was conducted in july 2017 by the research team of ocean hk ocean circulation ecosystem and hypoxia around hong kong waters project chen et al 2019b shi et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 the project is funded by a theme based research scheme of the research grants council rgc in hksar to explore the physical biogeochemical sediment and pollutant dynamics and their variability in the pre and hong kong waters this paper used the observed salinity data to validate the efdc simulation results 3 3 linkage of prb and pre for evaluating diversion ratios of river discharge estuary waters are strongly affected by river discharges especially during rainy seasons with larger discharges nevertheless it is challenging to monitor the river discharges at an estuary due to the mixture of seawater intrusion to the river delta moreover the simulation of river basin discharge to an estuary is rather difficult due to the complicated river network in the delta with multi outlets therefore on the one hand this is a research gap in the world to rationally estimate the river discharges from different outlets into an estuary on the other hand it is of great importance to have rational freshwater discharges from outlets to an estuary for evaluating the influence of river basins on the salinity variation and estuary ecosystem previous studies liu and gan 2020 liu et al 2018 perera et al 2009 yang and chui 2016 for coastal models usually used the flowrates at upstream control stations normally 40 130 km far from the outlets normally without the tide influence on those flowrates as a reference to set up flow boundary and the linkage of hydrologic models at the river delta often lacked in this study the prd is located at a plain terrain with a small elevation variation and the intensive anthropogenic activities sun et al 2020 including channel dredging and sand excavation are severe as a result it is difficult to generate an accurate river network and simulate rational river discharge from each outlet in the prd to the pre notably for a certain period which could be several years long the ratio of freshwater discharge from one outlet to the total freshwater discharge which is the sum of the river discharges from all the outlets to an estuary would not change severely wu 2013 such a ratio is called as a river diversion ratio and certainly the sum of the diversion ratios of all the outlets is 1 0 table 1 lists the historical diversion ratios of river discharge in the east and west outlets of the prd in the 1980 s and 2000 s wu 2013 from the table it can be observed that the discharge from modaomen is dominant in the west part to simplify the simulation the study takes modaomen outlet instead of total four outlets in the west part to analyze the discharge impacts on salinity variation and assigns the total diversion ratio of the west part to modaomen outlet to compare simulation results of different diversion ratios and explore anthropogenic activities the study adopted five scenarios see table 2 to adjust freshwater discharges as input data to efdc among them two scenarios e1 and e2 use the diversion ratios in the 2000 s and 1980 s see table 1 respectively therefore intuitively scenario e1 can be regarded as a proxy of current discharge ratio situation in the prd another scenario e3 uses the original results from swat which has freshwater discharge from four outlets fig 1 c to study the sensitivities of salinity in the west and east parts of the pre the remaining two scenarios e4 and e5 use 50 namely half and 200 double of the river discharge used in scenario e1 respectively fig 2 shows the framework of combining the hydrologic model and hydrodynamic model using river diversion ratio for exploring salinity variations 3 4 model evaluation the swat model was evaluated by the observed daily streamflow data obtained from the control stations gaoyao of the west river shijiao of the north river and boluo of the east river as shown in fig 1 a three widely used statistical parameters were selected to evaluate the performance of the model the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the percentage bias pbias which can be calculated using the following equations khadka et al 2021 niu and chen 2010 qiu and wan 2013 zhou et al 2020 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i

sample data as mentioned above the field survey cruise was conducted in july 2017 for the theme based research scheme project to validate the model results from efdc this study obtained observations from 14 cruise sites fig 1 d table 3 lists the cruise information for those sites chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b liu and gan 2020 shi et al 2019 at each site the salinity of the vertical profile was measured with a conductivity temperature depth ctd profiler every 0 5 m from the water surface to the bottom sites a1 to a9 are located in the east part from the river outlet and sites f1 to f5 are located in the west part the efdc simulated salinity using the scenarios of e1 e2 and e3 at the measured time of the field survey table 3 were compared with the observed salinity data for surface average and bottom of the seawater columns at those 14 sites 3 5 salinity stratification estuarine water as a mixture of freshwater and seawater is strongly affected by river discharge from the upstream basin and ocean current from the sea freshwater discharge can greatly affect the vertical distribution of coastal salinity in a seawater column resulting in a phenomenon of salinity stratification the study explored the pattern of salinity stratification which is described as st a non dimensional coefficient to characterize the vertical salt distribution of a seawater column gong et al 2014 hansen and rattray jr 1966 and the equation of computing s t is given below 4 s t δ s s 0 s bot s sur s 0 where s bot s sur and s 0 are the bottom surface and average salinities of the water column respectively if s t is close to 0 the saline and fresh water are well mixed if s t is larger than 1 the seawater is characterized by highly saline stratification 3 6 multiple regression to evaluate the possible influencing factors of salinity near estuaries chen et al 2016a this study adopted the multiple regression method the five independent variables namely flow rate of freshwater discharge seawater depth the distance to the outlet and current velocity including the velocity components of zonal and meridional directions and dependent variable salinity of 31 days in july 2017 for 14 sites a1 to a9 f1 to f5 see fig 1 d obtained from efdc simulation were used for multiple regression analysis f test is adopted for analysis of variance anova to evaluate whether the independent variable is significantly predictive of the dependent variable in the proposed regression model chen et al 2016a tranmer and elliot 2008 the statistical significance p of the individual regression coefficient is examined by t test tranmer and elliot 2008 the relationship between five independent variables and salinity was then analyzed using the following multiple regression equation andrews 1974 baig et al 2021 tranmer and elliot 2008 5 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 5 x 5 the standardized regression coefficients beta coefficients β are estimated using equation 6 siegel 2016 to evaluate the importance of each independent variable of the dependent variable salinity s x i and s y are the standard deviations of x i and y respectively 6 β i b i s x i s y 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance the swat model was evaluated at three control stations during the calibration 2008 to 2011 and validation 2012 to 2015 periods due to the availability of monthly streamflow observations we conducted evaluation of the streamflow simulation for both periods at monthly scale and table 4 presents the statistical values of model performance normally nse with the value larger than 0 50 and pbias with the absolute value smaller than 25 is regarded as satisfactory simulation moriasi et al 2007 wu and chen 2012b the results of the control stations from three major subbasins presented in the table indicate that the swat model is reliable in simulating the streamflow of the prb with the different diversion ratios of three scenarios e1 e2 and e3 the simulated salinities at sites a1 to a9 and f1 to f5 are compared with the cruise observed salinities fig 3 the significance values p of three groups of data are less than 0 001 and this indicates that the relationship between simulation and observation is statistically significant fig 3 a c show the comparison of simulated and observed salinity during the measuring time given in table 3 the figure includes the statistical parameters of model performance at the surface average and bottom of the seawater column for three scenarios e1 e2 and e3 from the figure it can be observed that the simulation of e1 fig 3 a matches the cruise observations better than those of e2 fig 3 b and e3 fig 3 c in terms of model evaluation indicators e1 results in larger values of r 2 0 82 and nse 0 88 than other two scenarios indicating a better correlation between simulated and observed salinity the negative value of pbias means the model could be overestimated but the result of e1 is still better than those of e2 and e3 fig 3 d presents the individual comparison of simulated and observed salinity at different layers surface average and bottom with the mixture of freshwater and seawater the estuarine salinity of the surface layer is usually in a dynamic variation which brings difficulties for model simulation from the graphical comparison we can observe that the simulation of e1 matches the observations better than those of e2 using the diversion ratio of the 1980 s and e3 using the original results from swat in terms of model evaluation indicators it is noted that the r 2 values of the layer of average and bottom may be good for e2 and e3 but the model performance varies considerably in simulating surface salinity generally e1 has a greater r 2 0 82 value than the other scenarios have and this indicates a better correlation between simulated and observed salinity with the validation of the simulated salinity in the pre in july 2017 it is confirmed that the efdc model with the river diversion ratio of e1 is appropriate and can rationally evaluate the salinity in the pre 4 2 rainfall freshwater discharge and salinity in july 2017 according to the meteorological data meng et al 2019 the total rainfall in july 2017 was 246 3 mm for the whole prb and 256 4 mm 230 7 mm and 247 8 mm for the east river basin the north river basin and the west river basin respectively moreover the rainfall is rather larger in the prd region with a total amount of 301 3 mm which is larger than the normal july rainfall by 29 particularly there were two large daily rainfall depths in the prd region on july 2 46 7 mm day and 17 45 9 mm day which could lead to more freshwater discharges to the pre to detect the relationship of salinity variation with rainfall and flow discharge in the rainy season taking july as an example in the study fig 4 shows the average daily rainfall and swat simulated total flow discharge from the prb and the daily maximum tidal range near the east and west outlets in july 2017 then according to the variation of flow discharge and tidal range we separated the period of july into seven periods moreover table 5 lists the average daily salinity stratification coefficients s t for the six periods at the 14 sites obtained from the efdc simulation from fig 4 it is noticed that there are three periods i iii and v with larger average daily rainfall greater than10 mm day of the prb and two periods i and iii with considerable flow variation greater than1000 m3 s as for the tides both the tidal ranges in the east and west outlets were kept in a relatively high level in two periods iii and vi in period i a heavy rainfall from july 1 to 2 led to a flood discharge to the pre especially on july 2 with a total freshwater discharge from the prb of 7 617 million m3 day which is near 3 times the average discharge 2 528 million m3 day in july in the meantime salinity values at sites a1 to a6 near the east outlets showed a large vertical fluctuation s t greater than 1 0 in period i especially for the sites near the outlet namely a1 to a4 with the average s t value of 2 7 2 4 2 1 and 2 0 see table 5 during periods ii and iii site a2 to a6 still kept a high stratification with the s t value of 0 9 2 0 while salinity at site a1 was highly stratified in period ii but gradually mixed in period iii table 5 however for other periods even period v with another relative larger daily rainfall the salinity vertical distribution near sites a1 to a4 with s t values smaller than 0 5 showed little impact from freshwater discharge variation notably the seawater near sites a5 and a6 always kept a significant stratified level even when flow discharge in a low level and this indicates that the sites could receive combined impacts from both current and flow discharge comparatively salinity near sites a7 to a9 was also stratified under flow and tidal variation but in a relatively lower level table 5 thus the seawater near a5 and a6 could be the most fluctuated zone under the influence of mixing seawater and freshwater in the west part the s t values of f1 to f5 during the eight periods are less than 0 6 and specifically during periods iii iv v vi and vii the s t values at sites f3 to f5 are zero table 5 salinity in f1 could also be affected by tides due to the relatively higher stratification in periods vi and vii when the flow discharge is low the lower s t values indicate that the seawater was normally well mixed and the influence of both the freshwater and tidal variations on stratification was not significant in the west part of the pre 4 3 longitudinal salinity distribution in east and west parts of the pre besides a detailed elaboration of vertical salinity variation at those observation sites presented in section 4 2 it is also of great significance to quantify the affected area in the pre due to freshwater discharge to evaluate impacts of different freshwater discharges fig 5 shows the average longitudinal salinity from humen a main east outlet and modaomen a main west outlet to the seawater in the pre under different scenarios as per the studies of dahl 1956 lee et al 2013 and rybak 2018 here we adopted 0 5 psu as the threshold for separating freshwater and saltwater and then analyzed the sensitivity of saline water under different scenarios namely if the salinity is smaller than 0 5 psu the water is regarded as freshwater otherwise the seawater the arrows in fig 5 indicate the divides between freshwater and seawater for the results from different scenarios on one hand near the east outlets mainly humen outlet fig 5 a the salinity shows a similar spatial variation with different freshwater discharges in july from scenarios e4 e1 to e5 referring to freshwater discharge increase see table 2 the distances for the divide are from 6 km 25 km to 55 km respectively on the other hand near the west outlet mainly modaomen outlet fig 5 b increasing freshwater discharge firstly shows little influence the distances of the divide are 10 km for e4 and 14 km for both e1 and e5 away from the outlet it can be observed that in the west part when the distance away from the outlet is larger than 34 km see fig 5 b the salinity keeps at a relatively stable level about 35 psu namely the seawater salinity without impacts of freshwater 4 4 salinity changes under anthropogenic impacts from the 1980 s to the 2000 s the diversion ratios of the freshwater discharges from eight outlets have been considerably changed table 1 the ratio of freshwater discharge from modaomen in the western prd decreased by around 10 while the ratios for the outlets in the eastern prd increased at a range of 3 3 to 6 6 except for jiaomen outlet in general the freshwater discharge from the east shows a 10 increase the possible reasons for this variation to a large extent are due to intensive anthropogenic activities in the prd during the past decades including channel dredging and sand excavation zhang et al 2010 since the freshwater discharge is a vital factor of a coastal ecosystem through affecting the salinity sediment and nutrients here we presented the salinity difference under the scenarios of e2 with the diversion ratios in the 1980 s and e1 with the diversion ratios in the 2000 s fig 6 presents the spatial difference of salinity between both scenarios e1 and e2 for seawater of the surface fig 6 a bottom fig 6 b and average fig 6 c notably the positive value in the figure indicates the salinity decrease from the 1980 s to the 2000 s and the negative value shows the salinity increase from the figure we can observe that salinity in the east part generally decreased while in the west increased and the influence of freshwater discharge has a more significant impact on the salinity value difference the largest salinity increase could reach 8 61 psu in the west part than that a maximum of 2 11 psu in the east the affected area of the surface layer is much larger than that of the bottom layer and the situation of salinity average fig 6 c is close to the that of the bottom layer fig 6 b to further quantitively identify the impacts of anthropogenic activities fig 7 shows the areas of salinity change under scenarios e1 and e2 for the surface fig 7 a bottom fig 7 b and average fig 7 c of the seawater column it can be observed that the surface salinity is affected most by the smallest area without salinity change 6 24 565 km2 9 060 km2 fig 7 a while the bottom salinity receives less impacts by the largest area without salinity change 32 67 2 960 km2 9 060 km2 fig 7 b the areas with salinity variation greater than0 psu for the surface bottom and average are 8 495 km2 6 101 km2 and 7 566 km2 respectively among them the areas with salinity variation more than 1 0 psu are 1 098 km2 494 km2 and 667 km2 respectively the results obtained from figs 6 and 7 indicate that the surface salinity is affected more in terms of the area when the freshwater discharge varies due to the specific topography of two parts of the pre the way of salinity change shows different fig 7 d presents the affected areas of average salinity change 0 5 psu near both east and west estuaries from the 1980 s e2 to the 2000 s e1 it can be observed that the affected areas with the absolute values of the salinity change near the east and west outlets from 0 5 to 1 0 psu are 689 km2 and 65 km2 from 1 0 to 2 0 psu are 577 km2 and 45 km2 more than 2 0 psu are 0 and 56 km2 respectively therefore the total area effected by anthropogenic activities is much larger near the east outlets 1 266 km2 than that near the west 166 km2 however almost all the affected area has a salinity change less than 2 0 psu in the east while 34 of the affected area in the west has a salinity variation from 2 0 to 5 5 psu this difference is furthered explored in section 4 5 4 5 multiple regression analysis to investigate the possible relationships between influencing factors namely freshwater discharge water depth the distance to the outlet and current velocity and salinity variation near outlets the study adopted the multiple linear regression method with the daily average freshwater discharge current velocity water depth and the distance to the outlet of those selected sites the daily average salinity in july can be estimated by the equation below 7 s 5 773 f 0 515 w d 0 235 d i s 16 967 v x 55 003 v y 0 186 where s is the average salinity f is the freshwater flow rate w d and dis are the local seawater depth and the distance to the outlet respectively v x and v y are the zonal velocity from west to east and meridional velocity from south to north of the seawater current respectively table 6 a lists the summary of coefficients and statistics of the multiple regression analysis results the values of statistical significance p for t test and f test are less than 0 05 in the regression indicating that the independent variables are significantly predictive of salinity to identify the importance of different factors the coefficient values of beta β were calculated using equation 6 from table 6 a we can observe that the meridional velocity of sea current v y with the β value of 0 587 plays a key role in determining salinity variation followed by the distance from the outlet dis seawater depth w d and zonal velocity v x the freshwater discharge f with a negative β value plays an opposite role in affecting the salinity change during the flood period namely freshwater increasing the salinity decreases the distance dis shows a critical impact on salinity variation and the positive beta coefficient illustrates a positive correlation between salinity variation and the distance to the outlets for the different divides between seawater and freshwater and the distance of full seawater with the salinity of 35 psu discussed in section 4 3 it can be explained by another essential influencing factor on salinity variation the water depth w d from the 1980 s to 2000 s with less freshwater discharge from modaomen outlet in the west part it would have a considerable impact on salinity and the affected area is not large due to the larger seawater depth which could make freshwater and saltwater mix in a rather short time and distance since the seawater depth near the west outlets is generally larger than that near the east outlets as shown in fig 1 e the salinity variation therefore has a smaller area in the west outlets fig 6 and a shorter distance for the divide between freshwater and saltwater from the outlet to the sea fig 5 as discussed in section 4 3 the salinity in the west part of the pre keeps at a relatively stable level of 35 psu when the distance from the outlet modaomen is larger than 34 km notably the distances of sites f2 to f5 to the outlet are larger than 34 km see fig 1 e to further detect the particular features of variable impacts on salinity the separate multiple linear regressions for the east part a1 a9 and west part f1 f5 were conducted and tables 5 b c summarize the statistical result fig 8 shows the fitting curves of the pre fig 8 a east part fig 8 b and west part fig 8 c the coefficient of determination r 2 for the east part is 0 868 table 5 b which is obviously better than that in the west one table 5 c however in the east part the values of the statistical significance p of the seawater velocity of both zonal 0 667 and meridional 0 781 components are far larger than 0 05 table 6 b revealing that their contributions to predicting the dependent variable are not significant the salinity was largely determined by the distance from the outlet with β value of 0 885 and the water depth still has a positive correlation with the salinity if the water depth and the distance from the outlet are unchanged freshwater discharge is the decisive factor of the salinity variation and the influences from the current velocity could be ignored in the west part in contrast the water depth and the distance away from the outlet make the smallest contribution to the salinity variation with the p value of 0 723 and 0 840 table 6 c the freshwater and seawater mix rather faster and the current velocity is a key factor in determining the salinity 5 conclusions this study explored salinity variation features in the pre which is featured with multi outlets under the influences of freshwater discharge change from the prb in the rainy season using two numerical models and the simulation results were validated using the cruise salinity observations in july 2017 the study first detected the correlations between freshwater discharge and salinity and then investigated the spatial impacts of freshwater discharge from the prb on salinity variation near both the west and east parts of the pre in july under five different discharge scenarios the result disclosed that the divide between freshwater and saltwater is more sensitive in the east part than in the west part of the pre moreover the distance of the divide in the west part tends to be stationary due to the profound influence of the seawater depth furthermore increasing anthropogenic activities from the 1980 s to 2000 s have resulted in more streamflow discharging into the estuary through the east outlets affecting more areas of salinity variation in the east part of the pre this study also quantified the impacts of four factors namely freshwater discharge seawater depth the distance away from the outlet and current velocity on salinity variations in both west and east parts of the pre using the multiple regression method the analysis revealed that the key factor in influencing salinity values is different in both parts of the pre for the estuary with relative shallow seawater depth around 10 km and less than 15 km namely the east part of the pre the distance away from the outlet is the major factor in determining the salinity of the site based on the findings of this study it can be concluded that salinity variations in the pre are strongly influenced by freshwater discharge from the prb in the rainy season the study revealed that the impact of freshwater discharge on the divide between freshwater and saltwater is more distinct in the east part of the pre compared to the west part additionally the study highlighted the role of anthropogenic activities in increasing streamflow discharge through the east outlets which has led to a greater influence on salinity variation in the east part furthermore the study used multiple regression analysis to quantify the impacts of different factors on salinity changes in the west and east parts overall this study provided a method of adjusting diversion ratios for rational evaluation of freshwater discharge from a complex river network over a delta to an estuary which would overcome the gap in the combination of modeling terrestrial and estuarine processes with important implications for understanding and conserving the estuary environment besides freshwater discharge of sediment and nutrient from river basin models could also be applied in this way to rationally determine the sources of estuarine eutrophication hypoxia and other ecosystem consequences this study would also be helpful to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic activities in complex river deltas with multiple outlets on salinity variations of other estuaries in the world credit

1723,the propagation threshold between different droughts is necessary to investigate the mechanism of drought evolution at the same time dongjiang basin is of great significance in water resource management and regional socioeconomic development as it is one of the main water sources in south china however studies have often been limited to propagation between meteorological and hydrological droughts while studies on the propagation threshold from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought have rarely been reported this study developed a framework for the propagation threshold from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought the framework improved the method of pooling and exclusion of droughts and proposed new matching rules for different droughts using these rules meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic drought events were consistently matched one by one from the matched combinations of multi type drought events using copula conditional probabilities the propagation thresholds from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought was found the cmip6 datasets were applied to build spi standardized precipitation index and sri standardized runoff index for identifying meteorological and hydrological droughts socioeconomic droughts based on swsdi standardized water supply and demand index were further evaluated by the swat soil and water assessment tool and sd supply and demand models results showed that the integration of the improved pooling and exclusion method and new matching rules would provide accurate and reliable matching among meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic drought events in the future the higher the severity of socioeconomic drought the larger the propagation threshold of meteorological and hydrological droughts the threshold for propagation from meteorological to socioeconomic drought was larger than that for propagation from hydrological to socioeconomic drought in particular radiation forcing significantly increased the propagation threshold between meteorological or hydrological and socioeconomic droughts the framework provides a foundation for drought propagation and even socioeconomic drought prediction keywords drought propagation pooling and excluding matching relationship tolerance mechanism socioeconomic drought cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is caused by the imbalance between supply and demand of water resources due to its usually long duration wide area of influence and frequent occurrence drought is considered as one of the world s top ten natural disasters zhang et al 2022 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 during the period of 1990 2015 alone the frequency of global drought reached 5 7 times year accounting for 5 of the total number of natural disasters and the economic losses were 135 7 billion dollars wang et al 2020 based on causes and impacts droughts can be divided into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts ashok and singh 2010 sun 1994 the meteorological drought in a region refers to the imbalance between supply and demand of precipitation and evaporation there hydrologic drought refers to runoff or groundwater resources being lower than normal agricultural drought refers to water deficit in crops caused by the continuous shortage of soil water which affects the normal growth and development of crops and socioeconomic drought refers to the imbalance of supply and demand within a certain period of time caused by the total amount of water resources that cannot meet domestic demand and production shukla and wood 2008 song et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 there are complex links between different types of droughts with one type of drought causing another over time the transmission of water deficit signals between different types of droughts is called propagation huang et al 2016 this study focuses on three types of droughts meteorological drought refers to insufficient precipitation hydrological drought refers to reduced river runoff and socioeconomic drought refers to the social and economic impacts of imbalances in water supply and demand studying the propagation and matching of drought events is crucial in the context of climate change as it helps inform effective drought management strategies drought research particularly in terms of socioeconomic drought propagation and matching faces several challenges these include the acquisition and quality of data interdisciplinary obstacles complexity of drought propagation mechanisms spatial and temporal scales as well as socioeconomic complexities in general it is necessary to develop more refined models including more accurate event matching relationships and more scientific calculations of propagation thresholds the propagation of drought is deemed vital to comprehend the mechanism of drought creation guo et al 2019 presently studies on drought transmission mainly focus on the propagation between meteorological and hydrological droughts huang et al 2016 barker et al 2016 van loon et al 2012 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 these studies show that the propagation of drought in the hydrological system has the characteristics of aggregation including attenuation hysteresis and extension van loon et al 2012 ma et al 2019 yang et al 2017 studies have also dealt with the change and connection of drought characteristics during the transmission of meteorological drought and hydrological drought these studies mainly investigated into the structure of dependence between meteorological drought and hydrological drought characteristics wong et al 2013 the nonlinear relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought wu et al 2017 and the process of internal transmission wu et al 2018 however the drought threshold received little attention the question is what are the conditions leading to different degrees of drought the propagation process may have a linear or nonlinear relationship van loon and laaha 2015 taking the propagation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought as an example the linear relationship means that a meteorological drought with large water shortage often leads to a serious hydrological drought in the case of non linear relationship a series of mild meteorological droughts may evolve into severe hydrological droughts and the weakening of meteorological droughts may sometimes occur due to the available high water storage in the catchment area wong et al 2013 however studies on drought threshold considered only the linear correlation and ignored the nonlinear correlation of different droughts haslinger et al 2014 huang et al 2017 at present bayesian network bn and copula function are widely used to provide a solution to this problem bayesian network is used for probabilistic analysis in uncertain environments and accurate solutions can be obtained based on incomplete information sperotto et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 copula function is used for multivariate analysis including drought frequency and rainfall frequency considering the dependence between multiple variables liu et al 2021 there are few reports on the although the transmission between distinct drought types plays a crucial role in elucidating the mechanism of drought evolution limited attention has been paid to the mechanism of transmission of meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought zhang et al 2019 before drought threshold can be calculated the key problem is how to match the relationship between drought events guo et al 2020 a method of drought pooling and excluding provides a preliminary solution to this problem tu et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 this method was developed by zelenhasić and salvai 1987 and revised by madsen and rosbjerg 1995 and has since been used in multivalued design this method considers that a major drought event is usually divided into several small drought events that may be interdependent and these small droughts may interfere with or debunk drought frequency analysis so it is necessary to do their pooling and excluding on this basis the drought event matching method was proposed but at present the drought event matching is limited to the matching of meteorological drought and hydrological drought events guo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 and there are no matching rules for socioeconomic drought events because socioeconomic drought is affected by many factors and human activities it is not advisable to directly use the original drought matching therefore it is necessary to propose a matching rule for socioeconomic drought in addition climate change has a significant impact on the water cycle zhang et al 2023 causing changes in water availability by affecting the temporal and spatial distribution of atmospheric water holding capacity which in turn induces more droughts human activities and environmental degradation have caused large scale changes in climate which not only increase the difficulty of drought assessment but also emphasize the need for future drought assessment ipcc 2012 owing to the impact of climate change future meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts will be more severe wang et al 2011 and the law of evolution of future socioeconomic droughts is still in the exploratory stage and calls for further studies in conclusion study of the threshold of propagation of socioeconomic drought in the future and establishing the connection between socioeconomic drought and other types of droughts will help improve the understanding of socioeconomic drought therefore this study takes dongjiang basin as the study area starts with the definition of socioeconomic drought adds tolerance mechanism on the basis of existing drought matching rules and formulates a set of drought matching rules applicable to socioeconomic drought in order to connect meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought at the same time based on the matching results the socioeconomic drought propagation threshold is calculated by the copula function to explore the conditions triggering socioeconomic drought to some extent this study complements the integration of socioeconomic drought prediction and management 2 methods 2 1 selection of index for different drought types the standardized precipitation index spi the standardized runoff index sri and the standardized water supply and demand index swsdi were selected to calculate the conditions of meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought in order to define the threshold of propagation from meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought mckee et al 1993 shukla and wood 2008 wang et al 2022 the selection of spi sri and swsdi in drought research is due to their specific relevance to different stages of drought propagation using these three indices in tandem allows one to effectively study the propagation of a drought event from its initial meteorological stage through the hydrological stage to its ultimate socio economic impact this kind of comprehensive analysis is crucial for understanding drought propagation dynamics and improving our resilience and response strategies the spi has usually been used to describe the degree of precipitation shortage in different periods of time and is applicable to the monitoring and evaluation of droughts and floods on monthly and above time scales wang et al 2015 the sri has been shown to be advantageous for the characterization of hydrological drought the swsdi was a new index to describe socioeconomic drought conditions and its effectiveness has been validated in the dongjiang basin wang et al 2022 spi and sri normalize variables subject to specific distribution for calculation one can refer to literature zhou et al 2021 swsdi is calculated by normalizing the probability density function of water supply qs and water demand qd difference wsdd and converting it into standard normal distribution swsdi was calculated as 1 q wsdd q s q d 2 i swsdi w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w 2 ln p for p 0 5 if p 0 5 then p was replaced by p 1 p and the sign of the resultant swsdi was reversed the constants were c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 within a given watershed qs can be simulated by a variety of hydrological models and qd can be decomposed into in channel water demand qin and off channel water demand qoff the relationship between three variables can be calculated as 3 q d q in q off where qin and qoff were determined in the dongjiang basin tu et al 2015 wang et al 2022 qin 203 m3 s qoff 152 90 m3 s qd 355 90 m3 s it should be noted that these three variables need to be selected according to the actual situation when replacing the basin area 2 2 pooling and excluding of different types of drought events run theory was for identifying drought feature elements tu et al 2019 based on a given threshold t through which the discrete sequence of an index was determined when the index sequence was lower than the set threshold the drought event was identified at this time the abscissa of the corresponding index sequence was called the start time st when the index series was greater than the threshold again the drought event was considered to be over at this time the abscissa of the corresponding index series was called the end time et thus a complete drought event was obtained by the run theory for a drought event the characteristic elements of drought were further identified the length of drought event was called drought duration d which can be represented by d et st the area enclosed by the index sequence and threshold was called drought severity s and the ratio of drought severity to drought duration was called drought intensity i therefore a complete drought event was expressed as event st et d s i a large drought was often divided into several small droughts that may be interdependent if these small droughts were not treated analysis of drought events may not be complete tu et al 2019 guo et al 2018 therefore this paper used the pooling and excluding method of droughts zelenhasić and salvai 1987 madsen and rosbjerg 1995 to merge and eliminate drought events which has been used in multivariate analysis of drought characteristics tu et al 2016 liao et al 2021 however the traditional pooling and excluding method has the problem of omitting drought characteristic elements this study improved the basis of the original method and completed the pooling and excluding process of drought events the method can be divided into two independent parts during pooling two consecutive drought events and the interval event between two drought events were defined as eventi sti eti di si ii eventi 1 sti 1 eti 1 di 1si 1 ii 1 and intervali eti sti 1 d s i based on the duration severity and intensity of drought events and interval events the following three pooling standards were given 4 d i t c 5 s i s i p c s 6 i i i i p c i where tc pc s and pc i are the setting parameters which can be obtained by calculation in general when tc was determined pc s and pc i had the same frequency i e pc s pc i it was used to verify the fusion process but when tc was not determined pc i was used as the condition for selecting tc when two consecutive drought events and interval events met the above three conditions at the same time the two consecutive drought events and interval events were identified as a new drought event and the combined new event was represented by eventpool sti eti 1 dpool spool ipool where the parameters were calculated as 7 s pool s i s i 1 s i 8 d pool d i d i 1 d i 9 i pool s pool d pool where spool is the severity of drought event after fusion dpool is the duration of drought event after fusion and ipool is the intensity of drought event after fusion after the pooling of drought events there were still some drought events with short drought duration and low drought severity which had no impact on the basic attributes of the basin and socioeconomic development and did not interfere with the results of socioeconomic drought threshold therefore the excluding method of drought events was used tallaksen et al 1997 when excluding if the drought event after fusion met any of the following conditions it was considered as an exclusion event 10 d pool r d d p o o l a v e 11 s pool r s s pool ave where rd and rs are two given critical ratios which can be calculated dpool ave and spool ave are the average duration and severity of all drought events after fusion it should be noted that any single drought event has two important characteristics drought duration and drought severity in multivariate analysis of drought event feature elements drought duration and drought severity were equally important therefore the elimination result of drought events was reliable only when rd rs guo et al 2020 so rd rs rds 2 3 matching of meteorological and hydrological events to socioeconomic drought events in order to identify the socioeconomic drought events corresponding to meteorological drought events and hydrological drought events it was necessary to carry out the matching process of drought events before matching the propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was determined first spi and sri 1 12 months of multiple scales and swsdi of monthly scale were calculated and the propagation time was preliminarily determined barker et al 2016 through the correlation coefficient of the three the time scale with the highest correlation coefficient was considered to be the best propagation time the propagation time showed that the socioeconomic drought event was a response to meteorological and hydrological conditions in the past months in terms of mechanism socioeconomic drought was caused by the change of meteorological conditions which affected the change of hydrological conditions and finally led to socioeconomic drought however the basin itself had the ability to regulate some meteorological droughts may not induce hydrological droughts but may promote socioeconomic droughts in addition because the water supply of surface and groundwater systems is affected by management methods some hydrological droughts may not be induced by meteorological droughts thus directly inducing socioeconomic droughts therefore the triggering of socioeconomic drought was divided into three scenarios 1 meteorological drought induced hydrological drought which further led to socioeconomic drought 2 meteorological drought directly induced socioeconomic drought and 3 hydrologic drought directly led to socioeconomic drought for the three triggering conditions of socioeconomic drought this paper made the following matching restrictions for different scenarios to ensure that the drought event matching was reasonable and comprehensive meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic drought events were distinguished by using e1 e2 e3 e1 was represented as a set of all meteorological drought events which can be represented by stu etu

represents the matching process of drought events different from the propagation process of meteorological drought to hydrological drought socioeconomic drought was affected by many factors such as meteorology topography ecology and human activities the impact of human activities will especially lead to the occurrence of socioeconomic drought events significantly ahead of or behind wang et al 2022 therefore a tolerance mechanism tm was proposed for socioeconomic drought matching based on the original matching mechanism which indirectly advanced or lagged the occurrence time of socioeconomic drought without changing the duration of the original socioeconomic drought event to match meteorological drought and hydrological drought in addition it limited tolerance mechanism to avoid matching drought events that did not belong to the matching process this restriction was based on the severity of drought according to previous studies all types of droughts were divided into four categories according to severity namely light level ll moderate level ml severe level sl and extreme level el drought levels were divided according to the percentile of severity of all drought events el was the last 10 sl was the last 20 ml was the last 40 and other drought events were ll because of the integrity of the matching process s1 did not join the tolerance mechanism that is only when meteorological drought and hydrological drought separately triggered socioeconomic drought the tolerance mechanism was effective the operation mode of tolerance mechanism was as follows 1 match s1 scenarios as shown in formula 12 2 the remaining events after matching in the previous step were used in the matching process of s2 scenario under the role of tolerance mechanism the matching process will be optimized suppose a tolerance error te then the new drought propagation time was defined as t m t m t c and t h t h t e the matching rules were limited to 15 scenario 2 s t u s t q t m

drought matching process with tolerance mechanism all meteorological drought events and hydrological drought events that matched socioeconomic drought events were identified and classified at this time each pair contained more than two types of drought events which further obtained the duration severity and intensity of different types of droughts 2 4 drought propagation threshold calculation model based on a bayesian network copula function was used to build a multivariate joint probability distribution based on the dependency between univariate distributions and random variables genest et al 2007 hao and singh 2015 it has been widely used in the analysis of drought recurrence period and frequency liao et al 2021 guo et al 2019 copula function can be expressed as 17 c u v φ 1 x u y v where c u v is the copula function combined with the two random variables φ denotes the convex function and u and v represent the two variables at present the most used copula functions include archimedes copula family and elliptical copula family the former can establish non normal extreme value relationship and can better describe extreme events the latter is representative and easy to construct the calculation of socioeconomic drought threshold was divided into the following steps 1 the marginal distribution functions including normal distribution logarithmic normal distribution log gamma distribution exponential exp distribution generalized pareto gp distribution generalized extreme value gev distribution and weibull wbl distribution were applied to fit the matched duration and severity 2 the archimedean copula family gumbel copula clayton copula and frank copula and the elliptical copula t copula and gaussian copula were used to establish the joint distribution and the fitting was evaluated through the goodness of fit tests including akaike information criteria aic and bayesian information criteria bic 3 the joint probability density function was established and the socioeconomic drought threshold was then calculated based on the joint probability density function the bayesian network was used to estimate the relationship between random variables the bayesian network conditional probability model is a powerful tool in the study of drought propagation as it can help to quantify and represent the uncertainty inherent in this complex process this model can be particularly useful for estimating propagation thresholds in drought research a bayesian network is a graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph dag in the context of drought research the variables could be different indicators of drought such as meteorological drought index hydrological drought index socioeconomic drought index and the edges between them represent the causal relationships the marginal cumulative distribution of the duration set of hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought after matching were assumed as x x1 x2 xn and y y1 y2 yn taking hydrological drought as the condition and socioeconomic drought as the target under the condition of x u the probability of y v was expressed as 18 p y v y u p x u y v p x u 1 x u y v c x u y v 1 x u 1 y v c x u y v 1 x u where x u and y v denote the cumulative probability of x u and y v respectively and c x u y v represents the joint cumulative probability of x u and y v the meteorological drought and hydrological drought characteristic variables were taken as the conditions and the socioeconomic drought boundary characteristic value was taken as the target that is the percentile of intensity the critical values were 10 20 and 40 respectively the conditional probability of socioeconomic drought under meteorological and hydrological drought conditions was then calculated the confidence level of drought propagation threshold was taken as 0 95 which meant that when the conditional probability was equal to or greater than 0 95 the corresponding meteorological and hydrological drought characteristic element values were considered as the propagation threshold of socio economic drought events triggering this level 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the pearl river basin is one the three major basins in china the dongjiang river basin the xijiang river basin the beijiang river basin the hanjiang river basin and the pearl river delta form the pearl river basin the dongjiang basin is located between 21 31 and 26 49 n 102 14 and 115 53 e with a drainage area of 453 690 km2 dongjiang river was one of the main tributaries of the pearl river it flows from jiangxi province to guangdong province from northeast to southwest and finally enters the pearl river delta the river is 562 km long with an average annual runoff of 25 7 billion m3 fig 1 it is an important source of water supply for yunnan guangdong guizhou and hong kong special administrative region hong kong and macao with a total population of nearly 40 million for water supply and per capita water resources of about 800 m2 dongjiang basin was high elevation in the northeast and low in the southwest the average annual precipitation in the basin is 1500 2400 mm from the perspective of spatial distribution it is more in the southwest and less in the northeast the middle and lower reaches of the dongjiang basin are economically developed in 2019 the total gdp of each region in dongjiang supporting region reached 4 17 trillion yuan 3 2 data in this study monthly scale meteorological data were obtained from bcc csm2 mr cmip6 https esgfnode llnl gov search cmip6 future climate scenarios use the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp framework which come from the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps scenarios were used ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 wang et al 2021 the dem and land use into the swat soil and water assessment tool model were obtained from geospatial data clouds https www gscloud cn and landsat satellite remote sensing images https landsat gsfc nasa gov respectively soil properties were from harmonized world soil database hwsd which provided information on soil types soil phases and soil physical and chemical properties at each grid point hydrological data were calculated by the swat model the resolution of meteorological and hydrological data was changed from 1 125 1 121 lifting to 0 5 0 5 by bilinear interpolation method for calculating socioeconomic drought socioeconomic data were obtained from guangdong zhou statistical yearbook 4 results and discussion 4 1 pooling and excluding of different types of drought events before the pooling and excluding of drought events tc pc s pc i and rds were calculated accurate pooling and excluding process would directly affect the extraction and matching of drought events and the calculation of drought threshold variable parameters tc pc s and pc i in the process of pooling and excluding were determined by the parameter sensitivity method ratios of the characteristic values of drought events before and after fusion namely dpool d spool s and ipool i and plot the ratio curve of tc pc s and pc i were determined fig 2 it should be noted that for the same drought event drought duration drought severity and drought intensity had the same value in pc that is pc pc s pc i therefore pc was used as the abscissa to draw the curve as can be seen in fig 2 using the meteorological drought in the ssp1 2 6 scenario as an example fig 2 a when tc changed from 1 to 2 the ratio experienced a significant change however when the slope shifted from tc 2 to tc 3 the increase in the curve s slope wass smaller compared to the previous stage consequently tc was set to 2 months once tc was determined the ratio changed as pc increased if the slope of the ratio significantly decreased or became zero for the first time it indicated that the change in the drought factor was becoming more gradual and the corresponding abscissa was determined as the pooling parameter pc 0 41 after pooling the drought events the drought events were excluded and the parameter rds was determined based on sensitivity analysis from the plot of the mean ratio against rds fig 3 the abscissa of the ratio was determined as the final value of rds when the slope of the ratio first decreased significantly or became zero the fusion and culling parameters for different drought types across all scenarios were compiled in table 1 4 2 matching of meteorological and hydrological drought events with socioeconomic drought events before a meteorological drought event and a hydrological drought event were matched the time of propagation tm and th of the meteorological and hydrological droughts to the socioeconomic drought index sequence was determined first then the triggering time of the socioeconomic drought by the meteorological and hydrological droughts was determined the correlation coefficients of spi sri and swsdi were calculated at multiple time scales under different scenarios fig 4 the maximum correlation coefficient was then taken for the best propagation time from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought and then drought events were matched according to the matching rules the highest correlation is that the scales represent transit times between different drought types the propagation time tm and th was determined by examining the time lag between meteorological and hydrological droughts and the onset of socioeconomic drought as measured by the swsdi it can be seen from fig 4 that under different scenarios the average propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was 8 75 months and the average propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was 7 months which conformed to the drought propagation mechanism with the increase of radiation forcing the transmission time from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought increased but the gap between them shortened which indicated that the high radiation forcing increased the severity of socioeconomic drought the reason was that with the increase of radiation forcing more precipitation and faster water cycle were affected by local temperature which accelerated the process of land surface runoff generation and concentration however due to the influence of underlying surface and river channel runoff cannot be timely and fully used by human activities at the same time high temperature was accompanied by greater water demand and local heat island effect the reduction of water supply and the increase of water demand finally deepened the severity of socioeconomic drought on the basis of defining the propagation time from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought the drought event matching method including tolerance mechanism was used to match the drought events under different scenarios fig 5 the allowable error was 1 month and the drought propagation time varied with the change of radiation intensity as shown in fig 5 in all future scenarios the matching number of s1 was found to be higher than that of s2 and s3 indicating that the development of socioeconomic drought was significantly affected by meteorological and hydrological factors in addition the number of direct matches between meteorological drought and socioeconomic drought was higher than that between hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought with the increase of radiative forcing this number gap became more significant with the increase of radiation forcing the change of meteorological factors had a higher impact on socioeconomic drought than hydrological factors and there may be variability in the future water cycle process 4 3 threshold of propagation from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought after drought event matching copula function was selected to construct the cumulative probability density function and calculate the drought threshold in this paper gamma log exp gp gev and wbl were used to fit the drought duration and drought intensity series of meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic droughts kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse were used to select the best marginal distribution fitting functions k s test is a method based on cumulative distribution function to test whether a sequence distribution conforms to a certain theoretical distribution or to compare whether two sequence distributions are different it is considered to be one of the most reliable and conventional nonparametric methods for comparing two samples the p p plots were drawn according to the relationship between the cumulative scale of variables and the cumulative scale of the specified distribution the graph was used to verify whether the data conformed to the specified distribution when the data conformed to the specified distribution the points in the p p plots were approximately on a straight line therefore the p p plots were selected to analyze the fitting of the original sequence and the theoretical sequence fig 6 and the best fitting marginal distribution function is shown in table 2 it can be seen from fig 6 and table 2 that the optimal fitting distribution of future drought duration and drought severity were wbl and gamma and only log appeared in the optimal fitting distribution of drought duration on this basis the drought duration and drought severity of meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought were combined through archimedes copula family and elliptical copula family according to drought classification droughts were divided into ll ml sl and el in socioeconomic drought the critical probabilities of ml sl and el were 0 6 0 8 and 0 9 respectively based on the best fit marginal distribution the boundary eigenvalues of the above three levels of socioeconomic drought were determined first second the joint distribution of structural meteorological and hydrological droughts and socioeconomic drought characteristics were determined finally taking meteorological hydrological drought characteristics as conditions and taking the boundary eigenvalues of socioeconomic drought of ml sl and el as the target the conditional probabilities of socioeconomic drought of ml sl and el were calculated fig 7 when the conditional probability was equal to or greater than 95 the corresponding meteorological and hydrological drought characteristic element values were considered as the propagation threshold of socioeconomic drought at the same level table 3 it can be seen from fig 7 and table 3 that under ssp1 2 6 the duration threshold for meteorological drought to spread to socioeconomic drought was 9 1 12 42 months while in the ssp3 7 0 the threshold was 5 00 9 70 months the severity threshold for meteorological drought to spread to socioeconomic drought was 5 39 10 67 under ssp1 2 6 while in the ssp3 7 0 the threshold was 5 51 8 37 under ssp2 4 5 scenario the duration and severity of drought from meteorological drought to extreme socioeconomic drought were the highest which were 17 46 months and 13 48 the maximum drought duration and drought severity from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought respectively were 13 65 months and 13 06 under ssp5 8 5 scenario on the whole the drought threshold from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought of different levels was higher than that from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought of different levels in the dongjiang basin with the increase of severity of socioeconomic drought the threshold value of propagation from meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was larger in addition with the increase of radiation forcing the threshold of transmission from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought of different levels was larger and the magnitude of radiation forcing significantly affected the drought transmission process 4 4 discussion first in the process of drought matching a matching rule with tolerance mechanism was proposed this matching method was specified by integrating the definition of socioeconomic drought and the characteristics of dongjiang basin the basin is rich in vegetation and the precipitation in the wet season accounts for more than 80 of the whole year resulting in a short time of runoff generation and convergence in the wet season while a long time in the dry season based on the relationship between the two and different scenarios in the future ae 1 was selected when the method was used in other regions attention was paid to the composition of swsdi and the characteristics of the watershed the allowable error of the watershed with sparse vegetation large runoff and intensive human activities was shortened when ae 0 the tolerance mechanism was invalid but it did not affect the drought matching process results second only the propagation of meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought under natural conditions is considered but for considering reservoirs the matching method with tolerance mechanism also has certain applicability generally speaking the role of the reservoir is to store water and balance the runoff between the wet season and the dry season which will also have a significant impact on the assessment of hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought when the reservoir was considered the number duration and intensity of hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought events decreased and the propagation time increased accordingly which seriously weakened the applicability of the traditional drought propagation time scheme however the method proposed in this paper offset this lag because of the tolerance mechanism finally in the calculation of the threshold of propagation from meteorological hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought all matching results were put into the same combination for consideration which mainly took into account the impact of sample size on the joint probability density function due to the pooling and excluding of drought events the events that can be used to evaluate the propagation threshold were reduced and the sample size of events that met the complete propagation relationship was 30 40 times which seriously affected the construction of the copula function when there were enough socioeconomic drought events the split analysis of different matching rules was further considered 5 conclusions the threshold of propagation and matching rule from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought are s an unavoidable problem in the current socioeconomic drought studies the solution to this problem can effectively guide drought prediction drought prevention and control and drought loss determination especially in areas with scarce data in light of the complexity of definition of socioeconomic drought this research proposed a drought matching rule with tolerance mechanism based on drought fusion and elimination scheme this new proposed drought matching rule calculated the threshold of transmission of meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought of different levels based on bayesian network conditional probability model which further explained the response of socioeconomic drought to meteorological hydrological conditions the findings of this paper can inform drought prediction prevention and control efforts in the dongjiang basin by providing insights into the propagation of meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 the socioeconomic drought matching rule with tolerance mechanism effectively identified the propagation from meteorological drought with water cycle to socioeconomic drought and provided a solution to the socioeconomic drought propagation with incomplete water cycle 2 the threshold of propagation of meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was higher than that of hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought and the difference between the propagation thresholds of drought intensity grew larger with the increase in the severity of socioeconomic drought the propagation threshold of meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought also increased 3 the drought matching results unveiled that the occurrence and development of socioeconomic drought were seriously affected by meteorological hydrological factors with the increase of radiation forcing the change of meteorological factors had a significant impact on socioeconomic drought at the same time with the rise of radiation forcing the propagation threshold from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought of different levels grew larger besides the magnitude of radiation forcing also significantly affected the drought transmission process author contributions tian wang writing original draft visualization software xinjun tu

1723,the propagation threshold between different droughts is necessary to investigate the mechanism of drought evolution at the same time dongjiang basin is of great significance in water resource management and regional socioeconomic development as it is one of the main water sources in south china however studies have often been limited to propagation between meteorological and hydrological droughts while studies on the propagation threshold from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought have rarely been reported this study developed a framework for the propagation threshold from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought the framework improved the method of pooling and exclusion of droughts and proposed new matching rules for different droughts using these rules meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic drought events were consistently matched one by one from the matched combinations of multi type drought events using copula conditional probabilities the propagation thresholds from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought was found the cmip6 datasets were applied to build spi standardized precipitation index and sri standardized runoff index for identifying meteorological and hydrological droughts socioeconomic droughts based on swsdi standardized water supply and demand index were further evaluated by the swat soil and water assessment tool and sd supply and demand models results showed that the integration of the improved pooling and exclusion method and new matching rules would provide accurate and reliable matching among meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic drought events in the future the higher the severity of socioeconomic drought the larger the propagation threshold of meteorological and hydrological droughts the threshold for propagation from meteorological to socioeconomic drought was larger than that for propagation from hydrological to socioeconomic drought in particular radiation forcing significantly increased the propagation threshold between meteorological or hydrological and socioeconomic droughts the framework provides a foundation for drought propagation and even socioeconomic drought prediction keywords drought propagation pooling and excluding matching relationship tolerance mechanism socioeconomic drought cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is caused by the imbalance between supply and demand of water resources due to its usually long duration wide area of influence and frequent occurrence drought is considered as one of the world s top ten natural disasters zhang et al 2022 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 during the period of 1990 2015 alone the frequency of global drought reached 5 7 times year accounting for 5 of the total number of natural disasters and the economic losses were 135 7 billion dollars wang et al 2020 based on causes and impacts droughts can be divided into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts ashok and singh 2010 sun 1994 the meteorological drought in a region refers to the imbalance between supply and demand of precipitation and evaporation there hydrologic drought refers to runoff or groundwater resources being lower than normal agricultural drought refers to water deficit in crops caused by the continuous shortage of soil water which affects the normal growth and development of crops and socioeconomic drought refers to the imbalance of supply and demand within a certain period of time caused by the total amount of water resources that cannot meet domestic demand and production shukla and wood 2008 song et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 there are complex links between different types of droughts with one type of drought causing another over time the transmission of water deficit signals between different types of droughts is called propagation huang et al 2016 this study focuses on three types of droughts meteorological drought refers to insufficient precipitation hydrological drought refers to reduced river runoff and socioeconomic drought refers to the social and economic impacts of imbalances in water supply and demand studying the propagation and matching of drought events is crucial in the context of climate change as it helps inform effective drought management strategies drought research particularly in terms of socioeconomic drought propagation and matching faces several challenges these include the acquisition and quality of data interdisciplinary obstacles complexity of drought propagation mechanisms spatial and temporal scales as well as socioeconomic complexities in general it is necessary to develop more refined models including more accurate event matching relationships and more scientific calculations of propagation thresholds the propagation of drought is deemed vital to comprehend the mechanism of drought creation guo et al 2019 presently studies on drought transmission mainly focus on the propagation between meteorological and hydrological droughts huang et al 2016 barker et al 2016 van loon et al 2012 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 these studies show that the propagation of drought in the hydrological system has the characteristics of aggregation including attenuation hysteresis and extension van loon et al 2012 ma et al 2019 yang et al 2017 studies have also dealt with the change and connection of drought characteristics during the transmission of meteorological drought and hydrological drought these studies mainly investigated into the structure of dependence between meteorological drought and hydrological drought characteristics wong et al 2013 the nonlinear relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought wu et al 2017 and the process of internal transmission wu et al 2018 however the drought threshold received little attention the question is what are the conditions leading to different degrees of drought the propagation process may have a linear or nonlinear relationship van loon and laaha 2015 taking the propagation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought as an example the linear relationship means that a meteorological drought with large water shortage often leads to a serious hydrological drought in the case of non linear relationship a series of mild meteorological droughts may evolve into severe hydrological droughts and the weakening of meteorological droughts may sometimes occur due to the available high water storage in the catchment area wong et al 2013 however studies on drought threshold considered only the linear correlation and ignored the nonlinear correlation of different droughts haslinger et al 2014 huang et al 2017 at present bayesian network bn and copula function are widely used to provide a solution to this problem bayesian network is used for probabilistic analysis in uncertain environments and accurate solutions can be obtained based on incomplete information sperotto et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 copula function is used for multivariate analysis including drought frequency and rainfall frequency considering the dependence between multiple variables liu et al 2021 there are few reports on the although the transmission between distinct drought types plays a crucial role in elucidating the mechanism of drought evolution limited attention has been paid to the mechanism of transmission of meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought zhang et al 2019 before drought threshold can be calculated the key problem is how to match the relationship between drought events guo et al 2020 a method of drought pooling and excluding provides a preliminary solution to this problem tu et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 this method was developed by zelenhasić and salvai 1987 and revised by madsen and rosbjerg 1995 and has since been used in multivalued design this method considers that a major drought event is usually divided into several small drought events that may be interdependent and these small droughts may interfere with or debunk drought frequency analysis so it is necessary to do their pooling and excluding on this basis the drought event matching method was proposed but at present the drought event matching is limited to the matching of meteorological drought and hydrological drought events guo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 and there are no matching rules for socioeconomic drought events because socioeconomic drought is affected by many factors and human activities it is not advisable to directly use the original drought matching therefore it is necessary to propose a matching rule for socioeconomic drought in addition climate change has a significant impact on the water cycle zhang et al 2023 causing changes in water availability by affecting the temporal and spatial distribution of atmospheric water holding capacity which in turn induces more droughts human activities and environmental degradation have caused large scale changes in climate which not only increase the difficulty of drought assessment but also emphasize the need for future drought assessment ipcc 2012 owing to the impact of climate change future meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts will be more severe wang et al 2011 and the law of evolution of future socioeconomic droughts is still in the exploratory stage and calls for further studies in conclusion study of the threshold of propagation of socioeconomic drought in the future and establishing the connection between socioeconomic drought and other types of droughts will help improve the understanding of socioeconomic drought therefore this study takes dongjiang basin as the study area starts with the definition of socioeconomic drought adds tolerance mechanism on the basis of existing drought matching rules and formulates a set of drought matching rules applicable to socioeconomic drought in order to connect meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought at the same time based on the matching results the socioeconomic drought propagation threshold is calculated by the copula function to explore the conditions triggering socioeconomic drought to some extent this study complements the integration of socioeconomic drought prediction and management 2 methods 2 1 selection of index for different drought types the standardized precipitation index spi the standardized runoff index sri and the standardized water supply and demand index swsdi were selected to calculate the conditions of meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought in order to define the threshold of propagation from meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought mckee et al 1993 shukla and wood 2008 wang et al 2022 the selection of spi sri and swsdi in drought research is due to their specific relevance to different stages of drought propagation using these three indices in tandem allows one to effectively study the propagation of a drought event from its initial meteorological stage through the hydrological stage to its ultimate socio economic impact this kind of comprehensive analysis is crucial for understanding drought propagation dynamics and improving our resilience and response strategies the spi has usually been used to describe the degree of precipitation shortage in different periods of time and is applicable to the monitoring and evaluation of droughts and floods on monthly and above time scales wang et al 2015 the sri has been shown to be advantageous for the characterization of hydrological drought the swsdi was a new index to describe socioeconomic drought conditions and its effectiveness has been validated in the dongjiang basin wang et al 2022 spi and sri normalize variables subject to specific distribution for calculation one can refer to literature zhou et al 2021 swsdi is calculated by normalizing the probability density function of water supply qs and water demand qd difference wsdd and converting it into standard normal distribution swsdi was calculated as 1 q wsdd q s q d 2 i swsdi w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w 2 ln p for p 0 5 if p 0 5 then p was replaced by p 1 p and the sign of the resultant swsdi was reversed the constants were c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 within a given watershed qs can be simulated by a variety of hydrological models and qd can be decomposed into in channel water demand qin and off channel water demand qoff the relationship between three variables can be calculated as 3 q d q in q off where qin and qoff were determined in the dongjiang basin tu et al 2015 wang et al 2022 qin 203 m3 s qoff 152 90 m3 s qd 355 90 m3 s it should be noted that these three variables need to be selected according to the actual situation when replacing the basin area 2 2 pooling and excluding of different types of drought events run theory was for identifying drought feature elements tu et al 2019 based on a given threshold t through which the discrete sequence of an index was determined when the index sequence was lower than the set threshold the drought event was identified at this time the abscissa of the corresponding index sequence was called the start time st when the index series was greater than the threshold again the drought event was considered to be over at this time the abscissa of the corresponding index series was called the end time et thus a complete drought event was obtained by the run theory for a drought event the characteristic elements of drought were further identified the length of drought event was called drought duration d which can be represented by d et st the area enclosed by the index sequence and threshold was called drought severity s and the ratio of drought severity to drought duration was called drought intensity i therefore a complete drought event was expressed as event st et d s i a large drought was often divided into several small droughts that may be interdependent if these small droughts were not treated analysis of drought events may not be complete tu et al 2019 guo et al 2018 therefore this paper used the pooling and excluding method of droughts zelenhasić and salvai 1987 madsen and rosbjerg 1995 to merge and eliminate drought events which has been used in multivariate analysis of drought characteristics tu et al 2016 liao et al 2021 however the traditional pooling and excluding method has the problem of omitting drought characteristic elements this study improved the basis of the original method and completed the pooling and excluding process of drought events the method can be divided into two independent parts during pooling two consecutive drought events and the interval event between two drought events were defined as eventi sti eti di si ii eventi 1 sti 1 eti 1 di 1si 1 ii 1 and intervali eti sti 1 d s i based on the duration severity and intensity of drought events and interval events the following three pooling standards were given 4 d i t c 5 s i s i p c s 6 i i i i p c i where tc pc s and pc i are the setting parameters which can be obtained by calculation in general when tc was determined pc s and pc i had the same frequency i e pc s pc i it was used to verify the fusion process but when tc was not determined pc i was used as the condition for selecting tc when two consecutive drought events and interval events met the above three conditions at the same time the two consecutive drought events and interval events were identified as a new drought event and the combined new event was represented by eventpool sti eti 1 dpool spool ipool where the parameters were calculated as 7 s pool s i s i 1 s i 8 d pool d i d i 1 d i 9 i pool s pool d pool where spool is the severity of drought event after fusion dpool is the duration of drought event after fusion and ipool is the intensity of drought event after fusion after the pooling of drought events there were still some drought events with short drought duration and low drought severity which had no impact on the basic attributes of the basin and socioeconomic development and did not interfere with the results of socioeconomic drought threshold therefore the excluding method of drought events was used tallaksen et al 1997 when excluding if the drought event after fusion met any of the following conditions it was considered as an exclusion event 10 d pool r d d p o o l a v e 11 s pool r s s pool ave where rd and rs are two given critical ratios which can be calculated dpool ave and spool ave are the average duration and severity of all drought events after fusion it should be noted that any single drought event has two important characteristics drought duration and drought severity in multivariate analysis of drought event feature elements drought duration and drought severity were equally important therefore the elimination result of drought events was reliable only when rd rs guo et al 2020 so rd rs rds 2 3 matching of meteorological and hydrological events to socioeconomic drought events in order to identify the socioeconomic drought events corresponding to meteorological drought events and hydrological drought events it was necessary to carry out the matching process of drought events before matching the propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was determined first spi and sri 1 12 months of multiple scales and swsdi of monthly scale were calculated and the propagation time was preliminarily determined barker et al 2016 through the correlation coefficient of the three the time scale with the highest correlation coefficient was considered to be the best propagation time the propagation time showed that the socioeconomic drought event was a response to meteorological and hydrological conditions in the past months in terms of mechanism socioeconomic drought was caused by the change of meteorological conditions which affected the change of hydrological conditions and finally led to socioeconomic drought however the basin itself had the ability to regulate some meteorological droughts may not induce hydrological droughts but may promote socioeconomic droughts in addition because the water supply of surface and groundwater systems is affected by management methods some hydrological droughts may not be induced by meteorological droughts thus directly inducing socioeconomic droughts therefore the triggering of socioeconomic drought was divided into three scenarios 1 meteorological drought induced hydrological drought which further led to socioeconomic drought 2 meteorological drought directly induced socioeconomic drought and 3 hydrologic drought directly led to socioeconomic drought for the three triggering conditions of socioeconomic drought this paper made the following matching restrictions for different scenarios to ensure that the drought event matching was reasonable and comprehensive meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic drought events were distinguished by using e1 e2 e3 e1 was represented as a set of all meteorological drought events which can be represented by stu etu du su iu e2 was represented as a set of all meteorological drought events which can be represented by stp etp dp sp ip e3 was represented as a set of all meteorological drought events which can be represented by stq etq dq sq iq 12 scenario 1 st u st q t m et u st p st q t h et p e i e p e q 13 scenario 2 st u st q t m et u st p st q t h st q t h et p e 1 e 3 14 scenario 3 st p st q t m et p st u st q t h st q t h et u e 2 e 3 where th and tm represent the propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought and from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought respectively represents the matching process of drought events different from the propagation process of meteorological drought to hydrological drought socioeconomic drought was affected by many factors such as meteorology topography ecology and human activities the impact of human activities will especially lead to the occurrence of socioeconomic drought events significantly ahead of or behind wang et al 2022 therefore a tolerance mechanism tm was proposed for socioeconomic drought matching based on the original matching mechanism which indirectly advanced or lagged the occurrence time of socioeconomic drought without changing the duration of the original socioeconomic drought event to match meteorological drought and hydrological drought in addition it limited tolerance mechanism to avoid matching drought events that did not belong to the matching process this restriction was based on the severity of drought according to previous studies all types of droughts were divided into four categories according to severity namely light level ll moderate level ml severe level sl and extreme level el drought levels were divided according to the percentile of severity of all drought events el was the last 10 sl was the last 20 ml was the last 40 and other drought events were ll because of the integrity of the matching process s1 did not join the tolerance mechanism that is only when meteorological drought and hydrological drought separately triggered socioeconomic drought the tolerance mechanism was effective the operation mode of tolerance mechanism was as follows 1 match s1 scenarios as shown in formula 12 2 the remaining events after matching in the previous step were used in the matching process of s2 scenario under the role of tolerance mechanism the matching process will be optimized suppose a tolerance error te then the new drought propagation time was defined as t m t m t c and t h t h t e the matching rules were limited to 15 scenario 2 s t u s t q t m

tolerance mechanism the matching process was optimized and limited to 16 scenario 2 s t p s t q t h e t p s t u s t q t h s t q t h e t u e 2 e 3 s t e 2 ll e 2 ll e 3 el after using the socioeconomic drought matching process with tolerance mechanism all meteorological drought events and hydrological drought events that matched socioeconomic drought events were identified and classified at this time each pair contained more than two types of drought events which further obtained the duration severity and intensity of different types of droughts 2 4 drought propagation threshold calculation model based on a bayesian network copula function was used to build a multivariate joint probability distribution based on the dependency between univariate distributions and random variables genest et al 2007 hao and singh 2015 it has been widely used in the analysis of drought recurrence period and frequency liao et al 2021 guo et al 2019 copula function can be expressed as 17 c u v φ 1 x u y v where c u v is the copula function combined with the two random variables φ denotes the convex function and u and v represent the two variables at present the most used copula functions include archimedes copula family and elliptical copula family the former can establish non normal extreme value relationship and can better describe extreme events the latter is representative and easy to construct the calculation of socioeconomic drought threshold was divided into the following steps 1 the marginal distribution functions including normal distribution logarithmic normal distribution log gamma distribution exponential exp distribution generalized pareto gp distribution generalized extreme value gev distribution and weibull wbl distribution were applied to fit the matched duration and severity 2 the archimedean copula family gumbel copula clayton copula and frank copula and the elliptical copula t copula and gaussian copula were used to establish the joint distribution and the fitting was evaluated through the goodness of fit tests including akaike information criteria aic and bayesian information criteria bic 3 the joint probability density function was established and the socioeconomic drought threshold was then calculated based on the joint probability density function the bayesian network was used to estimate the relationship between random variables the bayesian network conditional probability model is a powerful tool in the study of drought propagation as it can help to quantify and represent the uncertainty inherent in this complex process this model can be particularly useful for estimating propagation thresholds in drought research a bayesian network is a graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph dag in the context of drought research the variables could be different indicators of drought such as meteorological drought index hydrological drought index socioeconomic drought index and the edges between them represent the causal relationships the marginal cumulative distribution of the duration set of hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought after matching were assumed as x x1 x2 xn and y y1 y2 yn taking hydrological drought as the condition and socioeconomic drought as the target under the condition of x u the probability of y v was expressed as 18 p y v y u p x u y v p x u 1 x u y v c x u y v 1 x u 1 y v c x u y v 1 x u where x u and y v denote the cumulative probability of x u and y v respectively and c x u y v represents the joint cumulative probability of x u and y v the meteorological drought and hydrological drought characteristic variables were taken as the conditions and the socioeconomic drought boundary characteristic value was taken as the target that is the percentile of intensity the critical values were 10 20 and 40 respectively the conditional probability of socioeconomic drought under meteorological and hydrological drought conditions was then calculated the confidence level of drought propagation threshold was taken as 0 95 which meant that when the conditional probability was equal to or greater than 0 95 the corresponding meteorological and hydrological drought characteristic element values were considered as the propagation threshold of socio economic drought events triggering this level 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the pearl river basin is one the three major basins in china the dongjiang river basin the xijiang river basin the beijiang river basin the hanjiang river basin and the pearl river delta form the pearl river basin the dongjiang basin is located between 21 31 and 26 49 n 102 14 and 115 53 e with a drainage area of 453 690 km2 dongjiang river was one of the main tributaries of the pearl river it flows from jiangxi province to guangdong province from northeast to southwest and finally enters the pearl river delta the river is 562 km long with an average annual runoff of 25 7 billion m3 fig 1 it is an important source of water supply for yunnan guangdong guizhou and hong kong special administrative region hong kong and macao with a total population of nearly 40 million for water supply and per capita water resources of about 800 m2 dongjiang basin was high elevation in the northeast and low in the southwest the average annual precipitation in the basin is 1500 2400 mm from the perspective of spatial distribution it is more in the southwest and less in the northeast the middle and lower reaches of the dongjiang basin are economically developed in 2019 the total gdp of each region in dongjiang supporting region reached 4 17 trillion yuan 3 2 data in this study monthly scale meteorological data were obtained from bcc csm2 mr cmip6 https esgfnode llnl gov search cmip6 future climate scenarios use the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp framework which come from the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps scenarios were used ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 wang et al 2021 the dem and land use into the swat soil and water assessment tool model were obtained from geospatial data clouds https www gscloud cn and landsat satellite remote sensing images https landsat gsfc nasa gov respectively soil properties were from harmonized world soil database hwsd which provided information on soil types soil phases and soil physical and chemical properties at each grid point hydrological data were calculated by the swat model the resolution of meteorological and hydrological data was changed from 1 125 1 121 lifting to 0 5 0 5 by bilinear interpolation method for calculating socioeconomic drought socioeconomic data were obtained from guangdong zhou statistical yearbook 4 results and discussion 4 1 pooling and excluding of different types of drought events before the pooling and excluding of drought events tc pc s pc i and rds were calculated accurate pooling and excluding process would directly affect the extraction and matching of drought events and the calculation of drought threshold variable parameters tc pc s and pc i in the process of pooling and excluding were determined by the parameter sensitivity method ratios of the characteristic values of drought events before and after fusion namely dpool d spool s and ipool i and plot the ratio curve of tc pc s and pc i were determined fig 2 it should be noted that for the same drought event drought duration drought severity and drought intensity had the same value in pc that is pc pc s pc i therefore pc was used as the abscissa to draw the curve as can be seen in fig 2 using the meteorological drought in the ssp1 2 6 scenario as an example fig 2 a when tc changed from 1 to 2 the ratio experienced a significant change however when the slope shifted from tc 2 to tc 3 the increase in the curve s slope wass smaller compared to the previous stage consequently tc was set to 2 months once tc was determined the ratio changed as pc increased if the slope of the ratio significantly decreased or became zero for the first time it indicated that the change in the drought factor was becoming more gradual and the corresponding abscissa was determined as the pooling parameter pc 0 41 after pooling the drought events the drought events were excluded and the parameter rds was determined based on sensitivity analysis from the plot of the mean ratio against rds fig 3 the abscissa of the ratio was determined as the final value of rds when the slope of the ratio first decreased significantly or became zero the fusion and culling parameters for different drought types across all scenarios were compiled in table 1 4 2 matching of meteorological and hydrological drought events with socioeconomic drought events before a meteorological drought event and a hydrological drought event were matched the time of propagation tm and th of the meteorological and hydrological droughts to the socioeconomic drought index sequence was determined first then the triggering time of the socioeconomic drought by the meteorological and hydrological droughts was determined the correlation coefficients of spi sri and swsdi were calculated at multiple time scales under different scenarios fig 4 the maximum correlation coefficient was then taken for the best propagation time from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought and then drought events were matched according to the matching rules the highest correlation is that the scales represent transit times between different drought types the propagation time tm and th was determined by examining the time lag between meteorological and hydrological droughts and the onset of socioeconomic drought as measured by the swsdi it can be seen from fig 4 that under different scenarios the average propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was 8 75 months and the average propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was 7 months which conformed to the drought propagation mechanism with the increase of radiation forcing the transmission time from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought increased but the gap between them shortened which indicated that the high radiation forcing increased the severity of socioeconomic drought the reason was that with the increase of radiation forcing more precipitation and faster water cycle were affected by local temperature which accelerated the process of land surface runoff generation and concentration however due to the influence of underlying surface and river channel runoff cannot be timely and fully used by human activities at the same time high temperature was accompanied by greater water demand and local heat island effect the reduction of water supply and the increase of water demand finally deepened the severity of socioeconomic drought on the basis of defining the propagation time from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought the drought event matching method including tolerance mechanism was used to match the drought events under different scenarios fig 5 the allowable error was 1 month and the drought propagation time varied with the change of radiation intensity as shown in fig 5 in all future scenarios the matching number of s1 was found to be higher than that of s2 and s3 indicating that the development of socioeconomic drought was significantly affected by meteorological and hydrological factors in addition the number of direct matches between meteorological drought and socioeconomic drought was higher than that between hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought with the increase of radiative forcing this number gap became more significant with the increase of radiation forcing the change of meteorological factors had a higher impact on socioeconomic drought than hydrological factors and there may be variability in the future water cycle process 4 3 threshold of propagation from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought after drought event matching copula function was selected to construct the cumulative probability density function and calculate the drought threshold in this paper gamma log exp gp gev and wbl were used to fit the drought duration and drought intensity series of meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic droughts kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse were used to select the best marginal distribution fitting functions k s test is a method based on cumulative distribution function to test whether a sequence distribution conforms to a certain theoretical distribution or to compare whether two sequence distributions are different it is considered to be one of the most reliable and conventional nonparametric methods for comparing two samples the p p plots were drawn according to the relationship between the cumulative scale of variables and the cumulative scale of the specified distribution the graph was used to verify whether the data conformed to the specified distribution when the data conformed to the specified distribution the points in the p p plots were approximately on a straight line therefore the p p plots were selected to analyze the fitting of the original sequence and the theoretical sequence fig 6 and the best fitting marginal distribution function is shown in table 2 it can be seen from fig 6 and table 2 that the optimal fitting distribution of future drought duration and drought severity were wbl and gamma and only log appeared in the optimal fitting distribution of drought duration on this basis the drought duration and drought severity of meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought were combined through archimedes copula family and elliptical copula family according to drought classification droughts were divided into ll ml sl and el in socioeconomic drought the critical probabilities of ml sl and el were 0 6 0 8 and 0 9 respectively based on the best fit marginal distribution the boundary eigenvalues of the above three levels of socioeconomic drought were determined first second the joint distribution of structural meteorological and hydrological droughts and socioeconomic drought characteristics were determined finally taking meteorological hydrological drought characteristics as conditions and taking the boundary eigenvalues of socioeconomic drought of ml sl and el as the target the conditional probabilities of socioeconomic drought of ml sl and el were calculated fig 7 when the conditional probability was equal to or greater than 95 the corresponding meteorological and hydrological drought characteristic element values were considered as the propagation threshold of socioeconomic drought at the same level table 3 it can be seen from fig 7 and table 3 that under ssp1 2 6 the duration threshold for meteorological drought to spread to socioeconomic drought was 9 1 12 42 months while in the ssp3 7 0 the threshold was 5 00 9 70 months the severity threshold for meteorological drought to spread to socioeconomic drought was 5 39 10 67 under ssp1 2 6 while in the ssp3 7 0 the threshold was 5 51 8 37 under ssp2 4 5 scenario the duration and severity of drought from meteorological drought to extreme socioeconomic drought were the highest which were 17 46 months and 13 48 the maximum drought duration and drought severity from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought respectively were 13 65 months and 13 06 under ssp5 8 5 scenario on the whole the drought threshold from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought of different levels was higher than that from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought of different levels in the dongjiang basin with the increase of severity of socioeconomic drought the threshold value of propagation from meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was larger in addition with the increase of radiation forcing the threshold of transmission from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought of different levels was larger and the magnitude of radiation forcing significantly affected the drought transmission process 4 4 discussion first in the process of drought matching a matching rule with tolerance mechanism was proposed this matching method was specified by integrating the definition of socioeconomic drought and the characteristics of dongjiang basin the basin is rich in vegetation and the precipitation in the wet season accounts for more than 80 of the whole year resulting in a short time of runoff generation and convergence in the wet season while a long time in the dry season based on the relationship between the two and different scenarios in the future ae 1 was selected when the method was used in other regions attention was paid to the composition of swsdi and the characteristics of the watershed the allowable error of the watershed with sparse vegetation large runoff and intensive human activities was shortened when ae 0 the tolerance mechanism was invalid but it did not affect the drought matching process results second only the propagation of meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought under natural conditions is considered but for considering reservoirs the matching method with tolerance mechanism also has certain applicability generally speaking the role of the reservoir is to store water and balance the runoff between the wet season and the dry season which will also have a significant impact on the assessment of hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought when the reservoir was considered the number duration and intensity of hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought events decreased and the propagation time increased accordingly which seriously weakened the applicability of the traditional drought propagation time scheme however the method proposed in this paper offset this lag because of the tolerance mechanism finally in the calculation of the threshold of propagation from meteorological hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought all matching results were put into the same combination for consideration which mainly took into account the impact of sample size on the joint probability density function due to the pooling and excluding of drought events the events that can be used to evaluate the propagation threshold were reduced and the sample size of events that met the complete propagation relationship was 30 40 times which seriously affected the construction of the copula function when there were enough socioeconomic drought events the split analysis of different matching rules was further considered 5 conclusions the threshold of propagation and matching rule from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought are s an unavoidable problem in the current socioeconomic drought studies the solution to this problem can effectively guide drought prediction drought prevention and control and drought loss determination especially in areas with scarce data in light of the complexity of definition of socioeconomic drought this research proposed a drought matching rule with tolerance mechanism based on drought fusion and elimination scheme this new proposed drought matching rule calculated the threshold of transmission of meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought of different levels based on bayesian network conditional probability model which further explained the response of socioeconomic drought to meteorological hydrological conditions the findings of this paper can inform drought prediction prevention and control efforts in the dongjiang basin by providing insights into the propagation of meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 the socioeconomic drought matching rule with tolerance mechanism effectively identified the propagation from meteorological drought with water cycle to socioeconomic drought and provided a solution to the socioeconomic drought propagation with incomplete water cycle 2 the threshold of propagation of meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was higher than that of hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought and the difference between the propagation thresholds of drought intensity grew larger with the increase in the severity of socioeconomic drought the propagation threshold of meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought also increased 3 the drought matching results unveiled that the occurrence and development of socioeconomic drought were seriously affected by meteorological hydrological factors with the increase of radiation forcing the change of meteorological factors had a significant impact on socioeconomic drought at the same time with the rise of radiation forcing the propagation threshold from meteorological and hydrological droughts to socioeconomic drought of different levels grew larger besides the magnitude of radiation forcing also significantly affected the drought transmission process author contributions tian wang writing original draft visualization software xinjun tu

transformation cnn lstm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurately predicting the concentration of suspended sediment in rivers holds significant importance given its profound impact on several key areas such as reservoir planning water resource management river environment and ecological restoration sivakumar and jayawardena 2002 2005 khosravi et al 2022 one practical implication of high sediment deposition particularly suspended sediments in a reservoir is a gradual decrease in its storage capacity over time until it reaches the end of its useful life serra et al 2022 huang et al 2021 aytek and kişi 2008 currently three main categories of models have been developed to estimate the concentration of suspended sediment in rivers namely empirical models e g the src process based models and data driven models empirical models are extensively employed to forecast ssc in the initial stages as they establish a quantitative connection between ssc and flow asselman 2000 harrington and harrington 2013 heng and suetsugi 2014 zhang et al 2012 nonetheless empirical models are prone to uncertainty owing to the non linear seasonal and imprecise nature of the input variables despite their ability to estimate ssc to some extent aytek and kişi 2008 wu et al 2008 yang et al 1996 conversely process based models rely on physical processes to elucidate the interplay between runoff and ssc necessitating extensive data and incurring high costs particularly for large watersheds khosravi et al 2022 although process based methods are developed through observations carried out either in the laboratory or in the field and focus on a basic understanding of the physical mechanisms that result in ssc variation and its causes they are possibly unable to provide highly accurate forecasts when applied to specific field sites guillén et al 2002 lee et al 2004 soulsby 1997 tseng and tinoco 2021 a data driven model can be an effective alternative before developing a universal process based model goldstein and coco 2014 in contrast to empirical and process based models data driven models have gained a significant advantage due to their ease of application particularly with the rapid advancement of computer science mehr et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 consequently in the last two decades a plethora of data driven models such as artificial neural network ann adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems anfis radial basis function neural networks rbnn support vector machines svm least square svm lssvm among others have been developed for predicting the flow ssc relationship these models have proven to be more accurate and robust than empirical models adnan et al 2020 afan et al 2015 alp and cigizoglu 2007 kisi 2005 kisi 2008 kisi 2013 kisi and zounemat kermani 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 liu et al 2019 for instance afan et al 2015 trained ann with the daily flow and ssc data collected at rantau panjang station and demonstrated improved accuracy compared to src samantaray et al 2020 employed intelligent models rbnn ann and svm to forecast the daily ssc of salebhata suktel and lant stations located in western odisha india and the results showed that svm performed better than rbnn and ann nevertheless conventional artificial intelligence techniques are limited in their ability to discover the hidden information within natural data on the contrary modern deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks cnns long short term memory lstm and its variants including gated recurrent unit gru and bidirectional lstm bilstm have revolutionized data analysis by effectively capturing underlying patterns in time series data nourani et al 2021 gru simplifies the architecture of lstm by reducing the input gate forget gate and output gate into a single reset and update gate bilstm on the other hand is an extension of lstm that processes the input sequence in both forward and backward directions cnn comprises multiple convolutional layers that use trainable filters to extract feature maps from input images the power of cnns lies in their ability to learn hierarchical representations of visual data automatically thereby reducing the reliance on manual feature engineering and enabling end to end learning lstm is a type of recurrent neural network rnn that effectively addresses the vanishing gradient problem and learns long term dependencies in sequential data the advantage of lstm lies in its ability to capture and retain long term dependencies making it well suited for modeling time series speech recognition and natural language processing lstm can also handle variable length input sequences and is trained end to end using backpropagation through time in contrast to gru lstm has more powerful memory units that can store more information and have more sophisticated control mechanisms such as input gates forget gates and output gates allowing lstm to selectively retain or discard the information moreover lstm s long short term memory units are better equipped for handling long sequences making them more suitable for tasks involving lengthy sequences compared to bilstm lstm has a faster training speed since it processes sequence data in only one direction making it particularly useful for long sequence data furthermore the simpler architecture of lstm facilitates better interpretability thereby enabling a deeper understanding of the model s behavior and decision making in sequential data analysis some studies have demonstrated the potency of lstm in modeling time series data compared to conventional artificial neural networks for instance gao et al 2020 employed lstm and gate recurrent unit gru to simulate the yutan station control basin runoff in southeast china s fujian province and the results indicated that lstm and gru models could automatically filter redundant information thereby enhancing the accuracy of prediction with time steps and ensuring stability similarly kaveh et al 2021 demonstrated that lstm was superior to ffnns and anfiss when they trained an lstm network using daily flow q and ssc time series of schuylkill river to make predictions fang et al 2022 also utilized lstm to model and predict the relationship between rainfall and runoff and showed that lstm was capable of generating reliable predictive results and accurately predicting peak values fang and shao 2022 despite the lstm s ability to extract the autoregressive dependency of time series data it falls short in effectively capturing the seasonality component of time series nourani et al 2021 to address this the integration of machine learning models with data preprocessing technologies has become essential wu et al 2009 ravansalar et al 2017 quilty et al 2019 they facilitate the elimination of extraneous noise components and enables the detection of underlying patterns and structures within the raw time series data nourani et al 2021 li et al 2022 among the various data preprocessing technologies the wavelet based approach has been particularly favoured due to its ability to significantly improve forecast accuracy by leveraging wavelet filters the wt can decompose a time series into sub series leading to a more coherent structure for data driven models shoaib et al 2015 2016 a few previous studies have shown that wt can improve the performance of machine learning models for example nourani et al 2021 employed wt lstm to simulate the daily and monthly runoff sediment processes at three gauging stations in missouri and upper mississippi and found that the proposed model outperformed classical lstm and ann li et al 2022 integrated wt based data preprocessing module with an integrated nonlinear autoregressive network with external input inarx for ssc prediction with the daily flow and water level of the cuntan station in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and observed that the wt could significantly enhance the model s prediction performance however sometimes a single model is not enough to cope with complex tasks such as predicting ssc in an area with complex natural environments and varying climate changes hence ensemble learning models have been developed to be forecast models instead of individual models ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that aims to combine the prediction results of multiple models to obtain more accurate and robust predictions than a single model huang et al 2021 khosravi et al 2022 its main idea is to integrate a group of weak classifiers into a strong classifier by using weighted averaging or voting on the predictions of multiple classifiers to improve prediction accuracy and stability in a study conducted by khosravi et al 2022 four standalone models based on decision trees and four hybridized models were developed and evaluated for flow discharge prediction in talar watershed northern iran the results showed that the hybridized models captured extreme values more accurately compared with the standalone models huang et al 2021 combined different ml algorithms including multi layer perceptions random forest rf svm dnn rnn lstm networks and gru to predict ssc and the combined model is found to be more accurate than standalone models although ensemble learning could provide a more precise accuracy than individual models both input and model uncertainties have an impact on the effectiveness of ensemble learning models making it a challenge to construct an integrated ensemble learning model zuo et al 2020 wang et al 2023 wang et al 2023 have identified several challenges faced by existing ensemble forecasting models these include the need to i improve prediction accuracy to a certain degree ii effectively manage the scope of uncertainty and iii increase the size of the ensemble therefore the present study aims to address the aforementioned challenges by proposing a novel and comprehensive ensemble forecasting method to predict ssc in rivers to the best of the authors knowledge although few studies that have been published on combining deep learning and ensemble learning models as well as data preprocessing techniques barzegar et al 2021 pu et al 2023 there is no studies that have simultaneously combined two deep learning models cnn and lstm and two pre processing data methods wt and mggp for ssc prediction in the yellow river basin barzegar et al 2021 combined dwt with cnn and lstm to predict lake water level demonstrating that the combined model performs better than cnn and lstm similarly in a study conducted by pu et al 2023 dwt combined with cnn and lstm are adopted to forecast short term urban water demand the combined model also give the better prediction performance than single model in their study the cnn and lstm are integrated in the serial mode with the cnn extracting features from input data using spatial convolution operations and the lstm processing the extracted features in a time series different from them this study combined cnn and lstm in the parallel mode in which cnn and lstm process the input simultaneously and generate their respective prediction results in addition in contrast to the straightforward averaging method used in prior researchs huang et al 2021 this article proposes a technique that compares the prediction results of each model to identify the best performing one specifically the authors developed a comprehensive and integrated model called icnn lstm which integrates the wt technique for decomposing the original signal into different sub signals the mggp for filtering redundant sub signals and a combination model of both cnn and lstm in a parallel and loosely coupled manner thus the icnn lstm was applied in this study to predict the ssc at the tangnaihai hydrological station situated on the upper reaches of the yellow river additionally cnn lstm cnn lstm icnn and ilstm models were also used to predict the same daily ssc and their prediction results were compared to those of icnn lstm the study consists of five parts where the second part discusses the methods used in this study the third section describes the study area and statistical results of the study data and the fourth section compares and analyzes the prediction results and performance of all models used in this study and presents further discussions while the fifth part concludes the study 2 methods initially this section describes the concepts of wt and the mggp model for redundant information screening next it presents the cnn the lstm and the cnn lstm combined model then it describes the deep learning approaches of cnn and lstm integrated with wt and mggp followed by the presentation of the integrated cnn lstm icnn lstm model finally the criteria for evaluating model performance are explained 2 1 wt for capturing local features in time series data wt is applied as it can extract frequency domain information of time series data allowing for detailed analysis shoaib et al 2015 2016 wt is an evolution of the fourier transformation that uses a finite length attenuating wavelet base instead of an infinitely long trigonometric function base this method extracts frequency information and time information simultaneously revealing internal laws and discontinuities of non stationary data series jamei et al 2020 wt has two types continuous wt cwt and discrete wt dwt the cwt of a specific time series f t can be represented as a mapping between frequency information and time at various scales as shown below 1 w a b t f t ψ t b a d t where t denotes time ψ represents the wavelet function a means the scale parameter and b represents the location parameter due to the computational complexity of cwt it is frequently substituted by dwt the dwt of f t can be represented as follows 2 w a b d 2 1 2 1 l ψ 2 1 2 m f t d t where l and m are real numbers formula 2 enables the decomposition of the original time series data into two distinct components the approximate component and the detail component the former captures the signal s overall characteristics while the latter represents its local features therefore the resulting output of the dwt applied to the original time series data is expressed as 3 f t a l i 1 l d i where l represents the decomposition level 2 2 mggp mggp an evolutionary variant of gene programing gp leverages an intelligent optimization algorithm in conjunction with the linear combination of a single gene to derive all potential solutions khozani et al 2020 the mggp algorithm adopts the genetic concept of genes and represents it as a tree structure comprising the root internal nodes and leaf nodes as depicted in fig 1 the nodes are connected by mathematical operators which could either be root nodes or internal nodes initially mggp generates a set of genes that can reproduce offspring during reproduction each gene can undergo mutation and crossover crossover allows for the exchange of branches between two genes as illustrated in fig 1 a while mutation involves replacing an internal node or branch of a gene with a predefined random structure as shown in fig 1 b through the linear combination of multiple genes mggp expresses the solution to the problem as follows 4 y i 1 n c i g i c where c represents a constant term ci represents the ith gene weight gi represents the ith gene and n represents the number of last surviving genes the solution produced by mggp is tantamount to the optimal solution of formula 4 which is typically solved using the least square method 2 3 cnn cnn is a prominent deep learning algorithm that utilizes feed forward neural network architecture along with convolution operations and multiple hidden layers kuang and xu 2018 the architecture of a typical cnn consists of input convolution pooling fully connected and output layers lecun et al 1998 as illustrated in fig 2 cnn is inspired by the biological visual system and is characterized by its hidden layers namely convolution and pooling layers the convolution layer performs feature extraction using the convolution kernel with parameter sharing while the pooling layer conducts dimensionality reduction and extracts significant features the fully connected layer fits and abstracts all the features and finally the output layer produces the prediction results the convolution layer of a cnn applies a convolution operation to the input image using a convolution kernel which is then further adjusted by an activation function before being passed to the next layer mathematically the operation of the convolution layer can be represented as follows 5 x j n f i m j x j n 1 k ij n b j n where x j l denotes the j th output of the n th layer m j denotes the input image k ij n k ij n represents the connection weight between the i th input and the j th output of the n th layer represents the convolution operator f represents the activation function and b j n indicates deviation the primary function of the pooling layer in cnn is to optimize its structure and reduce the parameter space by applying averaging or maximization operations on a square array of input images with the array s size usually being smaller than that of the convolution kernel fig 2 displays four units of such square arrays the pooling layer can be mathematically represented as follows 6 x j n f β j n d o w n x j n 1 b j n where down represents the maximum pooling function the fully connected layer takes the output of the pooling layer as its input and conducts calculations involving all the neurons in the layer mathematically the calculation formula for the fully connected layer can be expressed as follows 7 x n f k n x n 1 b n where k n represents the weight between the n 1 th layer and the n th layer x n represents the output vector and x n 1 represents the input vector 2 4 lstm the lstm model is an important improvement on the recurrent neural network rnn model the core of the lstm lies in its ability to track information over a longer period of time via its clever controllable self loops to generate paths that allow gradients to flow continuously for a long time which makes it particularly suitable for processing tasks related to time series bengio et al 1994 furthermore lstm addresses the issue of long term dependency in recurrent neural networks by introducing a gate mechanism to regulate the retention and discard of features gers et al 1999 the lstm cell as illustrated in fig 3 has a complex recurrent structure that comprises a hidden state h t and a cell state c t capable of retaining long term memory the state information of each lstm unit flows sequentially from left to right with time the lstm model can dynamically regulate information updates in the cell state the forget gate f t manages the input x t and the preceding hidden state h t 1 connection to the cell state c t allowing it to determine whether to forget x t and h t 1 depending on the context the input gate i t and î t determine whether to pass the x t and the preceding hidden state h t 1 processed by the activation function to the cell state c t the output gate o t controls whether to send the processed x t and the preceding hidden state h t 1 of the previous step to the hidden state h t the entire process can be expressed as follows 8 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 9 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 10 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 11 i t tanh w i h t 1 x t b i 12 c t f t c t 1 i t i t 13 h t o t tanh c t 1 where σ represents the activation function w represents the weight matrix b represents bias and tanh represents the hyperbolic tangent function the intricate structure of lstm demonstrates its capability to precisely regulate the information and state flow within each gate of the cell additionally lstm exhibits the ability to handle input and output data vectors of various lengths making it highly adaptable for integration with other models 2 5 cnn lstm the cnn and lstm models exhibit distinct features in their internal data processing specifically the cnn model is adept at capturing local relevant features in input data through convolutional kernels but due to the filter size limitation it cannot effectively learn the temporal dependencies within sequential data lin et al 2022 in contrast lstm an advanced version of the rnn controls the data flow within the cell through the incorporation of a gate mechanism enabling it to perform short and long term memory functions and capture the temporal dependencies of sequential data however the cnn model outperforms lstm in capturing significant spatial features the effectiveness of cnn in capturing spatial features is attributed to its distinctive architecture which comprises convolutional and pooling layers convolutional layers employ learnable filters to extract spatial features from input images by convolving over the image pixels subsequently pooling layers are used to downsample the extracted features and preserve the essential information through stacking multiple convolutional and pooling layers cnn can learn intricate hierarchical representations of images that capture essential spatial features including edges textures shapes and patterns consequently the combination of both models can complement their respective strengths and enhance the accuracy of the prediction model zang et al 2020 the combination of cnn and lstm can be achieved either in a serial or parallel mode in the serial mode the cnn model processes the input data and extracts features through spatial convolution operations subsequently the lstm model processes the features extracted by the cnn model in time series in the parallel mode both cnn and lstm models process the input simultaneously and generate their respective prediction results which are then combined through a specific strategy this study utilizes a parallel approach to combine cnn and lstm models as depicted in fig 4 initially input vectors are fed into the cnn and lstm models to obtain individual prediction results the final prediction result is then determined by merging the results from both models in contrast to prior studies that employed a simplistic averaging approach huang e al 2021 this article presents a novel technique that involves an exhaustive comparison of the prediction outputs of every sample in the test period for each model thereby enabling the identification of the optimal performing model for each sample specifically the proposed approach entails a comparison of the predicted values of every sample in the predicted output vector of both the cnn and lstm models with the superior prediction serving as the final result thus for each of the 365 days in a year the best forecasting model either cnn or lstm in this study is selected this integration strategy ensures that the combined model consistently outperforms each model within the merged framework thereby enhancing the overall predictive performance of the 365 day forecast 2 6 icnn ilstm icnn lstm for enhancing the predictive accuracy of the deep learning models cnn lstm and the combined model cnn lstm this study employs wt and mggp to preprocess the input vector data the models which include preprocessing data modules are referred to as icnn ilstm and icnn lstm the comprehensive integrated model icnn lstm comprises three stages as depicted in fig 5 firstly the input signal is decomposed into an approximate signal a and a detail signal d using dwt if the input vector comprises k variables then dwt decomposes the signal into k k l sub signals which consist of k approximate signals and k l detail signals where l is the decomposition level li et al 2022 nevertheless not all of the k l detail signals are suitable for the prediction model s training khan et al 2020 the second step involves inputting k l detail signals into mggp to eliminate superfluous detail information to enhance the model s prediction performance while minimizing its complexity mggp utilizes multi objective optimization technology based on genetic algorithms to determine the optimal solution in contrast to single objective optimization which compares solutions based on a single fitness value multi objective optimization incorporates more than one target value given that it is not reasonable to assess the model s performance using only one target value the non dominated sorting method is a frequently utilized approach in comparing the benefits and drawbacks of solutions in multi objective optimization algorithms khozani et al 2020 within a given population a distinct set of solutions exists where no other individual solution outperforms it this collection of solutions is referred to as the pareto front pf and its mapping to the target space is achieved in mggp the mggp method employs a linear combination of multiple single genes to represent the solution to the problem consequently the mggp solution provides both the pf and the optimal expression of the multiple genes in the pf the method also documents the contribution of each gene to the overall expression contribution weight the gene sets with higher weights are the detailed information from the screening process and are utilized in training the deep learning models thirdly the approximate information of the original data series obtained by wt and part of the detailed information having a strong correlation with the target variable obtained by mggp are used as input vectors to train the integrated deep learning models cnn lstm and cnn lstm and make final predictions 2 7 performance evaluation criteria all evaluation metrics of the prediction models include the

the closer to zero the better 3 case study the tangnaihai hydrological station which is managed by the yellow river water conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources of china is a crucial monitoring station that records hydrological changes in the mainstream of the yellow river above tangnaihai provides essential information for the development and utilization of the yellow river s water resources flood control and drought relief water regulation and national economic construction and hence is used as the case study of this paper see fig 6 the daily series data of discharge and ssc of the tangnaihai hydrological station located in the upper reaches of the yellow river at latitude 35 30 50 and longitude 100 09 38 are used tangnaihai hydrological station was established in august 1955 and is situated in tangnaihai township xinghai county qinghai province it serves as a critical control station for the upper reaches of the yellow river and is the inflow control station of longyangxia reservoir the drainage area of the station is 121 972 square kilometers and the river length above the controlled section is 1 553 km accounting for 28 4 of the yellow river it is situated 3 911 km away from the estuary and 300 km from xining the capital of qinghai province as of 2005 the annual average flow of tangnaihai station is 20 04 billion m3 representing 34 2 of the yellow river s water volume the maximum annual net flow is 32 8 billion m3 and the minimum net flow is 105 8 m3 the period between june and october accounts for approximately 70 of the annual net flow the highest recorded water level is 2520 38 m and the lowest is 2512 38 m the daily discharge and sediment concentration data recorded at tangnaihai hydrological station were obtained from the national science technology infrastructure national earth system science data center website to train the model the daily data from january 1 1977 to december 31 1985 were utilized while the data from january 1 1986 to december 31 1986 were used for testing the statistical characteristics of discharge and sediment concentration of the hydrological station can be seen in table 1 where sd cv and csx denote standard deviation coefficient of variation and skewness respectively 4 application and discussion firstly the cnn lstm and cnn lstm models were trained and tested by using the flow and ssc time series data of tangnaihai hydrological station and their prediction performances were compared and analyzed before training the auto correlation function acf and partial auto correlation function pacf were utilized to ascertain the optimal input vector secondly models icnn ilstm and icnn lstm embedded with wt and mggp were applied to improve the prediction accuracy of ssc 4 1 cnn lstm and cnn lstm 4 1 1 selection of input vector for ensuring the optimal predictive performance of each model it is imperative to identify input vectors that are most likely to produce the best predicted results to achieve this the determination of the time lag of the input data vector is critical in this study the auto correlation function acf and partial auto correlation function pacf were utilized to analyze the periodicity and auto correlation of time series data which facilitates the selection of the time lag of series data sudheer et al 2002 fig 7 illustrates the correlation analysis and partial correlation analysis diagram of the ssc time series data fig 7 a demonstrates the annual periodicity of the ssc data series fig 7 b reveals that the maximum time lag of the input vector for predicting ssc is four steps where the time series itself has the strongest correlation with those having a one step lag in addition the sliding window method is used as an effective supplement to determine the input vector as employed in the study of moosavi et al 2013 the initial input vector encompasses the data of a one step time lag and the step is gradually adjusted to a specific value which is determined at 4 by pacf in this paper according to the flow and ssc data of different time lag steps a total of 26 different input vectors are identified in this paper as shown in table 2 the i3 input vector in the table includes the current flow qt and the previous day s suspended sediment concentration ssct 1 i4 contains the previous day s flow qt 1 and the suspended sediment concentration ssct 1 and so on 4 1 2 model applications the cnn model is characterized by its ability to extract high dimensional abstract data features through spatial convolution on input data it can serve as either a pre processing technology or a stand alone predictive model however because the convolution operation of cnn is executed in three dimensional space it is necessary to reshape the one dimensional input vector into a three dimensional vector before inputting it into the cnn model for optimizing the cnn model several parameters need to be defined prior to training including the maximum training step size the number of iterations per step size the size and number of convolution kernels and the selection of optimizer these parameters were determined through a trial and error process and their final values are outlined in table 3 taking the search for the optimal value of the maxepochs parameter as an example a parameter range of 10 to 100 was set starting from 10 the model was trained and the process was repeated by incrementing the value by 1 each time it was observed that the model s predictive performance did not improve beyond a value of 30 hence the parameter was fixed at 30 deep learning utilizes various optimization algorithms including adam sgd and others in contrast to the gradient descent algorithm employed in traditional neural networks through experimentation the optimizer adam was found to be superior to other algorithms in optimizing the training process which is also adopted in a study conducted by adaryani et al 2022 in the case of the lstm model the primary parameters to be configured include the maximum training step size number of iterations per step size choice of the optimizer number of hidden layer cells and dropout probability of the dropoutlayer from experimentation it was determined that the hidden layer with five neurons yielded optimal prediction results additionally to prevent overfitting during training the dropout probability of the dropoutlayer should be set for lstm this layer allows the network to halt the work of a particular number of random neurons during weight updates by setting a specific probability the dropout probability for lstm was set to 0 15 and other parameters are presented in table 4 for the cnn lstm model which is a parallel combination of cnn and lstm its parameters align with those of cnn and lstm to facilitate a comparative analysis of model performance the prediction performance indicators of cnn lstm and cnn lstm are presented in tables 5 6 and 7 respectively for cnn the performance of the model using only the current day s flow or the previous day s ssc as input vectors falls short with nsc values of 0 2265 and 0 3646 respectively both much lower than the satisfactory threshold of 0 75 however when combining the flow of the current day and the ssc of the previous day as in input vector i3 the model s prediction performance is significantly improved with an nsc value of 0 6651 notably the ssc of the current day is highly dependent on the ssc value of the previous day and the flow of the current day both of which are essential factors by using the sliding window method various flow and ssc input vector combinations with different time steps are designed such as i4 to i8 the comparison of their prediction results reveals that input vectors with a one time lag step such as i3 i8 i16 and i18 can produce satisfactory predictions while those without a one time lag step such as i5 i6 i7 i11 i12 and i13 perform poorly this finding is consistent with the correlation analysis results as shown in fig 7 the correlation between the ssc data sequence with one time lag step and the data sequence itself is close to 0 9 much higher than those with 2 4 time lag steps about 0 2 moreover comparing the prediction results of i4 i8 i9 and i10 it is observed that the input vector i9 with one and three time lag steps produces better results than the other three indicating that the window sliding method can be effectively combined with correlation analysis to identify better input vectors in addition the input vectors i4 i8 to i10 i14 to i16 and i18 are supplemented with the flow of the current day to construct new input vectors i19 to i26 these input vectors show an improved prediction performance highlighting the significance of the current day s flow in ssc prediction among all input vectors i19 which includes the current day flow previous day flow and previous day ssc exhibits the most optimal prediction performance in contrast i3 comprising the current day flow and previous day ssc ranks second in terms of predictive performance in contrast to cnn lstm exhibits a higher level of overall prediction performance the comparison of the 26 input vectors prediction results indicates a similar trend as that observed in cnn nevertheless lstm outperforms cnn to a certain extent when dealing with input vectors with relatively good prediction results such as i19 whose nsc is 0 8212 representing a 4 5 increase compared to cnn moreover lstm significantly improves performance in cases where the input vectors have poor prediction results such as i2 whose nsc is 0 7259 a 99 improvement over cnn s nsc of 0 3646 according to adaryani et al 2022 cnn has demonstrated noteworthy performance in image captioning applications and manifests comparatively reduced susceptibility towards time dependent modelling variations relative to lstm networks in terms of cnn lstm the impact of input vector selection on prediction results is similar to that of cnn and lstm as it is the combined outcome of the parallel prediction of the two models as a strategy is employed to identify the most accurate prediction result it is ensured that the combined model performs better than the stand alone models as presented in table 7 the optimal input vector for cnn lstm is also i19 which yields an nsc of 0 8630 marking an 18 89 increase from the 0 7259 obtained by lstm fig 8 a and b depict the optimal predicted and observed values of cnn lstm and cnn lstm for all input vectors in the training and testing phases respectively as shown in fig 8 a the highest peak value in the training phase is underestimated while the estimated values are close to the peak value in the testing phase moreover from fig 8 b it is apparent that the daily series data of ssc predicted by the three models in the testing phase are consistent with the actual observed values but all produce slightly higher predictions for the peak value comparatively the predicted value of cnn lstm is the closest to the actual peak value but there is still room for improvement in prediction performance in comparison to lstm the combined model namely cnn lstm offers the advantage of simultaneously capturing spatial and temporal information the presence of convolutional layers in the cnn lstm allows it to handle time series data that exhibit strong spatial correlations such as geophysical and meteorological data more effectively moreover the cnn lstm model contains fewer parameters than pure lstm models which results in reduced computational resources required during training thereby accelerating training and mitigating over fitting risks according to wang et al 2023 the advantages of ensemble forecasting over single deterministic forecasts have been well established for medium and long term forecasting as it provides a collection of plausible solutions instead of a single deterministic forecast ensemble forecasting results in increased consistency and reliability of the actual probability distribution of forecasts xu et al 2020 moreover ensemble forecasting results can be utilized to derive single value deterministic forecasts by combining multiple forecasting methods which demonstrates superior performance compared to single model simulations troin et al 2021 4 2 icnn ilstm and icnn lstm 4 2 1 wavelet function and decomposition level the initial step in developing the proposed icnn lstm model involves the wavelet decomposition of the daily sequence data of the original flow and ssc to accomplish this it is necessary to choose an appropriate wavelet function and determine its support length and vanishing moment the support length and vanishing moment are closely linked and higher vanishing moments are accompanied by longer support lengths however excessive support length may result in border problems while inadequate support length may have an adverse effect on the concentration of signal energy shoaib et al 2015 2016 as a result striking a balance between the support length and the vanishing moment is essential this study utilizes four commonly used wavelets namely daubechies wavelet symlets wavelet coiflets wavelet and discrete meyer approximate wavelet denoted as db sym coif and dmey respectively as decomposition tools for the original sequence signal to enhance the prediction performance wavelet functions with different vanishing moments are selected for each wavelet with adjustable support lengths and vanishing moments specifically dbn and symn correspond to db and sym functions with a support length of 2n 1 and a vanishing moment of n while coifn corresponds to a coif function with a support length of 6n 1 and a vanishing moment of n the support length determines the filter length of the wavelet which influences the local feature extraction of the wavelet decomposition whereas the vanishing moment affects the information expression of the wavelet mother function for instance sym6 represents a six degree polynomial that encodes the decomposition process of the original data series with constants and sub signals of degrees 1 to 5 unlike db sym and coif dmey does not have compact support and bioorthogonality which may significantly impact the results of the wavelet decomposition in addition to the support length and vanishing moment the wavelet decomposition level is another crucial factor that may directly influence the model performance assuming a decomposition level of 4 the wavelet decomposition process in this study involved decomposing the original signal a0 into a1 and d1 a1 into a2 and d2 a2 into a3 and d3 and a3 into a4 and d4 as illustrated in fig 9 the final signal set comprised all the nodes on the leaves including a4 d4 d3 d2 and d1 where a represents the approximate signal and d represents the detail signal the subscript n in dn denotes the time span for capturing the features of the original data sequence by the wavelet function such as d3 captures the features of the original data signal for 23 days the decomposition level which can be calculated using the empirical formula l int log n given by kisi and shiri 2011 is positively correlated with the model s prediction performance graf et al 2019 therefore the wavelet transformation wt should decompose the original data at the maximum level and for the current study the sequence length is 3652 and l int log 3652 11 figs 10 and 11 depict all the db6 wavelet decomposition sub signals of the current day flow and the previous day ssc when l equals 11 4 2 2 detail screening to perform wavelet decomposition at l 11 each input variable is decomposed into an approximate signal a11 and detail signals d1 to d11 while these detailed signals provide sufficient information for prediction there may be redundant information that could compromise the prediction accuracy to address this issue it is necessary to screen the detailed signals to exclude information that is not relevant to the prediction outcome one approach is to conduct a correlation analysis between each detailed signal and the original signal to eliminate detailed information with low correlation khan et al 2020 however mggp an evolutionary version of gp can intelligently perform similar tasks to principal component analysis li et al 2022 this study utilizes mggp to eliminate detailed signals that are unfavorable to the prediction results the detailed signals from the wavelet decomposition results of each variable in the input vector are input into mggp and the key parameters are presented in table 8 upon completion of the mggp algorithm a pareto front is generated which contains the optimal solution marked by green dots in fig 11 to obtain the optimal prediction expression mggp takes into account both the complexity of each expression in the pareto front and the r2 performance indicator resulting in the selection of an optimal expression represented by a green dot in the red circle in fig 12 this expression includes six genes that are associated with detailed information and their corresponding contribution weight to the prediction result as depicted in fig 13 by examining the contribution weight one can identify the detailed information that is most beneficial for prediction and then input it into a specific model for instance gene 4 in fig 13 has a significantly lower contribution weight than the other five genes which implies that it may be redundant information and can be excluded 4 2 3 ssc prediction the wavelet transformed and mggp screened signals are employed as inputs to the icnn ilstm and icnn lstm models for the purpose of predicting the ssc to ensure comparability the parameters of these models are kept consistent with those of the cnn lstm and cnn lstm models in section 4 1 moreover the input vector i19 is utilized for all wavelet decompositions as cnn lstm and cnn lstm demonstrate the most precise prediction performance on this vector table 10 presents the predicted outcomes for various wavelet functions the wavelet functions and their corresponding vanishing moments that produce satisfactory prediction results for icnn are the db function with vanishing moments of 2 and 8 while the db function with a vanishing moment of 4 performs relatively poorly however the db function with a vanishing moment of 6 yields the most accurate prediction results the sym wavelet functions with vanishing moments of 2 4 6 and 8 all generate satisfactory prediction results with nsc values higher than that of cnn and the sym4 function performs exceptionally well with an nsc value of 0 8943 on the other hand the coif function with vanishing moments of 2 3 and 5 do not significantly improve the prediction performance and only the coif function with a vanishing moment of 4 produces satisfactory prediction results with an nsc value of 0 8632 the dmey wavelet function produces relatively good prediction results with an nsc value of 0 8295 higher than that of cnn these findings suggest that wavelet function decomposition can enhance the prediction performance of the cnn model but the choice of the appropriate wavelet function and the vanishing moment is crucial in the case of the ilstm model all the considered wavelet functions have produced satisfactory prediction results with even db2 and sym2 the two functions with the poorest predictions demonstrating nsc values as high as 0 8686 and 0 8679 respectively sym8 on the other hand produced the highest nsc value of 0 9490 regarding the icnn lstm model which combines icnn and ilstm in parallel and utilizes a comparison strategy to determine the best performance its prediction results have consistently outperformed those of icnn and ilstm table 10 indicates that even the poorly performing wavelet functions db4 and coif3 still managed to attain high nsc values of 0 9043 and 0 9090 respectively while sym6 with the best prediction results achieved an nsc value as high as 0 9675 it can be seen that for icnn and ilstm the predictive performance of using sym wavelet functions is superior to that of dmey db and coif wavelets the possible reason is that sym is particularly useful for analyzing power system transients because of its ability to capture both high frequency and low frequency components of the signal it should be noted that the impact of wavelet decomposition basis functions on various models is non uniform and there is no standard to ascertain which specific wavelet basis function is optimal for a given prediction model extensive empirical research is required to establish potential patterns in this regard as an example li et al 2022 found that the adoption of coif3 resulted in greater accuracy than other wavelet basis functions including sym db and dmey this finding contrasts with the results obtained in the present study and earlier research attributable to the adoption of different forecast models to further assess the effectiveness of the deep learning approach this study employed two alternative models the empirical model src and the shallow neural network ann for predicting ssc src is an empirical model that uses the exponential function s aq b where a and b are coefficients to establish the relationship between flow and ssc by fitting this function to the training data we obtained the coefficients a 3 10 5 and b 1 38 however the nsc value of src in the test phase was only 0 4036 which falls considerably short of the satisfactory threshold of 0 75 ann on the other hand is a widely used traditional neural network in hydrology it consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer and its parameters see table 9 are determined through trial and error to compare its performance to that of the models used in this study the input data for ann was also i19 and the training results are presented in table 10 although the nsc value in the test phase increased to 0 6321 which is better than src it still fails to meet the ideal value of 0 75 in the table the red and bold content indicates the optimal prediction result of a specific model based on the same wavelet basis function to provide a more understandable comparison of the prediction performance of each model fig 14 is used to display the performance indicators of each model in the testing phase in the form of a histogram the figure shows that src yields the poorest prediction performance while icnn lstm demonstrates the best the descending order of the remaining models based on prediction performance is ann cnn lstm cnn lstm icnn and ilstm the r2 and nsc indicators increase gradually indicating a higher degree of fitting while the rmse value decreases gradually suggesting a reduced prediction error furthermore two points should be noted first the cnn lstm and icnn lstm models outperform each standalone model second the icnn ilstm and icnn lstm models utilizing wavelet decomposition and mggp screening exhibit superior accuracy than their corresponding cnn lstm and cnn lstm models in order to visually compare the prediction performance of each model fig 15 displays the box plots of the observed and predicted values of ssc for each model the median is represented by the circle in the box the upper and lower edges of the box represent the 3 4 quantile and 1 4 quantile respectively and the short horizontal line above and below the box represents the maximum and minimum values respectively the box plot of icnn lstm and cnn lstm is found to be the most similar to the box plot of the observed ssc data indicating that both icnn lstm and cnn lstm model has the higher accuracy than other models which demenstrate that ensemble learning is promising forecast tool it is important to note that the predicted data range of cnn and icnn is significantly narrower than the observed data range of ssc this implies that after spatial convolution cnn fails to predict the peak and minimum values of the original ssc data series as shown in fig 7 however this issue is not observed in the cnn lstm and icnn lstm models due to their comparative strategy for selecting the best results fig 16 presents scatter plots comparing the observed and predicted ssc values of each model the sub graphs a and b c and d and e and f indicate that the fitting degree of the observed and predicted values of icnn b ilstm d and icnn lstm f is superior to the other models in particular the icnn lstm f plot shows a high degree of agreement between the predicted and observed values with the center line being closely surrounded by the points conversely src g and ann h exhibit poor fitting and tend to underestimate relatively high ssc values to evaluate the icnn lstm model s prediction accuracy for the peak value fig 17 presents an enlarged comparison of the predicted and observed ssc values for the three peak periods during the testing stage the results indicate that the icnn lstm model has accurately predicted almost all peaks demonstrating the model s power and stability additionally fig 18 presents the error histograms of the three peak periods selected in the test phase which demonstrate that the errors of the three peak periods follow a normal distribution further validating the accuracy of the icnn lstm model proposed in this study ultimately it is crucial to provide a comprehensive explanation for why deep learning models are superior to traditional models and why incorporating pre processing data technology leads to more accurate predictions clearly firstly due to the capability of deep learning models to handle multiple hidden layers they can deeply explore the potential patterns and information hidden within the time series leading to significantly improved prediction performance over traditional neural network models specifically as a type of nonlinear dynamic system convolutional neural networks achieve a comprehensive representation of time series data by capturing the time relationships that change over time and minimizing the time dependent structure compared to rnns long short term memory introduces storage units that maintain previous state information and gating units that control information flow between different units thus addressing the inherent problem of gradient vanishing and explosion in rnn secondly data preprocessing techniques can significantly improve model prediction performance which has been reported in a tremendous amount of previous studies khan et al 2020 li et al 2022 liu et al 2013 nourani and behfar 2021 shoaib et al 2015 shoaib et al 2016 wang et al 2023 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 zuo et al 2020 and could be attributed to two main reasons i the wavelet transformation method divides the signal into relevant periods and extracts sub signals that exhibit a significant correlation with the model output through artificial intelligence based optimization techniques such as mggp ii applying wavelet transformation facilitates the identification of several periods as sub signals choosing the most prominent sub signals to represent the time series as inputs for ai models helps eliminate redundancy and minimize uncertainty associated with the model s output 4 3 discussion accurately predicting the ssc in rivers is of paramount importance the src which establishes a linear relationship between flow and ssc is incapable of quantifying the intricate nonlinear and non stationary connections between these variables especially under complex hydrological conditions however with the recent advancements in data driven machine learning a suite of robust models has been developed to achieve highly accurate predictions of suspended sediment concentration by adeptly capturing the nonlinear features of time series data liu et al 2013 while the traditional neural network represented by ann has been extensively applied in the prediction of various hydrological processes such as rainfall runoff relationships aqil et al 2007 awchi 2014 river runoff amisigo et al 2008 carcano et al 2008 water quality parameters choi and park 2001 lin et al 2008 evaporation rates kisi 2006 kisi 2008 and ssc kisi 2005 kişi 2010 kisi and zounemat kermani 2016 an area of current research emphasis pertains to deep learning networks particularly lstm and its various integrated applications in contrast to conventional neural networks deep learning techniques such as cnn and lstm are well suited to identifying underlying patterns in data and capturing complex temporal dependencies nevertheless these models have limitations in effectively capturing the seasonality component of time series which is a critical factor in hydrological processes consequently the integration of machine learning models with data preprocessing technologies such as wt has become an essential area of research wu et al 2009 ravansalar et al 2017 quilty et al 2019 in addition given the stochastic nature of hydrological variables and associated uncertainties a single model may sometimes prove insufficient leading to the adoption of integrated models as a promising alternative therefore the present study introduces a comprehensive ensemble model icnn lstm which integrates cutting edge machine learning techniques including wavelet preprocessing deep learning and ensemble learning thereby enriching the research outcomes pertaining to machine learning prediction applications great prediction performance of the icnn lstm model could be attributed to its three key features firstly the acf and pacf were utilized to analyze the periodicity and auto correlation of time series which facilitates the selection of the time lag of the predictors secondly the cnn and lstm models are loosely coupled in parallel which allows for mutual reinforcement and leverage of their respective strengths in improving the accuracy of ssc prediction thirdly the model integrates the wt for decomposing the original signal to sub signals and the mggp for eliminating the uncorrelated sub signals to remove noise and detects hidden information in the original data series the cnn lstm hybrid outperforms both cnn and lstm models exhibiting a nearly 89 improvement in nsc value compared to src in the test phase deep learning models embedded with wt such as icnn ilstm and icnn lstm show significantly higher nsc values than cnn lstm and cnn lstm models in the test phase with improvements of 13 8 5 7 and 12 1 respectively the conglomeration of individual models has been shown to be advantageous in overcoming their limitations leading to improved outcomes huang et al 2021 khosravi et al 2022 graf et al 2019 khan et al 2020 the efficacy of wavelet decomposition in time series simulations is confirmed by the study consistent with the findings of liu et al 2013 jamei et al 2020 and li et al 2022 to summarize the proposed icnn lstm framework is a reliable approach for real time forecasting notwithstanding the widespread application of dwt based models in hydrological studies li et al 2021 graf et al 2019 shoaib et al 2015 their practical use must be approached with care improper utilization of dwt can result in errors as noted by barzegar et al 2021 key considerations for developing dwt models include the judicious selection of decomposition levels and wavelet filters appropriate partitioning of calibration and validation data and the incorporation of future information while the first two aspects can be resolved by trial and error or by following established guidelines the inclusion of future information presents a limitation of dwt models that requires a more robust approach to minimize errors one promising alternative is the use of maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt li et al 2022 barzegar et al 2021 quilty and adamowski 2018 5 conclusion drawing upon two of the most popular research areas in machine learning namely deep learning and ensemble learning the present study introduces a comprehensive ensemble model namely icnn lstm the workflow of the proposed model comprises three steps 1 performing wavelet decomposition on the original data series to extract both the overall approximation and detailed information 2 screening the detailed information obtained from the wavelet decomposition using mggp to remove redundancies and 3 utilizing the filtered and decomposed signals to train and evaluate the cnn lstm model for obtaining the final prediction outcomes the performance of the icnn lstm model is evaluated using the daily flow and ssc data from the tangnaihai hydrological station in the upper reaches of the yellow river and compared with other models such as src ann cnn lstm cnn lstm icnn and ilstm the simplistic structure of src renders it incapable of representing the intricate nonlinear relationship between flow and ssc and hence exhibits a substandard performance although the shallow neural network ann delivers an acceptable prediction performance with an nsc value of 0 6321 it still falls short of a satisfactory prediction result nsc value of 0 75 cnn performs better than ann with an nsc value of 0 7859 which is deemed satisfactory however this value is still lower than that of lstm which exhibits an nsc value of 0 8212 the predictive performance of cnn lstm is further improved with an nsc value of 0 8630 surpassing both cnn and lstm this improvement is attributed to the utilization of a relatively superior merging strategy in the model which consistently outperforms all individual models incorporated in the ensemble in comparison to cnn lstm and cnn lstm the integration of wt and mggp screening modules has led to improved prediction performance in models such as icnn ilstm and icnn lstm icnn for instance has exhibited a 13 8 increase in nsc value reaching 0 8943 as opposed to cnn s 0 7859 similarly icnn lstm has displayed a 12 1 improvement in nsc value achieving 0 9675 compared to cnn lstm s 0 8630 the use of four different wavelet basis functions and different vanishing moments for each model has been investigated the findings indicate that the selection of wavelet basis function and vanishing moment significantly influences the prediction results for instance the sym wavelet basis function with a vanishing moment of 6 has resulted in the least accurate prediction for icnn lstm while the db with 4 has led to the most accurate prediction the icnn lstm owing to its distinct architecture that entails data decomposition and details scaling offers enhanced modeling robustness and adaptability this renders it a dependable alternative for achieving more precise predictions of river ssc and contributes to the advancement of hydrological forecasting theories furthermore the proposed ensemble learning approach offers valuable insights for forecasting other hydrological events such as

1724,the precise prediction of suspended sediment concentration ssc is of great importance for river reservoir construction planning water resource management and ecological environment restoration this research aims to improve ssc prediction accuracy by constructing a comprehensive and integrated deep learning model wavelet mggp cnn lstm icnn lstm combining wavelet transformation wt multi gene genetic programming mggp convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm simultaneously in icnn lstm the wt decomposes the signal and extracts time and frequency domain information while the mggp filters out redundant information then the cnn and lstm are integrated in a parallel and loosely coupled manner to form an initial combined model cnn lstm cnn combined with lstm to process filtered information by wt and mggp furthermore this study compares the performance of icnn lstm with cnn lstm cnn lstm icnn cnn embedded with wt and mggp ilstm lstm embedded with wt and mggp artificial neural network ann and the traditional sediment rating curve src the evaluation of prediction accuracy for all models was conducted using root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute error mae as performance indicators the daily discharge and suspended sediment concentration series data from tangnaihai hydrological station in the upper reaches of the yellow river spanning from 1977 to 1987 were selected to train and test the models results show that first deep learning networks such as cnn and lstm outperform the shallow neural network ann with lstm providing higher accuracy than cnn second the cnn lstm hybrid outperforms both cnn and lstm models exhibiting a nearly 89 improvement in nsc value compared to src in the test phase third deep learning models such as icnn ilstm and icnn lstm show significantly higher nsc values than cnn lstm and cnn lstm models in the test phase with improvements of 13 8 5 7 and 12 1 respectively moreover compared to src the proposed icnn lstm model improves nsc value by nearly 140 in the test phase the proposed icnn lstm model integrating the advantages of wt deep learning and ensemble learning provides accurate and reliable predictions and serves as a reference for time series prediction modeling keywords daily ssc prediction integrated deep learning wavelet transformation cnn lstm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurately predicting the concentration of suspended sediment in rivers holds significant importance given its profound impact on several key areas such as reservoir planning water resource management river environment and ecological restoration sivakumar and jayawardena 2002 2005 khosravi et al 2022 one practical implication of high sediment deposition particularly suspended sediments in a reservoir is a gradual decrease in its storage capacity over time until it reaches the end of its useful life serra et al 2022 huang et al 2021 aytek and kişi 2008 currently three main categories of models have been developed to estimate the concentration of suspended sediment in rivers namely empirical models e g the src process based models and data driven models empirical models are extensively employed to forecast ssc in the initial stages as they establish a quantitative connection between ssc and flow asselman 2000 harrington and harrington 2013 heng and suetsugi 2014 zhang et al 2012 nonetheless empirical models are prone to uncertainty owing to the non linear seasonal and imprecise nature of the input variables despite their ability to estimate ssc to some extent aytek and kişi 2008 wu et al 2008 yang et al 1996 conversely process based models rely on physical processes to elucidate the interplay between runoff and ssc necessitating extensive data and incurring high costs particularly for large watersheds khosravi et al 2022 although process based methods are developed through observations carried out either in the laboratory or in the field and focus on a basic understanding of the physical mechanisms that result in ssc variation and its causes they are possibly unable to provide highly accurate forecasts when applied to specific field sites guillén et al 2002 lee et al 2004 soulsby 1997 tseng and tinoco 2021 a data driven model can be an effective alternative before developing a universal process based model goldstein and coco 2014 in contrast to empirical and process based models data driven models have gained a significant advantage due to their ease of application particularly with the rapid advancement of computer science mehr et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 consequently in the last two decades a plethora of data driven models such as artificial neural network ann adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems anfis radial basis function neural networks rbnn support vector machines svm least square svm lssvm among others have been developed for predicting the flow ssc relationship these models have proven to be more accurate and robust than empirical models adnan et al 2020 afan et al 2015 alp and cigizoglu 2007 kisi 2005 kisi 2008 kisi 2013 kisi and zounemat kermani 2016 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 liu et al 2019 for instance afan et al 2015 trained ann with the daily flow and ssc data collected at rantau panjang station and demonstrated improved accuracy compared to src samantaray et al 2020 employed intelligent models rbnn ann and svm to forecast the daily ssc of salebhata suktel and lant stations located in western odisha india and the results showed that svm performed better than rbnn and ann nevertheless conventional artificial intelligence techniques are limited in their ability to discover the hidden information within natural data on the contrary modern deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks cnns long short term memory lstm and its variants including gated recurrent unit gru and bidirectional lstm bilstm have revolutionized data analysis by effectively capturing underlying patterns in time series data nourani et al 2021 gru simplifies the architecture of lstm by reducing the input gate forget gate and output gate into a single reset and update gate bilstm on the other hand is an extension of lstm that processes the input sequence in both forward and backward directions cnn comprises multiple convolutional layers that use trainable filters to extract feature maps from input images the power of cnns lies in their ability to learn hierarchical representations of visual data automatically thereby reducing the reliance on manual feature engineering and enabling end to end learning lstm is a type of recurrent neural network rnn that effectively addresses the vanishing gradient problem and learns long term dependencies in sequential data the advantage of lstm lies in its ability to capture and retain long term dependencies making it well suited for modeling time series speech recognition and natural language processing lstm can also handle variable length input sequences and is trained end to end using backpropagation through time in contrast to gru lstm has more powerful memory units that can store more information and have more sophisticated control mechanisms such as input gates forget gates and output gates allowing lstm to selectively retain or discard the information moreover lstm s long short term memory units are better equipped for handling long sequences making them more suitable for tasks involving lengthy sequences compared to bilstm lstm has a faster training speed since it processes sequence data in only one direction making it particularly useful for long sequence data furthermore the simpler architecture of lstm facilitates better interpretability thereby enabling a deeper understanding of the model s behavior and decision making in sequential data analysis some studies have demonstrated the potency of lstm in modeling time series data compared to conventional artificial neural networks for instance gao et al 2020 employed lstm and gate recurrent unit gru to simulate the yutan station control basin runoff in southeast china s fujian province and the results indicated that lstm and gru models could automatically filter redundant information thereby enhancing the accuracy of prediction with time steps and ensuring stability similarly kaveh et al 2021 demonstrated that lstm was superior to ffnns and anfiss when they trained an lstm network using daily flow q and ssc time series of schuylkill river to make predictions fang et al 2022 also utilized lstm to model and predict the relationship between rainfall and runoff and showed that lstm was capable of generating reliable predictive results and accurately predicting peak values fang and shao 2022 despite the lstm s ability to extract the autoregressive dependency of time series data it falls short in effectively capturing the seasonality component of time series nourani et al 2021 to address this the integration of machine learning models with data preprocessing technologies has become essential wu et al 2009 ravansalar et al 2017 quilty et al 2019 they facilitate the elimination of extraneous noise components and enables the detection of underlying patterns and structures within the raw time series data nourani et al 2021 li et al 2022 among the various data preprocessing technologies the wavelet based approach has been particularly favoured due to its ability to significantly improve forecast accuracy by leveraging wavelet filters the wt can decompose a time series into sub series leading to a more coherent structure for data driven models shoaib et al 2015 2016 a few previous studies have shown that wt can improve the performance of machine learning models for example nourani et al 2021 employed wt lstm to simulate the daily and monthly runoff sediment processes at three gauging stations in missouri and upper mississippi and found that the proposed model outperformed classical lstm and ann li et al 2022 integrated wt based data preprocessing module with an integrated nonlinear autoregressive network with external input inarx for ssc prediction with the daily flow and water level of the cuntan station in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and observed that the wt could significantly enhance the model s prediction performance however sometimes a single model is not enough to cope with complex tasks such as predicting ssc in an area with complex natural environments and varying climate changes hence ensemble learning models have been developed to be forecast models instead of individual models ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that aims to combine the prediction results of multiple models to obtain more accurate and robust predictions than a single model huang et al 2021 khosravi et al 2022 its main idea is to integrate a group of weak classifiers into a strong classifier by using weighted averaging or voting on the predictions of multiple classifiers to improve prediction accuracy and stability in a study conducted by khosravi et al 2022 four standalone models based on decision trees and four hybridized models were developed and evaluated for flow discharge prediction in talar watershed northern iran the results showed that the hybridized models captured extreme values more accurately compared with the standalone models huang et al 2021 combined different ml algorithms including multi layer perceptions random forest rf svm dnn rnn lstm networks and gru to predict ssc and the combined model is found to be more accurate than standalone models although ensemble learning could provide a more precise accuracy than individual models both input and model uncertainties have an impact on the effectiveness of ensemble learning models making it a challenge to construct an integrated ensemble learning model zuo et al 2020 wang et al 2023 wang et al 2023 have identified several challenges faced by existing ensemble forecasting models these include the need to i improve prediction accuracy to a certain degree ii effectively manage the scope of uncertainty and iii increase the size of the ensemble therefore the present study aims to address the aforementioned challenges by proposing a novel and comprehensive ensemble forecasting method to predict ssc in rivers to the best of the authors knowledge although few studies that have been published on combining deep learning and ensemble learning models as well as data preprocessing techniques barzegar et al 2021 pu et al 2023 there is no studies that have simultaneously combined two deep learning models cnn and lstm and two pre processing data methods wt and mggp for ssc prediction in the yellow river basin barzegar et al 2021 combined dwt with cnn and lstm to predict lake water level demonstrating that the combined model performs better than cnn and lstm similarly in a study conducted by pu et al 2023 dwt combined with cnn and lstm are adopted to forecast short term urban water demand the combined model also give the better prediction performance than single model in their study the cnn and lstm are integrated in the serial mode with the cnn extracting features from input data using spatial convolution operations and the lstm processing the extracted features in a time series different from them this study combined cnn and lstm in the parallel mode in which cnn and lstm process the input simultaneously and generate their respective prediction results in addition in contrast to the straightforward averaging method used in prior researchs huang et al 2021 this article proposes a technique that compares the prediction results of each model to identify the best performing one specifically the authors developed a comprehensive and integrated model called icnn lstm which integrates the wt technique for decomposing the original signal into different sub signals the mggp for filtering redundant sub signals and a combination model of both cnn and lstm in a parallel and loosely coupled manner thus the icnn lstm was applied in this study to predict the ssc at the tangnaihai hydrological station situated on the upper reaches of the yellow river additionally cnn lstm cnn lstm icnn and ilstm models were also used to predict the same daily ssc and their prediction results were compared to those of icnn lstm the study consists of five parts where the second part discusses the methods used in this study the third section describes the study area and statistical results of the study data and the fourth section compares and analyzes the prediction results and performance of all models used in this study and presents further discussions while the fifth part concludes the study 2 methods initially this section describes the concepts of wt and the mggp model for redundant information screening next it presents the cnn the lstm and the cnn lstm combined model then it describes the deep learning approaches of cnn and lstm integrated with wt and mggp followed by the presentation of the integrated cnn lstm icnn lstm model finally the criteria for evaluating model performance are explained 2 1 wt for capturing local features in time series data wt is applied as it can extract frequency domain information of time series data allowing for detailed analysis shoaib et al 2015 2016 wt is an evolution of the fourier transformation that uses a finite length attenuating wavelet base instead of an infinitely long trigonometric function base this method extracts frequency information and time information simultaneously revealing internal laws and discontinuities of non stationary data series jamei et al 2020 wt has two types continuous wt cwt and discrete wt dwt the cwt of a specific time series f t can be represented as a mapping between frequency information and time at various scales as shown below 1 w a b t f t ψ t b a d t where t denotes time ψ represents the wavelet function a means the scale parameter and b represents the location parameter due to the computational complexity of cwt it is frequently substituted by dwt the dwt of f t can be represented as follows 2 w a b d 2 1 2 1 l ψ 2 1 2 m f t d t where l and m are real numbers formula 2 enables the decomposition of the original time series data into two distinct components the approximate component and the detail component the former captures the signal s overall characteristics while the latter represents its local features therefore the resulting output of the dwt applied to the original time series data is expressed as 3 f t a l i 1 l d i where l represents the decomposition level 2 2 mggp mggp an evolutionary variant of gene programing gp leverages an intelligent optimization algorithm in conjunction with the linear combination of a single gene to derive all potential solutions khozani et al 2020 the mggp algorithm adopts the genetic concept of genes and represents it as a tree structure comprising the root internal nodes and leaf nodes as depicted in fig 1 the nodes are connected by mathematical operators which could either be root nodes or internal nodes initially mggp generates a set of genes that can reproduce offspring during reproduction each gene can undergo mutation and crossover crossover allows for the exchange of branches between two genes as illustrated in fig 1 a while mutation involves replacing an internal node or branch of a gene with a predefined random structure as shown in fig 1 b through the linear combination of multiple genes mggp expresses the solution to the problem as follows 4 y i 1 n c i g i c where c represents a constant term ci represents the ith gene weight gi represents the ith gene and n represents the number of last surviving genes the solution produced by mggp is tantamount to the optimal solution of formula 4 which is typically solved using the least square method 2 3 cnn cnn is a prominent deep learning algorithm that utilizes feed forward neural network architecture along with convolution operations and multiple hidden layers kuang and xu 2018 the architecture of a typical cnn consists of input convolution pooling fully connected and output layers lecun et al 1998 as illustrated in fig 2 cnn is inspired by the biological visual system and is characterized by its hidden layers namely convolution and pooling layers the convolution layer performs feature extraction using the convolution kernel with parameter sharing while the pooling layer conducts dimensionality reduction and extracts significant features the fully connected layer fits and abstracts all the features and finally the output layer produces the prediction results the convolution layer of a cnn applies a convolution operation to the input image using a convolution kernel which is then further adjusted by an activation function before being passed to the next layer mathematically the operation of the convolution layer can be represented as follows 5 x j n f i m j x j n 1 k ij n b j n where x j l denotes the j th output of the n th layer m j denotes the input image k ij n k ij n represents the connection weight between the i th input and the j th output of the n th layer represents the convolution operator f represents the activation function and b j n indicates deviation the primary function of the pooling layer in cnn is to optimize its structure and reduce the parameter space by applying averaging or maximization operations on a square array of input images with the array s size usually being smaller than that of the convolution kernel fig 2 displays four units of such square arrays the pooling layer can be mathematically represented as follows 6 x j n f β j n d o w n x j n 1 b j n where down represents the maximum pooling function the fully connected layer takes the output of the pooling layer as its input and conducts calculations involving all the neurons in the layer mathematically the calculation formula for the fully connected layer can be expressed as follows 7 x n f k n x n 1 b n where k n represents the weight between the n 1 th layer and the n th layer x n represents the output vector and x n 1 represents the input vector 2 4 lstm the lstm model is an important improvement on the recurrent neural network rnn model the core of the lstm lies in its ability to track information over a longer period of time via its clever controllable self loops to generate paths that allow gradients to flow continuously for a long time which makes it particularly suitable for processing tasks related to time series bengio et al 1994 furthermore lstm addresses the issue of long term dependency in recurrent neural networks by introducing a gate mechanism to regulate the retention and discard of features gers et al 1999 the lstm cell as illustrated in fig 3 has a complex recurrent structure that comprises a hidden state h t and a cell state c t capable of retaining long term memory the state information of each lstm unit flows sequentially from left to right with time the lstm model can dynamically regulate information updates in the cell state the forget gate f t manages the input x t and the preceding hidden state h t 1 connection to the cell state c t allowing it to determine whether to forget x t and h t 1 depending on the context the input gate i t and î t determine whether to pass the x t and the preceding hidden state h t 1 processed by the activation function to the cell state c t the output gate o t controls whether to send the processed x t and the preceding hidden state h t 1 of the previous step to the hidden state h t the entire process can be expressed as follows 8 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 9 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 10 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 11 i t tanh w i h t 1 x t b i 12 c t f t c t 1 i t i t 13 h t o t tanh c t 1 where σ represents the activation function w represents the weight matrix b represents bias and tanh represents the hyperbolic tangent function the intricate structure of lstm demonstrates its capability to precisely regulate the information and state flow within each gate of the cell additionally lstm exhibits the ability to handle input and output data vectors of various lengths making it highly adaptable for integration with other models 2 5 cnn lstm the cnn and lstm models exhibit distinct features in their internal data processing specifically the cnn model is adept at capturing local relevant features in input data through convolutional kernels but due to the filter size limitation it cannot effectively learn the temporal dependencies within sequential data lin et al 2022 in contrast lstm an advanced version of the rnn controls the data flow within the cell through the incorporation of a gate mechanism enabling it to perform short and long term memory functions and capture the temporal dependencies of sequential data however the cnn model outperforms lstm in capturing significant spatial features the effectiveness of cnn in capturing spatial features is attributed to its distinctive architecture which comprises convolutional and pooling layers convolutional layers employ learnable filters to extract spatial features from input images by convolving over the image pixels subsequently pooling layers are used to downsample the extracted features and preserve the essential information through stacking multiple convolutional and pooling layers cnn can learn intricate hierarchical representations of images that capture essential spatial features including edges textures shapes and patterns consequently the combination of both models can complement their respective strengths and enhance the accuracy of the prediction model zang et al 2020 the combination of cnn and lstm can be achieved either in a serial or parallel mode in the serial mode the cnn model processes the input data and extracts features through spatial convolution operations subsequently the lstm model processes the features extracted by the cnn model in time series in the parallel mode both cnn and lstm models process the input simultaneously and generate their respective prediction results which are then combined through a specific strategy this study utilizes a parallel approach to combine cnn and lstm models as depicted in fig 4 initially input vectors are fed into the cnn and lstm models to obtain individual prediction results the final prediction result is then determined by merging the results from both models in contrast to prior studies that employed a simplistic averaging approach huang e al 2021 this article presents a novel technique that involves an exhaustive comparison of the prediction outputs of every sample in the test period for each model thereby enabling the identification of the optimal performing model for each sample specifically the proposed approach entails a comparison of the predicted values of every sample in the predicted output vector of both the cnn and lstm models with the superior prediction serving as the final result thus for each of the 365 days in a year the best forecasting model either cnn or lstm in this study is selected this integration strategy ensures that the combined model consistently outperforms each model within the merged framework thereby enhancing the overall predictive performance of the 365 day forecast 2 6 icnn ilstm icnn lstm for enhancing the predictive accuracy of the deep learning models cnn lstm and the combined model cnn lstm this study employs wt and mggp to preprocess the input vector data the models which include preprocessing data modules are referred to as icnn ilstm and icnn lstm the comprehensive integrated model icnn lstm comprises three stages as depicted in fig 5 firstly the input signal is decomposed into an approximate signal a and a detail signal d using dwt if the input vector comprises k variables then dwt decomposes the signal into k k l sub signals which consist of k approximate signals and k l detail signals where l is the decomposition level li et al 2022 nevertheless not all of the k l detail signals are suitable for the prediction model s training khan et al 2020 the second step involves inputting k l detail signals into mggp to eliminate superfluous detail information to enhance the model s prediction performance while minimizing its complexity mggp utilizes multi objective optimization technology based on genetic algorithms to determine the optimal solution in contrast to single objective optimization which compares solutions based on a single fitness value multi objective optimization incorporates more than one target value given that it is not reasonable to assess the model s performance using only one target value the non dominated sorting method is a frequently utilized approach in comparing the benefits and drawbacks of solutions in multi objective optimization algorithms khozani et al 2020 within a given population a distinct set of solutions exists where no other individual solution outperforms it this collection of solutions is referred to as the pareto front pf and its mapping to the target space is achieved in mggp the mggp method employs a linear combination of multiple single genes to represent the solution to the problem consequently the mggp solution provides both the pf and the optimal expression of the multiple genes in the pf the method also documents the contribution of each gene to the overall expression contribution weight the gene sets with higher weights are the detailed information from the screening process and are utilized in training the deep learning models thirdly the approximate information of the original data series obtained by wt and part of the detailed information having a strong correlation with the target variable obtained by mggp are used as input vectors

crucial monitoring station that records hydrological changes in the mainstream of the yellow river above tangnaihai provides essential information for the development and utilization of the yellow river s water resources flood control and drought relief water regulation and national economic construction and hence is used as the case study of this paper see fig 6 the daily series data of discharge and ssc of the tangnaihai hydrological station located in the upper reaches of the yellow river at latitude 35 30 50 and longitude 100 09 38 are used tangnaihai hydrological station was established in august 1955 and is situated in tangnaihai township xinghai county qinghai province it serves as a critical control station for the upper reaches of the yellow river and is the inflow control station of longyangxia reservoir the drainage area of the station is 121 972 square kilometers and the river length above the controlled section is 1 553 km accounting for 28 4 of the yellow river it is situated 3 911 km away from the estuary and 300 km from xining the capital of qinghai province as of 2005 the annual average flow of tangnaihai station is 20 04 billion m3 representing 34 2 of the yellow river s water volume the maximum annual net flow is 32 8 billion m3 and the minimum net flow is 105 8 m3 the period between june and october accounts for approximately 70 of the annual net flow the highest recorded water level is 2520 38 m and the lowest is 2512 38 m the daily discharge and sediment concentration data recorded at tangnaihai hydrological station were obtained from the national science technology infrastructure national earth system science data center website to train the model the daily data from january 1 1977 to december 31 1985 were utilized while the data from january 1 1986 to december 31 1986 were used for testing the statistical characteristics of discharge and sediment concentration of the hydrological station can be seen in table 1 where sd cv and csx denote standard deviation coefficient of variation and skewness respectively 4 application and discussion firstly the cnn lstm and cnn lstm models were trained and tested by using the flow and ssc time series data of tangnaihai hydrological station and their prediction performances were compared and analyzed before training the auto correlation function acf and partial auto correlation function pacf were utilized to ascertain the optimal input vector secondly models icnn ilstm and icnn lstm embedded with wt and mggp were applied to improve the prediction accuracy of ssc 4 1 cnn lstm and cnn lstm 4 1 1 selection of input vector for ensuring the optimal predictive performance of each model it is imperative to identify input vectors that are most likely to produce the best predicted results to achieve this the determination of the time lag of the input data vector is critical in this study the auto correlation function acf and partial auto correlation function pacf were utilized to analyze the periodicity and auto correlation of time series data which facilitates the selection of the time lag of series data sudheer et al 2002 fig 7 illustrates the correlation analysis and partial correlation analysis diagram of the ssc time series data fig 7 a demonstrates the annual periodicity of the ssc data series fig 7 b reveals that the maximum time lag of the input vector for predicting ssc is four steps where the time series itself has the strongest correlation with those having a one step lag in addition the sliding window method is used as an effective supplement to determine the input vector as employed in the study of moosavi et al 2013 the initial input vector encompasses the data of a one step time lag and the step is gradually adjusted to a specific value which is determined at 4 by pacf in this paper according to the flow and ssc data of different time lag steps a total of 26 different input vectors are identified in this paper as shown in table 2 the i3 input vector in the table includes the current flow qt and the previous day s suspended sediment concentration ssct 1 i4 contains the previous day s flow qt 1 and the suspended sediment concentration ssct 1 and so on 4 1 2 model applications the cnn model is characterized by its ability to extract high dimensional abstract data features through spatial convolution on input data it can serve as either a pre processing technology or a stand alone predictive model however because the convolution operation of cnn is executed in three dimensional space it is necessary to reshape the one dimensional input vector into a three dimensional vector before inputting it into the cnn model for optimizing the cnn model several parameters need to be defined prior to training including the maximum training step size the number of iterations per step size the size and number of convolution kernels and the selection of optimizer these parameters were determined through a trial and error process and their final values are outlined in table 3 taking the search for the optimal value of the maxepochs parameter as an example a parameter range of 10 to 100 was set starting from 10 the model was trained and the process was repeated by incrementing the value by 1 each time it was observed that the model s predictive performance did not improve beyond a value of 30 hence the parameter was fixed at 30 deep learning utilizes various optimization algorithms including adam sgd and others in contrast to the gradient descent algorithm employed in traditional neural networks through experimentation the optimizer adam was found to be superior to other algorithms in optimizing the training process which is also adopted in a study conducted by adaryani et al 2022 in the case of the lstm model the primary parameters to be configured include the maximum training step size number of iterations per step size choice of the optimizer number of hidden layer cells and dropout probability of the dropoutlayer from experimentation it was determined that the hidden layer with five neurons yielded optimal prediction results additionally to prevent overfitting during training the dropout probability of the dropoutlayer should be set for lstm this layer allows the network to halt the work of a particular number of random neurons during weight updates by setting a specific probability the dropout probability for lstm was set to 0 15 and other parameters are presented in table 4 for the cnn lstm model which is a parallel combination of cnn and lstm its parameters align with those of cnn and lstm to facilitate a comparative analysis of model performance the prediction performance indicators of cnn lstm and cnn lstm are presented in tables 5 6 and 7 respectively for cnn the performance of the model using only the current day s flow or the previous day s ssc as input vectors falls short with nsc values of 0 2265 and 0 3646 respectively both much lower than the satisfactory threshold of 0 75 however when combining the flow of the current day and the ssc of the previous day as in input vector i3 the model s prediction performance is significantly improved with an nsc value of 0 6651 notably the ssc of the current day is highly dependent on the ssc value of the previous day and the flow of the current day both of which are essential factors by using the sliding window method various flow and ssc input vector combinations with different time steps are designed such as i4 to i8 the comparison of their prediction results reveals that input vectors with a one time lag step such as i3 i8 i16 and i18 can produce satisfactory predictions while those without a one time lag step such as i5 i6 i7 i11 i12 and i13 perform poorly this finding is consistent with the correlation analysis results as shown in fig 7 the correlation between the ssc data sequence with one time lag step and the data sequence itself is close to 0 9 much higher than those with 2 4 time lag steps about 0 2 moreover comparing the prediction results of i4 i8 i9 and i10 it is observed that the input vector i9 with one and three time lag steps produces better results than the other three indicating that the window sliding method can be effectively combined with correlation analysis to identify better input vectors in addition the input vectors i4 i8 to i10 i14 to i16 and i18 are supplemented with the flow of the current day to construct new input vectors i19 to i26 these input vectors show an improved prediction performance highlighting the significance of the current day s flow in ssc prediction among all input vectors i19 which includes the current day flow previous day flow and previous day ssc exhibits the most optimal prediction performance in contrast i3 comprising the current day flow and previous day ssc ranks second in terms of predictive performance in contrast to cnn lstm exhibits a higher level of overall prediction performance the comparison of the 26 input vectors prediction results indicates a similar trend as that observed in cnn nevertheless lstm outperforms cnn to a certain extent when dealing with input vectors with relatively good prediction results such as i19 whose nsc is 0 8212 representing a 4 5 increase compared to cnn moreover lstm significantly improves performance in cases where the input vectors have poor prediction results such as i2 whose nsc is 0 7259 a 99 improvement over cnn s nsc of 0 3646 according to adaryani et al 2022 cnn has demonstrated noteworthy performance in image captioning applications and manifests comparatively reduced susceptibility towards time dependent modelling variations relative to lstm networks in terms of cnn lstm the impact of input vector selection on prediction results is similar to that of cnn and lstm as it is the combined outcome of the parallel prediction of the two models as a strategy is employed to identify the most accurate prediction result it is ensured that the combined model performs better than the stand alone models as presented in table 7 the optimal input vector for cnn lstm is also i19 which yields an nsc of 0 8630 marking an 18 89 increase from the 0 7259 obtained by lstm fig 8 a and b depict the optimal predicted and observed values of cnn lstm and cnn lstm for all input vectors in the training and testing phases respectively as shown in fig 8 a the highest peak value in the training phase is underestimated while the estimated values are close to the peak value in the testing phase moreover from fig 8 b it is apparent that the daily series data of ssc predicted by the three models in the testing phase are consistent with the actual observed values but all produce slightly higher predictions for the peak value comparatively the predicted value of cnn lstm is the closest to the actual peak value but there is still room for improvement in prediction performance in comparison to lstm the combined model namely cnn lstm offers the advantage of simultaneously capturing spatial and temporal information the presence of convolutional layers in the cnn lstm allows it to handle time series data that exhibit strong spatial correlations such as geophysical and meteorological data more effectively moreover the cnn lstm model contains fewer parameters than pure lstm models which results in reduced computational resources required during training thereby accelerating training and mitigating over fitting risks according to wang et al 2023 the advantages of ensemble forecasting over single deterministic forecasts have been well established for medium and long term forecasting as it provides a collection of plausible solutions instead of a single deterministic forecast ensemble forecasting results in increased consistency and reliability of the actual probability distribution of forecasts xu et al 2020 moreover ensemble forecasting results can be utilized to derive single value deterministic forecasts by combining multiple forecasting methods which demonstrates superior performance compared to single model simulations troin et al 2021 4 2 icnn ilstm and icnn lstm 4 2 1 wavelet function and decomposition level the initial step in developing the proposed icnn lstm model involves the wavelet decomposition of the daily sequence data of the original flow and ssc to accomplish this it is necessary to choose an appropriate wavelet function and determine its support length and vanishing moment the support length and vanishing moment are closely linked and higher vanishing moments are accompanied by longer support lengths however excessive support length may result in border problems while inadequate support length may have an adverse effect on the concentration of signal energy shoaib et al 2015 2016 as a result striking a balance between the support length and the vanishing moment is essential this study utilizes four commonly used wavelets namely daubechies wavelet symlets wavelet coiflets wavelet and discrete meyer approximate wavelet denoted as db sym coif and dmey respectively as decomposition tools for the original sequence signal to enhance the prediction performance wavelet functions with different vanishing moments are selected for each wavelet with adjustable support lengths and vanishing moments specifically dbn and symn correspond to db and sym functions with a support length of 2n 1 and a vanishing moment of n while coifn corresponds to a coif function with a support length of 6n 1 and a vanishing moment of n the support length determines the filter length of the wavelet which influences the local feature extraction of the wavelet decomposition whereas the vanishing moment affects the information expression of the wavelet mother function for instance sym6 represents a six degree polynomial that encodes the decomposition process of the original data series with constants and sub signals of degrees 1 to 5 unlike db sym and coif dmey does not have compact support and bioorthogonality which may significantly impact the results of the wavelet decomposition in addition to the support length and vanishing moment the wavelet decomposition level is another crucial factor that may directly influence the model performance assuming a decomposition level of 4 the wavelet decomposition process in this study involved decomposing the original signal a0 into a1 and d1 a1 into a2 and d2 a2 into a3 and d3 and a3 into a4 and d4 as illustrated in fig 9 the final signal set comprised all the nodes on the leaves including a4 d4 d3 d2 and d1 where a represents the approximate signal and d represents the detail signal the subscript n in dn denotes the time span for capturing the features of the original data sequence by the wavelet function such as d3 captures the features of the original data signal for 23 days the decomposition level which can be calculated using the empirical formula l int log n given by kisi and shiri 2011 is positively correlated with the model s prediction performance graf et al 2019 therefore the wavelet transformation wt should decompose the original data at the maximum level and for the current study the sequence length is 3652 and l int log 3652 11 figs 10 and 11 depict all the db6 wavelet decomposition sub signals of the current day flow and the previous day ssc when l equals 11 4 2 2 detail screening to perform wavelet decomposition at l 11 each input variable is decomposed into an approximate signal a11 and detail signals d1 to d11 while these detailed signals provide sufficient information for prediction there may be redundant information that could compromise the prediction accuracy to address this issue it is necessary to screen the detailed signals to exclude information that is not relevant to the prediction outcome one approach is to conduct a correlation analysis between each detailed signal and the original signal to eliminate detailed information with low correlation khan et al 2020 however mggp an evolutionary version of gp can intelligently perform similar tasks to principal component analysis li et al 2022 this study utilizes mggp to eliminate detailed signals that are unfavorable to the prediction results the detailed signals from the wavelet decomposition results of each variable in the input vector are input into mggp and the key parameters are presented in table 8 upon completion of the mggp algorithm a pareto front is generated which contains the optimal solution marked by green dots in fig 11 to obtain the optimal prediction expression mggp takes into account both the complexity of each expression in the pareto front and the r2 performance indicator resulting in the selection of an optimal expression represented by a green dot in the red circle in fig 12 this expression includes six genes that are associated with detailed information and their corresponding contribution weight to the prediction result as depicted in fig 13 by examining the contribution weight one can identify the detailed information that is most beneficial for prediction and then input it into a specific model for instance gene 4 in fig 13 has a significantly lower contribution weight than the other five genes which implies that it may be redundant information and can be excluded 4 2 3 ssc prediction the wavelet transformed and mggp screened signals are employed as inputs to the icnn ilstm and icnn lstm models for the purpose of predicting the ssc to ensure comparability the parameters of these models are kept consistent with those of the cnn lstm and cnn lstm models in section 4 1 moreover the input vector i19 is utilized for all wavelet decompositions as cnn lstm and cnn lstm demonstrate the most precise prediction performance on this vector table 10 presents the predicted outcomes for various wavelet functions the wavelet functions and their corresponding vanishing moments that produce satisfactory prediction results for icnn are the db function with vanishing moments of 2 and 8 while the db function with a vanishing moment of 4 performs relatively poorly however the db function with a vanishing moment of 6 yields the most accurate prediction results the sym wavelet functions with vanishing moments of 2 4 6 and 8 all generate satisfactory prediction results with nsc values higher than that of cnn and the sym4 function performs exceptionally well with an nsc value of 0 8943 on the other hand the coif function with vanishing moments of 2 3 and 5 do not significantly improve the prediction performance and only the coif function with a vanishing moment of 4 produces satisfactory prediction results with an nsc value of 0 8632 the dmey wavelet function produces relatively good prediction results with an nsc value of 0 8295 higher than that of cnn these findings suggest that wavelet function decomposition can enhance the prediction performance of the cnn model but the choice of the appropriate wavelet function and the vanishing moment is crucial in the case of the ilstm model all the considered wavelet functions have produced satisfactory prediction results with even db2 and sym2 the two functions with the poorest predictions demonstrating nsc values as high as 0 8686 and 0 8679 respectively sym8 on the other hand produced the highest nsc value of 0 9490 regarding the icnn lstm model which combines icnn and ilstm in parallel and utilizes a comparison strategy to determine the best performance its prediction results have consistently outperformed those of icnn and ilstm table 10 indicates that even the poorly performing wavelet functions db4 and coif3 still managed to attain high nsc values of 0 9043 and 0 9090 respectively while sym6 with the best prediction results achieved an nsc value as high as 0 9675 it can be seen that for icnn and ilstm the predictive performance of using sym wavelet functions is superior to that of dmey db and coif wavelets the possible reason is that sym is particularly useful for analyzing power system transients because of its ability to capture both high frequency and low frequency components of the signal it should be noted that the impact of wavelet decomposition basis functions on various models is non uniform and there is no standard to ascertain which specific wavelet basis function is optimal for a given prediction model extensive empirical research is required to establish potential patterns in this regard as an example li et al 2022 found that the adoption of coif3 resulted in greater accuracy than other wavelet basis functions including sym db and dmey this finding contrasts with the results obtained in the present study and earlier research attributable to the adoption of different forecast models to further assess the effectiveness of the deep learning approach this study employed two alternative models the empirical model src and the shallow neural network ann for predicting ssc src is an empirical model that uses the exponential function s aq b where a and b are coefficients to establish the relationship between flow and ssc by fitting this function to the training data we obtained the coefficients a 3 10 5 and b 1 38 however the nsc value of src in the test phase was only 0 4036 which falls considerably short of the satisfactory threshold of 0 75 ann on the other hand is a widely used traditional neural network in hydrology it consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer and its parameters see table 9 are determined through trial and error to compare its performance to that of the models used in this study the input data for ann was also i19 and the training results are presented in table 10 although the nsc value in the test phase increased to 0 6321 which is better than src it still fails to meet the ideal value of 0 75 in the table the red and bold content indicates the optimal prediction result of a specific model based on the same wavelet basis function to provide a more understandable comparison of the prediction performance of each model fig 14 is used to display the performance indicators of each model in the testing phase in the form of a histogram the figure shows that src yields the poorest prediction performance while icnn lstm demonstrates the best the descending order of the remaining models based on prediction performance is ann cnn lstm cnn lstm icnn and ilstm the r2 and nsc indicators increase gradually indicating a higher degree of fitting while the rmse value decreases gradually suggesting a reduced prediction error furthermore two points should be noted first the cnn lstm and icnn lstm models outperform each standalone model second the icnn ilstm and icnn lstm models utilizing wavelet decomposition and mggp screening exhibit superior accuracy than their corresponding cnn lstm and cnn lstm models in order to visually compare the prediction performance of each model fig 15 displays the box plots of the observed and predicted values of ssc for each model the median is represented by the circle in the box the upper and lower edges of the box represent the 3 4 quantile and 1 4 quantile respectively and the short horizontal line above and below the box represents the maximum and minimum values respectively the box plot of icnn lstm and cnn lstm is found to be the most similar to the box plot of the observed ssc data indicating that both icnn lstm and cnn lstm model has the higher accuracy than other models which demenstrate that ensemble learning is promising forecast tool it is important to note that the predicted data range of cnn and icnn is significantly narrower than the observed data range of ssc this implies that after spatial convolution cnn fails to predict the peak and minimum values of the original ssc data series as shown in fig 7 however this issue is not observed in the cnn lstm and icnn lstm models due to their comparative strategy for selecting the best results fig 16 presents scatter plots comparing the observed and predicted ssc values of each model the sub graphs a and b c and d and e and f indicate that the fitting degree of the observed and predicted values of icnn b ilstm d and icnn lstm f is superior to the other models in particular the icnn lstm f plot shows a high degree of agreement between the predicted and observed values with the center line being closely surrounded by the points conversely src g and ann h exhibit poor fitting and tend to underestimate relatively high ssc values to evaluate the icnn lstm model s prediction accuracy for the peak value fig 17 presents an enlarged comparison of the predicted and observed ssc values for the three peak periods during the testing stage the results indicate that the icnn lstm model has accurately predicted almost all peaks demonstrating the model s power and stability additionally fig 18 presents the error histograms of the three peak periods selected in the test phase which demonstrate that the errors of the three peak periods follow a normal distribution further validating the accuracy of the icnn lstm model proposed in this study ultimately it is crucial to provide a comprehensive explanation for why deep learning models are superior to traditional models and why incorporating pre processing data technology leads to more accurate predictions clearly firstly due to the capability of deep learning models to handle multiple hidden layers they can deeply explore the potential patterns and information hidden within the time series leading to significantly improved prediction performance over traditional neural network models specifically as a type of nonlinear dynamic system convolutional neural networks achieve a comprehensive representation of time series data by capturing the time relationships that change over time and minimizing the time dependent structure compared to rnns long short term memory introduces storage units that maintain previous state information and gating units that control information flow between different units thus addressing the inherent problem of gradient vanishing and explosion in rnn secondly data preprocessing techniques can significantly improve model prediction performance which has been reported in a tremendous amount of previous studies khan et al 2020 li et al 2022 liu et al 2013 nourani and behfar 2021 shoaib et al 2015 shoaib et al 2016 wang et al 2023 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 zuo et al 2020 and could be attributed to two main reasons i the wavelet transformation method divides the signal into relevant periods and extracts sub signals that exhibit a significant correlation with the model output through artificial intelligence based optimization techniques such as mggp ii applying wavelet transformation facilitates the identification of several periods as sub signals choosing the most prominent sub signals to represent the time series as inputs for ai models helps eliminate redundancy and minimize uncertainty associated with the model s output 4 3 discussion accurately predicting the ssc in rivers is of paramount importance the src which establishes a linear relationship between flow and ssc is incapable of quantifying the intricate nonlinear and non stationary connections between these variables especially under complex hydrological conditions however with the recent advancements in data driven machine learning a suite of robust models has been developed to achieve highly accurate predictions of suspended sediment concentration by adeptly capturing the nonlinear features of time series data liu et al 2013 while the traditional neural network represented by ann has been extensively applied in the prediction of various hydrological processes such as rainfall runoff relationships aqil et al 2007 awchi 2014 river runoff amisigo et al 2008 carcano et al 2008 water quality parameters choi and park 2001 lin et al 2008 evaporation rates kisi 2006 kisi 2008 and ssc kisi 2005 kişi 2010 kisi and zounemat kermani 2016 an area of current research emphasis pertains to deep learning networks particularly lstm and its various integrated applications in contrast to conventional neural networks deep learning techniques such as cnn and lstm are well suited to identifying underlying patterns in data and capturing complex temporal dependencies nevertheless these models have limitations in effectively capturing the seasonality component of time series which is a critical factor in hydrological processes consequently the integration of machine learning models with data preprocessing technologies such as wt has become an essential area of research wu et al 2009 ravansalar et al 2017 quilty et al 2019 in addition given the stochastic nature of hydrological variables and associated uncertainties a single model may sometimes prove insufficient leading to the adoption of integrated models as a promising alternative therefore the present study introduces a comprehensive ensemble model icnn lstm which integrates cutting edge machine learning techniques including wavelet preprocessing deep learning and ensemble learning thereby enriching the research outcomes pertaining to machine learning prediction applications great prediction performance of the icnn lstm model could be attributed to its three key features firstly the acf and pacf were utilized to analyze the periodicity and auto correlation of time series which facilitates the selection of the time lag of the predictors secondly the cnn and lstm models are loosely coupled in parallel which allows for mutual reinforcement and leverage of their respective strengths in improving the accuracy of ssc prediction thirdly the model integrates the wt for decomposing the original signal to sub signals and the mggp for eliminating the uncorrelated sub signals to remove noise and detects hidden information in the original data series the cnn lstm hybrid outperforms both cnn and lstm models exhibiting a nearly 89 improvement in nsc value compared to src in the test phase deep learning models embedded with wt such as icnn ilstm and icnn lstm show significantly higher nsc values than cnn lstm and cnn lstm models in the test phase with improvements of 13 8 5 7 and 12 1 respectively the conglomeration of individual models has been shown to be advantageous in overcoming their limitations leading to improved outcomes huang et al 2021 khosravi et al 2022 graf et al 2019 khan et al 2020 the efficacy of wavelet decomposition in time series simulations is confirmed by the study consistent with the findings of liu et al 2013 jamei et al 2020 and li et al 2022 to summarize the proposed icnn lstm framework is a reliable approach for real time forecasting notwithstanding the widespread application of dwt based models in hydrological studies li et al 2021 graf et al 2019 shoaib et al 2015 their practical use must be approached with care improper utilization of dwt can result in errors as noted by barzegar et al 2021 key considerations for developing dwt models include the judicious selection of decomposition levels and wavelet filters appropriate partitioning of calibration and validation data and the incorporation of future information while the first two aspects can be resolved by trial and error or by following established guidelines the inclusion of future information presents a limitation of dwt models that requires a more robust approach to minimize errors one promising alternative is the use of maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt li et al 2022 barzegar et al 2021 quilty and adamowski 2018 5 conclusion drawing upon two of the most popular research areas in machine learning namely deep learning and ensemble learning the present study introduces a comprehensive ensemble model namely icnn lstm the workflow of the proposed model comprises three steps 1 performing wavelet decomposition on the original data series to extract both the overall approximation and detailed information 2 screening the detailed information obtained from the wavelet decomposition using mggp to remove redundancies and 3 utilizing the filtered and decomposed signals to train and evaluate the cnn lstm model for obtaining the final prediction outcomes the performance of the icnn lstm model is evaluated using the daily flow and ssc data from the tangnaihai hydrological station in the upper reaches of the yellow river and compared with other models such as src ann cnn lstm cnn lstm icnn and ilstm the simplistic structure of src renders it incapable of representing the intricate nonlinear relationship between flow and ssc and hence exhibits a substandard performance although the shallow neural network ann delivers an acceptable prediction performance with an nsc value of 0 6321 it still falls short of a satisfactory prediction result nsc value of 0 75 cnn performs better than ann with an nsc value of 0 7859 which is deemed satisfactory however this value is still lower than that of lstm which exhibits an nsc value of 0 8212 the predictive performance of cnn lstm is further improved with an nsc value of 0 8630 surpassing both cnn and lstm this improvement is attributed to the utilization of a relatively superior merging strategy in the model which consistently outperforms all individual models incorporated in the ensemble in comparison to cnn lstm and cnn lstm the integration of wt and mggp screening modules has led to improved prediction performance in models such as icnn ilstm and icnn lstm icnn for instance has exhibited a 13 8 increase in nsc value reaching 0 8943 as opposed to cnn s 0 7859 similarly icnn lstm has displayed a 12 1 improvement in nsc value achieving 0 9675 compared to cnn lstm s 0 8630 the use of four different wavelet basis functions and different vanishing moments for each model has been investigated the findings indicate that the selection of wavelet basis function and vanishing moment significantly influences the prediction results for instance the sym wavelet basis function with a vanishing moment of 6 has resulted in the least accurate prediction for icnn lstm while the db with 4 has led to the most accurate prediction the icnn lstm owing to its distinct architecture that entails data decomposition and details scaling offers enhanced modeling robustness and adaptability this renders it a dependable alternative for achieving more precise predictions of river ssc and contributes to the advancement of hydrological forecasting theories furthermore the proposed ensemble learning approach offers valuable insights for forecasting other hydrological events such as
