9570,turfgrass phenotyping is a potential tool in different grass program breeding the traditional methods for turfgrass drought phenotyping in field are time consuming and labor intensive however remote sensing techniques emerge as effective rapid and easy approaches to optimize turfgrass selection under water stress remote sensing approaches are considerate as important strategies to select species of turfgrass tolerable to drought allowing green space sustainability and environment protection in regions with water limitation here we evaluated differences between six mixtures of c3 c4 turfgrass grown under two water regimes limited and high irrigation the performance of turf species was achieved using the green area ga vegetation index calculated from rgb red green blue images obtained by ground camera and drone imagery the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the plant canopy temperature ct and soil moisture content sm both vegetation ga and ndvi and water status ct and sm indices presented a significant difference in turfgrass growth under the two water regimes differences among turfgrass species were detected under limited and high irrigation using the vegetation indices both ndvi and ga allowed clear separation between drought tolerant and susceptible turfgrass as well as the identification of the mixtures with a rapid green regeneration after a period of limited irrigation moreover the canopy temperature also discriminated between turfgrass species but only under limited irrigation while soil moisture values did not differentiate between species furthermore the regression and conceptual model using remote sensing parameters revealed the most adequate criteria to detect turfgrass variability under each growing condition this study also highlights the usefulness of green area vegetation index derived from drone imagery ga obtained by drone images in this study explained turfgrass variability better than that derived from ground rgb images or the ndvi keywords remote sensing ndvi rgb images canopy temperature water deficit turfgrass 1 introduction drought is one of the main environmental stresses incited high risk in grasslands development and natural green areas sustainability the high level of water deficit in many urban areas and the high consumption of water by turf makes the selection of drought tolerant species a fundamental criterion for planning urban green space in smart cities turfgrass phenotyping to drought tolerance is an important strategy to select species more adequate to regions with water limitations allowing then to the preservation of green spaces and environment in this context the selection of turfgrass varieties with superior drought resistance and low water use emerges as an effective way to decrease the water requirements of natural turfgrass areas saunders 2009 therefore turfgrass varieties with lower water needs and that can remain acceptable visually quality under dry conditions would be the species of choice in urban green spaces jansen van vuuren 1997 however traditional methods used to phenotype selection in field is time consuming and labor intensive on the other hand plants phenotyping also requires many resources and time since the results must be obtained from several years of experimentation and extended to many ecosystems in this sense auernhammer 2001 reported that agronomist and plant breeders need essential and precise technologies to support their strategic decisions by detailed spatial and temporal information on plant growth in different environmental conditions araus and cairns 2014 have reported that limitations in field phenotyping restrict our ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits particularly those related to stress tolerance likewise breeders of turfgrass reported that the implicit heavy time and labor demands of field phenotyping hinder the collection of more comprehensive data during early crop selection stages zhang et al 2019 in this context remote sensing technology has revealed as an alternative approach in recent decades for the selection of drought tolerant varieties in a short time and without the need for hard labor low cost phenotyping methods through remote sensing are becoming more widely used for estimating various plant traits including chlorophyll content nitrogen concentration and biomass yousfi et al 2019 marín et al 2020 saberioon et al 2014 thoele and ehlert 2010 and can provide a valuable information on plants adaptation to abiotic stress like water scarcity and extreme temperatures araus and cairns 2014 remote sensing techniques used in filed like the hand held point sensors such as spectroradiometers deery et al 2014 yousfi et al 2019 thermal sensors amani et al 1996 imagers jones et al 2009 marín et al 2020 and drones deery et al 2014 can provide relevant information on plant phenotypes montes et al 2011 and a rapid approximation of plant biochemical and biophysical criteria for large areas in field trials li et al 2014 furthermore the non invasive remote sensing methods such as digital image analysis and spectral reflectance for quantifying turfgrass cover and quality montes et al 2011 richardson et al 2001 jiang and carrow 2007 are considerate as major strategies to achieve grassland sustainability and less water consumption vegetation indices derived from remote sensing approaches are the criteria widely employed in field phenotyping platforms one of the most well known indices is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi derived from optical remote sensing the ndvi has been used widely for the estimation of plant biomass hansen and schjoerring 2003 babar et al 2006 and for turfgrass management marín et al 2020 carrow et al 2010 murphy et al 2014 this index is based on the concept of a relationship between the absorption of visible light and strong reflectance of near infrared light by chlorophyll viña et al 2011 ndvi is correlated positively with turfgrass quality caturegli et al 2016 and can be affected by differences in species and environments caturegli et al 2015 in addition information derived from digital rgb red green blue images can also inform on canopy vegetation yousfi et al 2019 casadesus et al 2007 digital image analysis has been successfully used to assess turfgrass color and the percentage of green cover marín et al 2020 karcher and richardson 2003 richardson et al 2001 as well as detect weeds in turfgrass plots parra et al 2020 the color information from rgb images can be frequently utilized to estimate leaf chlorophyll content and nitrogen concentration amani et al 1996 li et al 2015 plant biomass amani et al 1996 montes et al 2011 yousfi et al 2016 and plant height bendig et al 2014 schirrmann et al 2016 furthermore canopy temperature measurements taken using infrared thermometers sensor are also commonly used for the detection of water stress induced stomatal closure and as a guide for genotypic performance under drought idso et al 1981 canopy temperature is a relative measure of plant transpiration associated with water uptake from the soil reynolds et al 2007 given that a major role of transpiration is leaf cooling canopy temperature provides an indicator of the degree to which transpiration cools leaves under a demanding environmental load araus et al 2008 in the present the spectral reflectance sensing has become an essential approach in the precision turfgrass management several studies reported the utilization of spectral reflectance as an essential method to improve irrigation efficiency krum et al 2010 marín et al 2020 and for assessing turfgrass performance trenholm et al 1999 bremer et al 2011 taghvaeian et al 2013 reported that turfgrass management using the remote sensing methods in a consistent and non destructive manner can be permit the evaluation of turfgrass growth and quality likewise carrow et al 2010 and booth et al 2021 indicated that turfgrass phenotyping using ground sensors can provide information of turfgrass health and disease symptoms moreover trenholm et al 1999 and bell et al 2002 have also demonstrated in their studies that turfgrass ndvi was highly correlated with shoot density and turfgrass visual assessment rates and is considerate as key measure of drought stress similarly the digital imagery is also used as an effective method to assess turfgrass color and the percentage of green cover karcher and richardson 2003 richardson et al 2001 digital imagery was used in the research of shaver et al 2006 and schiavon et al 2012 to quantify turfgrass performance and to detect turfgrass physiological stress caused by drought carrow and duncan 2003 likewise bunderson et al 2009 have used digital imagery to compare the quality of 20 different species of turfgrass other studies have used both ground and aerial remote sensing in turfgrass phenotyping in this context zhang et al 2019 have compared the performance of bermuda grass cynodon spp and zoysia grass zoysia spp in field using ground and aerial remote sensing measurement caturegli et al 2019 have used the ndvi acquired by a ground based handheld crop sensor and unmanned aerial vehicles derived imagery to compare the performance of bermuda grass hybrid and tall fescue moreover leinauer et al 2014 have also compared the performance of eight different turfgrass species using ndvi measurements and digital images alternatively the canopy temperature was also employed in turfgrass phenotyping as a water stress criterion infrared thermometry can be used as a cheaper alternative for screening for drought tolerance amani et al 1996 reynolds et al 1998 jiang et al 2009 have reported that responses of turfgrass to water deficit conditions can be assessed by canopy temperature in this context lower values of canopy temperatures characterized the well watered turfgrass genotypes while water stressed turfgrass plants exhibited higher values of canopy temperature mauri et al 2020 the research of culpepper et al 2020 compare the responses of four warm season turfgrass species to supplemental irrigation or natural rainfall using the canopy temperature steinke et al 2009 have also used the canopy temperatures of 3 turfgrass species and 24 total turf cultivars in two successive years for the evaluation of turfgrass performance under drought conditions in this study and different from other studies witch compare c3 and c4 turf separately here we examined the performance of different mixtures c3 c4 turfgrass under limited and higher irrigation using remote sensing parameters the choice of c3 c4 mixtures permit us a large wide range of environmental conditions since c3 species are typical for cooler temperature regions and the c4 grasses are adapted to persist in warmer environments and both species differ in the photosynthetic system for the uptake of carbon dioxide green biomass was estimated by ndvi and by the green area vegetation index ga derived from ground and aerial digital pictures additionally water status indices were determined by measuring the canopy temperature and the soil water content the main objective of this study is to select the turfgrass more tolerant to water limitation and those with a rapid green regeneration after a period of stress using remote sensing methods moreover we also evaluated the efficacy of the vegetation indices obtained by ground and aerial imagery alone or in combination with canopy temperature to track turfgrass variability under the two irrigation regimes finally this study proposes a conceptual model relating mixture of c3 c4 turfgrass species variability with differences in vegetation indices canopy temperature and soil moisture under high and limited irrigation understanding the relationships between vegetation indices and water status parameters in turfgrass may help to design efficient breeding strategies to select those species most suitable for a given environmental condition especially drought thereby contributing to grassland sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions field trials were conducted during 2019 at the madrid institute for rural agrarian and food research and development imidra in alcalá de henares this site is characterized by loamy sand fertile soils and a continental climate the total amount of rainfall and the maximum and minimum temperatures accumulated by months for the 2019 crop season in the study region are presented in table 1 six c3 c4 turfgrass mixtures were studied to this end we mixed seeds from festuca arundinacea and poa pratensis both c3 with those from three c4 turfs cynodon dactylon buchloe dactyloides and zoysia japonica in a with 75 25 ratio of c3 to c4 the description and characteristics of the turfgrass species used are provided in table 2 irrigation was applied with sprinklers in blocks connected by valves and controlled by the rain bird irrigation system esp lxme model two different irrigation regimes were assayed limited irrigation 50 of container capacity and high irrigation 100 of container capacity soil humidity fig 2 was controlled by sensors plantae station plantae spain placed in the experimental plots and in the root active zone at a depth of 10 cm turfgrass seeds were planted on 4 april 2019 in a total of 36 plots six turfgrass mixtures three replicates per mixture and two water regimes each measuring 3 m 1 5 m fig 2 water deficit was imposed for two months after plant germination by decreasing the amount of water applied afterward irrigation was then increased to reach a high soil moisture content fig 1 and was maintained for the following two months in order to evaluate the degree of green regeneration of each mixture measurements were taken firstly in the two months of limited irrigation two days of measurement in each month and subsequently in the two month of high irrigation also we have measured twice in each month of high irrigation treatment measurement were achieved from june to september a period with high vegetative activity of plant turfgrass 2 2 ndvi a portable spectroradiometer greenseeker handheld crop sensor trimble usa was used to measure the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index this index is calculated by the following equation nir r nir r where r is the reflectance in the red band and nir is the reflectance in the near infrared band measurements were achieved every 15 days at sunny conditions and from 11 h to 14 h with a total of two measurements in each month of the experiment a constant distance of 50 60 cm above and vertical to the canopy was maintained between the sensor and the plots 2 3 ground and aerial rgb images rgb red green blue images were taken in each plot about 80 cm above the plant canopy in a zenithal plane using a sony dsc w120 camera rgb aerial images were taken on the same day using a bebop drone parrot paris france equipped with an rgb camera measurements were achieved every 15 days at sunny conditions and from 11 h to 14 h with a total of two measurements in each month of the experiment the breedpix 0 2 free access software established for digital image processing was used for image analysis casadesus et al 2005 this software rapidly provides digital values on the basis of different color properties and measures the green area ga portion of pixels with 60 hue 120 from the total number of pixels by capturing differences in biomass two ga indices were analyzed gaground rgb calculated from the ground image and gaaerial rgb calculated from aerial image 2 4 canopy temperature measurements canopy temperature ct was measured on the same day as the vegetation indices from 11 h to 14 h using an infrared thermometer fluke 561 sensor china measurements were taken approximately 1 m above the plants and with the sun behind the user of the device three measurements were taken in each plot and the average was taken as a plot data 2 5 plot moisture content soil moisture sm was measured on the same day as the remotely sensed traits using a field scout time domain reflectometry sensor 350 tdr 350 spectrum technologies inc usa measurements were taken with the 7 cm tdr rods and at three sites in each plot average of the three measurement was taken as a data of each plot 2 6 statistical analysis 2 6 1 factorial analyses of variance data were subjected to factorial analyses of variance anova to test the effects of irrigation on turfgrass growth a bivariate correlation procedure was used to analyze the relationships between ndvi gaground rgb gaaerial rgb and ct statistical analysis was done using ibm spss statistics 24 spss inc chicago il usa 2 6 2 stepwise analysis moreover we performed a multiple linear regression analysis stepwise to analyze turfgrass variability under different growing conditions statistical analysis was done using ibm spss statistics 24 spss inc chicago il usa 2 6 3 variables correlation a bivariate correlation procedure was used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficients between the different vegetation and water indices of the turfgrass studied the sigma plot 11 0 for windows systat software inc point richmond ca usa was used to establish the figures of all correlation 2 6 4 path analysis finally we performed path analyses li 1975 to quantify the relative contributions of the direct and indirect effects of remote sensing traits on turfgrass variability this methodology offers the possibility of building associations between variables on prior knowledge a path analysis determines simple correlations between independent factors in this case ct and sm and regresses them on each intermediary ndvi gaground rgb gaaerial rgb to obtain direct effects in the form of partial regression coefficients i e path coefficients involving traits that displayed turfgrass growing variation this model helps to understand differences in growing between the turf species examined in this study under the two irrigation regimes tested a model with a comparative fit index cfi with values 0 9 was taken as indicative of good fit arbuckle 1997 data were analyzed using the amos graphics package ibm spss amos usa the fig 3 presents a diagram summarizing all measurements achieved in this study the different instruments used and the statistical analyses performed 3 results 3 1 effect of irrigation on ndvi and green area irrigation significantly affected the turfgrass ndvi and ga table 3 low values for the three vegetation indices ndvi and ga calculated from both ground and aerial rgb images were observed under limited irrigation in addition soil moisture sm content under high irrigation was double that under limited irrigation whereas the canopy temperature ct of plants increased with the decrease of irrigation table 3 3 2 classification of turfgrass species on the basis of vegetation and water status indices turfgrass species showed a significant difference on comportment under the two irrigation regimes table 4 all the vegetation indices measured ndvi gaground rgb gaaerial rgb discriminated significantly p 0 000 between festuca and poa turfgrass mixtures under both water stress and high irrigation table 4 a higher values of vegetation indices were observed in festuca c4 turfgrass mixtures under limited irrigation compared to poa c4 mixtures conversely under the high irrigation conditions the poa c4 mixtures showed a higher values of vegetation indices than festuca c4 moreover canopy temperature ct also allowed significant discrimination between turfgrass species but only under the water stress regime table 4 with lower values of canopy temperature observed in festuca mixtures under limited irrigation however for the soil moisture tdr measures the species effect was not significant under both water regime table 4 furthermore we have compared the three festuca mixtures between them fig 4 under limited irrigation results showed that values of vegetation indices observed in festuca mixed with cynodon zoysia or buchloe did not present any difference between them fig 4a b c nonetheless ct was lower in festuca cynodon mixture compared to festuca buchloe and festuca zoysia fig 4 d whereas under high irrigation festuca zoysia and festuca buchloe with higher values of ndvi gaground rgb and gaaerial rgb slightly outperformed the performance of festuca cynodon fig 4a b c concerning the poa c4 mixtures a significant difference between them was observed under both water regimes fig 4 a b c d under limited irrigation poa cynodon showed a higher values of vegetation indices fig 4a b c and lower ct fig 4d while under high irrigation poa zoysia and poa buchloe showed higher values of vegetation indices compared to poa cynodon the soil moisture sm measurement did not present any differences in both festuca c4 and poa c4 mixtures fig 4e 3 3 remote sensing trait and turfgrass variability a multiple linear regression stepwise explaining turfgrass species variability as a function of traits related to ndvi gaground rgb and gaaerial rgb ct and sm under limited and high irrigation table 5 was performed the gaaerial rgb was chosen as the first explanatory variable of turfgrass variability under high irrigation and with a strong r2 0 85 additionally gaground rgb and ndvi were the two other variables chosen by the model however under limited irrigation the first variable chosen was the ndvi with r2 0 41 followed by gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb in contrast to high irrigation under limited irrigation the ct contributed even less than the vegetation indices to explaining the model in addition a conceptual model based on a path analysis was proposed fig 5a for the data of both water regimes comparative fit index cfi 0 9 and p 0 05 as the objective was to develop models that fit the data well under high irrigation neither ct nor sm had any direct significant effect on the variability of c3 c4 turfgrass mixtures however the canopy temperature ct had a significant negative effect on the three vegetation indices ndvi gaaerial rgb gaground rgb which in turn were associated significantly with turfgrass variability fig 5b under limited irrigation the effects of ct and sm on turfgrass variability were considerable but with a lower coefficient nevertheless these two parameters related to plant and soil water status indirectly affected turfgrass discrimination thus sm was negatively related to ct which in turn was strongly and negatively related to the three vegetation indices finally the vegetation indices showed a significant effect on turfgrass variability under limited irrigation fig 5c with higher correlation coefficient of gaaerial rgb than ndvi 3 4 relationships between ground and aerial measurements ndvi was correlated positively and with the same pattern with the ga obtained by aerial and ground rgb when all turfgrass species water regimes and replicates are combined fig 6a b moreover the gaground rgb was also strongly correlated r 0 83 with gaaerial rgb fig 6c likewise the three vegetation indices were strongly and negatively correlated with the canopy temperature and with the same pattern fig 7a b c 4 discussion 4 1 potential of ndvi and rgb imagery to screen differences in turfgrass species vegetation indices based on rgb images and the ndvi have demonstrated high throughput for the precise prediction of several traits that are valuable for breeders and agronomists vergara díaz et al 2016 in this study ndvi and both gaground rgb and gaaerial rgb were significantly lower under limited irrigation than high irrigation in this context water stressed canopies have been reported to have a lower spectral reflectance in the nir wavebands than unstressed ones fan et al 2020 the leaves of plants growing under water stress reflect significantly less nir and greater red irradiance consequently the ndvi and ga values are lower under stress conditions similar changes in the reflectance at the visible and nir wavebands caused by irrigation were observed in other turf studies on fescue fenstermaker shaulis et al 1997 lolium baghzouz et al 2006 and cynodon grass baghzouz et al 2007 the changes in the reflectance values of turfgrass observed in this study informs on the growing status of plants under limited and higher irrigation and can indicates perfectly of the turf performance and quality under water stress conditions in accordance vergara díaz et al 2016 have reported that vegetation indices based on rgb images and the ndvi have demonstrated high throughput for the precise prediction of several traits that are valuable for breeders and agronomists vergara díaz et al 2016 moreover richardson et al 2001 informed that vegetation indices can be used to evaluate turf quality color dry matter chlorophyll carotenoids and nitrogen content other studies also demonstrated the utility of the ndvi and other plant stress indicators based on spectral reflectance for assessing turfgrass performance montes et al 2011 trenholm et al 2000 marín el al 2020 and has been used to measure drought stress bell et al 2002 trenholm et al 1999 our results demonstrate the usefulness of ndvi and ga measurements from ground and aerial images to distinguish between turfgrass species under limited and higher accordingly in a previous study we also highlighted the utility of ndvi and ga to differentiate between c3 c4 turfgrass under water deficit marín et al 2020 in addition other authors also showed that vegetation indices are useful to discriminate between turfgrass cultivars grown under the same conditions and maintained under identical agronomical practices caturegli et al 2014 moreover here we have also demonstrated the greater growth of festuca mixture with the three c4 turf under water stress compared to the poa mixtures in this context the metabolism and architecture of roots in festuca species are key for the development of tolerance to water deficit perlikowski et al 2020 likewise it has been described that festuca species adapt to drought stress through alterations in leaf and root morphology wang et al 2008 furthermore the data obtained from the optical remote sensing techniques in this study showed an interesting pattern in the spectral characteristics of both c3 c4 mixtures vegetation indices exhibited that festuca mixture with cynodon buchloe and zoysia presented a similar pattern of growth under limited irrigation while under high irrigation fescue buchloe and fescue zoysia outperformed festuca cynodon nevertheless the ndvi gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb of poa with the three c4 species revealed significant differences under the two water regimes under limited irrigation the poa cynodon mixture showed a higher values of vegetation indices while under high irrigation poa buchloe and poa zoysia outperformed poa cynodon with poa buchloe showing the best growth under this condition according to this several types of bermuda grass have a deep and large root systems a morphological trait that allows them to reach available water at greater depth under stress conditions carrow 1996 on the basis of our results we can suggest that mixtures of festuca with cynodon buchloe or zoysia have a similar tolerance to water deficit and would be similar suitable for regions with limited water availability whereas in the case of pao mixtures poa cynodon would be the mixture of choice for drought regions furthermore under climates with higher precipitation and no water deficiency the festuca buchloe and festuca zoysia mixtures can offer better turf quality likewise the poa zoysia and poa buchloe mixtures would be the most suitable in such climates due to their high quality under optimal growing conditions additionally we also observed that after a period of growth under limited irrigation followed by high irrigation the c3 mixture with buchloe provided the highest vegetation indices indicating better green biomass regeneration after growing under water deficit accordingly the most characteristic response of drought dormant buffalo grass buchloe dactyloides is its rapid ability to regenerate growth after a period of water stress followed by water availability shantz 1911 4 2 turfgrass canopy temperature and water status the canopy temperature also referred to as leaf temperature has been widely employed for estimating plant water stress blum et al 1982 and for providing a relative measure of plant transpiration araus et al 2008 in this study the canopy temperature ct of the six turfgrass mixtures measured by an infrared thermometer was higher lower under limited irrigation than high irrigation under water deficit the decreased in water uptake caused the stomata to close thereby reducing transpiration and increasing leaf temperature blonquist et al 2009 however a lower ct indicates a greater capacity for transpiration and for taking up water from the soil and therefore a better plant water status blum et al 1982 also and consistent with the findings of other studies lopes and reynolds 2012 we observed that the ct was strongly related to the vegetation indices in this regard lower cts are strongly associated with higher green biomass and these two parameters can help to identify turf species with the greatest tolerance to drought our results also reveal that under limited irrigation the mixture of festuca with the three c4 turf showed a lower ct than the poa mixtures in this context festuca arundinacea is water use efficiency than other turfgrass species horst et al 1997 furthermore in response to water stress festuca spp undergoes an osmotic adjustment that maintains sufficient turgor pressure in the growing zone to ensure leaf elongation wang et al 2008 in contrast to the vegetation indices the ct of the three festuca mixtures under limited irrigation showed a clear difference between mixtures with festuca buchloe exhibiting the lowest ct it has been reported that buchloe grass requires low levels of water for survival and that under semi arid conditions it needs less irrigation to maintain good turf quality than tall festuca or and zoysia grass hicks et al 1984 also lower evapotranspiration rates in buchloe dactyloides indicate that this species uses less water than selected ornamentals horst et al 1997 however our comparison between poa mixtures revealed that poa cynodon showed better performance under water deficit in this context the thick leaf cuticles and smaller stomatal openings zhou et al 2009 as well as the reduced leaf surface stoma density and lower water transpiration rate mukhtar et al 2013 of cynodon dactylon confer better tolerance to water stress compared to the other turfgrass species 4 3 soil moisture soil moisture sm values measured by the tdr 350 did not show any differences between the turfgrass species under limited or high irrigation table 4 fig 5d nevertheless the analyze combining all sm data of the six turfgrass mixtures evaluated in this study demonstrated difference between turfgrass growth under the two irrigation regimes table 3 in this context such sensors can indicate when the soil profile is full of water or dry and therefore healthy turf is maintained by avoiding plant stress caused by soil that is too dry or too waterlogged bremer and ham 2003 accordingly moisture sensors are among the most used devices to manage crop irrigation schemes and have been reported to improve irrigation efficacy in lawns parra et al 2019 we propose sm as a useful criterion for managing turf irrigation but not for distinguishing between turfgrass mixtures moreover the feasibility of sm sensing devices has also been addressed for the irrigation management of bermuda grass osborne et al 2002 we considerate the sm data obtained by the soil sensors in this study as indirect measures to evaluate the development of turfgrass species osborne et al 2002 reported that as sm decreases plants show a decrease in tissue moisture content which in turn influences their reflectance properties 4 4 relationship between ground and aerial optical remote sensing trait the two groups of vegetation indices ndvi and ground and aerial rgb images showed high and positive correlations between them fig 7 this result is in accordance with previous research adamsen et al 1999 2011 and confirms that these indices inform about biomass status in a comparable manner likewise there was a high association between gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb images however ga obtained by drone images is better than ga of ground images with respect to explaining the variability in turfgrass growth fig 5d fig 6 table 5 and was less labor intensive and with less time consuming the use of spectral vegetation indices derived from uav imagery is emerging as a rapid and cost efficient approach for plant phenotyping angelos et al 2017 in present many low cost drones with an integrated simple rgb camera are now available to take images of large turfgrass surfaces in a short time in this context zhang et al 2019 reported that unmanned aerial vehicle uav imagery is considered a powerful tool for turfgrass breeders allowing them to evaluate crop performance and greatly increase the efficacy of data collection in relatively large trials advantages in field of view spatial and temporal resolution furthermore the high correlation found between the ndvi and the gaaerial rgb index in this study allows us to confirm the reliability uav based measurements for selecting drought tolerant species in large areas the greenseeker hand held sensor a low cost practical device has proved useful for detecting turfgrass stress for small areas caturegli et al 2015 however proximal sensors would need to be complemented with special cameras on board uavs to monitor the entire surface of large areas caturegli et al 2015 4 5 comparative model using remote sensing methods for turfgrass breeding results of the lineal regression presented here showed the usefulness of the vegetation indices derived from rgb imagery to explain the differences between turfgrass species under the high irrigation of note the ga vegetation index derived from aerial imagery was the most important parameter chosen by the model and with a higher impact r2 0 85 moreover ndvi made a negligible contribution to explaining variability under high irrigation due to the problem of saturation in this context a saturated ndvi in higher periods of turfgrass activity informs less than rgb indices which are characterized by less evident saturation montes et al 2011 however under limited irrigation ndvi was the first criterion chosen by the regression model other authors indicated that the ndvi is an index based on the strong contrast between the near infrared and the red band reflectance of a vegetation canopy and this difference becomes extensive as canopy vegetation cover increases amani et al 1996 this would explain why the ndvi is a more appropriate approach to study stress conditions in sparse canopies or during the early senescence of plants casadesus et al 2007 aparicio et al 2000 however our study combined both ndvi and vegetation indices derived from rgb images for collecting more and complete information to discriminate between turfgrass species under the two irrigation regimes accordingly data fusion in remote sensing can facilitates estimations of biomass possibly resolving saturation difficulties observed with vis nir sensor data under higher density vegetation tilly et al 2015 likewise the path model performed in the present study confirms the stepwise result and reveals the high capacity of vegetation indices ndvi and both gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb to explain turfgrass variability specially the ga index derived from drone images under high irrigation where the water status parameters ct and sm have no direct effect on turfgrass species variability moreover under limited irrigation vegetation indices are still more important criterion to explain variability of turf in this case water stress conditions ct contribute to explaining the model although to a lower extent than the vegetation indices and have a direct effect on turf species variability we highlighted the importance of the conceptual model proposed in this study combining various remote sensing techniques to explain the variability in different turfgrass species growing under different water regimes the results of this study can be are expected to help breeders to select appropriate criteria for turfgrass phenotyping under distinct environmental conditions 5 conclusion this study demonstrates the efficiency of vegetation indices to reveal variability in the performance of turfgrass species under different growing conditions our results confirm the usefulness of the vegetation indices for phenotyping most drought tolerant turfgrass mixtures in terms of retaining greener biomass during periods of limited irrigation although the ndvi is extensively used to monitor changes in growth under different conditions here we have shown that the ga vegetation index derived from aerial images provides a better evaluation of turfgrass mixtures in a short time and with high efficiency furthermore the path analysis model developed confirms the importance of the traits assessed by remote sensing for establishing variability in turfgrass performance the path analysis and regression model revealed the most suitable criteria to be used in certain environmental conditions for discriminating between turfgrass species therefore optimized turfgrass breeding strategies can allow the precise and rapid in the case of drones phenotyping of a large numbers of turf mixtures to identify those with greatest tolerant to water stress contributing in this way in the preservation of water resources the grasslands sustainability and the environment protection in future work we propose to add thermography thermal imagery to the model for detecting water stress in the same turfgrass mixtures used in this study we believe that a strategy combining aerial rgb and thermal imagery may potentially enhance turfgrass phenotyping and help to rapidly identify those mixtures most tolerant to drought conditions or those with rapid green regeneration after a period of water stress since this study is our first work using vegetation indices ndvi and both gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb as well as the canopy temperature for the evaluation of six turfgrass mixtures and under small plot in the future works we planned to repeat the experiment through large areas of turfgrass in other experimental stations and under different growing conditions extending the area the size and the duration of the study contribute to extrapolate the results obtained to more regions of the mediterranean moreover the studies of nasrallah et al 2018 and 2019 have highlighted the efficiency of using satellite data in wheat phenotyping accordingly we also plan to use satellite imagery for grassland phenotyping in futures work increasing the years of experimentation under different environments and combining terrestrial remote sensing techniques with drone and satellite data can permit to obtain a wide range of results and to concrete them under different ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments

and sm indices presented a significant difference in turfgrass growth under the two water regimes differences among turfgrass species were detected under limited and high irrigation using the vegetation indices both ndvi and ga allowed clear separation between drought tolerant and susceptible turfgrass as well as the identification of the mixtures with a rapid green regeneration after a period of limited irrigation moreover the canopy temperature also discriminated between turfgrass species but only under limited irrigation while soil moisture values did not differentiate between species furthermore the regression and conceptual model using remote sensing parameters revealed the most adequate criteria to detect turfgrass variability under each growing condition this study also highlights the usefulness of green area vegetation index derived from drone imagery ga obtained by drone images in this study explained turfgrass variability better than that derived from ground rgb images or the ndvi keywords remote sensing ndvi rgb images canopy temperature water deficit turfgrass 1 introduction drought is one of the main environmental stresses incited high risk in grasslands development and natural green areas sustainability the high level of water deficit in many urban areas and the high consumption of water by turf makes the selection of drought tolerant species a fundamental criterion for planning urban green space in smart cities turfgrass phenotyping to drought tolerance is an important strategy to select species more adequate to regions with water limitations allowing then to the preservation of green spaces and environment in this context the selection of turfgrass varieties with superior drought resistance and low water use emerges as an effective way to decrease the water requirements of natural turfgrass areas saunders 2009 therefore turfgrass varieties with lower water needs and that can remain acceptable visually quality under dry conditions would be the species of choice in urban green spaces jansen van vuuren 1997 however traditional methods used to phenotype selection in field is time consuming and labor intensive on the other hand plants phenotyping also requires many resources and time since the results must be obtained from several years of experimentation and extended to many ecosystems in this sense auernhammer 2001 reported that agronomist and plant breeders need essential and precise technologies to support their strategic decisions by detailed spatial and temporal information on plant growth in different environmental conditions araus and cairns 2014 have reported that limitations in field phenotyping restrict our ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits particularly those related to stress tolerance likewise breeders of turfgrass reported that the implicit heavy time and labor demands of field phenotyping hinder the collection of more comprehensive data during early crop selection stages zhang et al 2019 in this context remote sensing technology has revealed as an alternative approach in recent decades for the selection of drought tolerant varieties in a short time and without the need for hard labor low cost phenotyping methods through remote sensing are becoming more widely used for estimating various plant traits including chlorophyll content nitrogen concentration and biomass yousfi et al 2019 marín et al 2020 saberioon et al 2014 thoele and ehlert 2010 and can provide a valuable information on plants adaptation to abiotic stress like water scarcity and extreme temperatures araus and cairns 2014 remote sensing techniques used in filed like the hand held point sensors such as spectroradiometers deery et al 2014 yousfi et al 2019 thermal sensors amani et al 1996 imagers jones et al 2009 marín et al 2020 and drones deery et al 2014 can provide relevant information on plant phenotypes montes et al 2011 and a rapid approximation of plant biochemical and biophysical criteria for large areas in field trials li et al 2014 furthermore the non invasive remote sensing methods such as digital image analysis and spectral reflectance for quantifying turfgrass cover and quality montes et al 2011 richardson et al 2001 jiang and carrow 2007 are considerate as major strategies to achieve grassland sustainability and less water consumption vegetation indices derived from remote sensing approaches are the criteria widely employed in field phenotyping platforms one of the most well known indices is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi derived from optical remote sensing the ndvi has been used widely for the estimation of plant biomass hansen and schjoerring 2003 babar et al 2006 and for turfgrass management marín et al 2020 carrow et al 2010 murphy et al 2014 this index is based on the concept of a relationship between the absorption of visible light and strong reflectance of near infrared light by chlorophyll viña et al 2011 ndvi is correlated positively with turfgrass quality caturegli et al 2016 and can be affected by differences in species and environments caturegli et al 2015 in addition information derived from digital rgb red green blue images can also inform on canopy vegetation yousfi et al 2019 casadesus et al 2007 digital image analysis has been successfully used to assess turfgrass color and the percentage of green cover marín et al 2020 karcher and richardson 2003 richardson et al 2001 as well as detect weeds in turfgrass plots parra et al 2020 the color information from rgb images can be frequently utilized to estimate leaf chlorophyll content and nitrogen concentration amani et al 1996 li et al 2015 plant biomass amani et al 1996 montes et al 2011 yousfi et al 2016 and plant height bendig et al 2014 schirrmann et al 2016 furthermore canopy temperature measurements taken using infrared thermometers sensor are also commonly used for the detection of water stress induced stomatal closure and as a guide for genotypic performance under drought idso et al 1981 canopy temperature is a relative measure of plant transpiration associated with water uptake from the soil reynolds et al 2007 given that a major role of transpiration is leaf cooling canopy temperature provides an indicator of the degree to which transpiration cools leaves under a demanding environmental load araus et al 2008 in the present the spectral reflectance sensing has become an essential approach in the precision turfgrass management several studies reported the utilization of spectral reflectance as an essential method to improve irrigation efficiency krum et al 2010 marín et al 2020 and for assessing turfgrass performance trenholm et al 1999 bremer et al 2011 taghvaeian et al 2013 reported that turfgrass management using the remote sensing methods in a consistent and non destructive manner can be permit the evaluation of turfgrass growth and quality likewise carrow et al 2010 and booth et al 2021 indicated that turfgrass phenotyping using ground sensors can provide information of turfgrass health and disease symptoms moreover trenholm et al 1999 and bell et al 2002 have also demonstrated in their studies that turfgrass ndvi was highly correlated with shoot density and turfgrass visual assessment rates and is considerate as key measure of drought stress similarly the digital imagery is also used as an effective method to assess turfgrass color and the percentage of green cover karcher and richardson 2003 richardson et al 2001 digital imagery was used in the research of shaver et al 2006 and schiavon et al 2012 to quantify turfgrass performance and to detect turfgrass physiological stress caused by drought carrow and duncan 2003 likewise bunderson et al 2009 have used digital imagery to compare the quality of 20 different species of turfgrass other studies have used both ground and aerial remote sensing in turfgrass phenotyping in this context zhang et al 2019 have compared the performance of bermuda grass cynodon spp and zoysia grass zoysia spp in field using ground and aerial remote sensing measurement caturegli et al 2019 have used the ndvi acquired by a ground based handheld crop sensor and unmanned aerial vehicles derived imagery to compare the performance of bermuda grass hybrid and tall fescue moreover leinauer et al 2014 have also compared the performance of eight different turfgrass species using ndvi measurements and digital images alternatively the canopy temperature was also employed in turfgrass phenotyping as a water stress criterion infrared thermometry can be used as a cheaper alternative for screening for drought tolerance amani et al 1996 reynolds et al 1998 jiang et al 2009 have reported that responses of turfgrass to water deficit conditions can be assessed by canopy temperature in this context lower values of canopy temperatures characterized the well watered turfgrass genotypes while water stressed turfgrass plants exhibited higher values of canopy temperature mauri et al 2020 the research of culpepper et al 2020 compare the responses of four warm season turfgrass species to supplemental irrigation or natural rainfall using the canopy temperature steinke et al 2009 have also used the canopy temperatures of 3 turfgrass species and 24 total turf cultivars in two successive years for the evaluation of turfgrass performance under drought conditions in this study and different from other studies witch compare c3 and c4 turf separately here we examined the performance of different mixtures c3 c4 turfgrass under limited and higher irrigation using remote sensing parameters the choice of c3 c4 mixtures permit us a large wide range of environmental conditions since c3 species are typical for cooler temperature regions and the c4 grasses are adapted to persist in warmer environments and both species differ in the photosynthetic system for the uptake of carbon dioxide green biomass was estimated by ndvi and by the green area vegetation index ga derived from ground and aerial digital pictures additionally water status indices were determined by measuring the canopy temperature and the soil water content the main objective of this study is to select the turfgrass more tolerant to water limitation and those with a rapid green regeneration after a period of stress using remote sensing methods moreover we also evaluated the efficacy of the vegetation indices obtained by ground and aerial imagery alone or in combination with canopy temperature to track turfgrass variability under the two irrigation regimes finally this study proposes a conceptual model relating mixture of c3 c4 turfgrass species variability with differences in vegetation indices canopy temperature and soil moisture under high and limited irrigation understanding the relationships between vegetation indices and water status parameters in turfgrass may help to design efficient breeding strategies to select those species most suitable for a given environmental condition especially drought thereby contributing to grassland sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions field trials were conducted during 2019 at the madrid institute for rural agrarian and food research and development imidra in alcalá de henares this site is characterized by loamy sand fertile soils and a continental climate the total amount of rainfall and the maximum and minimum temperatures accumulated by months for the 2019 crop season in the study region are presented in table 1 six c3 c4 turfgrass mixtures were studied to this end we mixed seeds from festuca arundinacea and poa pratensis both c3 with those from three c4 turfs cynodon dactylon buchloe dactyloides and zoysia japonica in a with 75 25 ratio of c3 to c4 the description and characteristics of the turfgrass species used are provided in table 2 irrigation was applied with sprinklers in blocks connected by valves and controlled by the rain bird irrigation system esp lxme model two different irrigation regimes were assayed limited irrigation 50 of container capacity and high irrigation 100 of container capacity soil humidity fig 2 was controlled by sensors plantae station plantae spain placed in the experimental plots and in the root active zone at a depth of 10 cm turfgrass seeds were planted on 4 april 2019 in a total of 36 plots six turfgrass mixtures three replicates per mixture and two water regimes each measuring 3 m 1 5 m fig 2 water deficit was imposed for two months after plant germination by decreasing the amount of water applied afterward irrigation was then increased to reach a high soil moisture content fig 1 and was maintained for the following two months in order to evaluate the degree of green regeneration of each mixture measurements were taken firstly in the two months of limited irrigation two days of measurement in each month and subsequently in the two month of high irrigation also we have measured twice in each month of high irrigation treatment measurement were achieved from june to september a period with high vegetative activity of plant turfgrass 2 2 ndvi a portable spectroradiometer greenseeker handheld crop sensor trimble usa was used to measure the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index this index is calculated by the following equation nir r nir r where r is the reflectance in the red band and nir is the reflectance in the near infrared band measurements were achieved every 15 days at sunny conditions and from 11 h to 14 h with a total of two measurements in each month of the experiment a constant distance of 50 60 cm above and vertical to the canopy was maintained between the sensor and the plots 2 3 ground and aerial rgb images rgb red green blue images were taken in each plot about 80 cm above the plant canopy in a zenithal plane using a sony dsc w120 camera rgb aerial images were taken on the same day using a bebop drone parrot paris france equipped with an rgb camera measurements were achieved every 15 days at sunny conditions and from 11 h to 14 h with a total of two measurements in each month of the experiment the breedpix 0 2 free access software established for digital image processing was used for image analysis casadesus et al 2005 this software rapidly provides digital values on the basis of different color properties and measures the green area ga portion of pixels with 60 hue 120 from the total number of pixels by capturing differences in biomass two ga indices were analyzed gaground rgb calculated from the ground image and gaaerial rgb calculated from aerial image 2 4 canopy temperature measurements canopy temperature ct was measured on the same day as the vegetation indices from 11 h to 14 h using an infrared thermometer fluke 561 sensor china measurements were taken approximately 1 m above the plants and with the sun behind the user of the device three measurements were taken in each plot and the average was taken as a plot data 2 5 plot moisture content soil moisture sm was measured on the same day as the remotely sensed traits using a field scout time domain reflectometry sensor 350 tdr 350 spectrum technologies inc usa measurements were taken with the 7 cm tdr rods and at three sites in each plot average of the three measurement was taken as a data of each plot 2 6 statistical analysis 2 6 1 factorial analyses of variance data were subjected to factorial analyses of variance anova to test the effects of irrigation on turfgrass growth a bivariate correlation procedure was used to analyze the relationships between ndvi gaground rgb gaaerial rgb and ct statistical analysis was done using ibm spss statistics 24 spss inc chicago il usa 2 6 2 stepwise analysis moreover we performed a multiple linear regression analysis stepwise to analyze turfgrass variability under different growing conditions statistical analysis was done using ibm spss statistics 24 spss inc chicago il usa 2 6 3 variables correlation a bivariate correlation procedure was used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficients between the different vegetation and water indices of the turfgrass studied the sigma plot 11 0 for windows systat software inc point richmond ca usa was used to establish the figures of all correlation 2 6 4 path analysis finally we performed path analyses li 1975 to quantify the relative contributions of the direct and indirect effects of remote sensing traits on turfgrass variability this methodology offers the possibility of building associations between variables on prior knowledge a path analysis determines simple correlations between independent factors in this case ct and sm and regresses them on each intermediary ndvi gaground rgb gaaerial rgb to obtain direct effects in the form of partial regression coefficients i e path coefficients involving traits that displayed turfgrass growing variation this model helps to understand differences in growing between the turf species examined in this study under the two irrigation regimes tested a model with a comparative fit index cfi with values 0 9 was taken as indicative of good fit arbuckle 1997 data were analyzed using the amos graphics package ibm spss amos usa the fig 3 presents a diagram summarizing all measurements achieved in this study the different instruments used and the statistical analyses performed 3 results 3 1 effect of irrigation on ndvi and green area irrigation significantly affected the turfgrass ndvi and ga table 3 low values for the three vegetation indices ndvi and ga calculated from both ground and aerial rgb images were observed under limited irrigation in addition soil moisture sm content under high irrigation was double that under limited irrigation whereas the canopy temperature ct of plants increased with the decrease of irrigation table 3 3 2 classification of turfgrass species on the basis of vegetation and water status indices turfgrass species showed a significant difference on comportment under the two irrigation regimes table 4 all the vegetation indices measured ndvi gaground rgb gaaerial rgb discriminated significantly p 0 000 between festuca and poa turfgrass mixtures under both water stress and high irrigation table 4 a higher values of vegetation indices were observed in festuca c4 turfgrass mixtures under limited irrigation compared to poa c4 mixtures conversely under the high irrigation conditions the poa c4 mixtures showed a higher values of vegetation indices than festuca c4 moreover canopy temperature ct also allowed significant discrimination between turfgrass species but only under the water stress regime table 4 with lower values of canopy temperature observed in festuca mixtures under limited irrigation however for the soil moisture tdr measures the species effect was not significant under both water regime table 4 furthermore we have compared the three festuca mixtures between them fig 4 under limited irrigation results showed that values of vegetation indices observed in festuca mixed with cynodon zoysia or buchloe did not present any difference between them fig 4a b c nonetheless ct was lower in festuca cynodon mixture compared to festuca buchloe and festuca zoysia fig 4 d whereas under high irrigation festuca zoysia and festuca buchloe with higher values of ndvi gaground rgb and gaaerial rgb slightly outperformed the performance of festuca cynodon fig 4a b c concerning the poa c4 mixtures a significant difference between them was observed under both water regimes fig 4 a b c d under limited irrigation poa cynodon showed a higher values of vegetation indices fig 4a b c and lower ct fig 4d while under high irrigation poa zoysia and poa buchloe showed higher values of vegetation indices compared to poa cynodon the soil moisture sm measurement did not present any differences in both festuca c4 and poa c4 mixtures fig 4e 3 3 remote sensing trait and turfgrass variability a multiple linear regression stepwise explaining turfgrass species variability as a function of traits related to ndvi gaground rgb and gaaerial rgb ct and sm under limited and high irrigation table 5 was performed the gaaerial rgb was chosen as the first explanatory variable of turfgrass variability under high irrigation and with a strong r2 0 85 additionally gaground rgb and ndvi were the two other variables chosen by the model however under limited irrigation the first variable chosen was the ndvi with r2 0 41 followed by gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb in contrast to high irrigation under limited irrigation the ct contributed even less than the vegetation indices to explaining the model in addition a conceptual model based on a path analysis was proposed fig 5a for the data of both water regimes comparative fit index cfi 0 9 and p 0 05 as the objective was to develop models that fit the data well under high irrigation neither ct nor sm had any direct significant effect on the variability of c3 c4 turfgrass mixtures however the canopy temperature ct had a significant negative effect on the three vegetation indices ndvi gaaerial rgb gaground rgb which in turn were associated significantly with turfgrass variability fig 5b under limited irrigation the effects of ct and sm on turfgrass variability were considerable but with a lower coefficient nevertheless these two parameters related to plant and soil water status indirectly affected turfgrass discrimination thus sm was negatively related to ct which in turn was strongly and negatively related to the three vegetation indices finally the vegetation indices showed a significant effect on turfgrass variability under limited irrigation fig 5c with higher correlation coefficient of gaaerial rgb than ndvi 3 4 relationships between ground and aerial measurements ndvi was correlated positively and with the same pattern with the ga obtained by aerial and ground rgb when all turfgrass species water regimes and replicates are combined fig 6a b moreover the gaground rgb was also strongly correlated r 0 83 with gaaerial rgb fig 6c likewise the three vegetation indices were strongly and negatively correlated with the canopy temperature and with the same pattern fig 7a b c 4 discussion 4 1 potential of ndvi and rgb imagery to screen differences in turfgrass species vegetation indices based on rgb images and the ndvi have demonstrated high throughput for the precise prediction of several traits that are valuable for breeders and agronomists vergara díaz et al 2016 in this study ndvi and both gaground rgb and gaaerial rgb were significantly lower under limited irrigation than high irrigation in this context water stressed canopies have been reported to have a lower spectral reflectance in the nir wavebands than unstressed ones fan et al 2020 the leaves of plants growing under water stress reflect significantly less nir and greater red irradiance consequently the ndvi and ga values are lower under stress conditions similar changes in the reflectance at the visible and nir wavebands caused by irrigation were observed in other turf studies on fescue fenstermaker shaulis et al 1997 lolium baghzouz et al 2006 and cynodon grass baghzouz et al 2007 the changes in the reflectance values of turfgrass observed in this study informs on the growing status of plants under limited and higher irrigation and can indicates perfectly of the turf performance and quality under water stress conditions in accordance vergara díaz et al 2016 have reported that vegetation indices based on rgb images and the ndvi have demonstrated high throughput for the precise prediction of several traits that are valuable for breeders and agronomists vergara díaz et al 2016 moreover richardson et al 2001 informed that vegetation indices can be used to evaluate turf quality color dry matter chlorophyll carotenoids and nitrogen content other studies also demonstrated the utility of the ndvi and other plant stress indicators based on spectral reflectance for assessing turfgrass performance montes et al 2011 trenholm et al 2000 marín el al 2020 and has been used to measure drought stress bell et al 2002 trenholm et al 1999 our results demonstrate the usefulness of ndvi and ga measurements from ground and aerial images to distinguish between turfgrass species under limited and higher accordingly in a previous study we also highlighted the utility of ndvi and ga to differentiate between c3 c4 turfgrass under water deficit marín et al 2020 in addition other authors also showed that vegetation indices are useful to discriminate between turfgrass cultivars grown under the same conditions and maintained under identical agronomical practices caturegli et al 2014 moreover here we have also demonstrated the greater growth of festuca mixture with the three c4 turf under water stress compared to the poa mixtures in this context the metabolism and architecture of roots in festuca species are key for the development of tolerance to water deficit perlikowski et al 2020 likewise it has been described that festuca species adapt to drought stress through alterations in leaf and root morphology wang et al 2008 furthermore the data obtained from the optical remote sensing techniques in this study showed an interesting pattern in the spectral characteristics of both c3 c4 mixtures vegetation indices exhibited that festuca mixture with cynodon buchloe and zoysia presented a similar pattern of growth under limited irrigation while under high irrigation fescue buchloe and fescue zoysia outperformed festuca cynodon nevertheless the ndvi gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb of poa with the three c4 species revealed significant differences under the two water regimes under limited irrigation the poa cynodon mixture showed a higher values of vegetation indices while under high irrigation poa buchloe and poa zoysia outperformed poa cynodon with poa buchloe showing the best growth under this condition according to this several types of bermuda grass have a deep and large root systems a morphological trait that allows them to reach available water at greater depth under stress conditions carrow 1996 on the basis of our results we can suggest that mixtures of festuca with cynodon buchloe or zoysia have a similar tolerance to water deficit and would be similar suitable for regions with limited water availability whereas in the case of pao mixtures poa cynodon would be the mixture of choice for drought regions furthermore under climates with higher precipitation and no water deficiency the festuca buchloe and festuca zoysia mixtures can offer better turf quality likewise the poa zoysia and poa buchloe mixtures would be the most suitable in such climates due to their high quality under optimal growing conditions additionally we also observed that after a period of growth under limited irrigation followed by high irrigation the c3 mixture with buchloe provided the highest vegetation indices indicating better green biomass regeneration after growing under water deficit accordingly the most characteristic response of drought dormant buffalo grass buchloe dactyloides is its rapid ability to regenerate growth after a period of water stress followed by water availability shantz 1911 4 2 turfgrass canopy temperature and water status the canopy temperature also referred to as leaf temperature has been widely employed for estimating plant water stress blum et al 1982 and for providing a relative measure of plant transpiration araus et al 2008 in this study the canopy temperature ct of the six turfgrass mixtures measured by an infrared thermometer was higher lower under limited irrigation than high irrigation under water deficit the decreased in water uptake caused the stomata to close thereby reducing transpiration and increasing leaf temperature blonquist et al 2009 however a lower ct indicates a greater capacity for transpiration and for taking up water from the soil and therefore a better plant water status blum et al 1982 also and consistent with the findings of other studies lopes and reynolds 2012 we observed that the ct was strongly related to the vegetation indices in this regard lower cts are strongly associated with higher green biomass and these two parameters can help to identify turf species with the greatest tolerance to drought our results also reveal that under limited irrigation the mixture of festuca with the three c4 turf showed a lower ct than the poa mixtures in this context festuca arundinacea is water use efficiency than other turfgrass species horst et al 1997 furthermore in response to water stress festuca spp undergoes an osmotic adjustment that maintains sufficient turgor pressure in the growing zone to ensure leaf elongation wang et al 2008 in contrast to the vegetation indices the ct of the three festuca mixtures under limited irrigation showed a clear difference between mixtures with festuca buchloe exhibiting the lowest ct it has been reported that buchloe grass requires low levels of water for survival and that under semi arid conditions it needs less irrigation to maintain good turf quality than tall festuca or and zoysia grass hicks et al 1984 also lower evapotranspiration rates in buchloe dactyloides indicate that this species uses less water than selected ornamentals horst et al 1997 however our comparison between poa mixtures revealed that poa cynodon showed better performance under water deficit in this context the thick leaf cuticles and smaller stomatal openings zhou et al 2009 as well as the reduced leaf surface stoma density and lower water transpiration rate mukhtar et al 2013 of cynodon dactylon confer better tolerance to water stress compared to the other turfgrass species 4 3 soil moisture soil moisture sm values measured by the tdr 350 did not show any differences between the turfgrass species under limited or high irrigation table 4 fig 5d nevertheless the analyze combining all sm data of the six turfgrass mixtures evaluated in this study demonstrated difference between turfgrass growth under the two irrigation regimes table 3 in this context such sensors can indicate when the soil profile is full of water or dry and therefore healthy turf is maintained by avoiding plant stress caused by soil that is too dry or too waterlogged bremer and ham 2003 accordingly moisture sensors are among the most used devices to manage crop irrigation schemes and have been reported to improve irrigation efficacy in lawns parra et al 2019 we propose sm as a useful criterion for managing turf irrigation but not for distinguishing between turfgrass mixtures moreover the feasibility of sm sensing devices has also been addressed for the irrigation management of bermuda grass osborne et al 2002 we considerate the sm data obtained by the soil sensors in this study as indirect measures to evaluate the development of turfgrass species osborne et al 2002 reported that as sm decreases plants show a decrease in tissue moisture content which in turn influences their reflectance properties 4 4 relationship between ground and aerial optical remote sensing trait the two groups of vegetation indices ndvi and ground and aerial rgb images showed high and positive correlations between them fig 7 this result is in accordance with previous research adamsen et al 1999 2011 and confirms that these indices inform about biomass status in a comparable manner likewise there was a high association between gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb images however ga obtained by drone images is better than ga of ground images with respect to explaining the variability in turfgrass growth fig 5d fig 6 table 5 and was less labor intensive and with less time consuming the use of spectral vegetation indices derived from uav imagery is emerging as a rapid and cost efficient approach for plant phenotyping angelos et al 2017 in present many low cost drones with an integrated simple rgb camera are now available to take images of large turfgrass surfaces in a short time in this context zhang et al 2019 reported that unmanned aerial vehicle uav imagery is considered a powerful tool for turfgrass breeders allowing them to evaluate crop performance and greatly increase the efficacy of data collection in relatively large trials advantages in field of view spatial and temporal resolution furthermore the high correlation found between the ndvi and the gaaerial rgb index in this study allows us to confirm the reliability uav based measurements for selecting drought tolerant species in large areas the greenseeker hand held sensor a low cost practical device has proved useful for detecting turfgrass stress for small areas caturegli et al 2015 however proximal sensors would need to be complemented with special cameras on board uavs to monitor the entire surface of large areas caturegli et al 2015 4 5 comparative model using remote sensing methods for turfgrass breeding results of the lineal regression presented here showed the usefulness of the vegetation indices derived from rgb imagery to explain the differences between turfgrass species under the high irrigation of note the ga vegetation index derived from aerial imagery was the most important parameter chosen by the model and with a higher impact r2 0 85 moreover ndvi made a negligible contribution to explaining variability under high irrigation due to the problem of saturation in this context a saturated ndvi in higher periods of turfgrass activity informs less than rgb indices which are characterized by less evident saturation montes et al 2011 however under limited irrigation ndvi was the first criterion chosen by the regression model other authors indicated that the ndvi is an index based on the strong contrast between the near infrared and the red band reflectance of a vegetation canopy and this difference becomes extensive as canopy vegetation cover increases amani et al 1996 this would explain why the ndvi is a more appropriate approach to study stress conditions in sparse canopies or during the early senescence of plants casadesus et al 2007 aparicio et al 2000 however our study combined both ndvi and vegetation indices derived from rgb images for collecting more and complete information to discriminate between turfgrass species under the two irrigation regimes accordingly data fusion in remote sensing can facilitates estimations of biomass possibly resolving saturation difficulties observed with vis nir sensor data under higher density vegetation tilly et al 2015 likewise the path model performed in the present study confirms the stepwise result and reveals the high capacity of vegetation indices ndvi and both gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb to explain turfgrass variability specially the ga index derived from drone images under high irrigation where the water status parameters ct and sm have no direct effect on turfgrass species variability moreover under limited irrigation vegetation indices are still more important criterion to explain variability of turf in this case water stress conditions ct contribute to explaining the model although to a lower extent than the vegetation indices and have a direct effect on turf species variability we highlighted the importance of the conceptual model proposed in this study combining various remote sensing techniques to explain the variability in different turfgrass species growing under different water regimes the results of this study can be are expected to help breeders to select appropriate criteria for turfgrass phenotyping under distinct environmental conditions 5 conclusion this study demonstrates the efficiency of vegetation indices to reveal variability in the performance of turfgrass species under different growing conditions our results confirm the usefulness of the vegetation indices for phenotyping most drought tolerant turfgrass mixtures in terms of retaining greener biomass during periods of limited irrigation although the ndvi is extensively used to monitor changes in growth under different conditions here we have shown that the ga vegetation index derived from aerial images provides a better evaluation of turfgrass mixtures in a short time and with high efficiency furthermore the path analysis model developed confirms the importance of the traits assessed by remote sensing for establishing variability in turfgrass performance the path analysis and regression model revealed the most suitable criteria to be used in certain environmental conditions for discriminating between turfgrass species therefore optimized turfgrass breeding strategies can allow the precise and rapid in the case of drones phenotyping of a large numbers of turf mixtures to identify those with greatest tolerant to water stress contributing in this way in the preservation of water resources the grasslands sustainability and the environment protection in future work we propose to add thermography thermal imagery to the model for detecting water stress in the same turfgrass mixtures used in this study we believe that a strategy combining aerial rgb and thermal imagery may potentially enhance turfgrass phenotyping and help to rapidly identify those mixtures most tolerant to drought conditions or those with rapid green regeneration after a period of water stress since this study is our first work using vegetation indices ndvi and both gaaerial rgb and gaground rgb as well as the canopy temperature for the evaluation of six turfgrass mixtures and under small plot in the future works we planned to repeat the experiment through large areas of turfgrass in other experimental stations and under different growing conditions extending the area the size and the duration of the study contribute to extrapolate the results obtained to more regions of the mediterranean moreover the studies of nasrallah et al 2018 and 2019 have highlighted the efficiency of using satellite data in wheat phenotyping accordingly we also plan to use satellite imagery for grassland phenotyping in futures work increasing the years of experimentation under different environments and combining terrestrial remote sensing techniques with drone and satellite data can permit to obtain a wide range of results and to concrete them under different ecosystems declaration of competing

waterlogging for 10 d occurred in waxy maize it was the first to alter maize growth and physiology and then affecting grain quality waterlogging at v6 vt waxy maize were the most severe followed by vt r1 and r1 r3 keywords waxy maize waterlogging leaf physiological characteristic fresh ear yield grain quality 1 introduction rainfall in most areas rises and becomes more common with the global warming progresses ipcc 2021 according to statistics excessive rainfall can easily lead to waterlogging which affects 12 of the world s crop hectare and can result in up to 20 crop losses ren et al 2016a shabala 2011 waterlogging first impacts the root activity of crops and then affects the growth of aboveground plants gao et al 2018 during waterlogging air in soil pores is replaced by water resulting in hypoxia of crop roots suppression of root respiration stomatal closure reduction of co2 entry reduction of transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate and eventually crop yield reduction or failure pezeshki 1994 tian et al 2019 moreover waterlogging can cause the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros in plants which can cause membrane lipid peroxidation damage membrane homeostasis and produce superoxide anion radical o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as well as the accumulation of malondialdehyde mda and accelerate leaf senescence liu et al 2010 wang et al 2021a the antioxidant enzymes pod cat and sod etc can be triggered to alleviate and remove ros produced by plant cells induced by waterlogging gill et al 2019 jia et al 2019 tang et al 2010 wang et al 2019 studies have shown that waterlogging not only reduces crop yield but also reduces protein accumulation protein content and protein components resulting in lower grain starch and soluble sugar content ren et al 2013 wu et al 2013 waterlogging not only reduces the protein content and its components content of wheat grain and the ratio of glutenin to gliadin but also decreases the accumulation of starch starch content amylopectin content and the ratio of amylopectin to amylose wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 reported that waterlogging after anthesis inhibited the transformation of carbohydrates into starch in wheat grain otie et al 2019 suggested that waterlogging at v3 stage affected nutrient uptake and decreased grain protein content of maize ren et al 2013 found that waterlogging significantly decreased grain protein starch total soluble sugar and amylopectin while increase amylose of maize zea mays l and that the effect of waterlogging at v3 stage was the most significant followed by v6 and 10 d after flowering however in the study of wang et al 2021b waterlogging stress at grain maturity stage of waxy maize zea mays l var certaina kulesh reduced starch content but increased protein content conversely yang et al 2016 reported that waterlogging increased starch content and decreased protein content in waxy maize grain the different responses of grain quality to waterlogging between waxy maize and common maize maybe the distinct expresses of waxy gene wu et al 2022 the ear characteristics and grain quality standards for excellent fresh eating waxy maize are high demanded due to rich nutrient content and good palatability of waxy maize the planting area of fresh eating maize in china has now reached 1 34 million hectares xu et al 2010 however in recent decades some extreme weather resulted from climate changes occurring more frequently for example the heavy precipitation process in july 2016 in our experimental area 450 2 mm rainwater were given in about 5 days while the rainfall of 907 mm in about 6 days in july 2021 resulted in serious waterlogging and yield loss therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the effects of waterlogging at different growth stages on growth and grain quality of waxy maize 2 fully study the tolerance of waxy maize to waterlogging under the current soil texture and organic matter content

otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 effects of waterlogging at different growth stages on growth and development of waxy maize waterlogging had distinct effects on waxy maize growth at different growth stages and the alterations in the two growing seasons were essentially the same fig 2 table 4 waterlogging at v6 vt stage accelerated early growth of waxy maize compared with ck the plant height and leaf area index lai of wv6 vt treatment at vt stage increased by 10 0 and 21 6 respectively p 0 05 but at r3 stage the plant height and lai of wv6 vt treatment decreased by 11 5 and 15 3 respectively compared with ck the plant height and lai of wvt r1 treatment decreased by 6 4 and 13 9 at r1 stage and decreased by 4 0 and 11 4 at r3 stage respectively lai of wr1 r3 treatment decreased by 12 5 at r3 stage 3 2 effects of waterlogging on the physiological characteristics of waxy maize leaves 3 2 1 mda and antioxidant enzymes waterlogging at different growth stages increased mda content and antioxidant enzyme activity in waxy maize leaves fig 3 to maintain the dynamic balance of reactive oxygen species thereby reducing cell membrane peroxidation and triggering sod pod and cat activities and the activities of sod pod and cat decreased with the delay of waterlogging stage at the r3 stage of waxy maize the mda contents of wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments increased by 35 1 and 16 6 compared with ck p 0 05 respectively compared with ck the sod pod and cat activities of wv6 vt treatment increased by 42 9 156 3 and 55 6 respectively p 0 05 and those of wvt r1 treatment increased by 40 7 89 4 and 41 2 respectively p 0 05 compared with ck sod and pod in wr1 r3 treatment decreased by 28 2 and 24 0 respectively p 0 05 3 2 2 osmotic adjustment substances soluble protein soluble sugar and proline are important osmotic regulators in plant tissues and when plants are subjected to waterlogging these substances change to maintain cell water potential balance fig 4 at r3 stage compared with ck the soluble sugar soluble protein and proline of wv6 vt treatment decreased by 31 9 33 0 and 14 3 respectively p 0 05 and wvt r1 treatment decreased by 11 7 25 1 and 28 3 respectively p 0 05 while the soluble protein of wr1 r3 treatment increased by 35 1 p 0 05 3 2 3 photosynthetic characteristics waterlogging stress can lead to stomatal closure of plant leaves while the photosynthesis of waxy maize almost does not recover after waterlogging at different stages the changes of spad photosynthetic characteristics in the two growing seasons are basically the same fig 5 table 4 wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments decreased the spad fig 5a and g s fig 5c of waxy maize leaves resulting in a significant decrease in c i the decreased of c i caused by the decrease of spad and g s eventually led to the decrease of p n in wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments fig 5b the decrease of g s caused by waterlogging also led to the decrease of t r and t r in wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments decreased significantly fig 5e p 0 05 resulted in differences in lwue fig 5f and the lwue of leaves under drought treatment at different growth stages was wv6 vt wvt r1 wr1 r3 with the advancement of growth stage p n g s c i and t r increased while lwue decreased 3 3 effects of waterlogging on ear traits and yield of waxy maize waterlogging stress reduced the ear length ear diameter grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of waxy maize and the changes were consistent in the two growing seasons table 4 table 5 wv6 vt treatment had the greatest influence on ear length ear diameter grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of waxy maize followed by wvt r1 and wr1 r3 compared with ck the ear length ear diameter grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of wv6 vt treatment decreased by 19 9 8 4 18 3 and 16 2 p 0 05 and those of wvt r1 treatment decreased by 12 7 6 7 14 0 and 7 2 p 0 05 respectively while the bald tip length increased significantly under waterlogging at different growth stages the effect of waterlogging on ear traits eventually led to the decrease of ear yield th fresh ear yield with husks hfy and fresh ear yield fy in wv6 vt treatment were 34 5 and 35 7 lower than those in ck p 0 05 respectively the hfy and fy in wvt r1 treatment were 18 4 and 17 4 lower than those in ck p 0 05 respectively while the effect of wr1 r3 treatment on the yield of waxy maize was the smallest due to different waterlogging stages the maturity of ears at harvest were different resulting in different grain moisture contents the grain moisture contents of wv6 vt wvt r1 and wr1 r3 treatments were significantly lower than those of ck 3 4 effects of waterlogging on grain quality of waxy maize waterlogging stress decreased the total protein and soluble sugar content of fresh waxy maize grains and increased the starch and lysine content of grain fig 6 the effects of waterlogging at different growth stages on grain quality were different and the change trend of two growing seasons was consistent fig 6 table 4 the total protein fig 6a and soluble sugar contents fig 6b of wv6 vt treatment were the lowest which were 19 9 and 30 3 lower than those of ck p 0 05 followed by wvt r1 treatment which decreased by 9 5 and 20 7 respectively p 0 05 while the total protein content of wr1 r3 treatment also decreased significantly the starch content of wv6 vt treatment increased the most fig 7c with an increase of 31 9 p 0 05 followed by wvt r1 treatment with an increase of 19 1 p 0 05 and the starch content of wr1 r3 treatment decreased significantly wv6 vt treatment significantly increased lysine content in grain by 30 2 as waterlogging at v6 vt stage exhibited the most significant impactions on the total protein and starch content of waxy maize ears fig 6 the changes of amylose amylopectin and component protein content of waxy maize ears treated with wv6 vt were compared to further reveal effects of waterlogging on grain quality as shown in table 6 compared with ck the amylose and amylopectin content of waxy maize ears treated with wv6 vt increased by 26 7 and 32 5 respectively p 0 05 the protein content of each component in wv6 vt treatment was significantly decreased and the contents of gliadin glutenin albumin and globulin were decreased by 31 9 8 6 32 2 and 39 6 respectively p 0 05 3 5 principal component analysis principal component analysis was performed on all indexes of waxy maize in the two growing seasons three principal components pc1 pc2 and pc3 were extracted from the data of 2019 and 2020 λ 1 and the eigenvalues λ of principal component 1 pc1 in 2019 and 2020 were 21 15 and 14 02 respectively which explained 81 3 and 73 8 of the total variation respectively table 7 the λ of pc2 in 2019 and 2020 were 3 14 and 3 88 which explained 12 1 and 20 4 of the total variation respectively the λ of pc3 in 2019 and 2020 were 1 72 and 1 11 which explained 6 6 and 5 8 of the total variation respectively table 7 the maximum load in 2019 was plant height followed by proline c i starch and leaf soluble sugar the largest load variable in 2020 was lwue followed by starch soluble sugar lysine and spad fig 7 this indicated that waterlogging had the greatest impact on the growth and physiology of waxy maize plants followed by the grain quality of waxy maize the comprehensive scores of wv6 vt wvt r1 and wr1 r3 treatments were lower than those of ck and the comprehensive scores increased with the waterlogging stage fig 8 therefore wv6 vt treatment had the greatest impact on waxy maize followed by wvt r1 and wr1 r3 treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of waterlogging on leaf physiological characteristics of waxy maize at different growth stages in this study wv6 vt treatment accelerated the growth of waxy maize however plant height and lai were considerably lower in wv6 vt treatment than in the ck at the r3 stage waterlogging not only inhibits waxy maize growth but it also causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros membrane lipid peroxidation and disruption of membrane homeostasis resulting in increased o2 h2o2 and mda concentrations and in order to scavenge ros sod pod and cat activities will increase to protect plants from ros damage gill et al 2019 jia et al 2019 ren et al 2018 wang et al 2021a 2019 sod catalyzes the conversion of o2 to h2o2 while cat and pod convert h2o2 to o2 and h2o salah et al 2019a in this study wv6 vt treatment showed the highest increase in leaf mda content at r3 followed by wvt r1 and the activities of sod pod and cat increased significantly many studies mahmood et al 2021 salah et al 2019b tang et al 2010 wang et al 2021c have also shown that waterlogging can increase sod pod and cat activities due to the up regulation of antioxidant genes cat and pod expression under waterlogging stress conditions it may be that excessive water activates the response of non hydraulic root signal nhrs to waterlogging and under the regulation of nhrs ros generation of waxy maize is significantly enhanced and then the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as pod cat and sod were truly enhanced gui et al 2021 batool et al 2019 mda changes were minimal under wr1 r3 treatment while the highest levels were still found in the wv6 vt treatment at the r3 stage indicating that the plants recovered poorly after the lifting of waterlogging at the v6 vt stage this result is similar to liu et al 2013 who found that means the compensatory growth capacity of flooded plants was weak at the jointing stage waterlogging also leads to the leaf proteins degradation resulting in a significant decrease in soluble protein ren et al 2014a tang et al 2010 which was significantly reduced in both wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments as well as soluble sugars and proline content in our study the results are similar to the tang et al 2010 and ren et al 2014a but soluble protein increased significantly in the wr1 r3 treatment it further indicates that the physiology of waxy maize leaves was also shown to be most affected by v6 vt waterlogging while it was least affected by r1 r3 waterlogging waterlogging leads to a reduction in leaf area and accelerates leaf senescence then causes the decrease in photosynthetic characteristics ren et al 2016a in our study leaf p n g s c i and t r were significantly reduced in wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments at r3 stage obviously waterlogging affected leaf stomata resulted in c i decrease and reduced photosynthesis and transpiration this is similar to the findings of ren et al 2016a ashraf and habib ur rehman 1999 and wang et al 2021c namely g s of maize reduced significantly under waterlogging and p n c i and t r decreased significantly and p n reduction was mainly affected by stomatal factors ren et al 2018 2016a salah et al 2019a in our study the wv6 vt treatment showed a significant increase in c i and a significant decrease in p n at the end of waterlogging at the v6 vt stage in 2019 which indicates that the decrease in photosynthesis was also limited by non stomatal factors mainly due to a decrease in the activity of the leaf photosynthetic enzymes ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate rubp carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate pep carboxylase after waterlogging which in turn limited photosynthesis ren et al 2018 2014a tian et al 2019 simultaneously because waterlogging limits nutrient absorption nitrogen absorption is reduced resulted in a drop in chlorophyll and spad levels in leaves reduced photosynthesis men et al 2020 tuo et al 2015 4 2 effects of waterlogging on yield and yield traits of waxy maize at different growth stages with the advancement of growth period the effect of waterlogging on fresh ear yield of waxy maize showed a decreasing trend with hfy and fy decreasing the most under wv6 vt treatment followed by wvt r1 table 5 previous studies indicated that waterlogging reduced the grain storage capacity filling rate and filling length of maize ren et al 2016b 2014b shin et al 2017 thereby reduced maize silage yield and grain yield kaur et al 2020 ren et al 2016c which is similar to our study in our previous study with common maize it was also found that waterlogging at the jointing stage had the greatest effect on maize yield and its components and the yield reduction was mainly affected by the grain number per ear and 100 grain weight huang et al 2022 and waterlogging at v3 v6 flowering and post flowering stages of maize caused a reduction in the grain number per ear and 100 grain weight which in turn led to yield reduction in the present study the grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of waxy maize were reduced the most in wv6 vt treatment waterlogging at the jointing stage led to a decrease in n concentration in the main stalk of the maize which in turn limited the nutritional growth of maize resulting in lower dry matter accumulation and also limited normal flowering and spatulation otie et al 2019 zaidi et al 2004 which in turn led to a decrease in the grain number per ear and 100 grain weight in our study less dry matter accumulation due to severe leaf senescence and significantly reduced photosynthesis in wv6 vt treatment and grain water content was significantly reduced in the wv6 vt treatment this was mainly due to the waterlogging at the jointing stage leading to shortening of the filling stage ren et al 2016b early maturity of the seeds and reduction of water content 4 3 effects of waterlogging on grain quality of waxy maize at different growth stages waterlogging not only affects nutrient absorption and grain filling of maize but also changes grain quality the nitrogen accumulation in various organs and the nitrogen distribution rate in maize grains decreased as a result of waterlogging otie et al 2019 ren et al 2021 resulting in a decrease in total protein content in grains and protein degradation under waterlogging conditions and then a decrease in protein content tang et al 2010 in the present experiment waterlogging during various growth stages resulted in varying degrees of total protein loss in grains with the total protein loss being greatest in the wv6 vt treatment and the amounts of gliadin glutenin albumin and globulin all significantly reduced table 6 yang et al 2016 found that waterlogging at flowering and post anthesis stages can diminish protein albumin and glutenin content in maize kernels which is similar with the findings of this study waterlogging not only reduces grain protein level but it also reduces starch and soluble sugar content significantly ren et al 2013 while in our study wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments resulted in an increase in starch content and a decrease in soluble sugar content as well as an increase in amylopectin and amylose content under wv6 vt treatment whereas wr1 r3 treatment resulted in a decrease in starch content our results were different from the founding of ren et al 2013 because their results were based on mature grains while the starch content in this study and yang et al 2016 were based on data from fresh grain that is wv6 vt treatment significantly reduced grain moisture content at r3 stage aba content in leaves increased after waterlogging and aba increased the activity of key enzymes that transformed soluble sugar into starch ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 thereby accelerating the maturation of maize grains and accumulating starch in advance resulting in the decrease of soluble sugar and the increase of starch content in grains at r3 stage and waterlogging may limit the transfer of soluble sugar in stems to kernels resulting in the decrease of soluble sugar in grains araki et al 2012 while post anthesis waterlogging may inhibit the transformation of soluble sugar to starch in grains zhou et al 2018 our results also showed that wv6 vt and wvt r1 significantly increased grain lysine content the results of pca fig 7 showed that the antioxidant enzymes gas exchange parameters in leaves and plant growth were first affected when waterlogging occurred in waxy maize and then affected the grain quality as well as affected the ear growth resulting in the decrease of grain number per ear and 100 grain weight and decrease in water content in fresh grains due to early maturity of grains thereby affecting grain yield 5 conclusion waterlogging imposed at the jointing stage has the greatest impact on waxy maize growth and development ear yield and grain quality it s vital to avoid it at this stage of the waxy maize planting management process it has little effect on growth and development at the r1 r3 stages ear yield and grain total protein soluble sugar and starch content because it can mitigate the negative effects of waterlogging in time after waterlogging at the stages however the waterlogging duration set in this experiment was 10 d and the change process of waxy maize growth physiology and grain quality with the increase of waterlogging duration could not be understood thus further research is needed on this basis i e different waterlogging durations were set to investigate the variations in waxy maize growth physiology and grain quality under various waterlogging conditions declaration of competing

9571,a waterlogging experiment under a rain shelter was used to investigate the response mechanism of waxy maize plant growth ear yield and quality to waterlogging at various growth stages waterlogging for 10 d were carried out at v6 vt wv6 vt vt r1 wvt r1 and r1 r3 wr1 r3 stages of waxy maize in lysimeters in 2019 and 2020 seasons and non waterlogging was used as control ck the results showed that waterlogging at v6 vt had the highest impact on waxy maize growth fresh ear yield and grain quality followed by that at the vt r1 and finally that at the r1 r3 during the waterlogging at v6 vt the growth of waxy maize plants was accelerated while the gas exchange parameters in leaves were decreased however the plant height leaf area index lai and gas exchange parameters of the wv6 vt treatment were significantly lower than those of ck at r3 compared with ck the content of malondialdehyde mda and the activities of superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat in leaves increased whereas the contents of soluble sugar soluble protein and proline in leaves decreased as a result waxy maize ear length grain number per ear 100 grain weight and fresh ear yield fell and grain quality suffered as well total protein and soluble sugar content in grains decreased but starch and lysine content in grains increased principal component analysis pca revealed that when waterlogging for 10 d occurred in waxy maize it was the first to alter maize growth and physiology and then affecting grain quality waterlogging at v6 vt waxy maize were the most severe followed by vt r1 and r1 r3 keywords waxy maize waterlogging leaf physiological characteristic fresh ear yield grain quality 1 introduction rainfall in most areas rises and becomes more common with the global warming progresses ipcc 2021 according to statistics excessive rainfall can easily lead to waterlogging which affects 12 of the world s crop hectare and can result in up to 20 crop losses ren et al 2016a shabala 2011 waterlogging first impacts the root activity of crops and then affects the growth of aboveground plants gao et al 2018 during waterlogging air in soil pores is replaced by water resulting in hypoxia of crop roots suppression of root respiration stomatal closure reduction of co2 entry reduction of transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate and eventually crop yield reduction or failure pezeshki 1994 tian et al 2019 moreover waterlogging can cause the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros in plants which can cause membrane lipid peroxidation damage membrane homeostasis and produce superoxide anion radical o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as well as the accumulation of malondialdehyde mda and accelerate leaf senescence liu et al 2010 wang et al 2021a the antioxidant enzymes pod cat and sod etc can be triggered to alleviate and remove ros produced by plant cells induced by waterlogging gill et al 2019 jia et al 2019 tang et al 2010 wang et al 2019 studies have shown that waterlogging not only reduces crop yield but also reduces protein accumulation protein content and protein components resulting in lower grain starch and soluble sugar content ren et al 2013 wu et al 2013 waterlogging not only reduces the protein content and its components content of wheat grain and the ratio of glutenin to gliadin but also decreases the accumulation of starch starch content amylopectin content and the ratio of amylopectin to amylose wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 reported that waterlogging after anthesis inhibited the transformation of carbohydrates into starch in wheat grain otie et al 2019 suggested that waterlogging at v3 stage affected nutrient uptake and decreased grain protein content of maize ren et al 2013 found that waterlogging significantly decreased grain protein starch total soluble sugar and amylopectin while increase amylose of maize zea mays l and that the effect of waterlogging at v3 stage was the most significant followed by v6 and 10 d after flowering however in the study of wang et al 2021b waterlogging stress at grain maturity stage of waxy maize zea mays l var certaina kulesh reduced starch content but increased protein content conversely yang et al 2016 reported that waterlogging increased starch content and decreased protein content in waxy maize grain the different responses of grain quality to waterlogging between waxy maize and common maize maybe the distinct expresses of waxy gene wu et al 2022 the ear characteristics and grain quality standards for excellent fresh eating waxy maize are high demanded due to rich nutrient content and good palatability of waxy maize the planting area of fresh eating maize in china has now reached 1 34 million hectares xu et al 2010 however in recent decades some extreme weather resulted from climate changes occurring more frequently for example the heavy precipitation process in july 2016 in our experimental area 450 2 mm rainwater were given in about 5 days while the rainfall of 907 mm in about 6 days in july 2021 resulted in serious waterlogging and yield loss therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the effects of waterlogging at different growth stages on growth and grain quality of waxy maize 2 fully study the tolerance of waxy maize to waterlogging under the current soil texture and organic matter content

otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 effects of waterlogging at different growth stages on growth and development of waxy maize waterlogging had distinct effects on waxy maize growth at different growth stages and the alterations in the two growing seasons were essentially the same fig 2 table 4 waterlogging at v6 vt stage accelerated early growth of waxy maize compared with ck the plant height and leaf area index lai of wv6 vt treatment at vt stage increased by 10 0 and 21 6 respectively p 0 05 but at r3 stage the plant height and lai of wv6 vt treatment decreased by 11 5 and 15 3 respectively compared with ck the plant height and lai of wvt r1 treatment decreased by 6 4 and 13 9 at r1 stage and decreased by 4 0 and 11 4 at r3 stage respectively lai of wr1 r3 treatment decreased by 12 5 at r3 stage 3 2 effects of waterlogging on the physiological characteristics of waxy maize leaves 3 2 1 mda and antioxidant enzymes waterlogging at different growth stages increased mda content and antioxidant enzyme activity in waxy maize leaves fig 3 to maintain the dynamic balance of reactive oxygen species thereby reducing cell membrane peroxidation and triggering sod pod and cat activities and the activities of sod pod and cat decreased with the delay of waterlogging stage at the r3 stage of waxy maize the mda contents of wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments increased by 35 1 and 16 6 compared with ck p 0 05 respectively compared with ck the sod pod and cat activities of wv6 vt treatment increased by 42 9 156 3 and 55 6 respectively p 0 05 and those of wvt r1 treatment increased by 40 7 89 4 and 41 2 respectively p 0 05 compared with ck sod and pod in wr1 r3 treatment decreased by 28 2 and 24 0 respectively p 0 05 3 2 2 osmotic adjustment substances soluble protein soluble sugar and proline are important osmotic regulators in plant tissues and when plants are subjected to waterlogging these substances change to maintain cell water potential balance fig 4 at r3 stage compared with ck the soluble sugar soluble protein and proline of wv6 vt treatment decreased by 31 9 33 0 and 14 3 respectively p 0 05 and wvt r1 treatment decreased by 11 7 25 1 and 28 3 respectively p 0 05 while the soluble protein of wr1 r3 treatment increased by 35 1 p 0 05 3 2 3 photosynthetic characteristics waterlogging stress can lead to stomatal closure of plant leaves while the photosynthesis of waxy maize almost does not recover after waterlogging at different stages the changes of spad photosynthetic characteristics in the two growing seasons are basically the same fig 5 table 4 wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments decreased the spad fig 5a and g s fig 5c of waxy maize leaves resulting in a significant decrease in c i the decreased of c i caused by the decrease of spad and g s eventually led to the decrease of p n in wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments fig 5b the decrease of g s caused by waterlogging also led to the decrease of t r and t r in wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments decreased significantly fig 5e p 0 05 resulted in differences in lwue fig 5f and the lwue of leaves under drought treatment at different growth stages was wv6 vt wvt r1 wr1 r3 with the advancement of growth stage p n g s c i and t r increased while lwue decreased 3 3 effects of waterlogging on ear traits and yield of waxy maize waterlogging stress reduced the ear length ear diameter grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of waxy maize and the changes were consistent in the two growing seasons table 4 table 5 wv6 vt treatment had the greatest influence on ear length ear diameter grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of waxy maize followed by wvt r1 and wr1 r3 compared with ck the ear length ear diameter grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of wv6 vt treatment decreased by 19 9 8 4 18 3 and 16 2 p 0 05 and those of wvt r1 treatment decreased by 12 7 6 7 14 0 and 7 2 p 0 05 respectively while the bald tip length increased significantly under waterlogging at different growth stages the effect of waterlogging on ear traits eventually led to the decrease of ear yield th fresh ear yield with husks hfy and fresh ear yield fy in wv6 vt treatment were 34 5 and 35 7 lower than those in ck p 0 05 respectively the hfy and fy in wvt r1 treatment were 18 4 and 17 4 lower than those in ck p 0 05 respectively while the effect of wr1 r3 treatment on the yield of waxy maize was the smallest due to different waterlogging stages the maturity of ears at harvest were different resulting in different grain moisture contents the grain moisture contents of wv6 vt wvt r1 and wr1 r3 treatments were significantly lower than those of ck 3 4 effects of waterlogging on grain quality of waxy maize waterlogging stress decreased the total protein and soluble sugar content of fresh waxy maize grains and increased the starch and lysine content of grain fig 6 the effects of waterlogging at different growth stages on grain quality were different and the change trend of two growing seasons was consistent fig 6 table 4 the total protein fig 6a and soluble sugar contents fig 6b of wv6 vt treatment were the lowest which were 19 9 and 30 3 lower than those of ck p 0 05 followed by wvt r1 treatment which decreased by 9 5 and 20 7 respectively p 0 05 while the total protein content of wr1 r3 treatment also decreased significantly the starch content of wv6 vt treatment increased the most fig 7c with an increase of 31 9 p 0 05 followed by wvt r1 treatment with an increase of 19 1 p 0 05 and the starch content of wr1 r3 treatment decreased significantly wv6 vt treatment significantly increased lysine content in grain by 30 2 as waterlogging at v6 vt stage exhibited the most significant impactions on the total protein and starch content of waxy maize ears fig 6 the changes of amylose amylopectin and component protein content of waxy maize ears treated with wv6 vt were compared to further reveal effects of waterlogging on grain quality as shown in table 6 compared with ck the amylose and amylopectin content of waxy maize ears treated with wv6 vt increased by 26 7 and 32 5 respectively p 0 05 the protein content of each component in wv6 vt treatment was significantly decreased and the contents of gliadin glutenin albumin and globulin were decreased by 31 9 8 6 32 2 and 39 6 respectively p 0 05 3 5 principal component analysis principal component analysis was performed on all indexes of waxy maize in the two growing seasons three principal components pc1 pc2 and pc3 were extracted from the data of 2019 and 2020 λ 1 and the eigenvalues λ of principal component 1 pc1 in 2019 and 2020 were 21 15 and 14 02 respectively which explained 81 3 and 73 8 of the total variation respectively table 7 the λ of pc2 in 2019 and 2020 were 3 14 and 3 88 which explained 12 1 and 20 4 of the total variation respectively the λ of pc3 in 2019 and 2020 were 1 72 and 1 11 which explained 6 6 and 5 8 of the total variation respectively table 7 the maximum load in 2019 was plant height followed by proline c i starch and leaf soluble sugar the largest load variable in 2020 was lwue followed by starch soluble sugar lysine and spad fig 7 this indicated that waterlogging had the greatest impact on the growth and physiology of waxy maize plants followed by the grain quality of waxy maize the comprehensive scores of wv6 vt wvt r1 and wr1 r3 treatments were lower than those of ck and the comprehensive scores increased with the waterlogging stage fig 8 therefore wv6 vt treatment had the greatest impact on waxy maize followed by wvt r1 and wr1 r3 treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of waterlogging on leaf physiological characteristics of waxy maize at different growth stages in this study wv6 vt treatment accelerated the growth of waxy maize however plant height and lai were considerably lower in wv6 vt treatment than in the ck at the r3 stage waterlogging not only inhibits waxy maize growth but it also causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros membrane lipid peroxidation and disruption of membrane homeostasis resulting in increased o2 h2o2 and mda concentrations and in order to scavenge ros sod pod and cat activities will increase to protect plants from ros damage gill et al 2019 jia et al 2019 ren et al 2018 wang et al 2021a 2019 sod catalyzes the conversion of o2 to h2o2 while cat and pod convert h2o2 to o2 and h2o salah et al 2019a in this study wv6 vt treatment showed the highest increase in leaf mda content at r3 followed by wvt r1 and the activities of sod pod and cat increased significantly many studies mahmood et al 2021 salah et al 2019b tang et al 2010 wang et al 2021c have also shown that waterlogging can increase sod pod and cat activities due to the up regulation of antioxidant genes cat and pod expression under waterlogging stress conditions it may be that excessive water activates the response of non hydraulic root signal nhrs to waterlogging and under the regulation of nhrs ros generation of waxy maize is significantly enhanced and then the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as pod cat and sod were truly enhanced gui et al 2021 batool et al 2019 mda changes were minimal under wr1 r3 treatment while the highest levels were still found in the wv6 vt treatment at the r3 stage indicating that the plants recovered poorly after the lifting of waterlogging at the v6 vt stage this result is similar to liu et al 2013 who found that means the compensatory growth capacity of flooded plants was weak at the jointing stage waterlogging also leads to the leaf proteins degradation resulting in a significant decrease in soluble protein ren et al 2014a tang et al 2010 which was significantly reduced in both wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments as well as soluble sugars and proline content in our study the results are similar to the tang et al 2010 and ren et al 2014a but soluble protein increased significantly in the wr1 r3 treatment it further indicates that the physiology of waxy maize leaves was also shown to be most affected by v6 vt waterlogging while it was least affected by r1 r3 waterlogging waterlogging leads to a reduction in leaf area and accelerates leaf senescence then causes the decrease in photosynthetic characteristics ren et al 2016a in our study leaf p n g s c i and t r were significantly reduced in wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments at r3 stage obviously waterlogging affected leaf stomata resulted in c i decrease and reduced photosynthesis and transpiration this is similar to the findings of ren et al 2016a ashraf and habib ur rehman 1999 and wang et al 2021c namely g s of maize reduced significantly under waterlogging and p n c i and t r decreased significantly and p n reduction was mainly affected by stomatal factors ren et al 2018 2016a salah et al 2019a in our study the wv6 vt treatment showed a significant increase in c i and a significant decrease in p n at the end of waterlogging at the v6 vt stage in 2019 which indicates that the decrease in photosynthesis was also limited by non stomatal factors mainly due to a decrease in the activity of the leaf photosynthetic enzymes ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate rubp carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate pep carboxylase after waterlogging which in turn limited photosynthesis ren et al 2018 2014a tian et al 2019 simultaneously because waterlogging limits nutrient absorption nitrogen absorption is reduced resulted in a drop in chlorophyll and spad levels in leaves reduced photosynthesis men et al 2020 tuo et al 2015 4 2 effects of waterlogging on yield and yield traits of waxy maize at different growth stages with the advancement of growth period the effect of waterlogging on fresh ear yield of waxy maize showed a decreasing trend with hfy and fy decreasing the most under wv6 vt treatment followed by wvt r1 table 5 previous studies indicated that waterlogging reduced the grain storage capacity filling rate and filling length of maize ren et al 2016b 2014b shin et al 2017 thereby reduced maize silage yield and grain yield kaur et al 2020 ren et al 2016c which is similar to our study in our previous study with common maize it was also found that waterlogging at the jointing stage had the greatest effect on maize yield and its components and the yield reduction was mainly affected by the grain number per ear and 100 grain weight huang et al 2022 and waterlogging at v3 v6 flowering and post flowering stages of maize caused a reduction in the grain number per ear and 100 grain weight which in turn led to yield reduction in the present study the grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of waxy maize were reduced the most in wv6 vt treatment waterlogging at the jointing stage led to a decrease in n concentration in the main stalk of the maize which in turn limited the nutritional growth of maize resulting in lower dry matter accumulation and also limited normal flowering and spatulation otie et al 2019 zaidi et al 2004 which in turn led to a decrease in the grain number per ear and 100 grain weight in our study less dry matter accumulation due to severe leaf senescence and significantly reduced photosynthesis in wv6 vt treatment and grain water content was significantly reduced in the wv6 vt treatment this was mainly due to the waterlogging at the jointing stage leading to shortening of the filling stage ren et al 2016b early maturity of the seeds and reduction of water content 4 3 effects of waterlogging on grain quality of waxy maize at different growth stages waterlogging not only affects nutrient absorption and grain filling of maize but also changes grain quality the nitrogen accumulation in various organs and the nitrogen distribution rate in maize grains decreased as a result of waterlogging otie et al 2019 ren et al 2021 resulting in a decrease in total protein content in grains and protein degradation under waterlogging conditions and then a decrease in protein content tang et al 2010 in the present experiment waterlogging during various growth stages resulted in varying degrees of total protein loss in grains with the total protein loss being greatest in the wv6 vt treatment and the amounts of gliadin glutenin albumin and globulin all significantly reduced table 6 yang et al 2016 found that waterlogging at flowering and post anthesis stages can diminish protein albumin and glutenin content in maize kernels which is similar with the findings of this study waterlogging not only reduces grain protein level but it also reduces starch and soluble sugar content significantly ren et al 2013 while in our study wv6 vt and wvt r1 treatments resulted in an increase in starch content and a decrease in soluble sugar content as well as an increase in amylopectin and amylose content under wv6 vt treatment whereas wr1 r3 treatment resulted in a decrease in starch content our results were different from the founding of ren et al 2013 because their results were based on mature grains while the starch content in this study and yang et al 2016 were based on data from fresh grain that is wv6 vt treatment significantly reduced grain moisture content at r3 stage aba content in leaves increased after waterlogging and aba increased the activity of key enzymes that transformed soluble sugar into starch ren et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 thereby accelerating the maturation of maize grains and accumulating starch in advance resulting in the decrease of soluble sugar and the increase of starch content in grains at r3 stage and waterlogging may limit the transfer of soluble sugar in stems to kernels resulting in the decrease of soluble sugar in grains araki et al 2012 while post anthesis waterlogging may inhibit the transformation of soluble sugar to starch in grains zhou et al 2018 our results also showed that wv6 vt and wvt r1 significantly increased grain lysine content the results of pca fig 7 showed that the antioxidant enzymes gas exchange parameters in leaves and plant growth were first affected when waterlogging occurred in waxy maize and then affected the grain quality as well as affected the ear growth resulting in the decrease of grain number per ear and 100 grain weight and decrease in water content in fresh grains due to early maturity of grains thereby affecting grain yield 5 conclusion waterlogging imposed at the jointing stage has the greatest impact on waxy maize growth and development ear yield and grain quality it s vital to avoid it at this stage of the waxy maize planting management process it has little effect on growth and development at the r1 r3 stages ear yield and grain total protein soluble sugar and starch content because it can mitigate the negative effects of waterlogging in time after waterlogging at the stages however the waterlogging duration set in this experiment was 10 d and the change process of waxy maize growth physiology and grain quality with the increase of waterlogging duration could not be understood thus further research is needed on this basis i e different waterlogging durations were set to investigate the variations in waxy maize growth physiology and grain quality under various waterlogging conditions declaration of competing

9572,resilience and efficiency are the core concepts of sustainable management of agricultural water resources system this study constructed an evaluation system of the efficiency and resilience of agricultural water resources system e awrs r awrs in the yellow river basin by comprehensively applying the analytic hierarchy process ahp entropy method evm sbm dea model and the development coordination model the results showed that 1 from 2005 2019 the e awrs and r awrs showed a fluctuating upward trend the e awrs increased significantly especially the baihe heihe luohe and wudinghe river basins grew at a faster rate however the overall efficiency levels were still not high and all the 72 prefecture level administrative units were inefficient areas the r awrs was at a relatively low level in which the huangshui taohe and qingshuihe river basins had rapid growth in resilience 2 from the perspective of spatial differentiation characteristics the e awrs in sichuan qinghai inner mongolia shaanxi henan and shandong was relatively high while that in gansu shanxi and ningxia was relatively low the prefecture level administrative units of the upstream river source area hetao irrigation district fenwei plain and huanghuaihai plain had a relatively high e awrs the r awrs in the lower reaches was significantly better than that in the upper and middle reaches 3 the development degree of the agricultural water resources system has gone through a process of rapid rise 2005 2013 fluctuating growth 2014 2017 rise 2018 2019 showing an upstream midstream downstream stepwise increasing pattern the coordination degree of the agricultural water resources system showed a downward trend and the decrease showed an upstream downstream midstream increasing pattern 4 the three clusters divided by the average value of the development degree and coordination degree of the agricultural water resources system showed the changes from concentration to dispersion in contrast the coordination degree was gradually decreased keywords agricultural water resources resilience efficiency development coordination relationship yellow river basin 1 introduction water resources are basic natural resources and strategic economic resources that maintain the sustainable development of agriculture he et al 2020 with rapid population growth fast urbanization increasing economic development and climate change johnson et al 2001 luo et al 2020 especially in response to the competition for water system services from other economic sectors such as the increase in industry life and ecological water consumption water resources that can be used for agriculture are increasingly compressed xue et al 2017 qin et al 2020 in addition the future global population increase and the uncertainty caused by climate change will pose potential challenges to food production worthington and hutchinson 2005 eyshi rezaei et al 2017 tooley et al 2021 therefore whether water resources can be used efficiently and sustainably in the process of agricultural production is an important factor that determines global water resources and food security in china the total amount of water used in agriculture has decreased while grain production demand has continued to increase since 1990 the contradiction of reduced water but increased food production has become prominent wang and mei 2017 water resources have become one of the main factors restricting food production wang et al 2014 cao et al 2021 as china s development has entered a new era higher and more comprehensive requirements have been put forward for water resources management the speed and scale growth mode that relied on high input and low output in the past will gradually shift to the high quality and profitable growth mode with the coordinated efficiency and resilience development of the water resources system sun and meng 2020 therefore it is crucial to explore agricultural water management schemes under resilience efficiency nexus to promote sustainable agricultural development resilience and efficiency are critical to agricultural water management zhu et al 2021 from the proposal of suggestions for improving resource efficiency and strengthening the system against systemic risks by the international human dimensions programme ihdp to the implementation of integrating the resource efficiency agenda into the water resources management by the united nations environment programme unep and the world bank integration the interaction between resilience and efficiency has an increasing theoretical and practical significance trump et al 2018 world bank 2021 unep 2021 resilience refers to the ability of a region or a system to resist recover adapt and transform after a shock martin 2012 guan et al 2021 resilience of agricultural water resources system r awrs can be defined as the ability of agricultural water system to resist external pressure risk environmental and other shocks and disturbances the recovery ability to repair the damaged parts and maintain the equilibrium of the water system or the debugging ability to shift the system to a better state through adjustment adaptation learning renewal transformation etc the agricultural water resources system is complex dynamic and adaptable and improving resilience can protect the sustainable development of agriculture from potential disturbances as systems that lack resilience are fragile and unsustainable efficiency of agricultural water resources system e awrs which is another key element of water resource management refers to improving the efficiency of water resource allocation enhancing efficient output and promoting sustainable growth of the agricultural economy liu et al 2021 yao and liu 2021a 2021b according to the interpretations of the concept of e awrs and r awrs resilience emphasizes the recovery and shock resistance of agricultural water systems while efficiency emphasizes low input and high output this does not mean the contradiction between them instead they need to be well interrelated the agricultural development in china is affected by complex disturbances such as climate change ecological environmental pollution natural man made disasters water shortages and labor reduction shi et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b luo et al 2021 under the pressure of external environmental uncertainty and internal structural changes and upgrading the sustainable management of agricultural water resources urgently needs diversified and resilient policies optimizing the allocation of water resources and improving its professional management level and efficiency have become the main components of sustainable management of agricultural water resources guo et al 2021 resilience and efficiency can improve the way for humans to independently or comprehensively understand and respond to uncertainties and risks in a changing agricultural water resources system in addition decision makers and managers need to clearly understand the possible relations and tensions between the resilience and efficiency of the system thereby eliminating the outdated management model and avoiding problems in the sustainable management process of agricultural water resources currently scholars have conducted a series of studies on the resilience of water resources system and the main research areas include theoretical construction evaluation and measurement and resilience strategies of water system resilience zevenbergen et al 2008 tanner et al 2009 however research on the resilience of water resources is mostly limited to the quantitative analysis and evaluation of water resources resilience itself ignoring the thought of evolutionary economic geography in which the institutional environment and cultural factors are important factors that affect the resilience of agricultural water resources system as regard to water resources efficiency research mainly focuses on the measurement and evaluation driving factors and influencing mechanisms of water use efficiency kaneko etal 2004 sun et al 2011 chen et al 2015 yao and liu 2021a 2021b existing studies have commonalities in the selection of water efficiency evaluation indicators to be specific the input and output of production factors such as labor and capital are single and generally reflected in the growth of gdp while in the actual production in addition to the desired output the non desired outputs such as pollution should also be considered to better measure the environmental benefits of water use efficiency ma et al 2012 sun and meng 2020 guo et al 2021 despite the growing importance of resilience and efficiency in the sustainable development agenda especially in agricultural water resource management there has been a lack of analysis of the relationship between them the objectives of this study are to 1 construct a resilience index system for agricultural water resources system based on the economic social and ecological environment perspectives and measure the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 using the subjective and objective synthetic weighting method and the sbm model and 2 introduce a development coordination model to organically combine the e awrs and r awrs and explore the development coordination relationship between them this study aims to provide a reference for the ecological protection of the yellow river basin the implementation of national major strategies for high quality development and the utilization and sustainable management of water resources in china 2 methodology 2 1 case study area in the context of global warming and the impact of human activities such as urbanization farmland irrigation and conversion of farmland to forests the amount of water resources in the yellow river basin is generally decreasing lu et al 2021 in particular the rapid economic and social development has an increasing demand for water making water shortage to be a long term problem in social development zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b lu et al 2022 in 2018 the total water consumption in the basin was 127 09 billion m3 of which the proportion of agricultural water consumption was 64 20 815 90 billion m3 higher than the national agricultural water consumption proportion by 2 80 however the average water per mu of arable land was 324 m3 which was only 17 of the average water per mu of arable land in china qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia and other upstream areas account for a large proportion of agricultural water use the agricultural water use efficiency in the yellow river basin is generally not high the effective utilization coefficients of farmland irrigation water in shanxi sichuan qinghai inner mongolia and ningxia are 0 543 0 473 0 499 0 543 and 0 535 respectively which is lower than the national average of 0 554 and is in line with developed countries compared with the level of 0 7 there is a big gap and there is a large potential for water saving at the same time food production and energy development in the yellow river basin are highly dependent on water resources and changes in ecological water use will also exacerbate water shortages in the basin cai et al 2004 feng et al 2016 as a key area of national food security especially the yellow river irrigation area the yellow river basin has made a great contribution to the national food security strategy but the problem of inefficient use of agricultural water resources has not been well resolved zhang et al 2021 after the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin has been elevated to a major national strategy china has put forward higher requirements for the allocation of water resources in the basin zhao and yu 2020 zhang et al 2021 therefore there is an urgent need for solutions to agricultural water resources security and food security based on ensuring water safety for production living and ecological water in the river basin through multi objective collaborative optimization peng et al 2017 with this purpose this study selected 72 prefecture level administrative units in the yellow river basin fig 1 as the study area to carry out a collaborative analysis of the efficiency and resilience of the agricultural water resources system aiming to provide a scientific basis for improving the utilization efficiency and management capabilities of agricultural water resources in the yellow river basin 2 2 construction of index system the analysis framework of system resilience capability can conduct highly standardized and systematic research on the resilience capability of a system or a region gunderson and holling 2003 the existing measurement and evaluation of resilience capacity of water resources system are mostly based on the perspectives of society ecology society economy economy environment etc and there is still a lack of multi dimensional evaluation and analysis from the perspective of society economy resource and environment composite system therefore drawing on relevant research literature unep 2017 sun et al 2020 behboudian et al 2021 following the principles of systematicity scientific and availability the resilience evaluation index system of the agricultural water resources in the yellow river basin was constructed by combining the unevenness and complex adaptability of the agricultural water resources in the basin fully considering the environmental economic and social systems which are closely related to the agricultural water system and adding institutional factors table 1 due to the research on the evaluation of agricultural water resources efficiency is relatively mature this study selected agricultural water consumption arable land area labor force fertilizer application intensity pesticide application intensity and total power of agricultural machinery as input indicators agricultural production value as the expected output and gray water footprint intensity as the undesired output in the index weighting process combining the analytic hierarchy process ahp and the entropy method evm the least squares optimization model was established to reduce the deviation of the results and then the weight of each indicator was determined by weighting each indicator in the index system 2 3 methods the traditional data envelopment analysis dea ignores the slackness of input and output and does not consider the impact of undesired output factors which makes the measurement results deviate from the actual efficiency sun et al 2017a 2017b the non radial and non angle slacks based measure sbm is an additive dea model that based on slack variables solves the problem of slack affecting the measured value tone 2001 therefore the sbm dea model was used for measurement the agricultural water resources efficiency in this study the calculation process is as follows 1 ρ min 1 1 n n 1 n s n x x k n t 1 1 m 1 m 1 m s m y y k m t i 1 i s i b b k i t 2 s t t 1 t k 1 k z k t x kn t s n x x k n t n 1 n 3 t 1 t k 1 k z k t y km t s m y y k m t m 1 m 4 t 1 t k 1

output and undesired output respectively s n x s m y s i b represents the slack vectors of input and output x k n t y k m t b k i t is the input and output values of the k th production unit during t and z k t means the weight of the decision making unit the objective function ρ decreases strictly and monotonically with s n x s m y and s i b and 0 ρ 1 when ρ 1 the production unit is effective when ρ 1 the production unit has an efficiency loss the efficiency of water use can be improved by optimizing input expected output and undesired output in the process of water resources resilience calculation in order to achieve the unification of subjective and objective to ensure the reliability accuracy and fairness of the results this paper establishes a least squares optimization model by combining the analytic hierarchy process ahp and the entropy method evm to reduce the deviation of the results and weights each indicator in the water resources resilience indicator system to jointly determine the weight of each indicator the calculation process is as follows the subjective weight vector determined by ahp is 6 v v 1 v 2 v n t 7 v v 1 v 2 v n t the objective weight vector determined by evm is 8 u u 1 u 2 u n t assume the comprehensive weight vector of the indicators is 9 w w 1 w 2 w n t the subjective decision deviation model of the least square multiplication is established to directly control the quantitative difference between the decision weight and the real result within a small deviation range to the greatest extent 10 min h w i 1 m j 1 n u j w j x ij 2

agricultural water resources resilience evaluation index w i is the comprehensive weight of subjective and objective synthesis and g is the total score of agricultural water resources resilience level based on the theory of composite ecosystems a quantitative model of water resources efficiency and resilience development coordination fig 2 was established to study the possible direction and trend of the development degree and coordination degree of water resources system thereby revealing the interaction between them the development curve in the model is the projection of the development function on the right angled plane this function reflects the non linear interactive relationship between the resilience and efficiency of water resources and represents the maximum development the agricultural water resources system can achieve under certain conditions and external pressures the curve division method was used to reflect different considerations of agricultural water resources resilience and efficiency sun and meng 2020 the curves of y 1 2 x3 y 1 x3 and y 3 4 x3 divide the square area into 4 equal parts from the bottom left to the top right which are used as a measure of the development degree the curves of y x1 3 y x and y x3 divide the square area into 4 equal parts from upper left to lower right as a measure of coordination degree to provide a standard classification on the degree of development coordination according to the quantitative model of development coordination referring to the coupled coordination model li et al 2021 the development coordination degree can be calculated as follows 12 d y x 3 13 h log y log x 14 f d h where d is the degree of development h is the degree of coordination and f is the degree of development coordination 2 4 data sources the research data come from the statistical yearbooks water resources bulletins china statistical yearbook china city statistical yearbook and china water conservancy bulletin of 9 provinces and regions and 72 prefecture level administrative units in qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shanxi shaanxi henan and shandong the relevant data on water resources policies and regulations come from china water website http www h2o china com 3 results 3 1 calculation results and grouping the e awrs and r awrs based on sbm dea model of the 72 prefecture level administrative units were calculated according to the steps formulas and index weight proposed in section 2 to rank the efficiency and resilience of each prefecture level administrative units the prefecture level administrative units set was divided into five levels i e extremely low low medium upper medium and high by referring to the uniform distribution function as well as their maximum and minimum value from the sbm dea results in detail the threshold value and the numerical interval are shown in table 2 the sbm dea value should be within the interval of 0 1 when the value tends to 1 it indicates that the agricultural water resources system of the prefecture level administrative units is more efficient and resilient and vice versa 3 2 characteristics of temporal changes in eawrs and rawrs in the yellow river basin from a basin wide perspective fig 3 the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin fluctuate upward from 2005 to 2019 with mean values of efficiency and resilience rising from 0 19 and 0 13 in 2005 0 52 and 0 26 in 2019 respectively among them the e awrs improves significantly with a mean value of 0 35 however the mean values of 72 prefectures are all less than 1 indicating that all the areas are inefficient areas therefore the overall level of agricultural water resources utilization efficiency in the yellow river basin is not high the average value of the r awrs is only 0 21 which is generally at a low level both e awrs and r awrs show a stepped distribution pattern of upstream midstream downstream from low to high which matches the economic development level in the basin in recent years the ecological protection and construction of the sanjiangyuan wetland the return of cropland to forest and grass on the loess plateau and the ecological restoration of wetlands in the yellow river delta have been carried out in the upper middle and lower reaches of the yellow river and led to a continuous increase in the water resources resilience in the basin however as the most important coal production belt in china the intensified mining of coal has led to ecological problems such as soil erosion and human activities such as overgrazing and excessive logging and reclamation have caused serious vegetation degradation in some areas resulting in a relatively slow growth rate of water resilience from the perspective of the first level tributaries fig 4 during 2005 2019 the e awrs and r awrs of the 13 first level tributaries show a fluctuating upward trend regarding the r awrs the upstream tributaries generally grow faster than the middle and lower reaches among them the huangshui taohe and qingshuihe river basins have the fastest growth rate mainly because the upstream tributary basins belong to the source area of the yellow river and the ecological environment protection is greater than that of the middle and lower reaches while the industrial and agricultural pollution is less than that of the middle and lower reaches and the interference intensity of industrial activities on the agricultural water resources system is relatively low the implementation of key soil and water conservation projects and control water conservancy projects longyangxia sanmenxia and xiaolangdi as well as river training projects in the downstream areas of the main tributaries have contributed to the improvement of the r awrs in the tributaries in terms of the e awrs the growth rate of the middle and lower river basins is generally higher than that of the upper reaches the luohe and wudinghe river basins in the huanghuaihai plain where agriculture is more developed and the baihe and heihe river basins in the upper reaches of the yellow river have a higher growth rate this is consistent with the economic and social development conditions of different tributary basin regions 3 3 spatially divergent characteristics of eawrs a and rawrs in the yellow river basin it can be seen from fig 5 that from the spatial perspective the urban agriculture in sichuan qinghai inner mongolia shaanxi henan and shandong provinces have a relatively high eawrs while the urban agriculture in gansu shanxi and ningxia prefectures have a low eawrs the cities located in qinghai inner mongolia and sichuan are mostly autonomous prefectures and leagues in which the local agriculture is dominated by animal husbandry and the planting industry accounts for a small proportion of the agricultural water resources the prefecture level administrative units in the hetao irrigation district fenwei plain and huanghuaihai plain have a relatively high eawrs mainly because the government pays more attention to the economic benefits of agricultural production and invests more advanced production equipment and reasonable planting methods to improve the eawrs the serious drought and soil erosion in gansu and the ecological environmental pollution caused by the development of the coal based economy in shanxi have resulted in relatively low utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources in the two provinces however the low efficiency is gradually improving specifically in 2005 among the 72 prefecture level administrative units only xianyang and liaocheng had a high level efficiency a small number of areas were in a low and medium level and most cities were in an extremely low level in 2010 there was an improvement over 2005 but there were still very low level areas mainly in gansu and shanxi provinces in 2015 the number of cities above the medium level increased significantly but some cities were still the low level efficiency areas by the end of 2019 the eawrs in the four cities of baiyin dingxi linxia and luliang was still at a very low level and the improvement effect was not obvious however the e awrs of most cities has been significantly improved especially 11 cities including xianyang and xi an have reached a high level it can be seen from fig 6 that the r awrs in the lower reaches of the yellow river is significantly better than that in the upper and middle reaches while the r awrs in prefecture level administrative units such as the hetao irrigation district and fenwei plain is also relatively high this is because the local government has been working on environmental protection paid more attention to the sustainable development of agricultural production and actively introduced advanced production equipment and planting technologies which have improved the r awrs relatively fast the 72 prefecture level administrative units can be divided into three gradients aba prefecture and jinan have a relatively high level and belong to the first gradient 53 prefecture level administrative units such as puyang zibo and taian are above the low level and belong to the second gradient and 17 prefecture level administrative units including lanzhou dingxi and datong distributed in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river are at a very low level and belong to the third gradient specifically in 2005 only aba prefecture and jinan the two cities among 72 prefecture level administrative units were at a medium level 17 cities including lanzhou dingxi and datong were at an extremely low level and the remaining cities were at a low level in 2010 the number of cities reaching the middle level increased significantly and the 6 cities of yulin luoyang shangqiu dezhou jinan and binzhou reached the middle to high level the number of extremely low level cities has been reduced to three which were baiyin lanzhou and wuhai in 2015 the number of low level cities decreased significantly compared with 2010 and most cities reached the middle level the difference between 2019 and 2015 was not significant and the resilience of the basin s agricultural water resources system was not significantly improved 3 4 analysis on the development degree and coordination degree of the eawrs and rawrs in the yellow river basin substituting the values of e awrs and r awrs into eqs 12 and 13 the development degree and coordination degree of the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 can be calculated according to fig 7a the development degree of the agricultural water resources system of the yellow river basin shows an upward trend from 2005 to 2019 and goes through a process of rapid rise 2005 2013 fluctuating growth 2014 2017 rise 2018 2019 the process is like the development trend of the e awrs and r awrs according to fig 7b the coordination degree of the agricultural water resources system shows a downward trend from 2005 to 2019 with an overall decrease of 37 31 and the reduction shows an increasing trend of upstream downstream midstream among them the coordination degree of the upstream areas has the smallest decrease which is 27 25 compared with the middle and downstream areas the e awrs and r awrs in the upstream areas has more coordinated development indicating that while the e awrs in the upstream areas is improved the r awrs is also protected in the middle and downstream areas the coordination degree has greater decreases which are 44 82 and 42 16 respectively and the development speeds of e awrs and r awrs are not in harmony according to the trend curve types of development degree of the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 table 3 the development degree of agricultural water resources in the 8 prefecture level administrative units including dingxi baiyin and yangquan is relatively low but has a relatively stable development which is related to the endowment of water resources local finance and the ecological environment of these prefecture level administrative units increasing the investment in water resources protection is the key to breaking the development bottleneck the development degree of agricultural water resources in 7 prefecture level administrative units including wuhai baotou and hohhot show an inverted u shaped trend indicating that their economic development level and water resources infrastructure construction can support the current population density and water resources activities of agricultural production so that the agricultural water resources system can better achieve coordinated and sustainable development the development degree of agricultural water resources in 10 prefecture level administrative units such as wuwei jiaozuo and kaifeng show a fluctuating development trend and their development degree declines in some years the reason for this phenomenon is mainly related to the local economic development level social development environment natural disasters and the speed of the development process of the water resources system the development degree of agricultural water resources in 47 prefecture level administrative units such as taian sanmenxia and shangluo shows an upward trend the reason is that the government has invested heavily in agricultural production and water resources protection and extensively promoted the advanced agricultural facilities and planting methods thereby leading to the coordinated development of the e awrs and r awrs in these regions 3 5 analysis on the development and coordination of eawrs and rawrs in the yellow river basin taking the average of the development degree and coordination degree in 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2019 the trend and group division of the development degree and coordination degree of the agricultural water resources in 72 prefecture level administrative units can be obtained fig 8a fig 8b and fig 8c the abscissa is the degree of development and the vertical coordinates are the degree of coordination based on the average values of development degree and coordination degree from 2005 to 2019 the 72 cities are divided into 3 groups fig 8d from which it can be observed that the development degree and coordination degree of the 3 groups have different statistical characteristics from the changing trend in fig 8 the development degree and coordination degree of the 72 cities in the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 have changed from concentration to dispersion most prefecture level administrative units are originally located in the middle of the coordinate map but gradually move to the lower right indicating that the development degree of the agricultural water resources system in the yellow river basin is gradually getting better while the coordination degree is gradually getting worse this represents that the efficiency and resilience development speed of the agricultural water resources system tends to be out of balance mainly due to the slower growth of the resilience of the agricultural water resources system than the growth of efficiency therefore the key to future development lies in how to further improve the r awrs under the premise of ensuring the improvement of e awrs to achieve the coordinated and sustainable development of the e awrs and r awrs from fig 8d and table 4 the prefecture level administrative units of group 3 are mainly concentrated in the lower right of the coordinate map these areas have a high development degree but their average coordination degree is low which is one of the main factors that restrict the development and coordination of the regional group although these cities have relatively abundant water resources due to that the local water resources system infrastructure is far from perfect and the government s macro control is insufficient the development of the e awrs and r awrs is not in harmony compared with group 2 group 1 is closer to the upper left of the coordinate map and has a lower development degree and a higher coordination degree but the coordinated development is better in group 1 which is due to the factors that promote the improvement of the level of e awrs and r awrs tend to be diversified 3 6 influencing factor setting and model setting according to the availability of data six influencing factors suitable for the panel measurement model i e agricultural economic development level environmental regulation industrial development speed resource endowment water pollution discharge and water efficiency management policy were selected to establish a tobit panel regression model to analyze the factors affecting the resilience of agricultural water resources 15 y it α 0 β 1 ln ed it β 2 ln re it β 3 er it β 4 ln id it β 5 sd it β 6 we it ε it where y is the resilience of agricultural water resources ed is the level of agricultural economic development expressed by the per capita agricultural output value re is the resource endowment expressed by the total amount of local water resources er is the environmental regulation and the government s investment in agriculture is used to account for the agricultural output value id is the industrial development speed expressed by the ratio of the added value of the primary industry to gdp sd is the water pollution discharge expressed by the per capita urban pollution discharge and we is the water efficiency management policy expressed by the agricultural water use efficiency α0 is a constant term βn is the regression coefficient for variable n and ε is the error term before regression analysis we first performed unit root test on panel data to avoid false regression combined with the characteristics of the data the llc method and fisher adf method were selected to test the unit root of each indicator the results are shown in table 5 the test results of each variable showed that the p value was less than 0 1 so the null hypothesis of the existence of a unit root was rejected therefore it is considered that there is no unit root in the panel data that is there is no pseudo regression in the regression analysis on this basis a panel tobit regression with random effects was carried out and the lr test results showed that there was an individual effect indicating that it was appropriate to use the panel tobit regression model with random effects to analyze the influencing factors of agricultural water resources resilience in the yellow river basin the regression results are shown in table 6 it can be seen that 1 the level of agricultural economic development has a positive impact on the resilience of agricultural water resources at a significant level of 1 it shows that the higher the per capita agricultural income the higher the resilience of agricultural water resources this is mainly because with the increase of per capita income more advanced planting and irrigation equipment can be purchased and used thus ensuring the resilience of agricultural water resources 2 resource endowment has a positive impact on agricultural water resources resilience abundant water resources are a necessary condition for increasing agricultural production and farmers income and abundant water resources are the guarantee of agricultural water resources resilience 3 environmental regulation has a positive impact on agricultural water resources resilience at a significant level of 1 environmental pollution is externally uneconomical while environmental protection as a public demand is non competitive and non exclusive it is difficult to achieve continuous improvement of environmental quality by relying on market regulation which also needs the normalization and regulation from the government 4 the agricultural development speed has a negative impact on the resilience of agricultural water resources at the 1 significance level the environmental ekc theory believes that when the level of economic development is low more resources are used to maintain economic development however when the development reaches a certain stage more resources can be used to maintain and protect the ecological environment moreover the development of agriculture is often accompanied by a large amount of capital investment and resource consumption as a result environmental protection is neglected or the recovery speed of the environment cannot keep up with the consumption of development so the speed of agricultural development has a negative impact on the resilience of agricultural water resources 5 sewage discharge has a negative impact on agricultural water resources resilience at the 1 significant level the amount of sewage discharge has a direct impact on the resilience of agricultural water resources not only can the amount of wastewater discharged be used to infer the government s efforts to treat water resources but the amount of water pollution per capita is an indicator of the strength of people s awareness of water conservation 6 water efficiency management policy has a positive impact on water resource resilience at the 1 significant level the improvement of agricultural water use efficiency not only represents the reduction of water consumption but also represents the effective implementation of a series of policies issued by the government which will improve the resilience of agricultural water resources 4 discussion the sustainable development of agricultural water resources has always been the most basic issue for the healthy development of the yellow river basin sun et al 2020 gong et al 2020 the key of which is to effectively improve and synergistically promote the coordinated development of the e awrs and r awrs during the study period the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin showed a fluctuating upward trend but the spatial differentiation was significant and there was a certain spatial correspondence between the coordination degree of development and the level of economic development meanwhile due to policy leading factors regional water resources endowments agricultural production methods and historical basis etc especially the failure to handle the input output relationship of the local water resources system some cities have appeared the phenomenon that the development degree is higher than the coordination degree and the coordination degree gradually decreases however the overall agricultural water resource system in the yellow river basin has achieved a benign spatial resonance which is basically consistent with the findings of some scholars yu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 water use efficiency is the result of the comprehensive effects of various factors such as economic development and social production yao et al 2021 to improve water use efficiency it is necessary to consider the complex influence of various factors take various measures from different perspectives such as agricultural development technology level and water use management reasonably develop and utilize agricultural water resources adjust and optimize the agricultural water use structure promote industrial and agricultural water conservation techniques implement water conservation transformation in high water consuming industries and improve agricultural water use efficiency under the premise of ensuring a good ecological environment the government should formulate specific policies and feasible measures according to the differences in the development status of each prefecture level administrative units to improve the development level and quality of the regional water resources system and strengthen the development and coordination of the regional water resources system thereby enhancing the r awrs and achieving sustainable development of water resources system to fully guarantee the agricultural water security and ecological security of the yellow river basin it is necessary to take water resources as the main constraint coordinate the linkage relationship between the upper middle and lower reaches from the basin wide perspective and formulate an optimized control plan from a system perspective fu et al 2021 the government should establish demonstration zones for the efficient use of agricultural water resources in the main grain producing areas of the yellow river basin and strengthened the management of agricultural water resources by playing a demonstration and leading role in ecological management we should adhere to the joint management of water and soil on the one hand it should focus on water source areas and river basins coordinate the implementation of key ecological projects such as important water recharge areas and weihe river sources adhere to the joint management of mainstreams and tributaries and strengthen the comprehensive management of key watersheds small watersheds mountain flood channels and urban and rural black smelly water bodies on the other hand with the implementation of the comprehensive control project of soil erosion in the loess plateau as a starting point for soil control it should accelerate the construction of key ecological projects such as comprehensive management of small watersheds slope to ladder conversion ecological restoration and silt dams implement large scale comprehensive ecological control projects in the loess plateau watershed and concentrate on building a number of water conservancy projects to effectively reduce the area of soil erosion and the amount of sediment loss on the loess plateau in agricultural development it must continue to optimize the layout of characteristic and advantageous agricultural industries vigorously develop water saving ecological agriculture and green agriculture implement comprehensive reform demonstration projects for modern water saving agriculture accelerate the upgrading of water intake hubs water pumping stations and key water delivery projects in irrigation areas and spread advanced drip irrigation technology to promote the intensive and efficient development of agriculture in terms of agricultural water resources management it should improve and perfect the water resources management system and the working mechanism that combine the river basin management and administrative area management together implement dual control actions on the total and intensity of water consumption strengthen the supervision of the entire process of water conservation and force the optimization of scale structure and layout of agricultural development continuously optimize and adjust the crop planting structure determine the agricultural industry structure and planting structure according to the conditions of water supply and demand in different areas of the river basin strictly control the planting area of high water consuming crops expand the proportion of water saving and drought tolerant crops select and promote new varieties of drought tolerant crops moderately implement crop rotation and fallow actively develop rainwater harvesting and irrigation and enhance water storage and moisture retention capabilities it should scientifically assess the carrying conditions of water resources in various regions rationally allocate the total amount of water resources and achieve full coverage of agricultural water control indicators in various river basins and administrative regions at all levels in addition it should promote the efficient use of water resources and comprehensively improve water use efficiency and the resilience and carrying capacity of the regional water resources system this study selects the continuous period from 2005 to 2019 and is mainly based on the analysis at the prefecture level administrative units scale it only reflects the coordinated development relationship between the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin from a macro perspective the coordinated development relationship remains to be studied for a longer range of time scales county scales and multi scale aspects such as integration with natural units watersheds etc in addition due to the different research scales and research objects as well as the differences in the characteristics of regional agricultural water resources the influencing factors of the resilience of the water use efficiency system need to be explored in depth in summary the coordinated development relationship between the e awrs and r awrs is a common problem at present this paper only discusses the degree of development the degree of coordination and the state of coordinated development which belong to the static research category the main direction of future research is the influencing factors dynamic mechanisms and optimization paths for the coordinated development of both e awrs and r awrs 5 conclusions based on the definition of the resilience of agricultural water resources system this study constructed an evaluation system from three dimensions i e economy society and ecological environment and conducted a synergistic analysis on the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin by comprehensively applying the analytic hierarchy process ahp entropy method evm sbm dea model and the development coordination model the results of the study are as follows 1 from 2005 2019 the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin showed a fluctuating upward trend and the e awrs and r awrs in the upstream area were lower than the average value of the whole basin in comparison the e awrs and r awrs had improved significantly but the overall level was still not high the 72 prefecture level administrative units were all inefficient areas the baihe heihe luohe and wudinghe river basins had the fastest growth rates which was consistent with the economic and social development conditions the r awrs was generally at a low level the upstream tributary basins generally grew faster than the middle and lower reaches among them the huangshui taohe and qingshuihe river basins had the fastest growth rate 2 from the perspective of spatial differentiation the autonomous prefectures leagues and other regions in the upper reaches as well as the hetao irrigation district fenwei plain and huanghuaihai plain had a relatively high efficiency of agricultural water resources which was related to the factors of water resource endowment agricultural industrial structure agricultural production methods and technical level and ecological environment management system by 2019 except for the 4 cities of baiyin dingxi linxia and luliang the e awrs in most cities had been significantly improved 11 cities including taian xianyang and xi an had reached a high level the r awrs in the lower reaches was obviously better than that in the upper and middle reaches the hetao irrigation district and fenwei plain had a relatively higher r awrs 3 the development degree of the agricultural water resources system went through a process of rapid rise 2005 2013 fluctuating growth 2014 2017 rise 2018 2019 showing an upstream midstream downstream stepwise increasing pattern the coordination degree of the agricultural water resources system showed a downward trend and the decrease showed an increasing pattern of upstream downstream midstream the trend curve of development degree of the e awrs and r awrs in 72 prefecture level administrative units had four types i e steady inverted u fluctuating and upward types 4 the three clusters divided by the average value of the development degree and coordination degree of agricultural water resources system in 72 prefecture level administrative units showed a change from concentration to dispersion indicating that the development degree of agricultural water resources system of the yellow river basin was gradually getting better the gradual decrease in coordination degree was mainly due to the slower growth of the r awrs than e awrs increase in summary effectively improving and synergistically promoting the coordinated development of the e awrs and r awrs is the key to the sustainable and healthy development of agricultural water resources in the yellow river basin the influencing factors dynamic mechanisms and optimization paths of the coordinated development between e awrs and r awrs are the main directions of future research declaration of competing

9572,resilience and efficiency are the core concepts of sustainable management of agricultural water resources system this study constructed an evaluation system of the efficiency and resilience of agricultural water resources system e awrs r awrs in the yellow river basin by comprehensively applying the analytic hierarchy process ahp entropy method evm sbm dea model and the development coordination model the results showed that 1 from 2005 2019 the e awrs and r awrs showed a fluctuating upward trend the e awrs increased significantly especially the baihe heihe luohe and wudinghe river basins grew at a faster rate however the overall efficiency levels were still not high and all the 72 prefecture level administrative units were inefficient areas the r awrs was at a relatively low level in which the huangshui taohe and qingshuihe river basins had rapid growth in resilience 2 from the perspective of spatial differentiation characteristics the e awrs in sichuan qinghai inner mongolia shaanxi henan and shandong was relatively high while that in gansu shanxi and ningxia was relatively low the prefecture level administrative units of the upstream river source area hetao irrigation district fenwei plain and huanghuaihai plain had a relatively high e awrs the r awrs in the lower reaches was significantly better than that in the upper and middle reaches 3 the development degree of the agricultural water resources system has gone through a process of rapid rise 2005 2013 fluctuating growth 2014 2017 rise 2018 2019 showing an upstream midstream downstream stepwise increasing pattern the coordination degree of the agricultural water resources system showed a downward trend and the decrease showed an upstream downstream midstream increasing pattern 4 the three clusters divided by the average value of the development degree and coordination degree of the agricultural water resources system showed the changes from concentration to dispersion in contrast the coordination degree was gradually decreased keywords agricultural water resources resilience efficiency development coordination relationship yellow river basin 1 introduction water resources are basic natural resources and strategic economic resources that maintain the sustainable development of agriculture he et al 2020 with rapid population growth fast urbanization increasing economic development and climate change johnson et al 2001 luo et al 2020 especially in response to the competition for water system services from other economic sectors such as the increase in industry life and ecological water consumption water resources that can be used for agriculture are increasingly compressed xue et al 2017 qin et al 2020 in addition the future global population increase and the uncertainty caused by climate change will pose potential challenges to food production worthington and hutchinson 2005 eyshi rezaei et al 2017 tooley et al 2021 therefore whether water resources can be used efficiently and sustainably in the process of agricultural production is an important factor that determines global water resources and food security in china the total amount of water used in agriculture has decreased while grain production demand has continued to increase since 1990 the contradiction of reduced water but increased food production has become prominent wang and mei 2017 water resources have become one of the main factors restricting food production wang et al 2014 cao et al 2021 as china s development has entered a new era higher and more comprehensive requirements have been put forward for water resources management the speed and scale growth mode that relied on high input and low output in the past will gradually shift to the high quality and profitable growth mode with the coordinated efficiency and resilience development of the water resources system sun and meng 2020 therefore it is crucial to explore agricultural water management schemes under resilience efficiency nexus to promote sustainable agricultural development resilience and efficiency are critical to agricultural water management zhu et al 2021 from the proposal of suggestions for improving resource efficiency and strengthening the system against systemic risks by the international human dimensions programme ihdp to the implementation of integrating the resource efficiency agenda into the water resources management by the united nations environment programme unep and the world bank integration the interaction between resilience and efficiency has an increasing theoretical and practical significance trump et al 2018 world bank 2021 unep 2021 resilience refers to the ability of a region or a system to resist recover adapt and transform after a shock martin 2012 guan et al 2021 resilience of agricultural water resources system r awrs can be defined as the ability of agricultural water system to resist external pressure risk environmental and other shocks and disturbances the recovery ability to repair the damaged parts and maintain the equilibrium of the water system or the debugging ability to shift the system to a better state through adjustment adaptation learning renewal transformation etc the agricultural water resources system is complex dynamic and adaptable and improving resilience can protect the sustainable development of agriculture from potential disturbances as systems that lack resilience are fragile and unsustainable efficiency of agricultural water resources system e awrs which is another key element of water resource management refers to improving the efficiency of water resource allocation enhancing efficient output and promoting sustainable growth of the agricultural economy liu et al 2021 yao and liu 2021a 2021b according to the interpretations of the concept of e awrs and r awrs resilience emphasizes the recovery and shock resistance of agricultural water systems while efficiency emphasizes low input and high output this does not mean the contradiction between them instead they need to be well interrelated the agricultural development in china is affected by complex disturbances such as climate change ecological environmental pollution natural man made disasters water shortages and labor reduction shi et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b luo et al 2021 under the pressure of external environmental uncertainty and internal structural changes and upgrading the sustainable management of agricultural water resources urgently needs diversified and resilient policies optimizing the allocation of water resources and improving its professional management level and efficiency have become the main components of sustainable management of agricultural water resources guo et al 2021 resilience and efficiency can improve the way for humans to independently or comprehensively understand and respond to uncertainties and risks in a changing agricultural water resources system in addition decision makers and managers need to clearly understand the possible relations and tensions between the resilience and efficiency of the system thereby eliminating the outdated management model and avoiding problems in the sustainable management process of agricultural water resources currently scholars have conducted a series of studies on the resilience of water resources system and the main research areas include theoretical construction evaluation and measurement and resilience strategies of water system resilience zevenbergen et al 2008 tanner et al 2009 however research on the resilience of water resources is mostly limited to the quantitative analysis and evaluation of water resources resilience itself ignoring the thought of evolutionary economic geography in which the institutional environment and cultural factors are important factors that affect the resilience of agricultural water resources system as regard to water resources efficiency research mainly focuses on the measurement and evaluation driving factors and influencing mechanisms of water use efficiency kaneko etal 2004 sun et al 2011 chen et al 2015 yao and liu 2021a 2021b existing studies have commonalities in the selection of water efficiency evaluation indicators to be specific the input and output of production factors such as labor and capital are single and generally reflected in the growth of gdp while in the actual production in addition to the desired output the non desired outputs such as pollution should also be considered to better measure the environmental benefits of water use efficiency ma et al 2012 sun and meng 2020 guo et al 2021 despite the growing importance of resilience and efficiency in the sustainable development agenda especially in agricultural water resource management there has been a lack of analysis of the relationship between them the objectives of this study are to 1 construct a resilience index system for agricultural water resources system based on the economic social and ecological environment perspectives and measure the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 using the subjective and objective synthetic weighting method and the sbm model and 2 introduce a development coordination model to organically combine the e awrs and r awrs and explore the development coordination relationship between them this study aims to provide a reference for the ecological protection of the yellow river basin the implementation of national major strategies for high quality development and the utilization and sustainable management of water resources in china 2 methodology 2 1 case study area in the context of global warming and the impact of human activities such as urbanization farmland irrigation and conversion of farmland to forests the amount of water resources in the yellow river basin is generally decreasing lu et al 2021 in particular the rapid economic and social development has an increasing demand for water making water shortage to be a long term problem in social development zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b lu et al 2022 in 2018 the total water consumption in the basin was 127 09 billion m3 of which the proportion of agricultural water consumption was 64 20 815 90 billion m3 higher than the national agricultural water consumption proportion by 2 80 however the average water per mu of arable land was 324 m3 which was only 17 of the average water per mu of arable land in china qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia and other upstream areas account for a large proportion of agricultural water use the agricultural water use efficiency in the yellow river basin is generally not high the effective utilization coefficients of farmland irrigation water in shanxi sichuan qinghai inner mongolia and ningxia are 0 543 0 473 0 499 0 543 and 0 535 respectively which is lower than the national average of 0 554 and is in line with developed countries compared with the level of 0 7 there is a big gap and there is a large potential for water saving at the same time food production and energy development in the yellow river basin are highly dependent on water resources and changes in ecological water use will also exacerbate water shortages in the basin cai et al 2004 feng et al 2016 as a key area of national food security especially the yellow river irrigation area the yellow river basin has made a great contribution to the national food security strategy but the problem of inefficient use of agricultural water resources has not been well resolved zhang et al 2021 after the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin has been elevated to a major national strategy china has put forward higher requirements for the allocation of water resources in the basin zhao and yu 2020 zhang et al 2021 therefore there is an urgent need for solutions to agricultural water resources security and food security based on ensuring water safety for production living and ecological water in the river basin through multi objective collaborative optimization peng et al 2017 with this purpose this study selected 72 prefecture level administrative units in the yellow river basin fig 1 as the study area to carry out a collaborative analysis of the efficiency and resilience of the agricultural water resources system aiming to provide a scientific basis for improving the utilization efficiency and management capabilities of agricultural water resources in the yellow river basin 2 2 construction of index system the analysis framework of system resilience capability can conduct highly standardized and systematic research on the resilience capability of a system or a region gunderson and holling 2003 the existing measurement and evaluation of resilience capacity of water resources system are mostly based on the perspectives of society ecology society economy economy environment etc and there is still a lack of multi dimensional evaluation and analysis from the perspective of society economy resource and environment composite system therefore drawing on relevant research literature unep 2017 sun et al 2020 behboudian et al 2021 following the principles of systematicity scientific and availability the resilience evaluation index system of the agricultural water resources in the yellow river basin was constructed by combining the unevenness and complex adaptability of the agricultural water resources in the basin fully considering the environmental economic and social systems which are closely related to the agricultural water system and adding institutional factors table 1 due to the research on the evaluation of agricultural water resources efficiency is relatively mature this study selected agricultural water consumption arable land area labor force fertilizer application intensity pesticide application intensity and total power of agricultural machinery as input indicators agricultural production value as the expected output and gray water footprint intensity as the undesired output in the index weighting process combining the analytic hierarchy process ahp and the entropy method evm the least squares optimization model was established to reduce the deviation of the results and then the weight of each indicator was determined by weighting each indicator in the index system 2 3 methods the traditional data envelopment analysis dea ignores the slackness of input and output and does not consider the impact of undesired output factors which makes the measurement results deviate from the actual efficiency sun et al 2017a 2017b the non radial and non angle slacks based measure sbm is an additive dea model that based on slack variables solves the problem of slack affecting the measured value tone 2001 therefore the sbm dea model was used for measurement the agricultural water resources efficiency in this study the calculation process is as follows 1 ρ min 1 1 n n 1 n s n x x k n t 1 1 m 1 m 1 m s m y y k m t i 1 i s i b b k i t 2 s t t 1 t k 1 k z k t x kn t s n x x k n t n 1 n 3 t 1 t k 1 k z k t y km t s m y y k m t m 1 m 4 t 1 t k 1 k z k t b ki t s i b b k i t i 1 i 5 z k t 0 s n x 0 s m y 0 s i b 0 k 1 k where ρ is the water resource efficiency and resilience value to be calculated n m and i are the numbers of input expected output and undesired output respectively s n x s m y s i b represents the slack vectors of input and output x k n t y k m t b k i t is the input and output values of the k th production unit during t and z k t means the weight of the decision making unit the objective function ρ decreases strictly and monotonically with s n x s m y and s i b and 0 ρ 1 when ρ 1 the production unit is effective when ρ 1 the production unit has an efficiency loss the efficiency of water use can be improved by optimizing input expected output and undesired output in the process of water resources resilience calculation in order to achieve the unification of subjective and objective to ensure the reliability accuracy and fairness of the results this paper establishes a least squares optimization model by combining the analytic hierarchy process ahp and the entropy method evm to reduce the deviation of the results and weights each indicator in the water resources resilience indicator system to jointly determine the weight of each indicator the calculation process is as follows the subjective weight vector determined by ahp is 6 v v 1 v 2 v n t 7 v v 1 v 2 v n t the objective weight vector determined by evm is 8 u u 1 u 2 u n t assume the comprehensive weight vector of the indicators is 9 w w 1 w 2 w n t the subjective decision deviation model of the least square multiplication is established to directly control the quantitative difference between the decision weight and the real result within a small deviation range to the greatest extent 10 min h w i 1 m j 1 n u j w j x ij 2 v j w j x ij 2 where j 1 n w j 1 w j 0 j 1 2 n the evaluation model of agricultural water resources resilience is 11 g i 1 n w i x ij where x ij is the standardization of the original data of agricultural water resources resilience evaluation index w i is the comprehensive weight of subjective and objective synthesis and g is the total score of agricultural water resources resilience level based on the theory of composite ecosystems a quantitative model of water resources efficiency and resilience development coordination fig 2 was established to study the possible direction and trend of the development degree and coordination degree of water resources system thereby revealing the interaction between them the development curve in the model is the projection of the development function on the right angled plane this function reflects the non linear interactive relationship between the resilience and efficiency of water resources and represents the maximum development the agricultural water resources system can achieve under certain conditions and external pressures the curve division method was used to reflect different considerations of agricultural water resources resilience and efficiency sun and meng 2020 the curves of y 1 2 x3 y 1 x3 and y 3 4 x3 divide the square area into 4 equal parts from the bottom left to the top right which are used as a measure of the development degree the curves of y x1 3 y x and y x3 divide the square area into 4 equal parts from upper left to lower right as a measure of coordination degree to provide a standard classification on the degree of development coordination according to the quantitative model of development coordination referring to the coupled coordination model li et al 2021 the development coordination degree can be calculated as follows 12 d y x 3 13 h log y log x 14 f d h where d is the degree of development h is the degree of coordination and f is the degree of development coordination 2 4 data sources the research data come from the statistical yearbooks water resources bulletins china statistical yearbook china city statistical yearbook and china water conservancy bulletin of 9 provinces and regions and 72 prefecture level administrative units in qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shanxi shaanxi henan and shandong the relevant data on water resources policies and regulations come from china water website http www h2o china com 3 results 3 1 calculation results and grouping the e awrs and r awrs based on sbm dea model of the 72 prefecture level administrative units were calculated according to the steps formulas and index weight proposed in section 2 to rank the efficiency and resilience of each prefecture level administrative units the prefecture level administrative units set was divided into five levels i e extremely low low medium upper medium and high by referring to the uniform distribution function as well as their maximum and minimum value from the sbm dea results in detail the threshold value and the numerical interval are shown in table 2 the sbm dea value should be within the interval of 0 1 when the value tends to 1 it indicates that the agricultural water resources system of the prefecture level administrative units is more efficient and resilient and vice versa 3 2 characteristics of temporal changes in eawrs and rawrs in the yellow river basin from a basin wide perspective fig 3 the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin fluctuate upward from 2005 to 2019 with mean values of efficiency and resilience rising from 0 19 and 0 13 in 2005 0 52 and 0 26 in 2019 respectively among them the e awrs improves significantly with a mean value of 0 35 however the mean values of 72 prefectures are all less than 1 indicating that all the areas are inefficient areas therefore the overall level of agricultural water resources utilization efficiency in the yellow river basin is not high the average value of the r awrs is only 0 21 which is generally at a low level both e awrs and r awrs show a stepped distribution pattern of upstream midstream downstream from low to high which matches the economic development level in the basin in recent years the ecological protection and construction of the sanjiangyuan wetland the return of cropland to forest and grass on the loess plateau and the ecological restoration of wetlands in the yellow river delta have been carried out in the upper middle and lower reaches of the yellow river and led to a continuous increase in the water resources resilience in the basin however as the most important coal production belt in china the intensified mining of coal has led to ecological problems such as soil erosion and human activities such as overgrazing and excessive logging and reclamation have caused serious vegetation degradation in some areas resulting in a relatively slow growth rate of water resilience from the perspective of the first level tributaries fig 4 during 2005 2019 the e awrs and r awrs of the 13 first level tributaries show a fluctuating upward trend regarding the r awrs the upstream tributaries generally grow faster than the middle and lower reaches among them the huangshui taohe and qingshuihe river basins have the fastest growth rate mainly because the upstream tributary basins belong to the source area of the yellow river and the ecological environment protection is greater than that of the middle and lower reaches while the industrial and agricultural pollution is less than that of the middle and lower reaches and the interference intensity of industrial activities on the agricultural water resources system is relatively low the implementation of key soil and water conservation projects and control water conservancy projects longyangxia sanmenxia and xiaolangdi as well as river training projects in the downstream areas of the main tributaries have contributed to the improvement of the r awrs in the tributaries in terms of the e awrs the growth rate of the middle and lower river basins is generally higher than that of the upper reaches the luohe and wudinghe river basins in the huanghuaihai plain where agriculture is more developed and the baihe and heihe river basins in the upper reaches of the yellow river have a higher growth rate this is consistent with the economic and social development conditions of different tributary basin regions 3 3 spatially divergent characteristics of eawrs a and rawrs in the yellow river basin it can be seen from fig 5 that from the spatial perspective the urban agriculture in sichuan qinghai inner mongolia shaanxi henan and shandong provinces have a relatively high eawrs while the urban agriculture in gansu shanxi and ningxia prefectures have a low eawrs the cities located in qinghai inner mongolia and sichuan are mostly autonomous prefectures and leagues in which the local agriculture is dominated by animal husbandry and the planting industry accounts for a small proportion of the agricultural water resources the prefecture level administrative units in the hetao irrigation district fenwei plain and huanghuaihai plain have a relatively high eawrs mainly because the government pays more attention to the economic benefits of agricultural production and invests more advanced production equipment and reasonable planting methods to improve the eawrs the serious drought and soil erosion in gansu and the ecological environmental pollution caused by the development of the coal based economy in shanxi have resulted in relatively low utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources in the two provinces however the low efficiency is gradually improving specifically in 2005 among the 72 prefecture level administrative units only xianyang and liaocheng had a high level efficiency a small number of areas were in a low and medium level and most cities were in an extremely low level in 2010 there was an improvement over 2005 but there were still very low level areas mainly in gansu and shanxi provinces in 2015 the number of cities above the medium level increased significantly but some cities were still the low level efficiency areas by the end of 2019 the eawrs in the four cities of baiyin dingxi linxia and luliang was still at a very low level and the improvement effect was not obvious however the e awrs of most cities has been significantly improved especially 11 cities including xianyang and xi an have reached a high level it can be seen from fig 6 that the r awrs in the lower reaches of the yellow river is significantly better than that in the upper and middle reaches while the r awrs in prefecture level administrative units such as the hetao irrigation district and fenwei plain is also relatively high this is because the local government has been working on environmental protection paid more attention to the sustainable development of agricultural production and actively introduced advanced production equipment and planting technologies which have improved the r awrs relatively fast the 72 prefecture level administrative units can be divided into three gradients aba prefecture and jinan have a relatively high level and belong to the first gradient 53 prefecture level administrative units such as puyang zibo and taian are above the low level and belong to the second gradient and 17 prefecture level administrative units including lanzhou dingxi and datong distributed in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river are at a very low level and belong to the third gradient specifically in 2005 only aba prefecture and jinan the two cities among 72 prefecture level administrative units were at a medium level 17 cities including lanzhou dingxi and datong were at an extremely low level and the remaining cities were at a low level in 2010 the number of cities reaching the middle level increased significantly and the 6 cities of yulin luoyang shangqiu dezhou jinan and binzhou reached the middle to high level the number of extremely low level cities has been reduced to three which were baiyin lanzhou and wuhai in 2015 the number of low level cities decreased significantly compared with 2010 and most cities reached the middle level the difference between 2019 and 2015 was not significant and the resilience of the basin s agricultural water resources system was not significantly improved 3 4 analysis on the development degree and coordination degree of the eawrs and rawrs in the yellow river basin substituting the values of e awrs and r awrs into eqs 12 and 13 the development degree and coordination degree of the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 can be calculated according to fig 7a the development degree of the agricultural water resources system of the yellow river basin shows an upward trend from 2005 to 2019 and goes through a process of rapid rise 2005 2013 fluctuating growth 2014 2017 rise 2018 2019 the process is like the development trend of the e awrs and r awrs according to fig 7b the coordination degree of the agricultural water resources system shows a downward trend from 2005 to 2019 with an overall decrease of 37 31 and the reduction shows an increasing trend of upstream downstream midstream among them the coordination degree of the upstream areas has the smallest decrease which is 27 25 compared with the middle and downstream areas the e awrs and r awrs in the upstream areas has more coordinated development indicating that while the e awrs in the upstream areas is improved the r awrs is also protected in the middle and downstream areas the coordination degree has greater decreases which are 44 82 and 42 16 respectively and the development speeds of e awrs and r awrs are not in harmony according to the trend curve types of development degree of the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 table 3 the development degree of agricultural water resources in the 8 prefecture level administrative units including dingxi baiyin and yangquan is relatively low but has a relatively stable development which is related to the endowment of water resources local finance and the ecological environment of these prefecture level administrative units increasing the investment in water resources protection is the key to breaking the development bottleneck the development degree of agricultural water resources in 7 prefecture level administrative units including wuhai baotou and hohhot show an inverted u shaped trend indicating that their economic development level and water resources infrastructure construction can support the current population density and water resources activities of agricultural production so that the agricultural water resources system can better achieve coordinated and sustainable development the development degree of agricultural water resources in 10 prefecture level administrative units such as wuwei jiaozuo and kaifeng show a fluctuating development trend and their development degree declines in some years the reason for this phenomenon is mainly related to the local economic development level social development environment natural disasters and the speed of the development process of the water resources system the development degree of agricultural water resources in 47 prefecture level administrative units such as taian sanmenxia and shangluo shows an upward trend the reason is that the government has invested heavily in agricultural production and water resources protection and extensively promoted the advanced agricultural facilities and planting methods thereby leading to the coordinated development of the e awrs and r awrs in these regions 3 5 analysis on the development and coordination of eawrs and rawrs in the yellow river basin taking the average of the development degree and coordination degree in 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2019 the trend and group division of the development degree and coordination degree of the agricultural water resources in 72 prefecture level administrative units can be obtained fig 8a fig 8b and fig 8c the abscissa is the degree of development and the vertical coordinates are the degree of coordination based on the average values of development degree and coordination degree from 2005 to 2019 the 72 cities are divided into 3 groups fig 8d from which it can be observed that the development degree and coordination degree of the 3 groups have different statistical characteristics from the changing trend in fig 8 the development degree and coordination degree of the 72 cities in the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 have changed from concentration to dispersion most prefecture level administrative units are originally located in the middle of the coordinate map but gradually move to the lower right indicating that the development degree of the agricultural water resources system in the yellow river basin is gradually getting better while the coordination degree is gradually getting worse this represents that the efficiency and resilience development speed of the agricultural water resources system tends to be out of balance mainly due to the slower growth of the resilience of the agricultural water resources system than the growth of efficiency therefore the key to future development lies in how to further improve the r awrs under the premise of ensuring the improvement of e awrs to achieve the coordinated and sustainable development of the e awrs and r awrs from fig 8d and table 4 the prefecture level administrative units of group 3 are mainly concentrated in the lower right of the coordinate map these areas have a high development degree but their average coordination degree is low which is one of the main factors that restrict the development and coordination of the regional group although these cities have relatively abundant water resources due to that the local water resources system infrastructure is far from perfect and the government s macro control is insufficient the development of the e awrs and r awrs is not in harmony compared with group 2 group 1 is closer to the upper left of the coordinate map and has a lower development degree and a higher coordination degree but the coordinated development is better in group 1 which is due to the factors that promote the improvement of the level of e awrs and r awrs tend to be diversified 3 6 influencing factor setting and model setting according to the availability of data six influencing factors suitable for the panel measurement model i e agricultural economic development level environmental regulation industrial development speed resource endowment water pollution discharge and water efficiency management policy were selected to establish a tobit panel regression model to analyze the factors affecting the resilience of agricultural water resources 15 y it α 0 β 1 ln ed it β 2 ln re it β 3 er it β 4 ln id it β 5 sd it β 6 we it ε it where y is the resilience of agricultural water resources ed is the level of agricultural economic development expressed by the per capita agricultural output value re is the resource endowment expressed by the total amount of local water resources er is the environmental regulation and the government s investment in agriculture is used to account for the agricultural output value id is the industrial development speed expressed by the ratio of the added value of the primary industry to gdp sd is the water pollution discharge expressed by the per capita urban pollution discharge and we is the water efficiency management policy expressed by the agricultural water use efficiency α0 is a constant term βn is the regression coefficient for variable n and ε is the error term before regression analysis we first performed unit root test on panel data to avoid false regression combined with the characteristics of the data the llc method and fisher adf method were selected to test the unit root of each indicator the results are shown in table 5 the test results of each variable showed that the p value was less than 0 1 so the null hypothesis of the existence of a unit root was rejected therefore it is considered that there is no unit root in the panel data that is there is no pseudo regression in the regression analysis on this basis a panel tobit regression with random effects was carried out and the lr test results showed that there was an individual effect indicating that it was appropriate to use the panel tobit regression model with random effects to analyze the influencing factors of agricultural water resources resilience in the yellow river basin the regression results are shown in table 6 it can be seen that 1 the level of agricultural economic development has a positive impact on the resilience of agricultural water resources at a significant level of 1 it shows that the higher the per capita agricultural income the higher the resilience of agricultural water resources this is mainly because with the increase of per capita income more advanced planting and irrigation equipment can be purchased and used thus ensuring the resilience of agricultural water resources 2 resource endowment has a positive impact on agricultural water resources resilience abundant water resources are a necessary condition for increasing agricultural production and farmers income and abundant water resources are the guarantee of agricultural water resources resilience 3 environmental regulation has a positive impact on agricultural water resources resilience at a significant level of 1 environmental pollution is externally uneconomical while environmental protection as a public demand is non competitive and non exclusive it is difficult to achieve continuous improvement of environmental quality by relying on market regulation which also needs the normalization and regulation from the government 4 the agricultural development speed has a negative impact on the resilience of agricultural water resources at the 1 significance level the environmental ekc theory believes that when the level of economic development is low more resources are used to maintain economic development however when the development reaches a certain stage more resources can be used to maintain and protect the ecological environment moreover the development of agriculture is often accompanied by a large amount of capital investment and resource consumption as a result environmental protection is neglected or the recovery speed of the environment cannot keep up with the consumption of development so the speed of agricultural development has a negative impact on the resilience of agricultural water resources 5 sewage discharge has a negative impact on agricultural water resources resilience at the 1 significant level the amount of sewage discharge has a direct impact on the resilience of agricultural water resources not only can the amount of wastewater discharged be used to infer the government s efforts to treat water resources but the amount of water pollution per capita is an indicator of the strength of people s awareness of water conservation 6 water efficiency management policy has a positive impact on water resource resilience at the 1 significant level the improvement of agricultural water use efficiency not only represents the reduction of water consumption but also represents the effective implementation of a series of policies issued by the government which will improve the resilience of agricultural water resources 4 discussion the sustainable development of agricultural water resources has always been the most basic issue for the healthy development of the yellow river basin sun et al 2020 gong et al 2020 the key of which is to effectively improve and synergistically promote the coordinated development of the e awrs and r awrs during the study period the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin showed a fluctuating upward trend but the spatial differentiation was significant and there was a certain spatial correspondence between the coordination degree of development and the level of economic development meanwhile due to policy leading factors regional water resources endowments agricultural production methods and historical basis etc especially the failure to handle the input output relationship of the local water resources system some cities have appeared the phenomenon that the development degree is higher than the coordination degree and the coordination degree gradually decreases however the overall agricultural water resource system in the yellow river basin has achieved a benign spatial resonance which is basically consistent with the findings of some scholars yu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 water use efficiency is the result of the comprehensive effects of various factors such as economic development and social production yao et al 2021 to improve water use efficiency it is necessary to consider the complex influence of various factors take various measures from different perspectives such as agricultural development technology level and water use management reasonably develop and utilize agricultural water resources adjust and optimize the agricultural water use structure promote industrial and agricultural water conservation techniques implement water conservation transformation in high water consuming industries and improve agricultural water use efficiency under the premise of ensuring a good ecological environment the government should formulate specific policies and feasible measures according to the differences in the development status of each prefecture level administrative units to improve the development level and quality of the regional water resources system and strengthen the development and coordination of the regional water resources system thereby enhancing the r awrs and achieving sustainable development of water resources system to fully guarantee the agricultural water security and ecological security of the yellow river basin it is necessary to take water resources as the main constraint coordinate the linkage relationship between the upper middle and lower reaches from the basin wide perspective and formulate an optimized control plan from a system perspective fu et al 2021 the government should establish demonstration zones for the efficient use of agricultural water resources in the main grain producing areas of the yellow river basin and strengthened the management of agricultural water resources by playing a demonstration and leading role in ecological management we should adhere to the joint management of water and soil on the one hand it should focus on water source areas and river basins coordinate the implementation of key ecological projects such as important water recharge areas and weihe river sources adhere to the joint management of mainstreams and tributaries and strengthen the comprehensive management of key watersheds small watersheds mountain flood channels and urban and rural black smelly water bodies on the other hand with the implementation of the comprehensive control project of soil erosion in the loess plateau as a starting point for soil control it should accelerate the construction of key ecological projects such as comprehensive management of small watersheds slope to ladder conversion ecological restoration and silt dams implement large scale comprehensive ecological control projects in the loess plateau watershed and concentrate on building a number of water conservancy projects to effectively reduce the area of soil erosion and the amount of sediment loss on the loess plateau in agricultural development it must continue to optimize the layout of characteristic and advantageous agricultural industries vigorously develop water saving ecological agriculture and green agriculture implement comprehensive reform demonstration projects for modern water saving agriculture accelerate the upgrading of water intake hubs water pumping stations and key water delivery projects in irrigation areas and spread advanced drip irrigation technology to promote the intensive and efficient development of agriculture in terms of agricultural water resources management it should improve and perfect the water resources management system and the working mechanism that combine the river basin management and administrative area management together implement dual control actions on the total and intensity of water consumption strengthen the supervision of the entire process of water conservation and force the optimization of scale structure and layout of agricultural development continuously optimize and adjust the crop planting structure determine the agricultural industry structure and planting structure according to the conditions of water supply and demand in different areas of the river basin strictly control the planting area of high water consuming crops expand the proportion of water saving and drought tolerant crops select and promote new varieties of drought tolerant crops moderately implement crop rotation and fallow actively develop rainwater harvesting and irrigation and enhance water storage and moisture retention capabilities it should scientifically assess the carrying conditions of water resources in various regions rationally allocate the total amount of water resources and achieve full coverage of agricultural water control indicators in various river basins and administrative regions at all levels in addition it should promote the efficient use of water resources and comprehensively improve water use efficiency and the resilience and carrying capacity of the regional water resources system this study selects the continuous period from 2005 to 2019 and is mainly based on the analysis at the prefecture level administrative units scale it only reflects the coordinated development relationship between the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin from a macro perspective the coordinated development relationship remains to be studied for a longer range of time scales county scales and multi scale aspects such as integration with natural units watersheds etc in addition due to the different research scales and research objects as well as the differences in the characteristics of regional agricultural water resources the influencing factors of the resilience of the water use efficiency system need to be explored in depth in summary the coordinated development relationship between the e awrs and r awrs is a common problem at present this paper only discusses the degree of development the degree of coordination and the state of coordinated development which belong to the static research category the main direction of future research is the influencing factors dynamic mechanisms and optimization paths for the coordinated development of both e awrs and r awrs 5 conclusions based on the definition of the resilience of agricultural water resources system this study constructed an evaluation system from three dimensions i e economy society and ecological environment and conducted a synergistic analysis on the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin by comprehensively applying the analytic hierarchy process ahp entropy method evm sbm dea model and the development coordination model the results of the study are as follows 1 from 2005 2019 the e awrs and r awrs in the yellow river basin showed a fluctuating upward trend and the e awrs and r awrs in the upstream area were lower than the average value of the whole basin in comparison the e awrs and r awrs had improved significantly but the overall level was still not high the 72 prefecture level administrative units were all inefficient areas the baihe heihe luohe and wudinghe river basins had the fastest growth rates which was consistent with the economic and social development conditions the r awrs was generally at a low level the upstream tributary basins generally grew faster than the middle and lower reaches among them the huangshui taohe and qingshuihe river basins had the fastest growth rate 2 from the perspective of spatial differentiation the autonomous prefectures leagues and other regions in the upper reaches as well as the hetao irrigation district fenwei plain and huanghuaihai plain had a relatively high efficiency of agricultural water resources which was related to the factors of water resource endowment agricultural industrial structure agricultural production methods and technical level and ecological environment management system by 2019 except for the 4 cities of baiyin dingxi linxia and luliang the e awrs in most cities had been significantly improved 11 cities including taian xianyang and xi an had reached a high level the r awrs in the lower reaches was obviously better than that in the upper and middle reaches the hetao irrigation district and fenwei plain had a relatively higher r awrs 3 the development degree of the agricultural water resources system went through a process of rapid rise 2005 2013 fluctuating growth 2014 2017 rise 2018 2019 showing an upstream midstream downstream stepwise increasing pattern the coordination degree of the agricultural water resources system showed a downward trend and the decrease showed an increasing pattern of upstream downstream midstream the trend curve of development degree of the e awrs and r awrs in 72 prefecture level administrative units had four types i e steady inverted u fluctuating and upward types 4 the three clusters divided by the average value of the development degree and coordination degree of agricultural water resources system in 72 prefecture level administrative units showed a change from concentration to dispersion indicating that the development degree of agricultural water resources system of the yellow river basin was gradually getting better the gradual decrease in coordination degree was mainly due to the slower growth of the r awrs than e awrs increase in summary effectively improving and synergistically promoting the coordinated development of the e awrs and r awrs is the key to the sustainable and healthy development of agricultural water resources in the yellow river basin the influencing factors dynamic mechanisms and optimization paths of the coordinated development between e awrs and r awrs are the main directions of future research declaration of competing

9573,rising co2 concentration co2 in the atmosphere may modulate the response of crop plants to drought stress this study aimed to investigate the response of leaf gas exchange and plant growth of two c4 species representing both dicot amaranth and monocot maize to progressive drought under two different co2 ambient a co2 400 ppm and elevated e co2 800 ppm the soil water status in the pots was expressed as the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw the results showed that as compared to a co2 e co2 significantly increased net photosynthetic rate an at non stress condition an max for both species while the increase was more pronounced in maize than in amaranth stomatal conductance gs at non stress condition was significantly lower at e co2 in both species the ftsw threshold at which an starts to decrease was higher in maize grown at e co2 than at a co2 whereas it was not affected in amaranth in both species gs decreased at higher ftsw threshold when grown at e co2 than at a co2 e co2 decreased stomatal density sd in amaranth but increased it in maize drought increased sd in amaranth but not in maize intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was significantly enhanced by e co2 and drought stress at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 particularly in maize e co2 increased leaf area of well watered plants in maize and decreased specific leaf area in amaranth in amaranth water consumption of well watered plants was increased and plant wue was decreased at e co2 the varied responses of leaf gas exchange and wue to soil water deficits and e co2 among the two c4 species imply their different mechanisms in stomatal control over carbon gain versus water loss in dicot and monocot plants which is essentially important for selecting crop species and developing strategies to optimize crop wue in a future drier and co2 enriched climate the more physiological and biochemical response from soil stomatal to plant scale related to various environments would be considered in further investigation keywords elevated co2 drought c4 species stomatal control plant growth water use efficiency 1 introduction climate is one of the primary factors influencing crop growth and productivity since 1750 the atmospheric co2 concentration co2 has increased continuously from approximately 277 ppm to 397 ppm in 2013 and is predicted to reach 800 ppm at the end of this century hartmann et al 2013 furthermore the elevated co2 e co2 has been considered to be the main reason causing global climate warming and thereby declining freshwater resources for agricultural production pazzagli et al 2016 the effect of e co2 on plants has been extensively examined at different levels wand et al 1999 leakey et al 2009 most of these studies have been focusing on c3 species and less attention has been paid on c4 species due to the assumption that they are less responsive to e co2 than c3 species due to the co2 concentrating mechanism in photosynthesis reddy et al 2010 however a recent study by reich et al 2018 demonstrated that in a long term perspective after 12 years exposure to e co2 the c4 species responded much strongly to e co2 than did the c3 plants which was closely associated with the changes in soil mineral nitrogen n concentration in addition to soil n availability soil moisture status could also modulate the response of plants to e co2 and vice versa it is well known that e co2 could stimulate photosynthesis thereby increase the plant growth yield and water use efficiency wue whereas drought stress will reduce photosynthesis and negatively affect the crop yields reddy and hodges 2000 lobell and gourdji 2012 moreover e co2 often induces stomatal closure hereby curtailing transpiration rate which may sustain a high plant water status and alleviate the impacts of drought on crop yield morgan et al 2011 tausz posch et al 2015 the recent studies in different c3 species have also suggested that e co2 could retard the response of leaf gas exchange to soil drying yan et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wei et al 2020 which may sustain photosynthesis for a prolonged drought thus bringing more beneficial effect of e co2 on biomass accumulation and wue under water limited conditions the ability of crop plants to adapt to drought stress in a future e co2 environment is largely dependent on the effectiveness of stomatal control over leaf gas exchange yan et al 2017 the physiological mechanisms of stomata sensing and responding to the environmental factors have been well documented yan et al 2012 dow and bergmann 2014 sun et al 2014 many studies have shown that both drought and e co2 could reduce the stomatal conductance by either reducing stomatal aperture or by changing stomatal density or both xu et al 2016 yan et al 2017 on a short term reduction in stomatal aperture could be induced by both drought and e co2 where aba signaling may play a role engineer et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 in the long term reduction in stomatal density may occur under both drought and e co2 conditions lake and woodward 2008 xu et al 2016 however based on a meta analysis from face experiments ainsworth and rogers 2007 reported that the reduction in stomatal conductance under e co2 was caused by decreasing in stomatal aperture rather than the change of stomatal density compared to c3 species c4 species are predicted to be favored in response to e co2 under drought due to the co2 concentrating mechanism which enables the plants to maintain photosynthetic rate when stomatal conductance is lowered by water deficits long 1999 in addition evidence has also shown that in c4 species co2 leakage from bundle sheath bs cell was lower in monocots compared to dicots ehleringer and pearcy 1983 this is because the presence of suberized lamella in bs cells in monocots i e the nadp me subtype preventing the co2 leakage from the bs cells resulting in less pronounced photosynthetic response to e co2 than the dicots i e nad me subtype species lecain and morgan 1998 ghannoum et al 2000 in maize meng et al 2014 showed irrigation affected the response of leaf gas exchange to e co2 and the water use efficiency was increased by e co2 more significantly under rain fed condition however to date very little information is available about how e co2 modulates the responses of gas exchange and plant wue to progressive drought between c4 monocot and dicot species therefore the aim of this study was to investigate how e co2 modulates the response of gas exchange plant growth and wue from leaf to plant level in c4 monocot maize zea mays l and dicot amaranth amaranthus cruentus species to progressive soil drying maize is a staple food in many parts of the world while amaranth is a promising crop of high nutritive value it was hypothesized that the two species would respond differently to e co2 drought and their combinations at leaf and plant scales due to the differences in leaf anatomy and stomatal control over gas exchanges improving our understanding on the physiological mechanisms regulating gas exchange and wue of plants grown under combined e co2 and drought stress would be crucial for predicting the impact of global climatic change on crop productivity 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions pot experiments were conducted in a climate controlled greenhouse at the experimental farm of the faculty of sciences university of copenhagen taastrup denmark two c4 species maize zea mays representing a monocot and amaranth amaranthus cruentus representing a dicot were tested the plants were grown in 2 l pots 16 7

sufficient for root growth less than 40 days for both species before sowing the peat was fully saturated with water and left to drain freely for 48 h then the pot water holding capacity whc was determined the climatic conditions in the greenhouse were set at day night air temperature was 20 18 2 c 16 h photoperiod 6 00 22 00 h controlled by automatic curtain relative air humidity was 75 and photosynthetic active radiation par above the canopy was 500 µmol m 2 s 1 in average provided by the sunlight plus supplementary lamps the vapor pressure deficit vpd in the greenhouse cells was ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 kpa 2 2 experimental design two greenhouse cells with different co2 concentrations namely cell 1 with 400 ppm ambient co2 concentration a co2 and cell 2 with 800 ppm elevated co2 concentration e co2 were used in both greenhouse cells the co2 was sustained or achieved by emission of pure co2 from a bottled tank and distributed evenly in the cell through internal ventilation the co2 in the glasshouse cells was monitored every 6 s by a co2 transmitter series gmt220 vaisala group helsinki finland for amaranth five seeds per pot were sown on 4th of october 2017 8 days after sowing one healthy seedling was kept per pot 18 days later perlite was used to cover soil surface to diminish the evaporation 30 days after sowing the plants were supplied with nutrients of 1 05 g nh4no3 and 0 375 g h2kpo4 per pot to satisfy the amaranth plant growth and biomass formation the drought treatment started at 7th of november 2017 well watered plants were manually irrigated at 15 00 h on a daily basis to reach 95 of whc i e 1650 g while drought stressed plants were subjected to progressive soil drying until transpiration rate decreased to ca 10 of the well watered plants for maize four seeds per pot were sown on 21st of december 2017 15 days after sowing one healthy seedling was kept per pot 18 days later perlite was used to cover soil surface to reduce the evaporation 27 days after sowing the plants were supplied with nutrients of 2 85 g nh4no3 and 3 5 g h2kpo4 per pot to satisfy the maize plant growth and biomass formation the drought treatment started at 22nd of january 2018 well watered plants were manually irrigated at 15 00 h on a daily basis to reach 95 of whc i e 1650 g while the drought stressed plants were subjected to progressive soil drying until transpiration rate decreased to ca 10 of well watered plants four replicated pots were used for each species and treatment and the pots were randomly arranged in each co2 cell the flow chart of experiment design in amaranth and maize plants from sowing to drought stress treatment finished period was shown in fig 1 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil water status soil water status was determined by daily weighing the pots using an analytical balance sartorius model qa35ede s the pots were weighed on a daily basis at 15 00 h and soil water status was presented as the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw which has been used as an indicator for soil water status of plants experiencing progressive drought e g liu et al 2019 the ftsw value is the ratio between the amount of remaining transpirable soil water in the pot and total transpirable soil water ttsw 1 ftsw wtn wtf ttsw where wtn is the pot weight on a given date and wtf is the pot weight at the last day of drying cycle when the transpiration rate of drought stressed plants reaches 10 of well watered plants ttsw is the difference between pot weight at 100 whc 1734 g and pot weight of drought stressed plants at the last day of drying cycle namely when the transpiration rate decreased to 10 of well watered plants ca 800 g 2 3 2 leaf gas exchange after onset the drought stress treatment net photosynthesis rate an and stomatal conductance gs were measured daily on the third upper fully expanded leaf developed after the onset of drought treatment exactly on the mid portion of the leaf away from the veins using a li 6400xt portable photosynthesis system li cor ne usa the measurements were conducted from 9 30 12 00 h at a par of 1500 mol m 2 s 1 leaf temperature of 20 ºc and co2 of 400 ppm for a co2 and 800 ppm for e co2 respectively for both species preformed photosynthetic light response curves indicate that 1500 mol m 2 s 1 of par is sufficient for photosynthetic light saturation for each leaf the measurement took ca 6 min until stable readings on an and gs was reached and logged three times the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei during the soil drying treatment was calculated as an gs 2 3 3 stomatal density leaf epidermal impressions in amaranth were taken one day before the ending of the drought stress from both adaxial and abaxial surface of upper fully expended leaf developed after

wayne rasband national institutes of health usa java 1 6 0 24 64 bit was used for counting the stomata in amaranth and maize plants 2 4 leaf aba analysis after onset of soil drying the same leaves used for gas exchange measurements were harvested 5 times during the treatment periods corresponding to varied ftsw values the fresh leaf samples around 4 cm were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at 80 c the samples were grounded into fine powder and 30 mg each sample was weighted for aba assay 1 ml milli q water was added into the sample and aba was extracted on a shaken plate overnight at 4 c the extract was centrifuged at 14 000g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was used to determine aba concentration with elisa according to the protocol of asch 2000 2 5 leaf area and plant water use efficiency at final harvest day leaf area was measured by using a leaf area meter li cor 3100 li cor inc lincoln nb the leaf and stem samples were collected separately for drying in an oven for 48 h at 70 c to determine dry biomass and specific leaf area sla was calculated by dividing the leaf area with leaf dry biomass biomass increment was calculated from the difference of aboveground dry biomass between 1st and final harvest day plant water consumption pwc was the water use between plant first and final harvest water use efficiency at plant level wuep during the soil drying was calculated as biomass increment pwc 2 6 statistics analysis to evaluate the maximal value of an and gs at unstressed conditions the linear plateau model was modified as an or gs equals 2 an

results 3 1 soil water status the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw maintained above ca 0 8 under well watered condition for both species after withholding irrigation the ftsw in pots of drought stressed plants decreased over time until the whole plant available water was consumed which took around 12 14 days fig 2 3 2 response of leaf gas exchange rates to progressive soil drying in both species the response of an and gs to ftsw range from 0 0 to 0 6 was well described by the linear plateau model figs 3 and 4 the an curves were fitted by using linear plateau model with r2 of 0 95 0 90 0 85 and 0 77 respectively for amaranth at a co2 and e co2 and maize at a co2 and e co2 growth conditions the maximal net photosynthesis rate an max was significantly greater for plants grown at e co2 than at a co2 compared to a co2 e co2 significantly increased an max in amaranth and maize by 28 and 39 respectively the ftsw threshold at which the an of plants started to decrease due to drought was not affected by co2 in amaranth but was significantly increased by e co2 in maize fig 3 table 1 the gs curves were fitted by using linear plateau model with r2 of 0 97 0 87 0 79 and 0 68 respectively for amaranth at a co2 and e co2 and maize at a co2 and e co2 growth conditions the maximal stomatal conductance gs max was significantly lower i e reduced by 19 and 25 in amaranth and maize respectively for plants grown at e co2 compared to those grown at a co2 the ftsw threshold at which the gs of plants started to decrease due to drought stress was significantly higher at e co2 than at a co2 fig 4 table 1 at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 of progressive drought stress e co2 significantly increased a 281 12 intrinsic water use efficiency wuei in amaranth p 0 05 in maize e co2 possessed a 92 25 higher wuei than those grown under a co2 p 0 001 fig 5 3 3 leaf aba concentration at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 of the progressive soil drying aba leaf showed a 12 97 higher trend in amaranth grown at a co2 than at e co2 whereas a 62 32 lower change was true for maize p 0 01 fig 6 3 4 stomatal density stomatal density sd was significantly affected by co2 in both species compared to plants grown at a co2 e co2 significantly decreased 11 29 sd in amaranth but increased 9 26 sd in maize compared to well watered treatment drought stress increased 28 99 sd in amaranth at both co2 growth conditions whereas in maize drought decreased 10 32 sd only at e co2 p 0 05 fig 7 3 5 leaf area and specific leaf area in maize compared to a co2 e co2 increased 17 81 leaf area under well watered treatment but maintained leaf area under drought stress compared to well watered treatment drought stress decreased 53 47 leaf area in both species at both co2 growth conditions fig 8 compared to plants grown at a co2 e co2 significantly decreased 15 61 specific leaf area sla in amaranth compared to well watered treatment drought stress decreased 38 55 sla in both species at each co2 environment fig 9 3 6 biomass increment plant water consumption and water use efficiency there was no difference on biomass increment between a co2 and e co2 in both species compared to well watered treatment drought stress decreased 38 15 biomass increment in both species at both co2 growth conditions fig 10 compared to plants grown at a co2 e co2 increased 21 61 plant water consumption pwc in amaranth compared to well watered treatment drought stress decreased 43 4 pwc in both species at both co2 environment fig 11 in amaranth compared to a co2 e co2 decreased 23 53 plant water use efficiency wuep under both water status compared to well watered treatment drought stress maintained wuep although showed the trend to increase 8 85 wuep at both co2 environment in maize there was no difference on wuep across all treatments although wuep showed the 5 61 and 3 08 increased trend under e co2 and drought stress respectively fig 12 4 discussion there is common consensus that an of c4 species are less responsive to high co2 compared to c3 species due to the specialized co2 concentrating mechanism reddy et al 2010 in line with this leakey 2006 reported in maize under well watered condition e co2 550 ppm had no significant effect on an in contrast here e co2 significantly increased an for both amaranth and maize plants though the increase was more pronounced in maize than in amaranth fig 3 this varied response of an to e co2 between c4 monocot and dicot could be related to the ability to concentrate co2 in the bundle sheath bs cell ziska and bunce 1997 based on the biochemical subtype classification in c4 plants amaranth and maize is classified as nad me and nadp me type respectively studies have indicated that co2 leakage from bs cell wall was lower in monocots compared to dicots due to the presence of suberized lamella in bs cells in the nadp me subtype of monocots ehleringer and pearcy 1983 also lecain and morgan 1998 reported that an in nadp me species showed more pronounced response to e co2 compared to that of the nad me species these findings are in a good agreement with our result nevertheless ziska and bunce 1997 reported a significant increase in an under e co2 in eight out of ten c4 species where dicots e g amaranthus sp increased by 30 while the monocots e g zea mays increased by 5 thus the mechanisms for the varied an response to e co2 in different c4 species i e between monocots and dicots still remains largely elusive and merit further studies numerous studies have reported that e co2 caused a reduction in gs for both c3 and c4 species yan et al 2017 in the present study gs max was significantly reduced in both species grown at e co2 and the reduction was more pronounced in maize than in amaranth fig 4 consistent with this bunce 2004 reported that e co2 decreased gs much more in monocots 42 than in dicots 28 the decline of gs in response to e co2 could be attributed to both short term i e decrease in stomatal aperture and long term i e decrease in stomatal density mechanisms engineer et al 2016 earlier studies have proposed that the co2 binding carbonic anhydrases the interplay with aba and the guard cell photosynthesis are potential stimulus involved in inducing stomatal closure with a short term exposure to e co2 ainsworth and long 2005 engineer et al 2016 under well watered condition raschke 1975 showed that aba enhanced the stomatal co2 response in line with this tazoe and santrucek 2015 reported that e co2 induced gs reduction might be mediated by aba levels in the present study along with the progression of soil drying at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 aba leaf was consistently higher in amaranth grown at a co2 than at e co2 whereas the opposite trend was true for maize fig 6 these would have modulated the response of gs to soil drying differently between the two species as discussed later fig 4 in addition it is notable that the aba at whole leaf level could be different from that of guard cell thus a direct measurement on guard cell aba is needed in order to reveal the response of aba to co2 growth environment and its role in regulating g s in a long term the reduction of gs in plants grown at e co2 could be due to the decrease in stomatal density sd woodward et al 2002 woodward and kelly 1995 reported that among 100 species investigated 74 species showed a significant reduction in sd when grown at e co2 according to a meta analysis the e co2 induced gs reduction in free air co2 enrichment face experiments was averaged 22 across all plant species n c 580 ainsworth and rogers 2007 here e co2 significantly increased sd in maize but decreased it in amaranth fig 7 indicating the diverse responses of sd among species to change of co2 growth environment lake and woodward 2008 in contrast to our result maroco et al 1999 reported a 10 decrease in sd of maize grown at a co2 concentration of 1100 ppm for 30 days as compared to plants grown at 350 ppm co2 the reduction of gs in amaranth could be partially attributed to the lowered sd under e co2 while this was not true for maize in which the e co2 induced gs reduction might be mainly due to stomatal closure moreover in e co2 maize plant drought stress had a lower sd fig 7 indicating that at a co2 drought stress reduced maize gs mostly result from decrease in stomatal aperture not in sd whilst at e co2 the decrease in sd under drought stress may be helpful to induce reduction in maize gs response to drought combined with e co2 environment anyhow the measurements on stomatal pore size should be done in future studies to clearly explain the different response in the present study the soil water status in the pots was evaluated by fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw using a linear plateau model the response of leaf gas exchange parameters to progressive soil water deficit was evaluated it was found that an and gs for species tended to become more sensitive to soil water deficit when grown in e co2 as exemplified by the greater ftsw thresholds except an for amaranth for plants at e co2 than at a co2 figs 3 and 4 table 1 on the contrary our earlier studies in c3 species i e tomato found that e co2 retarded the response of an and gs to soil drying yan et al 2017 liu et al 2019 additionally several other authors also reported a delayed response of gs to drought in plants grown under e co2 compared to a co2 e g in barley robredo et al 2007 grasses abdelgawad et al 2015 and grapevines da silva et al 2017 an earlier stomatal closure under e co2 would conserve soil moisture and prolong the survival of plants under extended period of drought stress yan et al 2017 on the other hand a late stomatal closure leads to maintaining leaf gas exchange longer as the soil dries thus sustaining the growth rate liang et al 2018 it has been suggested that the early gs reduction in response to progressive soil drying might be a result of higher plant and leaf hydraulic conductance compared to late decrease in gs choudhary and sinclair 2014 whereas the late reduction in gs could be due to the lower osmotic potential which maintain a greater leaf turgor pressure liang et al 2018 furthermore it is well known that aba plays an important role in inducing stomatal closure during soil drying liu et al 2005 here leaf aba of amaranth was consistently higher in plants grown at a co2 than at e co2 which would expect to cause an earlier stomatal closure in the a co2 plants fig 6 this was however not the case as the ftsw threshold for gs reduction was significantly lower for plants grown at a co2 than at e co2 thus one explanation could be that the stomata become more sensitive to leaf aba in plants grown at e co2 on the contrary at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 of progressive drought stress maize plants grown at e co2 possessed significantly higher leaf aba than those grown at a co2 this could have contributed to an earlier decrease of gs in the e co2 plants as shown in fig 4 hence these above results indicate that the modulation of e co2 on gs response to soil drying differs between the two species the reduction in gs response under e co2 in order to maintain a constant ci ca causes a negligible offset of the higher an thus greatly increases water use efficiency wue liu et al 2019 besides leaf wue would be enhanced under moderate water stress as a result of the larger decrease in gs than an liu et al 2005 thereby the combined effect of e co2 and drought might further improve wue in leaf moreover de souza et al 2008 reported in c4 species sugarcane grown under e co2 showed a 30 increase of an and a 37 decrease of gs leading to a 62 increase of wuei these findings were in good agreement with our observation as e co2 significantly increased the wuei compared to those grown under a co2 at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 of progressive soil drying in both species particular in maize fig 5 such improvement of wuei in both plants induced by drought stress under e co2 environment implies that these c4 species could be better adapted to future climate changed scenarios the change in specific leaf area sla was mainly due to the change in dry matter and leaf expansion rates adapting to abiotic stress the higher sensitivity of leaf expansion growth than carbon assimilation to stress might result in lower sla vile et al 2005 here drought stress reduced sla thicker leaves in both species disregarding their co2 growth environment fig 9 the similar phenomenon has been reported by liu and stützel 2004 in amaranth where they found that the reduction of sla was accompanied with the improvement in plant wue besides the response of sla to e co2 was species dependent where no effect of co2 on sla was observed in maize while sla was decreased in amaranth fig 9 it was suggested that the reduction in sla was proportional to the increase in photosynthesis rate or might be as a consequence of the decrease in leaf n concentration under e co2 environment and this need further investigation in this study drought stress decreased leaf area biomass increment and plant water consumption pwc in both species figs 8 10 and 11 a number of studies have reported that exposed to e co2 the biomass accumulation was enhanced in c3 plant under well watered and moderate drought stress while this was pronounced only under drought stress in c4 plant van der kooi et al 2016 under e co2 the growth increment in c3 plant was about 40 45 whereas in c4 plant was around 10 20 reddy et al 2010 however here both leaf area and biomass increment were not different between a co2 and e co2 in amaranth while in maize well watered leaf area was increased at e co2 biomass increment showed the increase trend at e co2 although was no statistically significant figs 8 and 10 in addition the pwc was increased at e co2 in well watered amaranth while there was no difference of pwc between a co2 and e co2 in maize fig 11 these implied that the plant growth and water use responses were species dependent the lowered gs of plants grown under e co2 would conserve the soil moisture purcell et al 2018 which would prolong the period of subsequent plant water use plant wue wuep showed a 4 68 increase trend in both species under drought stress although the difference was not statistically significant compared to the well watered treatment fig 12 an earlier study had reported that e co2 could reduce gs in both c3 and c4 species but c4 plant has the ability to increase co2 assimilation rate under moderate drought stress wall 2001 thus e co2 could ameliorate the negative effect of drought stress van der kooi et al 2016 yan et al 2017 similarly in the present study wuep showed an increase trend at e co2 in maize along with soil drying although the difference was not significant whereas in amaranth wuep was decreased at e co2 due to the higher pwc fig 12 this was suggested that the soil water content was conserved in amaranth which delayed the onset and severity of water stress probably the stomatal response to e co2 may have differently influenced the whole plant water use reddy et al 2010 indicating the different plant wue response to e co2 between amaranth and maize species as this study was mainly about leaf gas exchange and plant growth variation in c4 species respond to drought stress and e co2 thus the more physiological and biochemical response from soil stomatal leaf to plant scale related to environmental conditions would be considered in the future investigation to better elucidate the different regulation mechanism in c4 plants 5 conclusions taken together the varied responses of photosynthesis gs and plant growth to drought and e co2 between amaranth and maize imply they possess different mechanisms in stomatal control over carbon gain versus water loss most interestingly the opposite effects of e co2 on the sensitivity of gs and stomatal density between the two c4 species may reveal some intrinsic differences in the mechanisms regulating stomatal behavior and wue from leaf to plant scale among monocot and dicot plants the more physiological and biochemical response from soil stomatal to plant scale related to various environments would be considered in the future study these findings are essentially important for selecting crop species and developing management strategies to optimize crop

9573,rising co2 concentration co2 in the atmosphere may modulate the response of crop plants to drought stress this study aimed to investigate the response of leaf gas exchange and plant growth of two c4 species representing both dicot amaranth and monocot maize to progressive drought under two different co2 ambient a co2 400 ppm and elevated e co2 800 ppm the soil water status in the pots was expressed as the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw the results showed that as compared to a co2 e co2 significantly increased net photosynthetic rate an at non stress condition an max for both species while the increase was more pronounced in maize than in amaranth stomatal conductance gs at non stress condition was significantly lower at e co2 in both species the ftsw threshold at which an starts to decrease was higher in maize grown at e co2 than at a co2 whereas it was not affected in amaranth in both species gs decreased at higher ftsw threshold when grown at e co2 than at a co2 e co2 decreased stomatal density sd in amaranth but increased it in maize drought increased sd in amaranth but not in maize intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was significantly enhanced by e co2 and drought stress at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 particularly in maize e co2 increased leaf area of well watered plants in maize and decreased specific leaf area in amaranth in amaranth water consumption of well watered plants was increased and plant wue was decreased at e co2 the varied responses of leaf gas exchange and wue to soil water deficits and e co2 among the two c4 species imply their different mechanisms in stomatal control over carbon gain versus water loss in dicot and monocot plants which is essentially important for selecting crop species and developing strategies to optimize crop wue in a future drier and co2 enriched climate the more physiological and biochemical response from soil stomatal to plant scale related to various environments would be considered in further investigation keywords elevated co2 drought c4 species stomatal control plant growth water use efficiency 1 introduction climate is one of the primary factors influencing crop growth and productivity since 1750 the atmospheric co2 concentration co2 has increased continuously from approximately 277 ppm to 397 ppm in 2013 and is predicted to reach 800 ppm at the end of this century hartmann et al 2013 furthermore the elevated co2 e co2 has been considered to be the main reason causing global climate warming and thereby declining freshwater resources for agricultural production pazzagli et al 2016 the effect of e co2 on plants has been extensively examined at different levels wand et al 1999 leakey et al 2009 most of these studies have been focusing on c3 species and less attention has been paid on c4 species due to the assumption that they are less responsive to e co2 than c3 species due to the co2 concentrating mechanism in photosynthesis reddy et al 2010 however a recent study by reich et al 2018 demonstrated that in a long term perspective after 12 years exposure to e co2 the c4 species responded much strongly to e co2 than did the c3 plants which was closely associated with the changes in soil mineral nitrogen n concentration in addition to soil n availability soil moisture status could also modulate the response of plants to e co2 and vice versa it is well known that e co2 could stimulate photosynthesis thereby increase the plant growth yield and water use efficiency wue whereas drought stress will reduce photosynthesis and negatively affect the crop yields reddy and hodges 2000 lobell and gourdji 2012 moreover e co2 often induces stomatal closure hereby curtailing transpiration rate which may sustain a high plant water status and alleviate the impacts of drought on crop yield morgan et al 2011 tausz posch et al 2015 the recent studies in different c3 species have also suggested that e co2 could retard the response of leaf gas exchange to soil drying yan et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wei et al 2020 which may sustain photosynthesis for a prolonged drought thus bringing more beneficial effect of e co2 on biomass accumulation and wue under water limited conditions the ability of crop plants to adapt to drought stress in a future e co2 environment is largely dependent on the effectiveness of stomatal control over leaf gas exchange yan et al 2017 the physiological mechanisms of stomata sensing and responding to the environmental factors have been well documented yan et al 2012 dow and bergmann 2014 sun et al 2014 many studies have shown that both drought and e co2 could reduce the stomatal conductance by either reducing stomatal aperture or by changing stomatal density or both xu et al 2016 yan et al 2017 on a short term reduction in stomatal aperture could be induced by both drought and e co2 where aba signaling may play a role engineer et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 in the long term reduction in stomatal density may occur under both drought and e co2 conditions lake and woodward 2008 xu et al 2016 however based on a meta analysis from face experiments ainsworth and rogers 2007 reported that the reduction in stomatal conductance under e co2 was caused by decreasing in stomatal aperture rather than the change of stomatal density compared to c3 species c4 species are predicted to be favored in response to e co2 under drought due to the co2 concentrating mechanism which enables the plants to maintain photosynthetic rate when stomatal conductance is lowered by water deficits long 1999 in addition evidence has also shown that in c4 species co2 leakage from bundle sheath bs cell was lower in monocots compared to dicots ehleringer and pearcy 1983 this is because the presence of suberized lamella in bs cells in monocots i e the nadp me subtype preventing the co2 leakage from the bs cells resulting in less pronounced photosynthetic response to e co2 than the dicots i e nad me subtype species lecain and morgan 1998 ghannoum et al 2000 in maize meng et al 2014 showed irrigation affected the response of leaf gas exchange to e co2 and the water use efficiency was increased by e co2 more significantly under rain fed condition however to date very little information is available about how e co2 modulates the responses of gas exchange and plant wue to progressive drought between c4 monocot and dicot species therefore the aim of this study was to investigate how e co2 modulates the response of gas exchange plant growth and wue from leaf to plant level in c4 monocot maize zea mays l and dicot amaranth amaranthus cruentus species to progressive soil drying maize is a staple food in many parts of the world while amaranth is a promising crop of high nutritive value it was hypothesized that the two species would respond differently to e co2 drought and their combinations at leaf and plant scales due to the differences in leaf anatomy and stomatal control over gas exchanges improving our understanding on the physiological mechanisms regulating gas exchange and wue of plants grown under combined e co2 and drought stress would be crucial for predicting the impact of global climatic change on crop productivity 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions pot experiments were conducted in a climate controlled greenhouse at the experimental farm of the faculty of sciences university of copenhagen taastrup denmark two c4 species maize zea mays representing a monocot and amaranth amaranthus cruentus representing a dicot were tested the plants were grown in 2 l pots 16 7

sufficient for root growth less than 40 days for both species before sowing the peat was fully saturated with water and left to drain freely for 48 h then the pot water holding capacity whc was determined the climatic conditions in the greenhouse were set at day night air temperature was 20 18 2 c 16 h photoperiod 6 00 22 00 h controlled by automatic curtain relative air humidity was 75 and photosynthetic active radiation par above the canopy was 500 µmol m 2 s 1 in average provided by the sunlight plus supplementary lamps the vapor pressure deficit vpd in the greenhouse cells was ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 kpa 2 2 experimental design two greenhouse cells with different co2 concentrations namely cell 1 with 400 ppm ambient co2 concentration a co2 and cell 2 with 800 ppm elevated co2 concentration e co2 were used in both greenhouse cells the co2 was sustained or achieved by emission of pure co2 from a bottled tank and distributed evenly in the cell through internal ventilation the co2 in the glasshouse cells was monitored every 6 s by a co2 transmitter series gmt220 vaisala group helsinki finland for amaranth five seeds per pot were sown on 4th of october 2017 8 days after sowing one healthy seedling was kept per pot 18 days later perlite was used to cover soil surface to diminish the evaporation 30 days after sowing the plants were supplied with nutrients of 1 05 g nh4no3 and 0 375 g h2kpo4 per pot to satisfy the amaranth plant growth and biomass formation the drought treatment started at 7th of november 2017 well watered plants were manually irrigated at 15 00 h on a daily basis to reach 95 of whc i e 1650 g while drought stressed plants were subjected to progressive soil drying until transpiration rate decreased to ca 10 of the well watered plants for maize four seeds per pot were sown on 21st of december 2017 15 days after sowing one healthy seedling was kept per pot 18 days later perlite was used to cover soil surface to reduce the evaporation 27 days after sowing the plants were supplied with nutrients of 2 85 g nh4no3 and 3 5 g h2kpo4 per pot to satisfy the maize plant growth and biomass formation the drought treatment started at 22nd of january 2018 well watered plants were manually irrigated at 15 00 h on a daily basis to reach 95 of whc i e 1650 g while the drought stressed plants were subjected to progressive soil drying until transpiration rate decreased to ca 10 of well watered plants four replicated pots were used for each species and treatment and the pots were randomly arranged in each co2 cell the flow chart of experiment design in amaranth and maize plants from sowing to drought stress treatment finished period was shown in fig 1 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil water status soil water status was determined by daily weighing the pots using an analytical balance sartorius model qa35ede s the pots were weighed on a daily basis at 15 00 h and soil water status was presented as the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw which has been used as an indicator for soil water status of plants experiencing progressive drought e g liu et al 2019 the ftsw value is the ratio between the amount of remaining transpirable soil water in the pot and total transpirable soil water ttsw 1 ftsw wtn wtf ttsw where wtn is the pot weight on a given date and wtf is the pot weight at the last day of drying cycle when the transpiration rate of drought stressed plants reaches 10 of well watered plants ttsw is the difference between pot weight at 100 whc 1734 g and pot weight of drought stressed plants at the last day of drying cycle namely when the transpiration rate decreased to 10 of well watered plants ca 800 g 2 3 2 leaf gas exchange after onset the drought stress treatment net photosynthesis rate an and stomatal conductance gs were measured daily on the third upper fully expanded leaf developed after the onset of drought treatment exactly on the mid portion of the leaf away from the veins using a li 6400xt portable photosynthesis system li cor ne usa the measurements were conducted from 9 30 12 00 h at a par of 1500 mol m 2 s 1 leaf temperature of 20 ºc and co2 of 400 ppm for a co2 and 800 ppm for e co2 respectively for both species preformed photosynthetic light response curves indicate that 1500 mol m 2 s 1 of par is sufficient for photosynthetic light saturation for each leaf the measurement took ca 6 min until stable readings on an and gs was reached and logged three times the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei during the soil drying treatment was calculated as an gs 2 3 3 stomatal density leaf epidermal impressions in amaranth were taken one day before the ending of the drought stress from both adaxial and abaxial surface of upper fully expended leaf developed after

wayne rasband national institutes of health usa java 1 6 0 24 64 bit was used for counting the stomata in amaranth and maize plants 2 4 leaf aba analysis after onset of soil drying the same leaves used for gas exchange measurements were harvested 5 times during the treatment periods corresponding to varied ftsw values the fresh leaf samples around 4 cm were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at 80 c the samples were grounded into fine powder and 30 mg each sample was weighted for aba assay 1 ml milli q water was added into the sample and aba was extracted on a shaken plate overnight at 4 c the extract was centrifuged at 14 000g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was used to determine aba concentration with elisa according to the protocol of asch 2000 2 5 leaf area and plant water use efficiency at final harvest day leaf area was measured by using a leaf area meter li cor 3100 li cor inc lincoln nb the leaf and stem samples were collected separately for drying in an oven for 48 h at 70 c to determine dry biomass and specific leaf area sla was calculated by dividing the leaf area with leaf dry biomass biomass increment was calculated from the difference of aboveground dry biomass between 1st and final harvest day plant water consumption pwc was the water use between plant first and final harvest water use efficiency at plant level wuep during the soil drying was calculated as biomass increment pwc 2 6 statistics analysis to evaluate the maximal value of an and gs at unstressed conditions the linear plateau model was modified as an or gs equals 2 an

results 3 1 soil water status the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw maintained above ca 0 8 under well watered condition for both species after withholding irrigation the ftsw in pots of drought stressed plants decreased over time until the whole plant available water was consumed which took around 12 14 days fig 2 3 2 response of leaf gas exchange rates to progressive soil drying in both species the response of an and gs to ftsw range from 0 0 to 0 6 was well described by the linear plateau model figs 3 and 4 the an curves were fitted by using linear plateau model with r2 of 0 95 0 90 0 85 and 0 77 respectively for amaranth at a co2 and e co2 and maize at a co2 and e co2 growth conditions the maximal net photosynthesis rate an max was significantly greater for plants grown at e co2 than at a co2 compared to a co2 e co2 significantly increased an max in amaranth and maize by 28 and 39 respectively the ftsw threshold at which the an of plants started to decrease due to drought was not affected by co2 in amaranth but was significantly increased by e co2 in maize fig 3 table 1 the gs curves were fitted by using linear plateau model with r2 of 0 97 0 87 0 79 and 0 68 respectively for amaranth at a co2 and e co2 and maize at a co2 and e co2 growth conditions the maximal stomatal conductance gs max was significantly lower i e reduced by 19 and 25 in amaranth and maize respectively for plants grown at e co2 compared to those grown at a co2 the ftsw threshold at which the gs of plants started to decrease due to drought stress was significantly higher at e co2 than at a co2 fig 4 table 1 at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 of progressive drought stress e co2 significantly increased a 281 12 intrinsic water use efficiency wuei in amaranth p 0 05 in maize e co2 possessed a 92 25 higher wuei than those grown under a co2 p 0 001 fig 5 3 3 leaf aba concentration at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 of the progressive soil drying aba leaf showed a 12 97 higher trend in amaranth grown at a co2 than at e co2 whereas a 62 32 lower change was true for maize p 0 01 fig 6 3 4 stomatal density stomatal density sd was significantly affected by co2 in both species compared to plants grown at a co2 e co2 significantly decreased 11 29 sd in amaranth but increased 9 26 sd in maize compared to well watered treatment drought stress increased 28 99 sd in amaranth at both co2 growth conditions whereas in maize drought decreased 10 32 sd only at e co2 p 0 05 fig 7 3 5 leaf area and specific leaf area in maize compared to a co2 e co2 increased 17 81 leaf area under well watered treatment but maintained leaf area under drought stress compared to well watered treatment drought stress decreased 53 47 leaf area in both species at both co2 growth conditions fig 8 compared to plants grown at a co2 e co2 significantly decreased 15 61 specific leaf area sla in amaranth compared to well watered treatment drought stress decreased 38 55 sla in both species at each co2 environment fig 9 3 6 biomass increment plant water consumption and water use efficiency there was no difference on biomass increment between a co2 and e co2 in both species compared to well watered treatment drought stress decreased 38 15 biomass increment in both species at both co2 growth conditions fig 10 compared to plants grown at a co2 e co2 increased 21 61 plant water consumption pwc in amaranth compared to well watered treatment drought stress decreased 43 4 pwc in both species at both co2 environment fig 11 in amaranth compared to a co2 e co2 decreased 23 53 plant water use efficiency wuep under both water status compared to well watered treatment drought stress maintained wuep although showed the trend to increase 8 85 wuep at both co2 environment in maize there was no difference on wuep across all treatments although wuep showed the 5 61 and 3 08 increased trend under e co2 and drought stress respectively fig 12 4 discussion there is common consensus that an of c4 species are less responsive to high co2 compared to c3 species due to the specialized co2 concentrating mechanism reddy et al 2010 in line with this leakey 2006 reported in maize under well watered condition e co2 550 ppm had no significant effect on an in contrast here e co2 significantly increased an for both amaranth and maize plants though the increase was more pronounced in maize than in amaranth fig 3 this varied response of an to e co2 between c4 monocot and dicot could be related to the ability to concentrate co2 in the bundle sheath bs cell ziska and bunce 1997 based on the biochemical subtype classification in c4 plants amaranth and maize is classified as nad me and nadp me type respectively studies have indicated that co2 leakage from bs cell wall was lower in monocots compared to dicots due to the presence of suberized lamella in bs cells in the nadp me subtype of monocots ehleringer and pearcy 1983 also lecain and morgan 1998 reported that an in nadp me species showed more pronounced response to e co2 compared to that of the nad me species these findings are in a good agreement with our result nevertheless ziska and bunce 1997 reported a significant increase in an under e co2 in eight out of ten c4 species where dicots e g amaranthus sp increased by 30 while the monocots e g zea mays increased by 5 thus the mechanisms for the varied an response to e co2 in different c4 species i e between monocots and dicots still remains largely elusive and merit further studies numerous studies have reported that e co2 caused a reduction in gs for both c3 and c4 species yan et al 2017 in the present study gs max was significantly reduced in both species grown at e co2 and the reduction was more pronounced in maize than in amaranth fig 4 consistent with this bunce 2004 reported that e co2 decreased gs much more in monocots 42 than in dicots 28 the decline of gs in response to e co2 could be attributed to both short term i e decrease in stomatal aperture and long term i e decrease in stomatal density mechanisms engineer et al 2016 earlier studies have proposed that the co2 binding carbonic anhydrases the interplay with aba and the guard cell photosynthesis are potential stimulus involved in inducing stomatal closure with a short term exposure to e co2 ainsworth and long 2005 engineer et al 2016 under well watered condition raschke 1975 showed that aba enhanced the stomatal co2 response in line with this tazoe and santrucek 2015 reported that e co2 induced gs reduction might be mediated by aba levels in the present study along with the progression of soil drying at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 aba leaf was consistently higher in amaranth grown at a co2 than at e co2 whereas the opposite trend was true for maize fig 6 these would have modulated the response of gs to soil drying differently between the two species as discussed later fig 4 in addition it is notable that the aba at whole leaf level could be different from that of guard cell thus a direct measurement on guard cell aba is needed in order to reveal the response of aba to co2 growth environment and its role in regulating g s in a long term the reduction of gs in plants grown at e co2 could be due to the decrease in stomatal density sd woodward et al 2002 woodward and kelly 1995 reported that among 100 species investigated 74 species showed a significant reduction in sd when grown at e co2 according to a meta analysis the e co2 induced gs reduction in free air co2 enrichment face experiments was averaged 22 across all plant species n c 580 ainsworth and rogers 2007 here e co2 significantly increased sd in maize but decreased it in amaranth fig 7 indicating the diverse responses of sd among species to change of co2 growth environment lake and woodward 2008 in contrast to our result maroco et al 1999 reported a 10 decrease in sd of maize grown at a co2 concentration of 1100 ppm for 30 days as compared to plants grown at 350 ppm co2 the reduction of gs in amaranth could be partially attributed to the lowered sd under e co2 while this was not true for maize in which the e co2 induced gs reduction might be mainly due to stomatal closure moreover in e co2 maize plant drought stress had a lower sd fig 7 indicating that at a co2 drought stress reduced maize gs mostly result from decrease in stomatal aperture not in sd whilst at e co2 the decrease in sd under drought stress may be helpful to induce reduction in maize gs response to drought combined with e co2 environment anyhow the measurements on stomatal pore size should be done in future studies to clearly explain the different response in the present study the soil water status in the pots was evaluated by fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw using a linear plateau model the response of leaf gas exchange parameters to progressive soil water deficit was evaluated it was found that an and gs for species tended to become more sensitive to soil water deficit when grown in e co2 as exemplified by the greater ftsw thresholds except an for amaranth for plants at e co2 than at a co2 figs 3 and 4 table 1 on the contrary our earlier studies in c3 species i e tomato found that e co2 retarded the response of an and gs to soil drying yan et al 2017 liu et al 2019 additionally several other authors also reported a delayed response of gs to drought in plants grown under e co2 compared to a co2 e g in barley robredo et al 2007 grasses abdelgawad et al 2015 and grapevines da silva et al 2017 an earlier stomatal closure under e co2 would conserve soil moisture and prolong the survival of plants under extended period of drought stress yan et al 2017 on the other hand a late stomatal closure leads to maintaining leaf gas exchange longer as the soil dries thus sustaining the growth rate liang et al 2018 it has been suggested that the early gs reduction in response to progressive soil drying might be a result of higher plant and leaf hydraulic conductance compared to late decrease in gs choudhary and sinclair 2014 whereas the late reduction in gs could be due to the lower osmotic potential which maintain a greater leaf turgor pressure liang et al 2018 furthermore it is well known that aba plays an important role in inducing stomatal closure during soil drying liu et al 2005 here leaf aba of amaranth was consistently higher in plants grown at a co2 than at e co2 which would expect to cause an earlier stomatal closure in the a co2 plants fig 6 this was however not the case as the ftsw threshold for gs reduction was significantly lower for plants grown at a co2 than at e co2 thus one explanation could be that the stomata become more sensitive to leaf aba in plants grown at e co2 on the contrary at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 of progressive drought stress maize plants grown at e co2 possessed significantly higher leaf aba than those grown at a co2 this could have contributed to an earlier decrease of gs in the e co2 plants as shown in fig 4 hence these above results indicate that the modulation of e co2 on gs response to soil drying differs between the two species the reduction in gs response under e co2 in order to maintain a constant ci ca causes a negligible offset of the higher an thus greatly increases water use efficiency wue liu et al 2019 besides leaf wue would be enhanced under moderate water stress as a result of the larger decrease in gs than an liu et al 2005 thereby the combined effect of e co2 and drought might further improve wue in leaf moreover de souza et al 2008 reported in c4 species sugarcane grown under e co2 showed a 30 increase of an and a 37 decrease of gs leading to a 62 increase of wuei these findings were in good agreement with our observation as e co2 significantly increased the wuei compared to those grown under a co2 at ftsw ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 of progressive soil drying in both species particular in maize fig 5 such improvement of wuei in both plants induced by drought stress under e co2 environment implies that these c4 species could be better adapted to future climate changed scenarios the change in specific leaf area sla was mainly due to the change in dry matter and leaf expansion rates adapting to abiotic stress the higher sensitivity of leaf expansion growth than carbon assimilation to stress might result in lower sla vile et al 2005 here drought stress reduced sla thicker leaves in both species disregarding their co2 growth environment fig 9 the similar phenomenon has been reported by liu and stützel 2004 in amaranth where they found that the reduction of sla was accompanied with the improvement in plant wue besides the response of sla to e co2 was species dependent where no effect of co2 on sla was observed in maize while sla was decreased in amaranth fig 9 it was suggested that the reduction in sla was proportional to the increase in photosynthesis rate or might be as a consequence of the decrease in leaf n concentration under e co2 environment and this need further investigation in this study drought stress decreased leaf area biomass increment and plant water consumption pwc in both species figs 8 10 and 11 a number of studies have reported that exposed to e co2 the biomass accumulation was enhanced in c3 plant under well watered and moderate drought stress while this was pronounced only under drought stress in c4 plant van der kooi et al 2016 under e co2 the growth increment in c3 plant was about 40 45 whereas in c4 plant was around 10 20 reddy et al 2010 however here both leaf area and biomass increment were not different between a co2 and e co2 in amaranth while in maize well watered leaf area was increased at e co2 biomass increment showed the increase trend at e co2 although was no statistically significant figs 8 and 10 in addition the pwc was increased at e co2 in well watered amaranth while there was no difference of pwc between a co2 and e co2 in maize fig 11 these implied that the plant growth and water use responses were species dependent the lowered gs of plants grown under e co2 would conserve the soil moisture purcell et al 2018 which would prolong the period of subsequent plant water use plant wue wuep showed a 4 68 increase trend in both species under drought stress although the difference was not statistically significant compared to the well watered treatment fig 12 an earlier study had reported that e co2 could reduce gs in both c3 and c4 species but c4 plant has the ability to increase co2 assimilation rate under moderate drought stress wall 2001 thus e co2 could ameliorate the negative effect of drought stress van der kooi et al 2016 yan et al 2017 similarly in the present study wuep showed an increase trend at e co2 in maize along with soil drying although the difference was not significant whereas in amaranth wuep was decreased at e co2 due to the higher pwc fig 12 this was suggested that the soil water content was conserved in amaranth which delayed the onset and severity of water stress probably the stomatal response to e co2 may have differently influenced the whole plant water use reddy et al 2010 indicating the different plant wue response to e co2 between amaranth and maize species as this study was mainly about leaf gas exchange and plant growth variation in c4 species respond to drought stress and e co2 thus the more physiological and biochemical response from soil stomatal leaf to plant scale related to environmental conditions would be considered in the future investigation to better elucidate the different regulation mechanism in c4 plants 5 conclusions taken together the varied responses of photosynthesis gs and plant growth to drought and e co2 between amaranth and maize imply they possess different mechanisms in stomatal control over carbon gain versus water loss most interestingly the opposite effects of e co2 on the sensitivity of gs and stomatal density between the two c4 species may reveal some intrinsic differences in the mechanisms regulating stomatal behavior and wue from leaf to plant scale among monocot and dicot plants the more physiological and biochemical response from soil stomatal to plant scale related to various environments would be considered in the future study these findings are essentially important for selecting crop species and developing management strategies to optimize crop

9574,management of saline water through desalination or blending with low salinity canal water may be a viable strategy for potato irrigation in semi arid regions having saline ground water and scarce canal water a 4 year study was conducted to investigate the effects of four water qualities canal water cw desalinated water dsw saline ground water gw and mixed water mw cw gw three n p k fertigation levels f100 100 npk 190 28 4 and 53 9 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively f80 80 npk and f60 60 npk and their interaction on the performance of two potato varieties grown in a sandy loam alluvial soil of semi arid region the electrical conductivity ec of cw dsw gw and mw ranged from 0 3 to 0 4 0 2 0 3 3 2 4 2 and 1 8 2 2 ds m 1 respectively drip irrigation with gw resulted in 21 44 reduction in total tuber yield compared with cw however the maximum reduction 54 was observed in grade a tuber yield that was accompanied by a considerable increase in grade c tuber yield irrigation with mw increased total tuber yield by 9 37 compared with gw irrigation with dsw manifested a 41 and 14 increase in total tuber yield as compared with gw and mw respectively the tuber yield obtained with mw was comparable with dsw up to soil ec1 2 of 0 65 ds m 1 and beyond that level dsw was observed to be superior the variety kufri surya had slight yield advantage over kufri pukhraj when cw dsw and mw were used however yields of both varieties were statistically at par under gw irrigation the variety kufri jyoti exhibited a 13 22 yield advantage over kufri surya for all irrigation water qualities plant growth and yield attributing parameters were the highest at f100 which declined progressively with a decrease in fertigation level for all water qualities however these differences were narrow between gw and mw and moderate between cw and dsw therefore in drip fertigated potatoes using saline or mixed water in a sandy loam soil it is advocated to use 80 of recommended npk without any loss in tuber yield and to reduce cost of cultivation environmental pollution keywords desalinated water drip irrigation fertigation irrigation water quality potato saline water 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is cultivated in over a hundred thousand hectares in the punjab region of india which accounts for 38 of the area under vegetable production in the state potatoes are sensitive to water stress at all stages of growth and therefore irrigation is essential for the successful production of this crop unlu et al 2006 ierna et al 2011 however brackish ground water and a limited supply of good quality canal water has been a major constraint for potato production in many arid and semi arid regions of the world including south western punjab different states in india use brackish ground water for irrigation ranging from 32 to 84 of total ground water supply kaledhonkar et al 2020 saline ground waters usually exist in coastal and arid regions and are often accompanied with high water tables and water logged areas sodic ground waters on the other hand are prevalent in semi arid regions where the average annual rainfall is 500 700 mm choudhary et al 2011 in the indian punjab region 69 of the poor quality ground water is sodic 25 is saline and 6 is saline sodic in nature sekhon et al 2020 potato is classified as a moderately salt sensitive crop grieve et al 2012 however the crop is particularly sensitive during the period of tuber bud initiation also salinity can reduce the proportion of extra large tubers in favour of smaller more commercially acceptable seed tubers shannon and grieve 1999 in addition differences in salt tolerance among potato cultivars have been reported levy et al 1988 levy 1992 patel et al 2001 the response of a particular cultivar to salinity stress depends upon many factors such as the concentration and composition of soluble salts soil texture rainfall shallow water table levels and water management practices including the method amount and frequency of irrigation choudhary et al 2011 several researchers have indicated that when saline waters are used for irrigation care must be taken to avoid salt accumulation in the root zone mokh et al 2014 the soluble salts decrease the osmotic potential of the soil solution which reduce the water and nutrient uptake by plant roots thereby impacting photosynthesis transpiration crop growth and yield russo et al 2009 nagaz et al 2012 using saline water through conventional furrow irrigation is potentially harmful as it can deteriorate soil physical properties which can adversely impact yields even more modification of the environment to suit the plant needs is the best approach to improve and sustain crop productivity in salt affected environments choudhary et al 2011 drip irrigation is one effective management approach that has revolutionized the production of some high value crops using saline water as it has the potential to maintain a high soil moisture content and therefore low matric stress around the root zone of the plant moreover the practice moves the salts towards the periphery of the wetting front and therefore maintains a lower soil water salinity near the drip emitter where root density is high nagaz et al 2007 choudhary et al 2011 kaledhonkar et al 2020 a number of researchers have advocated the use of surface drip irrigation to manage brackish irrigation water in potato and other crops dehghanisanij et al 2006 choudhary et al 2010 nagaz et al 2012 mokh et al 2014 jha et al 2017 kaledhonkar et al 2020 however the long term sustainability of saline water irrigation through drip irrigation in arid regions requires that the salts added through irrigation water are effectively leached from the root zone by rainwater during the following monsoon season kaledhonkar et al 2020 blending saline and non saline water in the correct proportion to maintain the ec of blended water at or below threshold level is a viable option for this conjunctive use of salty and fresh water shannon and grieve 2000 choudhary et al 2011 the potential of blending two water sources of different water qualities depends on the crop type salinity sodicity of the gw quantity of fresh water supply and economically acceptable levels of yield reductions minhas and gupta 1992 while working on tomatoes at the same experimental site garg et al 2019 have observed that blending canal water with saline water in equal proportions and applying that through drip irrigation gave 35 higher yield than that with saline water alone an alternative approach to this blended saline fresh water management strategy is by desalinating the groundwater through reverse osmosis processes prior to irrigation using desalinated water to irrigate high value cash crops such as potato may lead to significant saving of irrigation water currently used for leaching salts out of the root zone while simultaneously increasing yield and reducing groundwater pollution silber et al 2015 desalinated water is already used by farmers in israel spain and australia yermiyahu et al 2007 and its utilization as a source of irrigation in agriculture is on the rise ben gal et al 2009 as the desalination of saline ground water costs less than desalination of sea water zhou and tol 2005 information on the utilization of both blended and desalinated water applied through surface drip irrigation in potato production systems in semi arid regions is lacking therefore field investigations were conducted to study the effect of four irrigation water qualities canal water desalinated water ground water and blended water on the growth total and graded tuber yield of two potato varieties in a sandy loam soil in a semi arid region this study was continued for four consecutive seasons and included three npk fertigation levels in order to study their interactions with water quality treatments the other aim of this investigation was to study the effects of these water quality treatments on soil properties ph electrical conductivity and organic carbon in the root zone 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site

sandy loam with 75 0 sand 16 8 silt and 8 2 clay 2 2 field experiment the field experiments were conducted in a factorial randomized block in split plot design with 24 treatments replicated three times fig s1 the treatments were comprised of four irrigation water quality canal water cw desalinated water dsw ground tubewell water gw and mixed water mw cw and gw in a 1 1 ratio two varieties and three n p k fertigation levels f100 100 npk 190 28 4 and 53 9 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively f80 80 npk and f60 60 npk irrigation water quality was the main plot treatment whereas six treatment combinations of two varieties and three fertigation levels were the sub plot treatments each main plot and sub plot treatment was replicated thrice the varieties grown were kufri pukhraj and kufri surya during the first three years whereas kufri jyoti and kufri surya were planted during 2017 18 the disease free seed tubers of these varieties were obtained from nhrdf national horticultural research and development foundation regional office bathinda india the entire field 120 m 36 m was divided in to three blocks replications and each block measured 120 m 10 m fig s1 in between two adjacent blocks an area measuring 120 m 3 m was kept unplanted to facilitate data recording each block was divided in to four main plots each measuring 30 m 10 m each main plot comprised six sub plots each of size 4 05 m 10 m an area measuring 0 95 m 10 m was kept unplanted between two adjacent sub plots each sub plot of 40 5 m2 area comprised three raised beds each of 10 m length the bed width was 0 90 m at base and 0 70 m at top of the bed the furrow between two adjacent beds was 0 45 m wide at base the field was not changed during the course of study and the respective plots were used for the same treatment during all the four years of experimentation well rotten farm yard manure at the rate of 50 tons ha 1 was incorporated in each sub plot before sowing to control black scurf seed tubers were dipped in a solution of monceren 250 sl at the rate of 2 5 ml per litre of water for 10 min the treated tubers were kept in shade for 24 h before sowing and were manually planted in end october to early november in two rows spaced 50 cm apart and at an intra row spacing of 20 cm in a zig zag manner for weed control stomp 30 ec pendimethalin at the rate of 2 5 l ha 1 was sprayed within 48 h after sowing 2 3 irrigation water quality treatments the composition of all four irrigation water qualities used in this study is described in table 2 all four water qualities were stored in four separate water storage tanks of 1 5 million litre capacity each the cw and gw were mixed in equal proportions in a third water storage tank wherein an ec of 2 0 ds m 1 was maintained the dsw was used from a desalination plant manufactured and installed by rochem india installed at the experimental site this desalination plant works on the principle of reverse osmosis and uses disc membrane assembly with the membrane elements being arranged hydraulically in series the gw was used as feed input for the desalination plant whereas the main output permeate or desalinated water was stored in a desalinated water storage tank desalination plant had a filtration capacity of 10 m3 per hour with 90 output permeate efficiency the 10 reject brine obtained after the process of desalination was stored in a brine storage tank spread over 1 hectare area the base of which was covered with a high density polyethylene hdpe sheet of 500 µm thickness 2 4 irrigation and fertigation single drip lateral of 16 mm diameter having 1 3 l per hour discharge rate and in line emitters spaced at 30 cm were used in the centre of each bed to irrigate two rows of potato plants pre sowing irrigation 50 mm was given to ensure proper moisture in the field for germination however further irrigations with four water qualities were started after crop emergence which took 13 17 days to avoid salinity effect on early growth subsequent irrigations were given on alternate days throughout the growing season of potato crop with quantities based on daily crop water requirements through an automated surface drip irrigation system irrigations were stopped at dehaulming 105 das i e 10 days prior to harvesting optimum daily crop water requirement etc was estimated from climatic data using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as given below 1 etc kc et0 where etc is the daily crop evapotranspiration or crop water requirement mm day 1 kc is crop coefficient that mainly depends on type of crop growth stage of crop and the climate and et0 is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 i e evapotranspiration from the reference surface the kc values for the experiment were decided on the basis of semi arid conditions and planting time the estimated kc values during the initial development mid and late stage of potato were 0 70 0 70 1 15 1 15 and 1 15 0 50 respectively similar values of kc were used for all treatments and therefore equal amount of irrigation water was applied to all treatments the reference surface eto estimates evaporative losses from an extensive surface of green well watered grass of uniform height actively growing and completely shading the ground daily meteorological data was obtained from the meteorological station located at the site the total water applied to the crop through irrigation including pre sowing irrigation and effective rainfall from sowing to dehaulming was 127 mm 163 mm 172 mm and 159 mm during 2014 15 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively total number of irrigations applied during the corresponding years was 43 46 46 and 44 cumulative pan evaporation from sowing to dehaulming during the corresponding years was 192 mm 260 mm 277 mm and 241 mm the water soluble inorganic fertilizers viz urea 46 n urea phosphate 17 n 19 2 p and muriate of potash mop 49 8 k were applied through an automated surface drip irrigation system to fulfil the npk requirement of each plot as per local practice being adopted by growers the total npk requirement of each treated plot was divided in to 16 equal fertigation doses which were applied at 4 day interval starting from crop emergence 2 5 data collection the observations on plant height cm and number of leaves per plant were recorded at 60 and 90 days after planting on twenty plants per plot dehaulming was done at 105 days after sowing and the crop was harvested 10 days thereafter after harvesting potato tubers were graded into three grades i e grade a 75 g grade b 25 75 g and grade c 25 g and the yield of each grade was recorded separately in kg per plot the yield obtained from all three grades was added to estimate total tuber yield the soil samples at 0 15 and 15 30 cm depth were taken near the root zone from each plot at 20 25 cm horizontal distance from the lateral and analyzed for various chemical properties viz ph electrical conductivity ec and organic carbon soil ph was determined by beckman s glass electrode ph metre and the ec was determined by solubridge conductivity metre in 1 2 soil water ratio jackson 1967 the organic carbon oc content of soil was determined by rapid titration method of walkley and black 1934 the samples of all four irrigation water qualities were also analyzed periodically for various chemical properties viz ph ec jackson 1967 carbonates and bicarbonates by total alkalinity method jenkins and moore 1977 calcium ca2 plus magnesium mg2 by versenate disodium dihydrogen ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta method diehl et al 1950

variance anova procedure laid out for factorial randomized block in split plot design gomez and gomez 1984 using statistical software cpcs1 developed by punjab agricultural university ludhiana india cheema and singh 1990 the main effects of three factors irrigation water quality variety and fertigation levels and interaction among them were estimated and tested for significance by fisher s least

means was done using the least significant difference at p 0 05 piepho 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of irrigation water quality on growth parameters of potato irrespective of other factors irrigation water quality iwq exerted a significant effect p 0 05 on potato growth parameters i e plant height and number of leaves at both 60 and 90 days after sowing das for pooled data table 3 and during all four years of study table 4 the potato crop achieved the maximum growth attributes when it was drip irrigated with cw whereas the minimum values of growth parameters were recorded in plots irrigated with gw the data pooled over years revealed that irrigation with gw manifested 37 5 and 37 2 reduction in plant height 29 2 and 30 5 decrease in number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively as compared to irrigation with cw however this reduction was the lowest during first year of study 28 7 29 6 in plant height and 16 8 19 6 in number of leaves and showed a steady progression with time 30 7 32 7 in plant height and 26 0 34 3 in number of leaves in second year and 38 8 40 0 in plant height and 31 4 39 2 in number of leaves in third year of experimentation the reduction was the maximum during the fourth year of the study 49 4 50 5 in plant height and 32 3 35 1 in number of leaves this may be attributed to the steady increase in soil ec 1 soil 2 water ratio of the brackish water irrigated plots i e from 0 51 to 0 53 ds m 1 during first year to 0 84 0 90 ds m 1 during fourth year fig 1 in a clay loam soil of israel heuer and nadler 1995 have reported 17 reduction in plant height of potato when drip irrigated with saline water having ec of 6 0 ds m 1 over control drip irrigation with non saline water having ec of 1 5 ds m 1 while conducting a study on potato in a loamy sand soil of indian punjab jha et al 2017 have also observed a significant decrease in plant height at 30 das 60 das and dehaulming with increases in ec of irrigation water applied through drip irrigation this was likely due to the presence of salts in the soil solution decreasing the osmotic potential of soil solution making it difficult for the roots to absorb water and nutrients necessary for plant growth and development patel et al 2001 have also emphasized that initial soil salinity is important for successful potato cultivation because potatoes are relatively sensitive to salinity drip irrigation with mw resulting in an ec of about 2 0 ds m 1 was less growth suppressing in potato than was gw during all the four years of study table 4 and for pooled data table 3 however as discussed earlier this benefit was lower during the initial years of study but kept on increasing each year due to progressive increase in soil salinity ec of plots irrigated with gw fig 1 the data pooled over years revealed that drip irrigation with blended water resulted in 21 9 and 23 6 higher plant height 16 6 and 15 6 higher number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively than obtained with gw irrigation drip irrigation with dsw produced significantly p 0 05 higher plant height and number of leaves over those with gw and mw during all the four years of experimentation table 4 the data pooled over years table 3 revealed that irrigation with dsw caused 37 7 and 39 1 increment in plant height 30 8 and 32 9 in number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively over irrigation with gw the magnitude of increase was lower when dsw was compared with blended water i e 12 9 and 12 5 in plant height 12 2 and 14 9 in number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively therefore it is evident that the utilization of desalinated water offers another option for irrigation in areas scarce in good quality water resources however the growth parameter values of potatoes irrigated with dsw were significantly lower than those with cw irrigation the decrease was 13 9 and 12 6 in plant height 7 5 and 7 7 in number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively this may be attributed to comparatively lower concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium ions in dsw as compared with canal water table 2 3 2 effect of irrigation water quality on grade wise and total tuber yield among the four growing seasons the maximum total tuber yields were obtained in third year of study 2016 17 fig 2 this was considered to be due to less frost injury and a greater number of frost free nights during 2016 17 due to high night temperature table 1 in the indian punjab region there is problem of ground frost in december and january and potatoes are sensitive to frost the number of nights with probability of ground frost occurrence during crop growth period was 11 4 2 and 12 during 2014 15 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively irrespective of other factors the effects of iwq on total tuber yield were significant p 0 05 in all four years of study fig 2 the maximum total tuber yield was recorded with cw irrigation and was followed by dsw and mw whereas the lowest yield was observed with gw irrigation in all the years the data pooled over years table 5 exhibited that irrigation with gw registered 32 9 reduction in total tuber yield over that with cw however as observed in case of growth parameters this reduction was the lowest during first year 21 0 moderate during second year 29 0 and third year 37 6 and was the maximum during fourth year 43 5 due to progressive increase in soil ec of gw irrigated plots this decrease in yield may be due to reduction in plant height and number of leaves of potato leading to comparatively less light interception photosynthesis and translocation of photosynthates from source to sink the reduction in potato tuber yield with the use of saline water is considered to be linked to salinity in the root zone which reduces the water and nutrient uptake by the plant mokh et al 2014 several researchers have reported the adverse effects on potato tuber yield when saline water was used with surface or drip irrigation levy 1992 van hoorn et al 1993 patel et al 2001 have reported that the average total yield of potato across all cultivars was 20 higher in a non saline soil compared with a saline soil in a study conducted on potato in a loamy sand alluvial soil of north western india jha et al 2017 have also reported maximum tuber yield with good quality irrigation water and observed 17 reduction in tuber yield when the crop was drip irrigated with water having ec of 4 0 ds m 1 over control drip irrigation with water having ec of 0 65 ds m 1 drip irrigation with mw cw gw brought a significant p 0 05 increase in total tuber yield over that with gw during all these four years fig 2 however as observed in case of growth parameters this increment progressed from 8 6 during first year to 36 6 during fourth year due to progressive increase in soil salinity of plots irrigated with gw fig 1 this increment was 23 6 when the data were pooled over years table 5 it occurred because drip irrigation with mw resulted in comparatively lower soil salinity ec1 2 at both depths 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm compared with gw fig 1 as potato has been described as moderately sensitive to salinity shannon and grieve 2000 however it is pertinent to mention here that drip irrigation with blended water could not yield up to the levels achieved with fresh water and recorded 14 2 16 5 14 9 and 22 9 reduction in total tuber yield during first second third and fourth year respectively fig 2 and the decrease was 17 0 when the data were pooled over years table 5 drip irrigation with dsw exhibited significantly p 0 05 higher total tuber yield over that with gw and mw irrigation during all the four years of experimentation fig 2 the increment over gw was 19 3 23 2 55 5 and 75 whereas that over mw was 9 8 4 8 13 9 and 28 1 during first second third and fourth years respectively the data pooled over years table 5 revealed that irrigation with dsw resulted in a 40 6 and 13 8 increase in total tuber yield over irrigation with gw and mw respectively it may be attributed to the fact that the process of desalination removes undesirable salts from the ground water and its use for irrigation does not raise the ec of the soil to the levels achieved with the use of gw or mw however desalinated water could not match yield levels attained with fresh water irrigation it yielded significantly lower 5 8 and 12 5 during first and second year but statistically equal to those treated with cw irrigation during third and fourth year of study the data pooled over years table 5 exhibited that the total tuber yield of potato irrigated with dsw was significantly p 0 05 lower 5 6 than that with cw irrigation kim et al 2020 have reported that the application of desalinated irrigation water did not negatively affect growth and yield of lettuce under greenhouse conditions of korea and therefore desalinated water could reduce the pressure on scarce fresh water resources however the response of crops to desalinated irrigation water may change due to environmental factors such as soil composition use of fertilizers and the quality of desalinated water therefore it may be inferred that in areas where good quality waters are scarce out of two options mixed water and desalinated water available for potato cultivation in sandy loam soils the yield levels achieved by drip irrigation with mixed water were slightly lower but comparable to that with desalinated water when the ec1 2 of soil was below 0 650 ds m 1 however beyond this ec level drip irrigation with dsw gave comparatively better results than that with blended water 3 3 effect of irrigation water quality on grade wise tuber yield drip irrigation with gw and mw caused significant reductions in yield of all the three grades of potato as compared with those irrigated with cw in all the four years of study however the maximum impact was observed in grade a tuber yield whereas the grade c yield was the least affected on the basis of data pooled over years the use of gw and mw recorded 54 2 and 29 0 reduction in grade a 27 6 and 26 2 in grade b and 12 9 and 2 5 reduction in grade c tuber yield respectively as compared with cw irrigation table 5 apparently these reductions were of greater magnitude with gw than with mw during all the four years of study and for pooled data besides the reduction in grade a tuber yield was accompanied by simultaneous increments in grade b and grade c tuber yields however the per cent increment was considerably higher in grade c than in grade b tuber yield this became evident from the perusal of individual year data which showed that with an increase in ec1 2 of soil each year in gw irrigated plots the contribution of grade a tuber yield to total tuber yield continued to decrease 20 8 20 4 13 4 and 13 1 while that of grade c tuber yield showed an increasing trend 7 6 13 6 14 9 and 18 0 these proportions remained almost the same in cw and dsw irrigated plots across four years of study fig 2 an increase in yield of small size tubers at the cost of large size tubers with the use of gw or mw may be a monetary loss to farmers growing potato as a ware crop but it may be an advantage to growers cultivating potato as a seed crop in which a greater number of small sized tubers are desirable for example in the indian punjab region 60 of the potatoes produced are used as seed tubers which are supplied to adjoining states also patel et al 2001 have also reported significantly p 0 05 lower grade a tuber weight and higher grade b tuber weight of potato cultivar norland in saline soil as compared with non saline soil similarly jha et al 2017 have observed a significant decrease in grade a 75 g and an increase in grade d 25 g tuber yield of drip irrigated potatoes with increased salinity of the irrigation water up to 8 ds m 1 while the grade b 50 75 g and grade c 25 50 g tuber yield showed non significant changes 3 4 effect of fertigation levels on growth parameters and total tuber yield irrespective of other factors fertigation exerted a significant p 0 05 effect on plant growth parameters plant height and number of leaves at both 60 and 90 das table s1 grade wise and total tuber yield fig 3 of potato in all the four years of study and for pooled data tables 3 and 5 the maximum plant height number of leaves and total tuber yield was recorded with 100 npk and there was significant p 0 05 reduction in values of these parameters with decrease in fertilizer level to 80 and 60 npk however although significant p 0 05 the per cent reduction in these parameters was lower in reducing fertigation from 100 to 80 npk as compared to that when fertigation was lowered from 80 to 60 npk in all the four years of study the data pooled over years revealed that fertigation with 80 npk resulted in a 4 7 6 0 decrease in plant height 3 9 4 5 in number of leaves table 3 and 4 6 in total tuber yield when compared with those treated at the 100 npk level table 5 on the other hand the corresponding per cent reductions at 60 over 80 npk were 7 1 8 3 4 8 6 1 and 6 5 respectively our results are in contrast to those of sharda et al 2012 who have reported the maximum yield of drip fertigated potatoes with 80 of recommended npk 150 21 8 and 41 5 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively in a sandy loam alluvial soil of ludhiana india similarly while conducting a research trial on potato in a semi arid mediterranean climate of italy ierna et al 2011 have observed that with the reduction in the level of fertilization from f3 300 43 6 and 373 4 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively to f2 100 21 8 and 124 5 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively in the plots irrigated with 100 i3 and 50 etm maximum evapotranspiration i2 led to a negligible reduction in tuber yield of potato while a further reduction in the fertilization to f1 50 10 9 and 62 2 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively led to a reduction by 17 in i3 and 23 in i2 darwish et al 2006 have compared four nitrogen fertigation levels 125 250 375 and 500 kg ha 1 on potato in a dry mediterranean climate of lebanon in a non calcareous clay soil having low organic matter content and observed that the impact of increased nitrogen levels was visible on aboveground plant growth but the fresh tuber yield was not significantly improved and the application of 125 kg n ha 1 by fertigation was considered sufficient for processing potato the probable reason for the best results obtained with 100 npk may be that the fertilizer dose 190 28 4 and 53 9 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively used in the present study had been recommended for medium fertile soils having 0 40 0 75 organic carbon of punjab however the present study was conducted in soils having low organic carbon 0 25 0 36 therefore 80 npk fertigation level could not fulfil the nutrient needs of potato cultivars due to poor fertility status of soil coupled with semi arid climate and hence the potato crop responded to inorganic fertilizers up to 100 npk fertigation dose 3 5 irrigation water quality fertigation level interaction effects on tuber yield the interaction effects in respect of grade a grade b and grade c tuber yield were non significant p 0 05 for three three and four years respectively but were significant for grade a and grade b tuber yield for data pooled over years data not presented however for total tuber yield the interaction effects were non significant p 0 05 for the first and third year and significant p 0 05 for the second and fourth year and the pooled data fig 4 a perusal of the data fig 4 revealed that trend of total tuber yield reduction with a decrease in fertigation dose was consistent for cw and dsw in all the years of study however it did not hold true for gw and mw when mw was used through drip irrigation total tuber yield achieved with 80 npk was statistically p 0 05 at par with both 100 npk and 60 npk during second and fourth year of study this trend also followed when gw was used for irrigation during fourth year in respect to data pooled over the years although the differences among total tuber yield at all three fertigation levels were significantly p 0 05 different for all water qualities the differences were observed to be narrow for gw and mw and moderate for cw and dsw therefore it may be inferred that while raising potatoes with drip fertigation using fresh or desalinated water in a sandy loam soil 100 of recommended dose of npk should be used on the other hand when brackish or blended water is used through drip irrigation 80 of recommended npk is sufficient and increasing the dose of inorganic fertilizer beyond that may not yield beneficial results both financially and environmentally this could be due to the reason that benefits of high fertilization in potato are achieved at high irrigation level or low soil moisture tension ierna et al 2011 ierna and mauromicale 2018 but in plots irrigated with gw and mw soil moisture tension may be comparatively higher than that in cw or dsw irrigated plots due to higher ec of the soil while using saline water through surface drip irrigation in potato in a sandy soil of tunisia nagaz et al 2012 have recorded the maximum fresh tuber yield of potato 18 5 t ha 1 at 200 kg n ha 1 that did not significantly change at 300 kg n ha 1 while working on field crops in sandy soils of an arid region of rajasthan india kaledhonkar et al 2020 have concluded that in case of surface irrigation methods with saline water generally higher doses of fertilizers were required but with drip the yield levels at 100 npk were statistically at par with 125 npk due to a likely more efficient utilization of fertilizers in the drip irrigated crop a perusal of the data pooled over the years fig 4 revealed that total tuber yield achieved with dsw 100 npk and dsw 80 npk was statistically p 0 05 at par with cw 80 npk and cw 60 npk respectively this could be due to the reason that although the desalination process reduced undesirable salts in brackish water beneficial ions including essential nutrients like calcium magnesium and sulphate are also removed table 2 yermiyahu et al 2007 the resultant reduction in plant growth and yield with dsw should be compensated for by increasing the npk fertigation dose therefore in future research trials need to be conducted to explore the combined application of dsw 120 npk to achieve total tuber yield comparable with that achieved with cw 100 npk similarly total tuber yield obtained with dsw 60 npk was statistically p 0 05 at par with mw 100 npk mixed water even at lower fertigation dose 60 npk produced significantly p 0 05 higher total tuber yield than with gw at higher fertigation level 100 npk therefore it may be inferred that dsw and mw offer attractive opportunities for drip fertigation of potato where ground water is saline kumar 2017 has conducted a survey across india to analyze if conditions exist in india that might make small scale desalination for agriculture economically viable the bathinda district in south western punjab was one of the four regions identified in india which are suffering from fresh water scarcity for irrigation and human consumption the study concluded that the demand for expensive desalinated water for irrigation exists for crops that are extremely sensitive to salinity ph and for high value crops that yield very high net returns per unit volume of irrigation water used in south western punjab several reverse osmosis plants with large capacity have been installed in villages to generate drinking water similarly desalination plants could possibly be installed at the community level for irrigation purposes with a proper strategy for brine disposal and utilization on the other hand small scale desalination units will be preferred in areas in which the available ground water is not suitable in terms of chemical quality over those areas where available good quality ground water is insufficient one of the progressive farmers belonging to bathinda district of south western punjab has already installed a small scale desalination plant which produces 1000 l water per hour to raise high value flowers and vegetables under protected cultivation kumar 2017 3 6 differences in performance of varieties in terms of tuber yield irrespective of other factors there were significant p 0 05 differences in performance of varieties with respect to grade wise and total tuber yield table s2 of potato in all the four years of study with the exception of grade a and grade b tuber yield during 2014 15 the total tuber yield of kufri surya was 1 9 1 6 and 6 5 higher than that of kufri pukhraj 23 5 22 6 24 8 t ha 1 during 2014 15 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively whereas kufri jyoti outyielded kufri surya 19 3 t ha 1 by 19 1 during 2017 18 analyses of the interaction effects irrigation water quality variety fig 5 revealed that the total yield of kufri surya and kufri pukhraj was statistically p 0 05 at par when saline gw was used during first three years of study however with respect to other water qualities the total tuber yield of kufri surya was significantly higher than that of kufri pukhraj although the differences were narrow on the other hand during fourth year of study kufri jyoti yielded significantly p 0 05 higher 13 1 21 6 than that of kufri surya for all four types of irrigation water qualities used however the minimum increase 13 1 was recorded when gw was used for irrigation therefore it may be inferred that the variety kufri surya that had shown slight yield advantage over kufri pukhraj when cw dsw and mw was used lost the advantage over kufri pukhraj when gw was used for irrigation besides the variety kufri jyoti maintained its yield superiority over kufri surya irrespective of the water quality used for irrigation the other interaction effects fertigation levels variety and irrigation water quality fertigation levels variety were observed to be non significant for plant growth and yield attributes during all the four years of study and for the pooled data tables 3 and 5 3 7 effect of irrigation water quality and fertigation levels on soil properties irrespective of fertigation levels the irrigation water quality exerted non significant p 0 05 effect on organic carbon content of soil at both depths 0 15 and 15 30 cm during all 4 years of study table s3 however the effect on soil ph and ec was significant p 0 05 during all the years and for the pooled data table 6 figs 1 and 6 the ph values of gw and mw irrigated plots were significantly p 0 05 higher than cw and dsw irrigated plots at both depths during all the years however the ph of cw and dsw irrigated plots at both the depths was statistically p 0 05 at par during individual years as well as for the pooled data similarly the soil ph of mw irrigated plots was numerically lower but statistically p 0 05 at par with those of gw irrigated plots at both depths during all four years of study fig 6 however for the pooled data the soil ph of mw irrigated plots was significantly p 0 05 lower than those of gw irrigated plots at both table 6 the minimum and maximum values of soil ec1 2 were found in dsw and gw irrigated plots respectively at both depths during all years of study fig 1 and for the pooled data table 6 the mw irrigated plots recorded the ec1 2 values which were significantly p 0 05 lower than gw irrigated plots but significantly p 0 05 higher than dsw and cw irrigated plots for all the irrigation water qualities the soil ec1 2 values were the lowest in first year and showed a progressive increasing trend from the first to fourth year of the study however the increase was very sharp for gw moderate for mw and of low magnitude for cw and dsw at both soil depths fig 1 the year wise small increase in ec1 2 of soil irrigated with cw and dsw may be due to the reason that the soil of respective plots was not disturbed or cultivated during all these years while working on onion in a semi arid region of brazil pessoa et al 2019 have also reported significant increases in soil ec when irrigated with waters having different level of salts however the values of soil ec were higher in silty clay loam soil than in sandy loam soil due to higher retention of salts in fine textured soils from lower infiltration rates irrespective of irrigation water quality the fertigation levels exerted non significant p 0 05 effect on soil oc at both depths in four years of study table s4 however the effect on soil ph was non significant p 0 05 at both depths during first two years but significant p 0 05 differences were observed during third and fourth years of study table s4 and also for the pooled data table 6 the maximum ph was recorded in plots fertigated with 60 npk and it showed significant and progressive decreases with increases in fertigation doses to 80 and 100 npk the effect of fertigation levels on soil ec1 2 was non significant p 0 05 at both depths during first two years and at one depth during third and fourth years of study table s4 however the differences were significant p 0 05 for the pooled data for both soil depths table 6 the minimum values were recorded in plots fertigated with 60 npk and there was a significant p 0 05 increase in soil ec with increase in fertigation dose to 80 and 100 npk high salt concentration in soil reduces soil ph due to salt suspension effect and release of more protons in soil solution gavriloaiei 2012 low soil ph at high fertigation level may be ascribed to high soil salinity as compared with low soil salinity realized at low fertigation level choudhary et al 2011 4 conclusions drip irrigation with cw recorded the maximum plant height number of leaves and total tuber yield and was followed by dsw mw and gw irrigation in all 4 years of study irrigation with saline gw and mw lead to considerable reductions in these parameters as compared to cw irrigation however the latter was less growth and yield suppressing than the former besides the per cent reductions were the lowest during first year and showed an increasing trend due to increase in soil ec with each passing year drip irrigation with dsw yielded 19 75 and 10 28 higher over that with gw and mw respectively during 1st to 4th years of study however mw irrigation yielded comparable to that with dsw below soil ec1 2 of 0 650 ds m 1 and beyond this ec level irrigation with dsw proved superior to mw therefore in semi arid regions characterized by saline ground water and scarce fresh water potatoes may be drip irrigated with either mw or dsw depending upon soil ec drip irrigation with saline water resulted in significant decrease in grade a tuber yield with a concomitant increase in grade c tuber yield therefore saline water of ec up to 2 0 ds m 1 may be opted for irrigating seed crop of potatoes in which a greater number of small sized tubers are desirable irrespective of fertigation level total tuber yield of potatoes irrigated with dsw was 6 lower than that with cw however total yield achieved with dsw 100 npk and dsw 80 npk was statistically at par with cw 80 npk and cw 60 npk respectively therefore further research may be aimed to explore the possibility of using 120 npk with dsw to achieve yield levels comparable with cw 100 npk however if it achieves the desired result the 20 higher nutrient requirement could possibly be met not only with mineral fertilizers but with the integrated use of organic manures vermicompost farm yard manure green manure etc and mineral fertilizers keeping in view the sustainable agriculture goals the maximum values of plant height number of leaves and total tuber yield were recorded with 100 npk and there was a significant reduction in these parameters with decrease in fertigation dose to 80 and 60 npk for all water qualities however the differences were small in plants irrigated with gw mw and moderate for those irrigated with cw dsw therefore it is concluded that in drip fertigated potatoes using fresh water in a sandy loam soil of semi arid region 100 npk should be used whereas when saline or blended water is used 80 npk should be used without any loss in tuber yield so as to reduce cost of cultivation and environmental pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9574,management of saline water through desalination or blending with low salinity canal water may be a viable strategy for potato irrigation in semi arid regions having saline ground water and scarce canal water a 4 year study was conducted to investigate the effects of four water qualities canal water cw desalinated water dsw saline ground water gw and mixed water mw cw gw three n p k fertigation levels f100 100 npk 190 28 4 and 53 9 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively f80 80 npk and f60 60 npk and their interaction on the performance of two potato varieties grown in a sandy loam alluvial soil of semi arid region the electrical conductivity ec of cw dsw gw and mw ranged from 0 3 to 0 4 0 2 0 3 3 2 4 2 and 1 8 2 2 ds m 1 respectively drip irrigation with gw resulted in 21 44 reduction in total tuber yield compared with cw however the maximum reduction 54 was observed in grade a tuber yield that was accompanied by a considerable increase in grade c tuber yield irrigation with mw increased total tuber yield by 9 37 compared with gw irrigation with dsw manifested a 41 and 14 increase in total tuber yield as compared with gw and mw respectively the tuber yield obtained with mw was comparable with dsw up to soil ec1 2 of 0 65 ds m 1 and beyond that level dsw was observed to be superior the variety kufri surya had slight yield advantage over kufri pukhraj when cw dsw and mw were used however yields of both varieties were statistically at par under gw irrigation the variety kufri jyoti exhibited a 13 22 yield advantage over kufri surya for all irrigation water qualities plant growth and yield attributing parameters were the highest at f100 which declined progressively with a decrease in fertigation level for all water qualities however these differences were narrow between gw and mw and moderate between cw and dsw therefore in drip fertigated potatoes using saline or mixed water in a sandy loam soil it is advocated to use 80 of recommended npk without any loss in tuber yield and to reduce cost of cultivation environmental pollution keywords desalinated water drip irrigation fertigation irrigation water quality potato saline water 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is cultivated in over a hundred thousand hectares in the punjab region of india which accounts for 38 of the area under vegetable production in the state potatoes are sensitive to water stress at all stages of growth and therefore irrigation is essential for the successful production of this crop unlu et al 2006 ierna et al 2011 however brackish ground water and a limited supply of good quality canal water has been a major constraint for potato production in many arid and semi arid regions of the world including south western punjab different states in india use brackish ground water for irrigation ranging from 32 to 84 of total ground water supply kaledhonkar et al 2020 saline ground waters usually exist in coastal and arid regions and are often accompanied with high water tables and water logged areas sodic ground waters on the other hand are prevalent in semi arid regions where the average annual rainfall is 500 700 mm choudhary et al 2011 in the indian punjab region 69 of the poor quality ground water is sodic 25 is saline and 6 is saline sodic in nature sekhon et al 2020 potato is classified as a moderately salt sensitive crop grieve et al 2012 however the crop is particularly sensitive during the period of tuber bud initiation also salinity can reduce the proportion of extra large tubers in favour of smaller more commercially acceptable seed tubers shannon and grieve 1999 in addition differences in salt tolerance among potato cultivars have been reported levy et al 1988 levy 1992 patel et al 2001 the response of a particular cultivar to salinity stress depends upon many factors such as the concentration and composition of soluble salts soil texture rainfall shallow water table levels and water management practices including the method amount and frequency of irrigation choudhary et al 2011 several researchers have indicated that when saline waters are used for irrigation care must be taken to avoid salt accumulation in the root zone mokh et al 2014 the soluble salts decrease the osmotic potential of the soil solution which reduce the water and nutrient uptake by plant roots thereby impacting photosynthesis transpiration crop growth and yield russo et al 2009 nagaz et al 2012 using saline water through conventional furrow irrigation is potentially harmful as it can deteriorate soil physical properties which can adversely impact yields even more modification of the environment to suit the plant needs is the best approach to improve and sustain crop productivity in salt affected environments choudhary et al 2011 drip irrigation is one effective management approach that has revolutionized the production of some high value crops using saline water as it has the potential to maintain a high soil moisture content and therefore low matric stress around the root zone of the plant moreover the practice moves the salts towards the periphery of the wetting front and therefore maintains a lower soil water salinity near the drip emitter where root density is high nagaz et al 2007 choudhary et al 2011 kaledhonkar et al 2020 a number of researchers have advocated the use of surface drip irrigation to manage brackish irrigation water in potato and other crops dehghanisanij et al 2006 choudhary et al 2010 nagaz et al 2012 mokh et al 2014 jha et al 2017 kaledhonkar et al 2020 however the long term sustainability of saline water irrigation through drip irrigation in arid regions requires that the salts added through irrigation water are effectively leached from the root zone by rainwater during the following monsoon season kaledhonkar et al 2020 blending saline and non saline water in the correct proportion to maintain the ec of blended water at or below threshold level is a viable option for this conjunctive use of salty and fresh water shannon and grieve 2000 choudhary et al 2011 the potential of blending two water sources of different water qualities depends on the crop type salinity sodicity of the gw quantity of fresh water supply and economically acceptable levels of yield reductions minhas and gupta 1992 while working on tomatoes at the same experimental site garg et al 2019 have observed that blending canal water with saline water in equal proportions and applying that through drip irrigation gave 35 higher yield than that with saline water alone an alternative approach to this blended saline fresh water management strategy is by desalinating the groundwater through reverse osmosis processes prior to irrigation using desalinated water to irrigate high value cash crops such as potato may lead to significant saving of irrigation water currently used for leaching salts out of the root zone while simultaneously increasing yield and reducing groundwater pollution silber et al 2015 desalinated water is already used by farmers in israel spain and australia yermiyahu et al 2007 and its utilization as a source of irrigation in agriculture is on the rise ben gal et al 2009 as the desalination of saline ground water costs less than desalination of sea water zhou and tol 2005 information on the utilization of both blended and desalinated water applied through surface drip irrigation in potato production systems in semi arid regions is lacking therefore field investigations were conducted to study the effect of four irrigation water qualities canal water desalinated water ground water and blended water on the growth total and graded tuber yield of two potato varieties in a sandy loam soil in a semi arid region this study was continued for four consecutive seasons and included three npk fertigation levels in order to study their interactions with water quality treatments the other aim of this investigation was to study the effects of these water quality treatments on soil properties ph electrical conductivity and organic carbon in the root zone 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site

combinations of two varieties and three fertigation levels were the sub plot treatments each main plot and sub plot treatment was replicated thrice the varieties grown were kufri pukhraj and kufri surya during the first three years whereas kufri jyoti and kufri surya were planted during 2017 18 the disease free seed tubers of these varieties were obtained from nhrdf national horticultural research and development foundation regional office bathinda india the entire field 120 m 36 m was divided in to three blocks replications and each block measured 120 m 10 m fig s1 in between two adjacent blocks an area measuring 120 m 3 m was kept unplanted to facilitate data recording each block was divided in to four main plots each measuring 30 m 10 m each main plot comprised six sub plots each of size 4 05 m 10 m an area measuring 0 95 m 10 m was kept unplanted between two adjacent sub plots each sub plot of 40 5 m2 area comprised three raised beds each of 10 m length the bed width was 0 90 m at base and 0 70 m at top of the bed the furrow between two adjacent beds was 0 45 m wide at base the field was not changed during the course of study and the respective plots were used for the same treatment during all the four years of experimentation well rotten farm yard manure at the rate of 50 tons ha 1 was incorporated in each sub plot before sowing to control black scurf seed tubers were dipped in a solution of monceren 250 sl at the rate of 2 5 ml per litre of water for 10 min the treated tubers were kept in shade for 24 h before sowing and were manually planted in end october to early november in two rows spaced 50 cm apart and at an intra row spacing of 20 cm in a zig zag manner for weed control stomp 30 ec pendimethalin at the rate of 2 5 l ha 1 was sprayed within 48 h after sowing 2 3 irrigation water quality treatments the composition of all four irrigation water qualities used in this study is described in table 2 all four water qualities were stored in four separate water storage tanks of 1 5 million litre capacity each the cw and gw were mixed in equal proportions in a third water storage tank wherein an ec of 2 0 ds m 1 was maintained the dsw was used from a desalination plant manufactured and installed by rochem india installed at the experimental site this desalination plant works on the principle of reverse osmosis and uses disc membrane assembly with the membrane elements being arranged hydraulically in series the gw was used as feed input for the desalination plant whereas the main output permeate or desalinated water was stored in a desalinated water storage tank desalination plant had a filtration capacity of 10 m3 per hour with 90 output permeate efficiency the 10 reject brine obtained after the process of desalination was stored in a brine storage tank spread over 1 hectare area the base of which was covered with a high density polyethylene hdpe sheet of 500 µm thickness 2 4 irrigation and fertigation single drip lateral of 16 mm diameter having 1 3 l per hour discharge rate and in line emitters spaced at 30 cm were used in the centre of each bed to irrigate two rows of potato plants pre sowing irrigation 50 mm was given to ensure proper moisture in the field for germination however further irrigations with four water qualities were started after crop emergence which took 13 17 days to avoid salinity effect on early growth subsequent irrigations were given on alternate days throughout the growing season of potato crop with quantities based on daily crop water requirements through an automated surface drip irrigation system irrigations were stopped at dehaulming 105 das i e 10 days prior to harvesting optimum daily crop water requirement etc was estimated from climatic data using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as given below 1 etc kc et0 where etc is the daily crop evapotranspiration or crop water requirement mm day 1 kc is crop coefficient that mainly depends on type of crop growth stage of crop and the climate and et0 is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 i e evapotranspiration from the reference surface the kc values for the experiment were decided on the basis of semi arid conditions and planting time the estimated kc values during the initial development mid and late stage of potato were 0 70 0 70 1 15 1 15 and 1 15 0 50 respectively similar values of kc were used for all treatments and therefore equal amount of irrigation water was applied to all treatments the reference surface eto estimates evaporative losses from an extensive surface of green well watered grass of uniform height actively growing and completely shading the ground daily meteorological data was obtained from the meteorological station located at the site the total water applied to the crop through irrigation including pre sowing irrigation and effective rainfall from sowing to dehaulming was 127 mm 163 mm 172 mm and 159 mm during 2014 15 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively total number of irrigations applied during the corresponding years was 43 46 46 and 44 cumulative pan evaporation from sowing to dehaulming during the corresponding years was 192 mm 260 mm 277 mm and 241 mm the water soluble inorganic fertilizers viz urea 46 n urea phosphate 17 n 19 2 p and muriate of potash mop 49 8 k were applied through an automated surface drip irrigation system to fulfil the npk requirement of each plot as per local practice being adopted by growers the total npk requirement of each treated plot was divided in to 16 equal fertigation doses which were applied at 4 day interval starting from crop emergence 2 5 data collection the observations on plant height cm and number of leaves per plant were recorded at 60 and 90 days after planting on twenty plants per plot dehaulming was done at 105 days after sowing and the crop was harvested 10 days thereafter after harvesting potato tubers were graded into three grades i e grade a 75 g grade b 25 75 g and grade c 25 g and the yield of each grade was recorded separately in kg per plot the yield obtained from all three grades was added to estimate total tuber yield the soil samples at 0 15 and 15 30 cm depth were taken near the root zone from each plot at 20 25 cm horizontal distance from the lateral and analyzed for various chemical properties viz ph electrical conductivity ec and organic carbon soil ph was determined by beckman s glass electrode ph metre and the ec was determined by solubridge conductivity metre in 1 2 soil water ratio jackson 1967 the organic carbon oc content of soil was determined by rapid titration method of walkley and black 1934 the samples of all four irrigation water qualities were also analyzed periodically for various chemical properties viz ph ec jackson 1967 carbonates

irrigation water quality iwq exerted a significant effect p 0 05 on potato growth parameters i e plant height and number of leaves at both 60 and 90 days after sowing das for pooled data table 3 and during all four years of study table 4 the potato crop achieved the maximum growth attributes when it was drip irrigated with cw whereas the minimum values of growth parameters were recorded in plots irrigated with gw the data pooled over years revealed that irrigation with gw manifested 37 5 and 37 2 reduction in plant height 29 2 and 30 5 decrease in number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively as compared to irrigation with cw however this reduction was the lowest during first year of study 28 7 29 6 in plant height and 16 8 19 6 in number of leaves and showed a steady progression with time 30 7 32 7 in plant height and 26 0 34 3 in number of leaves in second year and 38 8 40 0 in plant height and 31 4 39 2 in number of leaves in third year of experimentation the reduction was the maximum during the fourth year of the study 49 4 50 5 in plant height and 32 3 35 1 in number of leaves this may be attributed to the steady increase in soil ec 1 soil 2 water ratio of the brackish water irrigated plots i e from 0 51 to 0 53 ds m 1 during first year to 0 84 0 90 ds m 1 during fourth year fig 1 in a clay loam soil of israel heuer and nadler 1995 have reported 17 reduction in plant height of potato when drip irrigated with saline water having ec of 6 0 ds m 1 over control drip irrigation with non saline water having ec of 1 5 ds m 1 while conducting a study on potato in a loamy sand soil of indian punjab jha et al 2017 have also observed a significant decrease in plant height at 30 das 60 das and dehaulming with increases in ec of irrigation water applied through drip irrigation this was likely due to the presence of salts in the soil solution decreasing the osmotic potential of soil solution making it difficult for the roots to absorb water and nutrients necessary for plant growth and development patel et al 2001 have also emphasized that initial soil salinity is important for successful potato cultivation because potatoes are relatively sensitive to salinity drip irrigation with mw resulting in an ec of about 2 0 ds m 1 was less growth suppressing in potato than was gw during all the four years of study table 4 and for pooled data table 3 however as discussed earlier this benefit was lower during the initial years of study but kept on increasing each year due to progressive increase in soil salinity ec of plots irrigated with gw fig 1 the data pooled over years revealed that drip irrigation with blended water resulted in 21 9 and 23 6 higher plant height 16 6 and 15 6 higher number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively than obtained with gw irrigation drip irrigation with dsw produced significantly p 0 05 higher plant height and number of leaves over those with gw and mw during all the four years of experimentation table 4 the data pooled over years table 3 revealed that irrigation with dsw caused 37 7 and 39 1 increment in plant height 30 8 and 32 9 in number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively over irrigation with gw the magnitude of increase was lower when dsw was compared with blended water i e 12 9 and 12 5 in plant height 12 2 and 14 9 in number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively therefore it is evident that the utilization of desalinated water offers another option for irrigation in areas scarce in good quality water resources however the growth parameter values of potatoes irrigated with dsw were significantly lower than those with cw irrigation the decrease was 13 9 and 12 6 in plant height 7 5 and 7 7 in number of leaves at 60 and 90 das respectively this may be attributed to comparatively lower concentration of calcium magnesium and potassium ions in dsw as compared with canal water table 2 3 2 effect of irrigation water quality on grade wise and total tuber yield among the four growing seasons the maximum total tuber yields were obtained in third year of study 2016 17 fig 2 this was considered to be due to less frost injury and a greater number of frost free nights during 2016 17 due to high night temperature table 1 in the indian punjab region there is problem of ground frost in december and january and potatoes are sensitive to frost the number of nights with probability of ground frost occurrence during crop growth period was 11 4 2 and 12 during 2014 15 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively irrespective of other factors the effects of iwq on total tuber yield were significant p 0 05 in all four years of study fig 2 the maximum total tuber yield was recorded with cw irrigation and was followed by dsw and mw whereas the lowest yield was observed with gw irrigation in all the years the data pooled over years table 5 exhibited that irrigation with gw registered 32 9 reduction in total tuber yield over that with cw however as observed in case of growth parameters this reduction was the lowest during first year 21 0 moderate during second year 29 0 and third year 37 6 and was the maximum during fourth year 43 5 due to progressive increase in soil ec of gw irrigated plots this decrease in yield may be due to reduction in plant height and number of leaves of potato leading to comparatively less light interception photosynthesis and translocation of photosynthates from source to sink the reduction in potato tuber yield with the use of saline water is considered to be linked to salinity in the root zone which reduces the water and nutrient uptake by the plant mokh et al 2014 several researchers have reported the adverse effects on potato tuber yield when saline water was used with surface or drip irrigation levy 1992 van hoorn et al 1993 patel et al 2001 have reported that the average total yield of potato across all cultivars was 20 higher in a non saline soil compared with a saline soil in a study conducted on potato in a loamy sand alluvial soil of north western india jha et al 2017 have also reported maximum tuber yield with good quality irrigation water and observed 17 reduction in tuber yield when the crop was drip irrigated with water having ec of 4 0 ds m 1 over control drip irrigation with water having ec of 0 65 ds m 1 drip irrigation with mw cw gw brought a significant p 0 05 increase in total tuber yield over that with gw during all these four years fig 2 however as observed in case of growth parameters this increment progressed from 8 6 during first year to 36 6 during fourth year due to progressive increase in soil salinity of plots irrigated with gw fig 1 this increment was 23 6 when the data were pooled over years table 5 it occurred because drip irrigation with mw resulted in comparatively lower soil salinity ec1 2 at both depths 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm compared with gw fig 1 as potato has been described as moderately sensitive to salinity shannon and grieve 2000 however it is pertinent to mention here that drip irrigation with blended water could not yield up to the levels achieved with fresh water and recorded 14 2 16 5 14 9 and 22 9 reduction in total tuber yield during first second third and fourth year respectively fig 2 and the decrease was 17 0 when the data were pooled over years table 5 drip irrigation with dsw exhibited significantly p 0 05 higher total tuber yield over that with gw and mw irrigation during all the four years of experimentation fig 2 the increment over gw was 19 3 23 2 55 5 and 75 whereas that over mw was 9 8 4 8 13 9 and 28 1 during first second third and fourth years respectively the data pooled over years table 5 revealed that irrigation with dsw resulted in a 40 6 and 13 8 increase in total tuber yield over irrigation with gw and mw respectively it may be attributed to the fact that the process of desalination removes undesirable salts from the ground water and its use for irrigation does not raise the ec of the soil to the levels achieved with the use of gw or mw however desalinated water could not match yield levels attained with fresh water irrigation it yielded significantly lower 5 8 and 12 5 during first and second year but statistically equal to those treated with cw irrigation during third and fourth year of study the data pooled over years table 5 exhibited that the total tuber yield of potato irrigated with dsw was significantly p 0 05 lower 5 6 than that with cw irrigation kim et al 2020 have reported that the application of desalinated irrigation water did not negatively affect growth and yield of lettuce under greenhouse conditions of korea and therefore desalinated water could reduce the pressure on scarce fresh water resources however the response of crops to desalinated irrigation water may change due to environmental factors such as soil composition use of fertilizers and the quality of desalinated water therefore it may be inferred that in areas where good quality waters are scarce out of two options mixed water and desalinated water available for potato cultivation in sandy loam soils the yield levels achieved by drip irrigation with mixed water were slightly lower but comparable to that with desalinated water when the ec1 2 of soil was below 0 650 ds m 1 however beyond this ec level drip irrigation with dsw gave comparatively better results than that with blended water 3 3 effect of irrigation water quality on grade wise tuber yield drip irrigation with gw and mw caused significant reductions in yield of all the three grades of potato as compared with those irrigated with cw in all the four years of study however the maximum impact was observed in grade a tuber yield whereas the grade c yield was the least affected on the basis of data pooled over years the use of gw and mw recorded 54 2 and 29 0 reduction in grade a 27 6 and 26 2 in grade b and 12 9 and 2 5 reduction in grade c tuber yield respectively as compared with cw irrigation table 5 apparently these reductions were of greater magnitude with gw than with mw during all the four years of study and for pooled data besides the reduction in grade a tuber yield was accompanied by simultaneous increments in grade b and grade c tuber yields however the per cent increment was considerably higher in grade c than in grade b tuber yield this became evident from the perusal of individual year data which showed that with an increase in ec1 2 of soil each year in gw irrigated plots the contribution of grade a tuber yield to total tuber yield continued to decrease 20 8 20 4 13 4 and 13 1 while that of grade c tuber yield showed an increasing trend 7 6 13 6 14 9 and 18 0 these proportions remained almost the same in cw and dsw irrigated plots across four years of study fig 2 an increase in yield of small size tubers at the cost of large size tubers with the use of gw or mw may be a monetary loss to farmers growing potato as a ware crop but it may be an advantage to growers cultivating potato as a seed crop in which a greater number of small sized tubers are desirable for example in the indian punjab region 60 of the potatoes produced are used as seed tubers which are supplied to adjoining states also patel et al 2001 have also reported significantly p 0 05 lower grade a tuber weight and higher grade b tuber weight of potato cultivar norland in saline soil as compared with non saline soil similarly jha et al 2017 have observed a significant decrease in grade a 75 g and an increase in grade d 25 g tuber yield of drip irrigated potatoes with increased salinity of the irrigation water up to 8 ds m 1 while the grade b 50 75 g and grade c 25 50 g tuber yield showed non significant changes 3 4 effect of fertigation levels on growth parameters and total tuber yield irrespective of other factors fertigation exerted a significant p 0 05 effect on plant growth parameters plant height and number of leaves at both 60 and 90 das table s1 grade wise and total tuber yield fig 3 of potato in all the four years of study and for pooled data tables 3 and 5 the maximum plant height number of leaves and total tuber yield was recorded with 100 npk and there was significant p 0 05 reduction in values of these parameters with decrease in fertilizer level to 80 and 60 npk however although significant p 0 05 the per cent reduction in these parameters was lower in reducing fertigation from 100 to 80 npk as compared to that when fertigation was lowered from 80 to 60 npk in all the four years of study the data pooled over years revealed that fertigation with 80 npk resulted in a 4 7 6 0 decrease in plant height 3 9 4 5 in number of leaves table 3 and 4 6 in total tuber yield when compared with those treated at the 100 npk level table 5 on the other hand the corresponding per cent reductions at 60 over 80 npk were 7 1 8 3 4 8 6 1 and 6 5 respectively our results are in contrast to those of sharda et al 2012 who have reported the maximum yield of drip fertigated potatoes with 80 of recommended npk 150 21 8 and 41 5 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively in a sandy loam alluvial soil of ludhiana india similarly while conducting a research trial on potato in a semi arid mediterranean climate of italy ierna et al 2011 have observed that with the reduction in the level of fertilization from f3 300 43 6 and 373 4 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively to f2 100 21 8 and 124 5 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively in the plots irrigated with 100 i3 and 50 etm maximum evapotranspiration i2 led to a negligible reduction in tuber yield of potato while a further reduction in the fertilization to f1 50 10 9 and 62 2 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively led to a reduction by 17 in i3 and 23 in i2 darwish et al 2006 have compared four nitrogen fertigation levels 125 250 375 and 500 kg ha 1 on potato in a dry mediterranean climate of lebanon in a non calcareous clay soil having low organic matter content and observed that the impact of increased nitrogen levels was visible on aboveground plant growth but the fresh tuber yield was not significantly improved and the application of 125 kg n ha 1 by fertigation was considered sufficient for processing potato the probable reason for the best results obtained with 100 npk may be that the fertilizer dose 190 28 4 and 53 9 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively used in the present study had been recommended for medium fertile soils having 0 40 0 75 organic carbon of punjab however the present study was conducted in soils having low organic carbon 0 25 0 36 therefore 80 npk fertigation level could not fulfil the nutrient needs of potato cultivars due to poor fertility status of soil coupled with semi arid climate and hence the potato crop responded to inorganic fertilizers up to 100 npk fertigation dose 3 5 irrigation water quality fertigation level interaction effects on tuber yield the interaction effects in respect of grade a grade b and grade c tuber yield were non significant p 0 05 for three three and four years respectively but were significant for grade a and grade b tuber yield for data pooled over years data not presented however for total tuber yield the interaction effects were non significant p 0 05 for the first and third year and significant p 0 05 for the second and fourth year and the pooled data fig 4 a perusal of the data fig 4 revealed that trend of total tuber yield reduction with a decrease in fertigation dose was consistent for cw and dsw in all the years of study however it did not hold true for gw and mw when mw was used through drip irrigation total tuber yield achieved with 80 npk was statistically p 0 05 at par with both 100 npk and 60 npk during second and fourth year of study this trend also followed when gw was used for irrigation during fourth year in respect to data pooled over the years although the differences among total tuber yield at all three fertigation levels were significantly p 0 05 different for all water qualities the differences were observed to be narrow for gw and mw and moderate for cw and dsw therefore it may be inferred that while raising potatoes with drip fertigation using fresh or desalinated water in a sandy loam soil 100 of recommended dose of npk should be used on the other hand when brackish or blended water is used through drip irrigation 80 of recommended npk is sufficient and increasing the dose of inorganic fertilizer beyond that may not yield beneficial results both financially and environmentally this could be due to the reason that benefits of high fertilization in potato are achieved at high irrigation level or low soil moisture tension ierna et al 2011 ierna and mauromicale 2018 but in plots irrigated with gw and mw soil moisture tension may be comparatively higher than that in cw or dsw irrigated plots due to higher ec of the soil while using saline water through surface drip irrigation in potato in a sandy soil of tunisia nagaz et al 2012 have recorded the maximum fresh tuber yield of potato 18 5 t ha 1 at 200 kg n ha 1 that did not significantly change at 300 kg n ha 1 while working on field crops in sandy soils of an arid region of rajasthan india kaledhonkar et al 2020 have concluded that in case of surface irrigation methods with saline water generally higher doses of fertilizers were required but with drip the yield levels at 100 npk were statistically at par with 125 npk due to a likely more efficient utilization of fertilizers in the drip irrigated crop a perusal of the data pooled over the years fig 4 revealed that total tuber yield achieved with dsw 100 npk and dsw 80 npk was statistically p 0 05 at par with cw 80 npk and cw 60 npk respectively this could be due to the reason that although the desalination process reduced undesirable salts in brackish water beneficial ions including essential nutrients like calcium magnesium and sulphate are also removed table 2 yermiyahu et al 2007 the resultant reduction in plant growth and yield with dsw should be compensated for by increasing the npk fertigation dose therefore in future research trials need to be conducted to explore the combined application of dsw 120 npk to achieve total tuber yield comparable with that achieved with cw 100 npk similarly total tuber yield obtained with dsw 60 npk was statistically p 0 05 at par with mw 100 npk mixed water even at lower fertigation dose 60 npk produced significantly p 0 05 higher total tuber yield than with gw at higher fertigation level 100 npk therefore it may be inferred that dsw and mw offer attractive opportunities for drip fertigation of potato where ground water is saline kumar 2017 has conducted a survey across india to analyze if conditions exist in india that might make small scale desalination for agriculture economically viable the bathinda district in south western punjab was one of the four regions identified in india which are suffering from fresh water scarcity for irrigation and human consumption the study concluded that the demand for expensive desalinated water for irrigation exists for crops that are extremely sensitive to salinity ph and for high value crops that yield very high net returns per unit volume of irrigation water used in south western punjab several reverse osmosis plants with large capacity have been installed in villages to generate drinking water similarly desalination plants could possibly be installed at the community level for irrigation purposes with a proper strategy for brine disposal and utilization on the other hand small scale desalination units will be preferred in areas in which the available ground water is not suitable in terms of chemical quality over those areas where available good quality ground water is insufficient one of the progressive farmers belonging to bathinda district of south western punjab has already installed a small scale desalination plant which produces 1000 l water per hour to raise high value flowers and vegetables under protected cultivation kumar 2017 3 6 differences in performance of varieties in terms of tuber yield irrespective of other factors there were significant p 0 05 differences in performance of varieties with respect to grade wise and total tuber yield table s2 of potato in all the four years of study with the exception of grade a and grade b tuber yield during 2014 15 the total tuber yield of kufri surya was 1 9 1 6 and 6 5 higher than that of kufri pukhraj 23 5 22 6 24 8 t ha 1 during 2014 15 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively whereas kufri jyoti outyielded kufri surya 19 3 t ha 1 by 19 1 during 2017 18 analyses of the interaction effects irrigation water quality variety fig 5 revealed that the total yield of kufri surya and kufri pukhraj was statistically p 0 05 at par when saline gw was used during first three years of study however with respect to other water qualities the total tuber yield of kufri surya was significantly higher than that of kufri pukhraj although the differences were narrow on the other hand during fourth year of study kufri jyoti yielded significantly p 0 05 higher 13 1 21 6 than that of kufri surya for all four types of irrigation water qualities used however the minimum increase 13 1 was recorded when gw was used for irrigation therefore it may be inferred that the variety kufri surya that had shown slight yield advantage over kufri pukhraj when cw dsw and mw was used lost the advantage over kufri pukhraj when gw was used for irrigation besides the variety kufri jyoti maintained its yield superiority over kufri surya irrespective of the water quality used for irrigation the other interaction effects fertigation levels variety and irrigation water quality fertigation levels variety were observed to be non significant for plant growth and yield attributes during all the four years of study and for the pooled data tables 3 and 5 3 7 effect of irrigation water quality and fertigation levels on soil properties irrespective of fertigation levels the irrigation water quality exerted non significant p 0 05 effect on organic carbon content of soil at both depths 0 15 and 15 30 cm during all 4 years of study table s3 however the effect on soil ph and ec was significant p 0 05 during all the years and for the pooled data table 6 figs 1 and 6 the ph values of gw and mw irrigated plots were significantly p 0 05 higher than cw and dsw irrigated plots at both depths during all the years however the ph of cw and dsw irrigated plots at both the depths was statistically p 0 05 at par during individual years as well as for the pooled data similarly the soil ph of mw irrigated plots was numerically lower but statistically p 0 05 at par with those of gw irrigated plots at both depths during all four years of study fig 6 however for the pooled data the soil ph of mw irrigated plots was significantly p 0 05 lower than those of gw irrigated plots at both table 6 the minimum and maximum values of soil ec1 2 were found in dsw and gw irrigated plots respectively at both depths during all years of study fig 1 and for the pooled data table 6 the mw irrigated plots recorded the ec1 2 values which were significantly p 0 05 lower than gw irrigated plots but significantly p 0 05 higher than dsw and cw irrigated plots for all the irrigation water qualities the soil ec1 2 values were the lowest in first year and showed a progressive increasing trend from the first to fourth year of the study however the increase was very sharp for gw moderate for mw and of low magnitude for cw and dsw at both soil depths fig 1 the year wise small increase in ec1 2 of soil irrigated with cw and dsw may be due to the reason that the soil of respective plots was not disturbed or cultivated during all these years while working on onion in a semi arid region of brazil pessoa et al 2019 have also reported significant increases in soil ec when irrigated with waters having different level of salts however the values of soil ec were higher in silty clay loam soil than in sandy loam soil due to higher retention of salts in fine textured soils from lower infiltration rates irrespective of irrigation water quality the fertigation levels exerted non significant p 0 05 effect on soil oc at both depths in four years of study table s4 however the effect on soil ph was non significant p 0 05 at both depths during first two years but significant p 0 05 differences were observed during third and fourth years of study table s4 and also for the pooled data table 6 the maximum ph was recorded in plots fertigated with 60 npk and it showed significant and progressive decreases with increases in fertigation doses to 80 and 100 npk the effect of fertigation levels on soil ec1 2 was non significant p 0 05 at both depths during first two years and at one depth during third and fourth years of study table s4 however the differences were significant p 0 05 for the pooled data for both soil depths table 6 the minimum values were recorded in plots fertigated with 60 npk and there was a significant p 0 05 increase in soil ec with increase in fertigation dose to 80 and 100 npk high salt concentration in soil reduces soil ph due to salt suspension effect and release of more protons in soil solution gavriloaiei 2012 low soil ph at high fertigation level may be ascribed to high soil salinity as compared with low soil salinity realized at low fertigation level choudhary et al 2011 4 conclusions drip irrigation with cw recorded the maximum plant height number of leaves and total tuber yield and was followed by dsw mw and gw irrigation in all 4 years of study irrigation with saline gw and mw lead to considerable reductions in these parameters as compared to cw irrigation however the latter was less growth and yield suppressing than the former besides the per cent reductions were the lowest during first year and showed an increasing trend due to increase in soil ec with each passing year drip irrigation with dsw yielded 19 75 and 10 28 higher over that with gw and mw respectively during 1st to 4th years of study however mw irrigation yielded comparable to that with dsw below soil ec1 2 of 0 650 ds m 1 and beyond this ec level irrigation with dsw proved superior to mw therefore in semi arid regions characterized by saline ground water and scarce fresh water potatoes may be drip irrigated with either mw or dsw depending upon soil ec drip irrigation with saline water resulted in significant decrease in grade a tuber yield with a concomitant increase in grade c tuber yield therefore saline water of ec up to 2 0 ds m 1 may be opted for irrigating seed crop of potatoes in which a greater number of small sized tubers are desirable irrespective of fertigation level total tuber yield of potatoes irrigated with dsw was 6 lower than that with cw however total yield achieved with dsw 100 npk and dsw 80 npk was statistically at par with cw 80 npk and cw 60 npk respectively therefore further research may be aimed to explore the possibility of using 120 npk with dsw to achieve yield levels comparable with cw 100 npk however if it achieves the desired result the 20 higher nutrient requirement could possibly be met not only with mineral fertilizers but with the integrated use of organic manures vermicompost farm yard manure green manure etc and mineral fertilizers keeping in view the sustainable agriculture goals the maximum values of plant height number of leaves and total tuber yield were recorded with 100 npk and there was a significant reduction in these parameters with decrease in fertigation dose to 80 and 60 npk for all water qualities however the differences were small in plants irrigated with gw mw and moderate for those irrigated with cw dsw therefore it is concluded that in drip fertigated potatoes using fresh water in a sandy loam soil of semi arid region 100 npk should be used whereas when saline or blended water is used 80 npk should be used without any loss in tuber yield so as to reduce cost of cultivation and environmental pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
