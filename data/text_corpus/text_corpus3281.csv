16405,this study examined the removal and enantio specific fate of a suite of eleven chiral 2 arylpropionic acids 2 apas during biological wastewater treatment simulated in a laboratory scale membrane bioreactor mbr using pure r and s enantiomers in the mbr influent chiral inversion was determined through the increase in the concentration of the non dominant enantiomer and changes in the enantiomeric fraction ef between the two enantiomers during the treatment process effective 90 and similar removal rates between r and s enantiomers were confirmed for eight 2 apas in this study 2 apas exhibited diverse and distinctive chiral inversion behaviours two 2 apas showed r s unidirectional inversion three 2 apas showed s r unidirectional inversion and six 2 apas showed bidirectional inversion this is the first study to report chiral inversion behaviours of a comprehensive suite of 2 apas with a variety of functional groups substituted onto the aryl ring a decrease in effluent ef over time was observed for two 2 apas this study shows that chiral inversion of 2 apas varies significantly from compound to compound despite the high similarity in their chemical structures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs chiral compounds chiral inversion enantiomeric fraction membrane bioreactor 1 introduction approximately 50 of marketed pharmaceuticals are chiral chemicals hashim et al 2010 mcconathy and owens 2003 there is a growing body of evidence to suggest distinctive ecological implications beween some enantiomeric pairs petrie and camacho muñoz 2021 for example enantiomers of some widely prescribed pharmaceuticals can have significantly different toxic impacts to model aquatic organisms used in ecotoxicity studies arenas et al 2021 stanley et al 2007 stanley et al 2006 however the vast majority of reported occurrences of pharmaceuticals in the environment do not differentiate between enantiomeric pairs and the role of chirality in their behaviour is generally not studied langa et al 2021 pérez and barceló 2008 2 arylpropionic acids 2 apas are a group of chemicals which include some important non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids e g ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen and flurbiprofen these commonly used drugs possess anti inflammatory and analgesic activities due to their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes that promote inflammation vane 2003 their therapeutic effects have been reported to reside almost exclusively in their s enantiomers eutomers rather than their r enantiomers distomers caldwell et al 1988 for example s ibuprofen has been reported to be 160 times more active than r ibuprofen adams et al 1976 due to the least cost synthetic route of production ibuprofen and ketoprofen are most commonly produced and consumed as racemic mixtures of their two enantiomers hashim et al 2010 however enantiomerically pure s ibuprofen known as dexibuprofen and s ketoprofen known as dexketoprofen are also available hashim et al 2010 naproxen is only ever manufactured and dispensed as s naproxen due to concerns regarding toxicity of r naproxen neale et al 2019 reported that r naproxen is also more toxic to bacteria than s naproxen while s flurbiprofen has higher bacterial toxicity and lower algal toxicity than r flurbiprofen previous investigations of the changes in enantiomeric fraction ef of emerging contaminants during wastewater treatment have generally assumed that such changes have been solely the consequence of more rapid degradation of one enantiomer relative to the other termed enantioselective degradation buser et al 1999 fono and sedlak 2005 gasser et al 2012 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 this assumption may be correct for some chemicals but an alternative explanation for at least some of the changes in ef may be chiral inversion of one enantiomer to the other such processes are well known for some pharmaceuticals during mammalian metabolism caldwell et al 1988 wechter 1994 distinguishing between enantioselective degradation and chiral inversion in addition to biodegradation is difficult when racemic mixtures of enantiomeric pairs are examined in biological systems since either process could lead to reduced concentrations of both enantiomers dogan et al 2020 petrie and camacho muñoz 2021 however controlled experiments with an enantiomerically pure 2 apa pharmaceutical naproxen have revealed that enantiomeric inversion can be observed during simulated biological wastewater treatment processes hashim et al 2011 subsequently enantio specific analyses of effluents from municipal wwtps and untreated sewage have provided similar insights for example in one study r naproxen was below the method limit of detection lod 1 ng l 1 in untreated sewage but measurable at higher concentrations in wwtp effluents suggesting that it was produced during wastewater treatment khan et al 2014 similarly a study comparing enantiomeric compositions of naproxen found exclusively s naproxen in surface waters from pakistan where no sewage treatment processes operate but traces of r naproxen in the effluents of a wwtp in germany selke et al 2010 that study also reported an identical trend for the naproxen metabolite o desmethyl naproxen despite these observations indicating the occurrence of chiral inversion of naproxen during biological wastewater treatment processes it is unclear whether equivalent inversion occurs for other 2 apa chemicals the aim of this study was to determine whether chiral inversion could be observed for a broader range of 2 apas during simulated biological wastewater treatment furthermore the study was designed to reveal the direction of chiral inversion including the possibility that it may occur bidirectionally finally the range of 2 apas selected for inclusion in this study was intended to provide insights into the influence of various molecular structures on the observed chiral inversion or biodegradation of 2 apas 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and consumables enantiomerically pure 95 2 apa analytical standards were used in all experiments a total of 22 analytes comprising r and

ethylchloroformate r 1 phenylethylamine pea sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide were purchased from sigma aldrich castle hill nsw australia water used in analysis was obtained from a waters milli q water purification unit millford ct usa stock solutions of individual 2 apa enantiomers approximately 1 g l and derivatisation reagents were prepared in anhydrous acn and stored at 4 c in the dark from these individual solutions two working stocks of mixed 2 apas for calibration standards and experiments were prepared in anhydrous acn and stored at 4 c in the dark one stock solution contained pure r enantiomers the other stock solution contained pure s enantiomers as directly analogous internal standards istds were not available for some target analytes racemic a solution of racemic d3 naproxen was prepared in anhydrous acn at a concentration of 1 mg l for use as the istd 2 2 laboratory scale membrane bioreactor system two identical aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr systems were operated in parallel each system consisted of a 4 l glass reactor and a submerged hollow fibre polyvinylidene difluoride membrane module mitsubishi rayon japan supplementary information figure s1 the membrane module had a nominal pore size and effective surface area of 0 04 μm and 0 073 m2 respectively a high resolution pressure sensor 0 1 kpa john morris group australia was fixed between the membrane module and the suction pump for continuous monitoring of transmembrane pressure tmp the two glass reactors were placed in a temperature controlled water bath to maintain a constant temperature using a temperature control unit thermoline australia equipped with a stainless steel heat exchanging coil peristaltic pumps masterflex l s usa were used for feeding and permeate extraction and the reactors working volume were maintained at 3 l compressed air was used to aerate the mbr system via diffusers located at the bottom of the reactor at a flow rate of 400 ml min using an air pump aquaone australia 2 3 mbr experimental protocol activated sludge from a full scale wastewater treatment plant at sydney olympic park nsw australia was used to inoculate the two mbrs synthetic wastewater was used to simulate medium strength municipal sewage cod tn tp 150 6 5 1 the concentrated synthetic wastewater was prepared weekly and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c it was then diluted with tap water on a daily basis to make up a feed solution influent containing per litre glucose 600 mg peptone 100 mg urea 35 mg kh2po4 17 5 mg mgso4 17 5 mg feso4 10 mg and sodium acetate 225 mg the membrane module was operated with 9 min suction and 1 min relaxation at an average flux of 3 4 lmh chiral 2 apas were continuously introduced to the mbr influent at a concentration in the range of 1 10 μg l of each compound one mbr was dosed with only r enantiomers denoted as mbr r and the other mbr was dosed with only s enantiomers denoted as mbr s samples were collected twice a week

solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater toc was analysed using a toc vcsh analyser shimadzu japan ph and do of the mixed liquor were monitored using a portable ph do metre hach australia the temperature and do concentration of both mbrs were maintained at 20 0 0 1 c and above 3 mg l respectively the hydraulic retention time was kept at 12 h sludge withdrawal was not conducted except for sample collection for analysis purposes resulting in a sludge retention time of 133 days prior to the addition of 2 apas to the influent the two mbr systems were operated for approximately two months for acclimatisation to achieve stable and identical performance 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 chiral compounds extraction and diastereomer preparation duplicate samples of the influent and effluent 500 ml each were collected on days 1 4 7 10 14 and 18 after dosing with enantiomerically pure solutions of chiral 2 apas duplicate mixed liquor samples 400 ml were also collected at the end of the experiment for analysis of chiral 2 apas in the mixed liquor and sludge phase chiral 2 apas were extracted from aqueous samples and converted into their respective r r and r s phenylethylamide diastereomers following a previously described derivatisation method hashim and khan 2011 with slight modifications in elution solvent selection briefly samples 500 ml were acidified to approximately ph 3 4 using sulphuric acid 4 m and 50 µl of the istd was added solid phase extraction spe was performed using oasis 500 mg and 60 mg hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridges purchased from waters millford ct usa within 24 h of sample collection hlb spe cartridges were pre conditioned with 5 ml methanol and 5 ml milli q water all samples were then loaded onto the cartridges under vacuum pressure at a flow rate less than 15 ml min rinsed with 20 ml milli q water dried with air at room temperature for 20 min and stored at 4 c prior to elution and chiral analysis analytes were eluted off the cartridges using a 1 3 acn dcm mixture 2 3 ml and combined eluants concentrated to approximately 100 µl under nitrogen the residue was reconstituted in 300 µl acn treated with 30 µl of tea 50 mm 40 µl ethyl chloroformate 60 mm and sonicated for 2 min subsequently 40 µl of r pea 0 5 m was added and the mixture was sonicated for 2 min before the addition of 3 ml sulphuric acid 3 mm the derivatised analytes were extracted from the mixture in a second spe step using oasis hlb cartridges 1 ml 60 mg preconditioned with methanol 1 ml and water 1 ml adjusted to ph 9 5 using sodium hydroxide the loaded spe cartridges were dried under nitrogen and the analytes were eluted using dcm 1 ml directly into 2 ml autosampler vials prior to analysis 2 4 2 enantio specific analysis of chiral compounds enantio specific analysis of the 2 apa r r and r s pea diastereomers was conducted following a method previously described by hashim and khan 2011 with some modifications briefly target analytes were separated using an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m hp5 ms 30 m 250 µm 0 25 µm column under a helium flow of 1 2 ml min injection inlet interface and source temperatures were 270 260 and 280 c respectively an injection volume of 1 µl was used with the inlet in split less configuration the oven temperature gradient program was as follows initial 120 c held for 1 min increased to 240 c at 40 c min then to 300 c at 5 c min and held for 5 min having a run time of 18 min target analytes and isotope labelled istds were identified using an agilent 7000c triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electron impact ionization source at voltage of 70 ev and a source temperature of 280 c multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode was employed to monitor analytes ms1 scans of individual target analytes were performed to obtain suitable precursor ions followed by product ion scans to determine m z transitions and optimise collision energies ces two mrm transitions were monitored for each target analyte and isotope labelled istds all monitored transitions and optimized ce are presented in supplementary information table s1 the first mrm transition shown was used for quantification the second used for as a qualifier calibration curves showed good linearity with regression coefficients 0 99 for all analytes limits of quantification loq were defined as the concentration of an extracted analyte giving a signal to noise s n ratio greater than 10 a loq of 3 ng l was determined for all target analytes satisfactory method performance was confirmed by processing of blank and fortified milli q grade water samples along with experimental batches no target analyte or istd was detected above loqs in blank samples and extraction recoveries for all target analytes were within 20 of expected values in fortified samples a fortified extracted sample triplicate gave results with a relative standard deviation rsd of 5 for all target analytes verifying method precision target analyte concentrations were calculated using isotope dilution method with a 6 point calibration curve at 1 5 10 50 100 500 ng ml concentrations of chiral compounds in the solid phase sludge were determined according to a method previously described by wijekoon et al 2015 the solid pellets obtained from the mixed liquor after centrifugation were freeze dried for 14 h using an alpha 1 2 ldplus freeze dryer christ gmbh germany the dried sludge was ground and 0 7 g of sludge powder was transferred to a glass test tube for extraction the sludge powder was thoroughly mixed with methanol 7 5 ml using a vortex mixer vm1 ratek australia for 3 min and ultrasonicated for 10 min at 40 c the sample was centrifuged at 3270 g for 10 min alleegra x 12r beckman coulter usa and the supernatant was collected in a glass beaker for further analysis a dcm and methanol mixture 1 1 v v 7 5 ml were added to the remaining sludge and the process of mixing ultrasonic extraction and centrifugation was repeated the supernatants from both steps were combined and residual methanol and dcm were purged using nitrogen gas finally milli q water was added to obtain a 500 ml aqueous sample this sample was then analysed using the analytical method used for aqueous samples described above 2 5 calculation of removal efficiency and enantiomeric fraction the ef was calculated as follows 1 ef c m c m c o where cm is the concentration of the main enantiomer dosed into the reactor i e r 2 apas for mbr r and s 2 apas for mbr s co is the concentration of the other enantiomer the ef of all influent samples ranged from 0 97 1 00 confirming the purity of enantiomers used in this study the removal efficiency of an enantiomer was defined as 2 overall removal 100 c f c p c f where cf and cp are concentrations of the enantiomer in the mbr feed influent and permeate effluent respectively when an enantiomer was not detected the analytical technique loq of 3 ng l was assigned to concentration value for removal efficiency calculation chiral inversion results in a higher concentration of a specific enantiomer in the effluent than influent and thus negative removal of the enantiomer the overall removal of an enantiomer can be accounted for by chiral inversion and biotransformation biodegradation the percentage accounted by each process was calculated as follows 3 chiral inversion 100 c op c of c mf 4 biotransformation overall removal chiral inversion where cmf is the concentration of the main enantiomer in the feed influent cof and cop are the concentration of the other enantiomer in the feed and permeate respectively sorption rate of chiral 2 apas to sludge during mbr treatment was calculated by considering the ratio between the amount of 2 apa detected in sludge and the total amount dosed into the reactor 5 sorption rate 100 c sl v sl m sl c f v f t where csl and cf are the average concentrations of 2 apa in the sludge and the feed msl is the sludge concentration in the reactor g dried sludge l vsl is the volume of the reactor mixed liquor 3 l and vf is the daily volume of feed 6 l t was the number of days chiral 2 apas were dosed into the reactor before sludge sample was collected for analysis 37 days 2 6 assessment of abiotic changes in enantiomeric fraction prior to undertaking the experiments described in this manuscript control experiments were undertaken to assess the possibility of abiotic changes in ef under laboratory conditions these experiments involved incubation of chiral 2 apas ibuprofen ketoprofen and naproxen in laboratory grade water for up to 21 days followed by the same solid phase extraction and analytical determination applied in this study these experiments confirmed no observable change in ef under normal laboratory conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane bioreactor performance the two mbrs showed similar performance during the start up period fig 1 allowing for a systematic comparison between r and s enantiomeric inversion during mbr treatment the mlss concentration increased steadily from 5 5 0 1 to 9 7 0 2 n 2 and from 5 7 0 1 to 8 8 0 2 g l n 2 in the mbr r and the mbr s respectively both mbrs showed high mlvss mlss ratios in the range of 0 76 0 92 indicating a high number of active microorganisms high and stable toc removal efficiency 94 was achieved in both mbrs ph of the mixed liquor were stable at 6 55 0 16 n 42 and 6 57 0 17 n 40 in the mbr r and the mbr s respectively do concentration was maintained above 3 mg l to ensure an aerobic condition in both mbrs chiral compound addition and the type of enantiomer dosed did not affect the performance of the two mbrs fig 1 biomass content continued to increase to 11 5 0 2 and 10 8 0 5 g l n 2 in the mbr r and the mbr s respectively with high mlvss mlss ratio 0 85 toc removal efficiency also increased to 100 during continuous dosing of chiral compounds stable operation of both mbrs during the chiral compound addition period allowed for clear determination of chiral inversion occurrence there was a gradual increase in tmp in both mbrs over time from 0 8 1 to 5 2 7 6 kpa due to the increasing biomass concentrations supplementary information figure s2 membrane fouling was not observed during the experimental period due to the low operating flux in this study 3 4 lmh 3 2 chiral compound removal efficiency eleven r 2 apas 90 and ten s 2 apas 96 were effectively removed in this study fig 2 s naproxen was the only exception with the lowest removal efficiency of 74 5 14 4 fig 2 all compounds investigated here have the same 2 apa skeleton structure they differ from one another by the substituent groups on the aromatic ring table 1 these substituent groups can affect the ability of a compound to participate in biological reactions through steric hindrance and electrostatic shielding especially for hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic compounds log d 3 2 liu et al 2011 tadkaew et al 2011 steric hindrance at a given atom in a molecule is the congestion caused by the physical presence of the surrounding groups steric hindrance can affect the initial point of enzymatic attack liu et al 2011 or lead to different metabolism pathways for different enantiomers which was the case for 3 phenylbutyric acid degradation by rhodococcus rhodochrous pb1 simoni et al 1996 amongst the eleven 2 apas in terms of molecular structure naproxen possesses the bulkiest substituent group resulting in a higher steric hindrance and thus a lower removal efficiency naproxen also possesses a polynuclear structure two fused aromatic rings that may increase its persistence this is consistent with previous findings that naproxen can have lower removal efficiency than mononuclear 2 apas benzene based compounds such as ketoprofen and ibuprofen during wastewater treatment processes kim et al 2007 matamoros et al 2009 tambosi et al 2010 several mechanisms may contribute to the removal of chiral compounds in mbrs including biodegradation biotransformation including chiral inversion sorption to sludge and retention by membrane hydrophobic organic compounds log d 3 2 can be removed via sorption to the sludge phase tadkaew et al 2011 none of the chiral 2 apas used in this study are hydrophobic see their log d values in table 1 under the conditions applied in this study all apas are largely ionised and thus negatively charged pka ph 6 insignificant sorption to sludge 0 25 was confirmed by the negligible concentrations of r 2 apas in the mbr r sludge phase and s 2 apas in the mbr s sludge phase supplementary information table s2 and table s3 membrane retention was also insignificant in this study as confirmed by the similar 2 apa concentration in the mbr mixed liquor and the effluent supplementary information table s2 and table s3 all 2 apas investigated here are significantly smaller than the pore size 0 04 µm of the membrane thus their rejection by the membrane was not expected thus both sorption to sludge and membrane retention were insignificant and biodegradation and biotransformation are the two main removal mechanisms naproxen and ketoprofen removal in mbr treatment has been extensively investigated by contrast the removal of the remaining nine 2 apas appears to have not been previously studied in the literature r and s naproxen and ketoprofen removal efficiencies observed here were higher than those in previous studies supplementary information table s4 using racemic 2 apas instead of pure enantiomers alturki et al 2010 hashim et al 2011 tadkaew et al 2011 wang et al 2016 in agreement with this study nguyen et al 2017 reported that the removal of either pure ibuprofen enantiomers by an enzymatic mbr was 20 higher than of racemic ibuprofen previous works have confirmed enzymatic degradation as a major biodegradation pathway of naproxen ketoprofen and other 2 apas górny et al 2019 marco urrea et al 2010 further research to simultaneously examine degradation pathway and the fate of pure enantiomers may unravel the underlying reason for the higher removal of pure enantiomers compared to a racemic mixture observed in this study and the literature the two mbrs with feed solution containing r enantiomers and s enantiomers separately showed similar removal efficiencies of eight chiral 2 apas fig 2 of the remaining three chiral 2 apas i e naproxen ketoprofen and flurbiprofen one enantiomer was removed at higher rate compared to the other student t test p value 0 05 s enantiomers of ketoprofen and flurbiprofen were better removed than the corresponding r enantiomers while r naproxen was better removed than s naproxen in previous studies using racemic compounds enantioselective degradation preferential degradation of one enantiomer over the other was inferred only from the difference in ef between the influent and effluent evans et al 2017 matamoros et al 2009 petrie et al 2018 however the ef difference could be the result of enantioselective degradation chiral inversion or a combination of both the use of pure enantiomers instead of racemic mixtures in this study helps distinguish the two processes and allows for the comparison of each enantiomer s removal efficiency 3 3 chiral inversion of 2 apas in membrane bioreactors the disappearance of an enantiomer is due to the combination of chiral inversion to the opposite enantiomer and biotransformation thus the contributions of chiral inversion and biotransformation were calculated for each enantiomer in each sample from the result in table 2 the eleven chiral 2 apas could be divided into 3 groups in terms of chiral inversion behaviour 1 unidirectional chiral inversion r s two 2 apas 2 unidirectional chiral inversion s r three 2 apas and 3 bidirectional chiral inversion r s and s r five 2 apas details on the behaviour of each compound will be discussed further section 3 3 1 to 3 3 3 3 3 1 r s unidirectional chiral inversion unidirectional chiral inversion r s was observed for 2 4 chlorophenyl propionic acid and 2 phenylpropionic acid fig 3 as described in section 2 the mbr r was fed with r 2 apas thus s enantiomers of these compounds were below the loq in the influent however they were detected in the effluent yielding a negative removal efficiency fig 3a negative removal was not observed for the r enantiomers of these compounds in the mbr s fed with s enantiomers supplementary information table s5 these results confirm that their chiral inversion was unidirectional in the r s direction while the evidence of unidirectional chiral inversion in the r s direction was conclusive for these two 2 apas a very low concentration of the s enantiomer in the effluent was noted resulting in large error bars when reporting the negative removal values of these compounds fig 3 corresponding to the increase of s enantiomers concentrations the ef of these compounds significantly decreased from 1 00 in the influent to 0 47 0 12 0 58 0 11 n 11 in the effluent fig 3b student t test p 0 05 this study appears to provide the first evidence of significant chiral inversion of 2 4 chlorophenyl propionic acid and 2 phenylpropionic acid during biological wastewater treatment previous works have established that microorganisms can perform chiral inversion of 2 phenylpropionic acid though the direction is substrate and species specific hanlon et al 1994 hutt et al 1993 rhys williams et al 1998 for example hung et al 1996 found that r 2 phenylpropionic acid was inverted to the s enantiomer by the fungi cordycep militalis incubations of pure enantiomers with another fungus species verticillium lecanii in sorensen s phosphate buffer confirmed the occurrence of bidirectional inversion thomason et al 1997 kato et al 2003 reported that the bacteria nocardia diaphanozonaia invert 2 phenylpropionic acid in the s r direction which was the opposite direction to what was observed in this study 3 3 2 s r unidirectional chiral inversion unidirectional chiral inversion in the s r direction was observed for flurbiprofen 2 4 tert butylphenyl propionic acid and 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid fig 4 the concentration of their r enantiomers in the effluent of the mbr s receiving s 2 apas only were higher than that of the influent resulting in negative removal efficiencies by contrast negative removal was not observed for the s enantiomers of these compounds in the mbr r fed with r enantiomers supplementary information table s5 the ef of s flurbiprofen s 2 4 tert butylphenyl propionic acid and s 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid were significantly different between influent 1 00 and effluent 0 23 0 12 0 54 0 12 n 11 of the mbr s student t test p 0 05 it is noted that the effluent ef decreased over time for s flurbiprofen supplementary information table s7 fig 4 appears to be the first set of data on chiral inversion of these 2 apas during biological wastewater treatment the direction of flurbiprofen chiral inversion in previous studies examining single bacterial species was species specific kato et al 2003 thomason et al 1998 the fungus v lecanii carried out bidirectional inversion of flurbiprofen with r s enantiomer as the more significant direction the opposite of what was observed in this study thomason et al 1998 the fungus c militalis can invert flurbiprofen from r to s antipode while the bacteria n diaphanozonaria did not show any chiral inversion activity on this compound kato et al 2003 chiral inversion could lead to the increase in the concentration of the more biologically active or more toxic enantiomers for example r flurbiprofen was found to have a greater effect on photosystem ii inhibition in green algae than s flurbiprofen while only r flurbiprofen induced ethoxyresorufin o deethylase erod activity in fish cells neale et al 2019 r 2 4 tert butylphenyl propionic acid was around 1 6 times more potent than the s enantiomer in the erod assay ecir1 5 of 7 9 mg l for s compared to 4 9 mg l for r while only r 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid induced erod activity ecir1 5 of 4 5 mg l unpublished results the erod assay which is described in detail in neale et al 2019 was conducted with an exposure period of 6 h rather than 24 h the shorter exposure period was selected since a previous study found this was the optimal exposure period for pharmaceuticals including 2 apas ibuprofen and ketoprofen thibaut and porte 2008 linear concentration effect curves for erod activity for the two enantiomers of 2 4 tert butylphenyl propionic acid and the two enantiomers of 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid are provided in the supplementary information figure s4 and figure s5 3 3 3 bidirectional chiral inversion six 2 apas including naproxen ketoprofen 2 3 methylphenyl propionic acid 2 3 chlorophenyl propionic acid 2 4 fluorophenyl propionic acid and 2 4 butylphenyl propionic acid exhibited bidirectional chiral inversion this may be observed in fig 5 and fig 6 which show negative removal of both s and r enantiomers respectively of these 2 apas the concentration of the s enantiomer of naproxen ketoprofen 2 3 methylphenyl propionic acid 2 3 chlorophenyl propionic acid 2 4 fluorophenyl propionic acid in the effluent of the mbr r was higher than that of the influent resulting in negative removal efficiencies fig 5a correspondingly their ef dropped significantly from 0 98 1 00 in the influent to the range between 0 25 0 08 and 0 64 0 07 in the effluent n 11 fig 5b in the mbr s the concentration of r enantiomer in the effluent was also higher than the effluent resulting in negative removal efficiencies fig 6a the chiral inversion extent for these compounds appears to be greater in the r s direction than s r it is noted that for 2 4 butylphenyl propionic acid there was no evidence from influent and effluent data to support the occurrence of chiral inversion nevertheless s 2 4 butylphenyl propionic acid was not detected in the influent of mbr r but was detected at 1 7 1 7 ng g in the sludge phase and 9 0 0 0 ng l in the mixed liquor supernatant supplementary information similarly r 2 4 butylphenyl propionic acid was not detected in the influent of mbr s but was detected at 3 7 2 6 ng g in the sludge phase suggesting that bidirectional inversion also occurred for this 2 apa supplementary information table s3 bidirectional inversion of naproxen and ketoprofen in biological systems have been previously reported bertin et al 2020 nguyen et al 2017 thomason et al 1998 bidirectional inversion of naproxen was observed in an enzymatic mbr dosed with laccase from the fungus pleurotus ostreatus and in complex microbial communities such as soil microcosms bertin et al 2020 nguyen et al 2017 nguyen et al 2017 also observed that r s was the dominant inversion direction with 14 4 of r naproxen in the influent undergoing inversion to s naproxen and only 4 of s naproxen in the influent undergoing inversion to r naproxen nevertheless since naproxen chiral inversion is bidirectional it is difficult to confirm whether this results from the enantioselectivity of chiral inversion enzymes different rates of inversion for different enantiomers or other interactions between two enantiomers this is the first time the r s chiral inversion of naproxen has been demonstrated in a wastewater treatment process since r naproxen is metabolised into s naproxen in the human body this is the dominant enantiomer detected in raw wastewater and s r inversion has been frequently observed camacho muñoz et al 2019 sanganyado et al 2017 however it is known that naproxen exhibits different chiral inversion behaviour in different environments for example experiments with the fungus v lecanii resulted in r s chiral inversion thomason et al 1998 while observations from a microcosm experiment with activated sludge from wastewater treatment plant were of s r inversion suzuki et al 2014 ketoprofen has been found to undergo bidirectional inversion by different fungi and fungal enzymes nguyen et al 2017 thomason et al 1998 wsol et al 2004 however it was reported that the s r inversion was more significant than the r s inversion thomason et al 1998 which is different from this study similar to s flurbiprofen the effluent ef of naproxen both enantiomers decreased over time supplementary information table s6 s7 the decrease in effluent ef could be due to varying rates of metabolism and chiral inversion as a consequence of microbial adaptation analysis of the mbr microbial community associated with chiral inversion may bring more insights into this phenomenon the results in this study highlight the significance of using pure enantiomers over racemic mixture in confirming the occurrence of chiral inversion when racemic solutions of 2 3 chlorophenyl propionic acid and 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid were dosed into culture media of n diaphanozonaia no inversion activity was observed kato et al 2003 ketoprofen frequently showed minor ef change from influent to effluent increased from 0 54 0 58 to 0 61 0 68 during wastewater treatment and microcosm studies but this observation was attributed to enantioselective degradation of the two enantiomers rather than chiral inversion caballo et al 2015 camacho muñoz et al 2019 khan 2014 the 2 apas investigated here only differ from one another by a substituent group of the benzyl ring but exhibited significantly different chiral inversion behaviours table 1 the underlying reason could be the impact of substituent groups on the chiral inversion process or different microbial species with different chiral inversion mechanisms are responsible for the inversion of different compounds steric hindrance caused by substituent groups can affect the initial point of enzymatic attack and the metabolism pathway for different enantiomers liu et al 2011 simoni et al 1996 liu et al 2011 observed that the bacteria xanthobacter flavus pa1 initially attacked 2 phenylbutyric acid at the β c atom of the carboxyl alkyl side chain through hydroxylation not at the aromatic ring and suggested that the reason to be steric hindrance of the chiral carboxyl alkyl moiety attached on the benzene ring simoni et al 1996 examined the metabolism of chiral 3 phenylbutyric acid by r rhodochrous pb1 and showed that the r enantiomer was initially demethylated at the chiral centre of the carboxyl alkyl side chain to decrease the steric hindrance and further metabolized via meta ring cleavage whereas the s enantiomer is only cometabolically oxidized to s 3 2 3 dihydroxyphenyl butyric acid without ring cleavage thus it is possible that steric hindrance of the substituent group can impact chiral inversion behaviour of 2 apas kato et al 2003 demonstrated that chiral inversion enzymes of n diaphanozonaria accept 2 phenylpropionic acid and 2 fluorophenylacetic acid but did not show any activity on compounds with higher steric bulkiness e g 2 phenylbutanoic acid 2 methoxyphenylacetic acid and 3 hydroxy 2 phenylpropanoic acid consequently a mechanistic understanding of chiral biotransformation of 2 apas remains lacking and a future research need 4 conclusion this study examined the chiral inversion behaviour of a suite of pharmaceutically active 2 arylpropionic acids 2 apas using pure r and s enantiomers during biological wastewater treatment high and similar removal efficiencies of r and s forms were observed 90 for eight 2 apa enantiomers the eleven 2 apas investigated here differ from one another by just one substituent group attached to the 2 apa backbone but show diverse and distinctive chiral inversion behaviours two 2 apas showed chiral inversion in the r s direction three 2 apas showed chiral inversion in the s r direction and six 2 apas showed bidirectional chiral inversion compounds exhibiting bidirectional inversion also shows greater inversion from r s than from s r time dependant changes in effluent ef was observed for two 2 apas

16405,this study examined the removal and enantio specific fate of a suite of eleven chiral 2 arylpropionic acids 2 apas during biological wastewater treatment simulated in a laboratory scale membrane bioreactor mbr using pure r and s enantiomers in the mbr influent chiral inversion was determined through the increase in the concentration of the non dominant enantiomer and changes in the enantiomeric fraction ef between the two enantiomers during the treatment process effective 90 and similar removal rates between r and s enantiomers were confirmed for eight 2 apas in this study 2 apas exhibited diverse and distinctive chiral inversion behaviours two 2 apas showed r s unidirectional inversion three 2 apas showed s r unidirectional inversion and six 2 apas showed bidirectional inversion this is the first study to report chiral inversion behaviours of a comprehensive suite of 2 apas with a variety of functional groups substituted onto the aryl ring a decrease in effluent ef over time was observed for two 2 apas this study shows that chiral inversion of 2 apas varies significantly from compound to compound despite the high similarity in their chemical structures graphical

pharmaceuticals are chiral chemicals hashim et al 2010 mcconathy and owens 2003 there is a growing body of evidence to suggest distinctive ecological implications beween some enantiomeric pairs petrie and camacho muñoz 2021 for example enantiomers of some widely prescribed pharmaceuticals can have significantly different toxic impacts to model aquatic organisms used in ecotoxicity studies arenas et al 2021 stanley et al 2007 stanley et al 2006 however the vast majority of reported occurrences of pharmaceuticals in the environment do not differentiate between enantiomeric pairs and the role of chirality in their behaviour is generally not studied langa et al 2021 pérez and barceló 2008 2 arylpropionic acids 2 apas are a group of chemicals which include some important non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids e g ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen and flurbiprofen these commonly used drugs possess anti inflammatory and analgesic activities due to their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes that promote inflammation vane 2003 their therapeutic effects have been reported to reside almost exclusively in their s enantiomers eutomers rather than their r enantiomers distomers caldwell et al 1988 for example s ibuprofen has been reported to be 160 times more active than r ibuprofen adams et al 1976 due to the least cost synthetic route of production ibuprofen and ketoprofen are most commonly produced and consumed as racemic mixtures of their two enantiomers hashim et al 2010 however enantiomerically pure s ibuprofen known as dexibuprofen and s ketoprofen known as dexketoprofen are also available hashim et al 2010 naproxen is only ever manufactured and dispensed as s naproxen due to concerns regarding toxicity of r naproxen neale et al 2019 reported that r naproxen is also more toxic to bacteria than s naproxen while s flurbiprofen has higher bacterial toxicity and lower algal toxicity than r flurbiprofen previous investigations of the changes in enantiomeric fraction ef of emerging contaminants during wastewater treatment have generally assumed that such changes have been solely the consequence of more rapid degradation of one enantiomer relative to the other termed enantioselective degradation buser et al 1999 fono and sedlak 2005 gasser et al 2012 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 this assumption may be correct for some chemicals but an alternative explanation for at least some of the changes in ef may be chiral inversion of one enantiomer to the other such processes are well known for some pharmaceuticals during mammalian metabolism caldwell et al 1988 wechter 1994 distinguishing between enantioselective degradation and chiral inversion in addition to biodegradation is difficult when racemic mixtures of enantiomeric pairs are examined in biological systems since either process could lead to reduced concentrations of both enantiomers dogan et al 2020 petrie and camacho muñoz 2021 however controlled experiments with an enantiomerically pure 2 apa pharmaceutical naproxen have revealed that enantiomeric inversion can be observed during simulated biological wastewater treatment processes hashim et al 2011 subsequently enantio specific analyses of effluents from municipal wwtps and untreated sewage have provided similar insights for example in one study r naproxen was below the method limit of detection lod 1 ng l 1 in untreated sewage but measurable at higher concentrations in wwtp effluents suggesting that it was produced during wastewater treatment khan et al 2014 similarly a study comparing enantiomeric compositions of naproxen found exclusively s naproxen in surface waters from pakistan where no sewage treatment processes operate but traces of r naproxen in the effluents of a wwtp in germany selke et al 2010 that study also reported an identical trend for the naproxen metabolite o desmethyl naproxen despite these observations indicating the occurrence of chiral inversion of naproxen during biological wastewater treatment processes it is unclear whether equivalent inversion occurs for other 2 apa chemicals the aim of this study was to determine whether chiral inversion could be observed for a broader range of 2 apas during simulated biological wastewater treatment furthermore the study was designed to reveal the direction of chiral inversion including the possibility that it may occur bidirectionally finally the range of 2 apas selected for inclusion in this study was intended to provide insights into the influence of various molecular structures on the observed chiral inversion or biodegradation of 2 apas 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and consumables enantiomerically pure 95 2 apa analytical standards were used in all experiments a total of 22 analytes comprising r and

ethylchloroformate r 1 phenylethylamine pea sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide were purchased from sigma aldrich castle hill nsw australia water used in analysis was obtained from a waters milli q water purification unit millford ct usa stock solutions of individual 2 apa enantiomers approximately 1 g l and derivatisation reagents were prepared in anhydrous acn and stored at 4 c in the dark from these individual solutions two working stocks of mixed 2 apas for calibration standards and experiments were prepared in anhydrous acn and stored at 4 c in the dark one stock solution contained pure r enantiomers the other stock solution contained pure s enantiomers as directly analogous internal standards istds were not available for some target analytes racemic a solution of racemic d3 naproxen was prepared in anhydrous acn at a concentration of 1 mg l for use as the istd 2 2 laboratory scale membrane bioreactor system two identical aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr systems were operated in parallel each system consisted of a 4 l glass reactor and a submerged hollow fibre polyvinylidene difluoride membrane module mitsubishi rayon japan supplementary information figure s1 the membrane module had a nominal pore size and effective surface area of 0 04 μm and 0 073 m2 respectively a high resolution pressure sensor 0 1 kpa john morris group australia was fixed between the membrane module and the suction pump for continuous monitoring of transmembrane pressure tmp the two glass reactors were placed in a temperature controlled water bath to maintain a constant

extraction and the reactors working volume were maintained at 3 l compressed air was used to aerate the mbr system via diffusers located at the bottom of the reactor at a flow rate of 400 ml min using an air pump aquaone australia 2 3 mbr experimental protocol activated sludge from a full scale wastewater treatment plant at sydney olympic park nsw australia was used to inoculate the two mbrs synthetic wastewater was used to simulate medium strength municipal sewage cod tn tp 150 6 5 1 the concentrated synthetic wastewater was prepared weekly and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c it was then diluted with tap water on a daily basis to make up a feed solution influent containing per litre glucose 600 mg peptone 100 mg urea 35 mg kh2po4 17 5 mg mgso4 17 5 mg feso4 10 mg and sodium acetate 225 mg the membrane module was operated with 9 min suction and 1 min relaxation at an average flux of 3 4 lmh chiral 2 apas were continuously introduced to the mbr influent at a concentration in the range of 1 10 μg l of each compound one mbr was dosed with only r enantiomers denoted as mbr r and the other mbr was dosed with only s enantiomers denoted as mbr s samples were collected twice a week

analyser shimadzu japan ph and do of the mixed liquor were monitored using a portable ph do metre hach australia the temperature and do concentration of both mbrs were maintained at 20 0 0 1 c and above 3 mg l respectively the hydraulic retention time was kept at 12 h sludge withdrawal was not conducted except for sample collection for analysis purposes resulting in a sludge retention time of 133 days prior to the addition of 2 apas to the influent the two mbr systems were operated for approximately two months for acclimatisation to achieve stable and identical performance 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 chiral compounds extraction and diastereomer preparation duplicate samples of the influent and effluent 500 ml each were collected on days 1 4 7 10 14 and 18 after dosing with enantiomerically pure solutions of chiral 2 apas duplicate mixed liquor samples 400 ml were also collected at the end of the experiment for analysis of chiral 2 apas in the mixed liquor and sludge phase chiral 2 apas were extracted from aqueous samples and converted into their respective r r and r s phenylethylamide diastereomers following a previously described derivatisation method hashim and khan 2011 with slight modifications in elution solvent selection briefly samples 500 ml were acidified to approximately ph 3 4 using sulphuric acid 4 m and 50 µl of the istd was added solid phase extraction spe was performed using oasis 500 mg and 60 mg hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridges purchased from waters millford ct usa within 24 h of sample collection hlb spe cartridges were pre conditioned with 5 ml methanol and 5 ml milli q water all samples were then loaded onto the cartridges under vacuum pressure at a flow rate less than 15 ml min rinsed with 20 ml milli q water dried with air at room temperature for 20 min and stored at 4 c prior to elution and chiral analysis analytes were eluted off the cartridges using a 1 3 acn dcm mixture 2 3 ml and combined eluants concentrated to approximately 100 µl under nitrogen the residue was reconstituted in 300 µl acn treated with 30 µl of tea 50 mm 40 µl ethyl chloroformate 60 mm and sonicated for 2 min subsequently 40 µl of r pea 0 5 m was added and the mixture was sonicated for 2 min before the addition of 3 ml sulphuric acid 3 mm the derivatised analytes were extracted from the mixture in a second spe step using oasis hlb cartridges 1 ml 60 mg preconditioned with methanol 1 ml and water 1 ml adjusted to ph 9 5 using sodium hydroxide the loaded spe cartridges were dried under nitrogen and the analytes were eluted using dcm 1 ml directly into 2 ml autosampler vials prior to analysis 2 4 2 enantio specific analysis of chiral compounds enantio specific analysis of the 2 apa r r and r s pea diastereomers was conducted following a method previously described by hashim and khan 2011 with some modifications briefly target analytes were separated using an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m hp5 ms 30 m 250 µm 0 25 µm column under a helium flow of 1 2 ml min injection inlet interface and source temperatures were 270 260 and 280 c respectively an injection volume of 1 µl was used with the inlet in split less configuration the oven temperature gradient program was as follows initial 120 c held for 1 min increased to 240 c at 40 c min then to 300 c at 5 c min and held for 5 min having a run time of 18 min target analytes and isotope labelled istds were identified using an agilent 7000c triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electron impact ionization source at voltage of 70 ev and a source temperature of 280 c multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode was employed to monitor analytes ms1 scans of individual target analytes were performed to obtain suitable precursor ions followed by product ion scans to determine m z transitions and optimise collision energies ces two mrm transitions were monitored for each target analyte and isotope labelled istds all monitored transitions and optimized ce are presented in supplementary information table s1 the first mrm transition shown was used for quantification the second used for as a qualifier calibration curves showed good linearity with regression coefficients 0 99 for all analytes limits of quantification loq were defined as the concentration of an extracted analyte giving a signal to noise s n ratio greater than 10 a loq of 3 ng l was determined for all target analytes satisfactory method performance was confirmed by processing of blank and fortified milli q grade water samples along with experimental batches no target analyte or istd was detected above loqs in blank samples and extraction recoveries for all target analytes were within 20 of expected values in fortified samples a fortified extracted sample triplicate gave results with a relative standard deviation rsd of 5 for all target analytes verifying method precision target analyte concentrations were calculated using isotope dilution method with a 6 point calibration curve at 1 5 10 50 100 500 ng ml concentrations of chiral compounds in the solid phase sludge were determined according to a method previously described by wijekoon et al 2015 the solid pellets obtained from the mixed liquor after centrifugation were freeze dried for 14 h using an alpha 1 2 ldplus freeze dryer christ gmbh germany the dried sludge was ground and 0 7 g of sludge powder was transferred to a glass test tube for extraction the sludge powder was thoroughly mixed with methanol 7 5 ml using a vortex mixer vm1 ratek australia for 3 min and ultrasonicated for 10 min at 40 c the sample was centrifuged at 3270 g for 10 min alleegra x 12r beckman coulter usa and the supernatant was collected in a glass beaker for further analysis a dcm and methanol mixture 1 1 v v 7 5 ml were added to the remaining sludge and the process of mixing ultrasonic extraction and centrifugation was repeated the supernatants from both steps were combined and residual methanol and dcm were purged using nitrogen gas finally milli q water was added to obtain a 500 ml aqueous sample this sample was then analysed using the analytical method used for aqueous samples described above 2 5 calculation of removal efficiency and enantiomeric fraction the ef was calculated as follows 1 ef c m c m c o where cm is the concentration of the main enantiomer dosed into the reactor i e r 2 apas for mbr r and s 2 apas for mbr s co is the concentration of the other enantiomer the ef of all influent samples ranged from 0 97 1 00 confirming the purity of enantiomers used in this study the removal efficiency of an enantiomer was defined as 2 overall removal 100 c f c p c f where cf and cp are concentrations of the enantiomer in the mbr feed influent and permeate effluent respectively when an enantiomer was not detected the analytical technique loq of 3 ng l was assigned to concentration value for removal efficiency calculation chiral inversion results in a higher concentration of a specific enantiomer in the effluent than influent and thus negative removal of the enantiomer the overall removal of an enantiomer can be accounted for by chiral inversion and biotransformation biodegradation the percentage accounted by each process was calculated as follows 3 chiral inversion 100 c op c of c mf 4 biotransformation overall removal chiral inversion where cmf is the concentration of the main enantiomer in the feed influent cof and cop are the concentration of the other enantiomer in the feed and permeate respectively sorption rate of chiral 2 apas to sludge during mbr treatment was calculated by considering the ratio between the amount of 2 apa detected in sludge and the total amount dosed into the reactor 5 sorption rate 100 c sl v sl m sl c f v f t where csl and cf are the average concentrations of 2 apa in the sludge and the feed msl is the sludge concentration in the reactor g dried sludge l vsl is the volume of the reactor mixed liquor 3 l and vf is the daily volume of feed 6 l t was the number of days chiral 2 apas were dosed into the reactor before sludge sample was collected for analysis 37 days 2 6 assessment of abiotic changes in enantiomeric fraction prior to undertaking the experiments described in this manuscript control experiments were undertaken to assess the possibility of abiotic changes in ef under laboratory conditions these experiments involved incubation of chiral 2 apas ibuprofen ketoprofen and naproxen in laboratory grade water for up to 21 days followed by the same solid phase extraction and analytical determination applied in this study these experiments confirmed no observable change in ef under normal laboratory conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane bioreactor performance the two mbrs showed similar performance during the start up period fig 1 allowing for a systematic comparison between r and s enantiomeric inversion during mbr treatment the mlss concentration increased steadily from 5 5 0 1 to 9 7 0 2 n 2 and from 5 7 0 1 to 8 8 0 2 g l n 2 in the mbr r and the mbr s respectively both mbrs showed high mlvss mlss ratios in the range of 0 76 0 92 indicating a high number of active microorganisms high and stable toc removal efficiency 94 was achieved in both mbrs ph of the mixed liquor were stable at 6 55 0 16 n 42 and 6 57 0 17 n 40 in the mbr r and the mbr s respectively do concentration was maintained above 3 mg l to ensure an aerobic condition in both mbrs chiral compound addition and the type of enantiomer dosed did not affect the performance of the two mbrs fig 1 biomass content continued to increase to 11 5 0 2 and 10 8 0 5 g l n 2 in the mbr r and the mbr s respectively with high mlvss mlss ratio 0 85 toc removal efficiency also increased to 100 during continuous dosing of chiral compounds stable operation of both mbrs during the chiral compound addition period allowed for clear determination of chiral inversion occurrence there was a gradual increase in tmp in both mbrs over time from 0 8 1 to 5 2 7 6 kpa due to the increasing biomass concentrations supplementary information figure s2 membrane fouling was not observed during the experimental period due to the low operating flux in this study 3 4 lmh 3 2 chiral compound removal efficiency eleven r 2 apas 90 and ten s 2 apas 96 were effectively removed in this study fig 2 s naproxen was the only exception with the lowest removal efficiency of 74 5 14 4 fig 2 all compounds investigated here have the same 2 apa skeleton structure they differ from one another by the substituent groups on the aromatic ring table 1 these substituent groups can affect the ability of a compound to participate in biological reactions through steric hindrance and electrostatic shielding especially for hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic compounds log d 3 2 liu et al 2011 tadkaew et al 2011 steric hindrance at a given atom in a molecule is the congestion caused by the physical presence of the surrounding groups steric hindrance can affect the initial point of enzymatic attack liu et al 2011 or lead to different metabolism pathways for different enantiomers which was the case for 3 phenylbutyric acid degradation by rhodococcus rhodochrous pb1 simoni et al 1996 amongst the eleven 2 apas in terms of molecular structure naproxen possesses the bulkiest substituent group resulting in a higher steric hindrance and thus a lower removal efficiency naproxen also possesses a polynuclear structure two fused aromatic rings that may increase its persistence this is consistent with previous findings that naproxen can have lower removal efficiency than mononuclear 2 apas benzene based compounds such as ketoprofen and ibuprofen during wastewater treatment processes kim et al 2007 matamoros et al 2009 tambosi et al 2010 several mechanisms may contribute to the removal of chiral compounds in mbrs including biodegradation biotransformation including chiral inversion sorption to sludge and retention by membrane hydrophobic organic compounds log d 3 2 can be removed via sorption to the sludge phase tadkaew et al 2011 none of the chiral 2 apas used in this study are hydrophobic see their log d values in table 1 under the conditions applied in this study all apas are largely ionised and thus negatively charged pka ph 6 insignificant sorption to sludge 0 25 was confirmed by the negligible concentrations of r 2 apas in the mbr r sludge phase and s 2 apas in the mbr s sludge phase supplementary information table s2 and table s3 membrane retention was also insignificant in this study as confirmed by the similar 2 apa concentration in the mbr mixed liquor and the effluent supplementary information table s2 and table s3 all 2 apas investigated here are significantly smaller than the pore size 0 04 µm of the membrane thus their rejection by the membrane was not expected thus both sorption to sludge and membrane retention were insignificant and biodegradation and biotransformation are the two main removal mechanisms naproxen and ketoprofen removal in mbr treatment has been extensively investigated by contrast the removal of the remaining nine 2 apas appears to have not been previously studied in the literature r and s naproxen and ketoprofen removal efficiencies observed here were higher than those in previous studies supplementary information table s4 using racemic 2 apas instead of pure enantiomers alturki et al 2010 hashim et al 2011 tadkaew et al 2011 wang et al 2016 in agreement with this study nguyen et al 2017 reported that the removal of either pure ibuprofen enantiomers by an enzymatic mbr was 20 higher than of racemic ibuprofen previous works have confirmed enzymatic degradation as a major biodegradation pathway of naproxen ketoprofen and other 2 apas górny et al 2019 marco urrea et al 2010 further research to simultaneously examine degradation pathway and the fate of pure enantiomers may unravel the underlying reason for the higher removal of pure enantiomers compared to a racemic mixture observed in this study and the literature the two mbrs with feed solution containing r enantiomers and s enantiomers separately showed similar removal efficiencies of eight chiral 2 apas fig 2 of the remaining three chiral 2 apas i e naproxen ketoprofen and flurbiprofen one enantiomer was removed at higher rate compared to the other student t test p value 0 05 s enantiomers of ketoprofen and flurbiprofen were better removed than the corresponding r enantiomers while r naproxen was better removed than s naproxen in previous studies using racemic compounds enantioselective degradation preferential degradation of one enantiomer over the other was inferred only from the difference in ef between the influent and effluent evans et al 2017 matamoros et al 2009 petrie et al 2018 however the ef difference could be the result of enantioselective degradation chiral inversion or a combination of both the use of pure enantiomers instead of racemic mixtures in this study helps distinguish the two processes and allows for the comparison of each enantiomer s removal efficiency 3 3 chiral inversion of 2 apas in membrane bioreactors the disappearance of an enantiomer is due to the combination of chiral inversion to the opposite enantiomer and biotransformation thus the contributions of chiral inversion and biotransformation were calculated for each enantiomer in each sample from the result in table 2 the eleven chiral 2 apas could be divided into 3 groups in terms of chiral inversion behaviour 1 unidirectional chiral inversion r s two 2 apas 2 unidirectional chiral inversion s r three 2 apas and 3 bidirectional chiral inversion r s and s r five 2 apas details on the behaviour of each compound will be discussed further section 3 3 1 to 3 3 3 3 3 1 r s unidirectional chiral inversion unidirectional chiral inversion r s was observed for 2 4 chlorophenyl propionic acid and 2 phenylpropionic acid fig 3 as described in section 2 the mbr r was fed with r 2 apas thus s enantiomers of these compounds were below the loq in the influent however they were detected in the effluent yielding a negative removal efficiency fig 3a negative removal was not observed for the r enantiomers of these compounds in the mbr s fed with s enantiomers supplementary information table s5 these results confirm that their chiral inversion was unidirectional in the r s direction while the evidence of unidirectional chiral inversion in the r s direction was conclusive for these two 2 apas a very low concentration of the s enantiomer in the effluent was noted resulting in large error bars when reporting the negative removal values of these compounds fig 3 corresponding to the increase of s enantiomers concentrations the ef of these compounds significantly decreased from 1 00 in the influent to 0 47 0 12 0 58 0 11 n 11 in the effluent fig 3b student t test p 0 05 this study appears to provide the first evidence of significant chiral inversion of 2 4 chlorophenyl propionic acid and 2 phenylpropionic acid during biological wastewater treatment previous works have established that microorganisms can perform chiral inversion of 2 phenylpropionic acid though the direction is substrate and species specific hanlon et al 1994 hutt et al 1993 rhys williams et al 1998 for example hung et al 1996 found that r 2 phenylpropionic acid was inverted to the s enantiomer by the fungi cordycep militalis incubations of pure enantiomers with another fungus species verticillium lecanii in sorensen s phosphate buffer confirmed the occurrence of bidirectional inversion thomason et al 1997 kato et al 2003 reported that the bacteria nocardia diaphanozonaia invert 2 phenylpropionic acid in the s r direction which was the opposite direction to what was observed in this study 3 3 2 s r unidirectional chiral inversion unidirectional chiral inversion in the s r direction was observed for flurbiprofen 2 4 tert butylphenyl propionic acid and 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid fig 4 the concentration of their r enantiomers in the effluent of the mbr s receiving s 2 apas only were higher than that of the influent resulting in negative removal efficiencies by contrast negative removal was not observed for the s enantiomers of these compounds in the mbr r fed with r enantiomers supplementary information table s5 the ef of s flurbiprofen s 2 4 tert butylphenyl propionic acid and s 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid were significantly different between influent 1 00 and effluent 0 23 0 12 0 54 0 12 n 11 of the mbr s student t test p 0 05 it is noted that the effluent ef decreased over time for s flurbiprofen supplementary information table s7 fig 4 appears to be the first set of data on chiral inversion of these 2 apas during biological wastewater treatment the direction of flurbiprofen chiral inversion in previous studies examining single bacterial species was species specific kato et al 2003 thomason et al 1998 the fungus v lecanii carried out bidirectional inversion of flurbiprofen with r s enantiomer as the more significant direction the opposite of what was observed in this study thomason et al 1998 the fungus c militalis can invert flurbiprofen from r to s antipode while the bacteria n diaphanozonaria did not show any chiral inversion activity on this compound kato et al 2003 chiral inversion could lead to the increase in the concentration of the more biologically active or more toxic enantiomers for example r flurbiprofen was found to have a greater effect on photosystem ii inhibition in green algae than s flurbiprofen while only r flurbiprofen induced ethoxyresorufin o deethylase erod activity in fish cells neale et al 2019 r 2 4 tert butylphenyl propionic acid was around 1 6 times more potent than the s enantiomer in the erod assay ecir1 5 of 7 9 mg l for s compared to 4 9 mg l for r while only r 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid induced erod activity ecir1 5 of 4 5 mg l unpublished results the erod assay which is described in detail in neale et al 2019 was conducted with an exposure period of 6 h rather than 24 h the shorter exposure period was selected since a previous study found this was the optimal exposure period for pharmaceuticals including 2 apas ibuprofen and ketoprofen thibaut and porte 2008 linear concentration effect curves for erod activity for the two enantiomers of 2 4 tert butylphenyl propionic acid and the two enantiomers of 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid are provided in the supplementary information figure s4 and figure s5 3 3 3 bidirectional chiral inversion six 2 apas including naproxen ketoprofen 2 3 methylphenyl propionic acid 2 3 chlorophenyl propionic acid 2 4 fluorophenyl propionic acid and 2 4 butylphenyl propionic acid exhibited bidirectional chiral inversion this may be observed in fig 5 and fig 6 which show negative removal of both s and r enantiomers respectively of these 2 apas the concentration of the s enantiomer of naproxen ketoprofen 2 3 methylphenyl propionic acid 2 3 chlorophenyl propionic acid 2 4 fluorophenyl propionic acid in the effluent of the mbr r was higher than that of the influent resulting in negative removal efficiencies fig 5a correspondingly their ef dropped significantly from 0 98 1 00 in the influent to the range between 0 25 0 08 and 0 64 0 07 in the effluent n 11 fig 5b in the mbr s the concentration of r enantiomer in the effluent was also higher than the effluent resulting in negative removal efficiencies fig 6a the chiral inversion extent for these compounds appears to be greater in the r s direction than s r it is noted that for 2 4 butylphenyl propionic acid there was no evidence from influent and effluent data to support the occurrence of chiral inversion nevertheless s 2 4 butylphenyl propionic acid was not detected in the influent of mbr r but was detected at 1 7 1 7 ng g in the sludge phase and 9 0 0 0 ng l in the mixed liquor supernatant supplementary information similarly r 2 4 butylphenyl propionic acid was not detected in the influent of mbr s but was detected at 3 7 2 6 ng g in the sludge phase suggesting that bidirectional inversion also occurred for this 2 apa supplementary information table s3 bidirectional inversion of naproxen and ketoprofen in biological systems have been previously reported bertin et al 2020 nguyen et al 2017 thomason et al 1998 bidirectional inversion of naproxen was observed in an enzymatic mbr dosed with laccase from the fungus pleurotus ostreatus and in complex microbial communities such as soil microcosms bertin et al 2020 nguyen et al 2017 nguyen et al 2017 also observed that r s was the dominant inversion direction with 14 4 of r naproxen in the influent undergoing inversion to s naproxen and only 4 of s naproxen in the influent undergoing inversion to r naproxen nevertheless since naproxen chiral inversion is bidirectional it is difficult to confirm whether this results from the enantioselectivity of chiral inversion enzymes different rates of inversion for different enantiomers or other interactions between two enantiomers this is the first time the r s chiral inversion of naproxen has been demonstrated in a wastewater treatment process since r naproxen is metabolised into s naproxen in the human body this is the dominant enantiomer detected in raw wastewater and s r inversion has been frequently observed camacho muñoz et al 2019 sanganyado et al 2017 however it is known that naproxen exhibits different chiral inversion behaviour in different environments for example experiments with the fungus v lecanii resulted in r s chiral inversion thomason et al 1998 while observations from a microcosm experiment with activated sludge from wastewater treatment plant were of s r inversion suzuki et al 2014 ketoprofen has been found to undergo bidirectional inversion by different fungi and fungal enzymes nguyen et al 2017 thomason et al 1998 wsol et al 2004 however it was reported that the s r inversion was more significant than the r s inversion thomason et al 1998 which is different from this study similar to s flurbiprofen the effluent ef of naproxen both enantiomers decreased over time supplementary information table s6 s7 the decrease in effluent ef could be due to varying rates of metabolism and chiral inversion as a consequence of microbial adaptation analysis of the mbr microbial community associated with chiral inversion may bring more insights into this phenomenon the results in this study highlight the significance of using pure enantiomers over racemic mixture in confirming the occurrence of chiral inversion when racemic solutions of 2 3 chlorophenyl propionic acid and 2 4 methoxyphenyl propionic acid were dosed into culture media of n diaphanozonaia no inversion activity was observed kato et al 2003 ketoprofen frequently showed minor ef change from influent to effluent increased from 0 54 0 58 to 0 61 0 68 during wastewater treatment and microcosm studies but this observation was attributed to enantioselective degradation of the two enantiomers rather than chiral inversion caballo et al 2015 camacho muñoz et al 2019 khan 2014 the 2 apas investigated here only differ from one another by a substituent group of the benzyl ring but exhibited significantly different chiral inversion behaviours table 1 the underlying reason could be the impact of substituent groups on the chiral inversion process or different microbial species with different chiral inversion mechanisms are responsible for the inversion of different compounds steric hindrance caused by substituent groups can affect the initial point of enzymatic attack and the metabolism pathway for different enantiomers liu et al 2011 simoni et al 1996 liu et al 2011 observed that the bacteria xanthobacter flavus pa1 initially attacked 2 phenylbutyric acid at the β c atom of the carboxyl alkyl side chain through hydroxylation not at the aromatic ring and suggested that the reason to be steric hindrance of the chiral carboxyl alkyl moiety attached on the benzene ring simoni et al 1996 examined the metabolism of chiral 3 phenylbutyric acid by r rhodochrous pb1 and showed that the r enantiomer was initially demethylated at the chiral centre of the carboxyl alkyl side chain to decrease the steric hindrance and further metabolized via meta ring cleavage whereas the s enantiomer is only cometabolically oxidized to s 3 2 3 dihydroxyphenyl butyric acid without ring cleavage thus it is possible that steric hindrance of the substituent group can impact chiral inversion behaviour of 2 apas kato et al 2003 demonstrated that chiral inversion enzymes of n diaphanozonaria accept 2 phenylpropionic acid and 2 fluorophenylacetic acid but did not show any activity on compounds with higher steric bulkiness e g 2 phenylbutanoic acid 2 methoxyphenylacetic acid and 3 hydroxy 2 phenylpropanoic acid consequently a mechanistic understanding of chiral biotransformation of 2 apas remains lacking and a future research need 4 conclusion this study examined the chiral inversion behaviour of a suite of pharmaceutically active 2 arylpropionic acids 2 apas using pure r and s enantiomers during biological wastewater treatment high and similar removal efficiencies of r and s forms were observed 90 for eight 2 apa enantiomers the eleven 2 apas investigated here differ from one another by just one substituent group attached to the 2 apa backbone but show diverse and distinctive chiral inversion behaviours two 2 apas showed chiral inversion in the r s direction three 2 apas showed chiral inversion in the s r direction and six 2 apas showed bidirectional chiral inversion compounds exhibiting bidirectional inversion also shows greater inversion from r s than from s r time dependant changes in effluent ef was observed for two 2 apas

16406,halobenzoquinones hbqs are emerging disinfection byproducts generated during the reaction of chlorine disinfectant with natural organic matter nom in source water in this study the correlations between molecular weight and hbqs generation of river nom was evaluated the compositional and functional characteristics of primary hbqs precursors were revealed by using orbitrap mass spectrometry combined with molecular tagging the nom fraction larger than 50 kda resulted in approximately 9 times more hbqs 50 9 2 7 ng mgc than low molecular weight fractions significant correlations were found between the yields of hbqs and lignin like and highly oxygen compounds in nom suggesting their critical roles in hbqs formation derivatizating the aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in nom could reduce hbqs yields by 90 7 100 unraveling the molecular characteristics of hbqs precursors in nom would greatly benefit the prediction of hbqs yields of different source water and develop more efficient disinfection byproduct control strategies graph abstract image graphical abstract keywords halobenzoquinones natural organic matter molecular weight molecular composition molecular tagging 1 introduction disinfection byproducts dbps are inevitably generated from the reactions between disinfectants and natural organic matter nom in raw water dbps have attracted intensive attentions due to their adverse health effects such as elevated risks of bladder cancer bull et al 2011 hrudey et al 2015 since johannes j rook discovered trihalomethanes thms in 1974 rook 1974 more than 700 dbps have been reported richardson et al 2007 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009 richardson and thomas 2018 halobenzoquinones hbqs are emerging dbps that have been detected in over 95 of chlorinated water at

and dna li et al 2014 2015 wang et al 2018 li et al 2018a exhibiting relatively high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity qin et al 2010 du et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 frequently detected hbqs in disinfected water include 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 dcbq 3 4 5 6 tetrachloro 1 2 benzoquinone tetrac 1 2 bq 2 6 dibromo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 dbbq and 2 chloro 6 iodo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 cibq wang et al 2016 hu et al 2020 lou et al 2021 disinfectant dosage precursor availability temperature and ph could all affect the formation of these hbqs hu et al 2020 source water nom and contaminants such as phenol personal care products and aromatic amines were common precursors of hbqs qin et al 2010 diemert et al 2013 kosaka et al 2017 in particular nom was the dominant source of precursors contributing to the generation of hbqs in source water kosaka et al 2017 diemert et al 2013 the high complexity and large temporal and spatial variations of source water nom hampered the discovery of naturally occurring hbqs precursors and elucidation of their molecular features high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms represents one of the state of the art techniques to characterize the composition of nom phungsai et al 2016 fu et al 2020 it predicts the molecular formulas of unknown compounds with a mass error 2 ppm using the analytical mode of full spectrum screening particularly for low molecular weight compounds zhang et al 2012 phungsai et al 2018 recent studies using hr ms revealed that the formation of regulated dbps e g thms was closely related with the molecular composition of nom with high o c and h c ratios wang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 however the precursors of hbqs were mainly studied as individual compounds or surrogate parameters for example li s group found that dissolved organic carbon doc with uv absorbance at 254 nm contributed to hbqs formation diemert et al 2013 many other researchers have demonstrated that individual compounds such as phenol and aromatic amines can generate hbqs during chlorination kosaka et al 2017 zhao et al 2012 the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring hbqs precursors are not fully revealed due to the limitations of analytical instruments moreover hbqs generated from chlorination of aromatic compounds varied with functional groups kosaka et al 2017 diemert et al 2013 fortunately molecular tagging coupled with chemical derivatization was a promising technique to characterize the functional groups of compounds compared with traditional tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and ms molecular tagging has advantages in molecule separation york and bell 2020 which also enables more accurate identification of aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl in nom york and bell 2020 liu et al 2020 thus molecular tagging can provide a deeper insight into the functional groups of hbq precursors in this study we aimed to identify hbq precursors in source water nom and unravel their molecular weight composition and functional group features specific objectives were to 1 investigate the contributions of size fractionated nom to hbq formation during chlorination 2 identify the molecular composition and critical functional groups of hbq precursors using hr ms and molecular tagging and 3 unravel the mechanism of functional groups determining the generation of hbqs it is expected that the outcomes will provide more comprehensive information regarding the formation mechanism of nom generated hbqs which would be important for the prediction and elimination of hbq associated ecological and health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials the suwannee river nom srnom 2r101n and the suwannee river humic acid srha 3s101h were purchased from the

2021 and transported to the laboratory under 4 c prior to analysis the property of source water was summarized in table s2 river nom was concentrated using solid phase extraction spe with agilent bond elute ppl cartridges containing 1 g of modified and functionalized styrene divinylbenzene sdvb the ppl cartridge was selected according to its reported high recoveries of doc in environmental samples phungsai et al 2018 in brief 4 l of aqueous samples were passed through the cartridge at a flow rate of 5 6 ml min and eluted with 6 ml of water acetonitrile v v 50 50 and 6 ml acetonitrile respectively liu et al 2020 more details can be found in text s2 the recovery of doc was in the range of 49 62 similar to previous studies li et al 2016 phungsai et al 2018 srnom and collected river nom at a concentration of 100 mg l was prepared and fractionated using mwco ultrafiltration membranes following procedures described previously chu et al 2010 han et al 2015 he et al 2020 10 kda fractions were termed as high mw nom and 10 kda factions were low mw dom liu et al 2012 400 ml of each fraction at the concentration of 10 mg l was prepared for the downstream analyses 2 3 chlorination of nom samples and model precursors the chlorine dosage in hbqs formation experiments was determined based on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and nh3 n and calculated as cl2 dosage mg l 3 doc mg l 7 6 nh3 n mg l 10 mg l diemert et al 2013 the ph of the solution was kept at 7 0 0 2 with the addition of 10 mm phosphate to better illustrate the relationship of nom components and hbqs we analyzed hbqs generated by reacting 10 mg l of srnom with 60 mg l chlorine for different contact time 0 2 4 6 10 16 20 24 30 36 and 48 h the highest concentration of hbqs was observed at 6 h fig s1 and thus 6 h was selected for downstream experiments this was similar to the findings from a previous study where the maximum 2 6 dcbq concentration was obtained after a 5 h reaction of nom with chlorine kosaka et al 2017 the chlorination reaction was conducted in 250 ml glass bottles in a 25 0 1 0 c thermostatic incubator for 6 h twelve model phenol compounds were selected as the representative precursors with different functional groups 500 μm of each compound was reacted with 5 m chlorine in 100 ml solution at ph 7 0 0 2 for 6 h triplicate samples of the chlorinated compounds were subjected to uplc ms ms analysis to quantify hbqs generated using the method described in section 2 4 formic acid fa was used to quench chlorine in previous studies and 2 5 formic acid can completely quench chlorine at 1 3 mg l table s3 therefore hbqs were stabilized and the residual chlorine was quenched by 2 5 fa v v treatment for 60 min in our analyzed samples subsequently spe was used to extract and concentrate hbqs and nom in the sample according to reported methods huang et al 2013 briefly spe with waters oasis hlb cartridges 6 ml 200 mg per cartridge was used to extract hbqs from 200 ml samples and the details are described in text s3 the hbqs yields were calculated as the ratio of the generated hbqs to the initial doc concentration and expressed in ng mgc all of the conditions of hbqs formation experiments are summarized in table s4 meanwhile the chlorinated nom samples for the analysis of component changes were also pretreated via spe using an agilent bond elute ppl cartridge following the procedure described above to avoid any carryover during sample preparation spe extraction and sequential lc ms ms analysis control samples ultrapure water were prepared and analyzed along with the samples experiments were conducted in triplicate and the relative standard deviations were lower than 5 for all of the reported mean values 2 4 analysis of hbqs doc and molecular characteristic of nom hbqs were analyzed by an ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray triple quadrupole ion trap tandem mass spectrometer uplc esi qtrap ms ms waters uplc system qtrap 5500 sciex concord on canada in negative mode huang et al 2013 the spectrometer was equipped with a beh c18 column 2 1 100 mm i d 1 7 μm waters ireland and operated at 50 c eight hbqs were separated at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min within 18 min the instrument parameters are described in table s5 the method detection limits mdls of hbqs were in the range of 0 2 2 6 ng l and the recoveries were 69 96 table s6 the concentration of doc was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the specific uv absorbance suva at 285 nm suva285 and 254 nm suva254 were used to indicate the aromaticity of dom which were calculated as uv285 and uv254 divided by the doc of the solution the functional groups of nom were measured by ftir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo scientific co ltd waltham mass the concentration of residual chlorine was measured using a pocket colorimeter following the instruments instructions pocket colorimeter ⅱ analysis system hach the molecular composition of the nom was discerned by a qexactive plus mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma in negative mode all size fractionated and chlorinated samples were diluted with water and acetonitrile 40 60 and injected into the instrument directly at a flow rate of 100 μl min the analysis was conducted with a spray current of 4 5 kv in the mass range of 50 2000 to avoid cross contamination the injection system was washed with 500 μl acetonitrile between samples the formulas of identified peaks were predicted by using the trfu algorithm with a mass error of less than 2 ppm fu et al 2020 restrictive characteristics of molecules were set at 1 c 50 1 o n 5 s 2 p 1 0 3 h c 2 5 and 0 o c 1 2 similar to the general molecular characteristics of nom fu et al 2020 meanwhile the formulas were used in our study with oxygen subtracted double bond equivalents dbe o value eq 1 between 10 and 10 herzsprung et al 2014 plots of the carbon oxidation state cos eq 2 and dbe o c eq 3 served as indicators of the degrees of oxidation and unsaturation respectively the selected chemicals demonstrated in the van krevelen diagram can be categorized into seven components by the h c and o c ratios in molecular formulas fu et al 2020 liu et al 2020 kim et al 2003 the composition of each component is described in text s4 the mass peak intensities were normalized by the largest peak and calculated the percentage of all peaks in each compound by matlab 2019b 1 dbe o 1 0 5 2c h o 2 cos h 2o c 3 dbe o c 1 0 5 2c h o c where c h and o represent the number of carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a single formula spearman s rank correlations between hbqs yields and the intensity of seven components of six nom fractions as well as their correlations with the components of river water nom were calculated matlab 2019b and r were used for statistical analyses two tailed tests statistical significance p 0 05 2 5 derivatization of hbqs precursors to examine the contributions of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the generation of hbqs mei and dmso which can react with the two groups were applied to the nom samples fig s3 fujitake et al 2003 york and bell 2020 the following methylation was carried out in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks fujitake et al 2003 briefly 5 mg of sample was mixed with 5 ml of anhydrous dmso and then mixed with msc at a molar ratio of 0 5 10 mm under a stream of nitrogen the sample flask was sealed and ultra sonicated for 3 h and cooled on ice and then mei was added to the solution at a msc mei molar ratio of 1 1 3 the solution was warmed up to room temperature stirred for 4 to 12 h finally the solution was diluted in 15 ml deionized water evaporated with nitrogen gas until dmso disappeared and the solution was freeze dried details are described in text s5 the unintentionally generated nai during methylation reaction can react with ocl and thus had to be removed methylated nom was dissolved in 10 ml chloroform and passed through a membrane filter 0 22 µm ptfe millipore to remove nai the solution before and after filtration was dried and the weight difference represented the yield of methylated nom fujitake et al 2003 none of i was detected by ion exchange chromatography in the final solution the detection limit was 20 µg l to check the impact of filtration on the composition of samples 5 mg unmethylated nom as a control was treated along with the methylated samples during the filtration process finally the control nom and methylated nom were re dissolved in 50 ml deionized water the roles of aldehydes and ketones in generating hbqs were determined by deriving c o using grp liu et al 2020 the reaction mechanism is described in fig s3 1 mg nom was dissolved in 200 µl of 70 acetonitrile acetonitrile water 70 30 v v and mixed with 600 µl of 20 mm grp and 400 µl of 10 mm hcl in 70 acetonitrile text s6 the experiment was conducted at 50 c for 10 min finally the mixed solution was dried with nitrogen gas and re dissolved in 50 ml deionized water for chlorination both of the derivatives were diluted to 10 mg l for chlorination experiment meanwhile the reactions between derivatization reagents and chlorine may cause inaccuracy of the results we excluded the interference by mixing derivatization reagents with chlorine table s4 the results showed that none of hbqs were formed during chlorination process all of three derivatization reagents 10 mm were added to the 10 µg l hbqs to explore its effects on hbqs respectively as well as little loss of hbqs in the presence of derivatization reagents 3 results and discussion 3 1 hbqs generated by nom fractions with different molecular weight among the six mw fractions of nom hbqs generated by the 50 100 kda fraction 55 3 2 1 ng mgc and 100 kda fraction 46 6 1 7 ng mgc were significantly higher than those of the other four smaller mw fractions 3 1 14 4 folds higher p 0 05 fig 1 meanwhile all five hbqs were detected in the 50 100 kda and 100 kda fractions whereas the three smaller fractions generated only two hbqs namely 2 6 dcbq and tetrac 1 2 bq among all hbqs 2 6 dcbq was the most abundant and prevalent in line with the results of other studies on the frequency and concentration of 2 6 dcbq in real drinking water zhao et al 2012 lou et al 2021 in all tested source water samples the yields of hbqs in 50 kda fraction was significantly higher than that of 50 kda fraction p 0 05 fig s3 the van krevelen diagram displayed the h c and o c ratios of components in size fractionated nom fig 2 which ranged from 0 to 1 2 and 0 2 5 respectively for larger mw fractions 50 100 kda and 100 kda highly oxygen compounds hocs and lignin carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules crams like structures were dominant which accounted for over 50 of the whole components in 50 100 kda and 100 kda fractions fig s4 the o c and h c ratios of smaller mw fractions 3 10 kda and 3 kda otherwise were discontinuously distributed 0 o c 0 3 and 1 5 h c 2 0 and 0 1 o c 0 67 and 0 67 h c 1 5 these smaller mw components were featured by lipids like and lignin crams like structures components 80 in 3 10 kda and 3 kda fractions and hocs the third abundant components only accounted for 6 9 the distinct component in the larger mw fractions was hocs despite that we cannot entirely attribute the precursors of hbqs to hocs lignin crams like structures the major components of aquatic sediment and soil dom fu et al 2020 blackburn et al 2017 consisted of lignin derived and carboxylic rich alicyclic molecule cram structure components the cram components were likely to be aliphatic aldehydes ketones while the lignin derived compounds were considered to be aromatic aldehydes ketones they exhibited different properties with regard to hbqs generation potentials although lignin crams like structure components were abundant in all mw fractions the composition of each mw varied significantly as shown in fig s5 lignin crams like components detected in the above 50 kda fraction generally had a broad range of dbe o c and cos fig s5a while the below 30 kda fraction was characterized by negative dbe o c fig s5b as a result the correlation between hbqs and the whole of lignin crams like components deserved further investigation hocs were usually considered as tannin derived molecules li et al 2018b they were formed during the diagenetic processes of various organic matter kellerman et al 2014 2015 minor et al 2012 both of the two components were characterized as aromatic ring with functional groups which is the basic structure of hbqs previous study found that nom with mw 10 kda contained more aromatic structures than lower mw nom fraction 10 kda by using suva value he et al 2020 the conclusion was matched well with the distribution of aromatic compounds in different mw fractions thus deeper research on the relationship between the nom components and the formation of hbqs need to be further conducted 3 2 hbqs formation potentials of different nom components the distinct composition of different mw fractions in nom could lead to varied yields of hbqs each component of nom in the van krevelen diagram received a spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s with the generation of hbqs herzsprung et al 2012 fig 3 lignin crams like components demonstrated a strong correlation with the yields of hbqs r 0 79 p 0 01 hocs 0 67 o c 1 2 0 67 h c 1 5 were also prone to generate hbqs with a r value of 0 95 at p 0 01 while the correlations with lipids like carbohydrates like unsaturated hydrocarbons uh components aliphatic peptides like a p like and condensed aromatic structures as components were insignificant the significant correlation between hocs lignin crams like components and dbp formation also be observed for thms and haas during chlorination wang et al 2017 previous study has pointed that quinones can be formed by the oxidization of lignin structures copy and mcknight 2005 thus the oxidizing condition created by chlorination is favorable for hbqs generation the characteristic of hocs was rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups while phenol was the well studied precursors of hbqs zhao et al 2012 the information mentioned above may partly explain the strong correlation between the generation of hbqs and hocs lignin crams like structures taking our attention to the real river samples the significant correlations between hbqs generation and molecules in the hocs and lignin crams like components were also observed at p 0 05 fig s6 therefore hocs and lignin crams like play important roles in hbqs formation to validate the results the seven components of nom were acquired according to previous studies including bleached and hydrolysis of ha and exacts of peat soil details are described in text s7 stevenson 1994 chefetz et al 2002 kim et al 2003 sleighter and hatcher 2008 hocs generated the highest amount of hbqs 113 0 6 6 ng mgc followed by lignin crams like components 99 8 6 4 ng mgc a p and carbohydrates 7 2 0 3 ng mgc lipids like 1 4 0 1 ng mgc as 1 3 0 1 ng mgc and uh nd fig 4 therefore lignin crams like components and hocs also produced higher hbqs than other components these results verified that hocs and lignin crams like components were the major precursors of hbqs more detailed information of the structural and functional features of hbqs precursors deserved further investigation the formation of hbqs was closely related to the saturation and oxidation states of the precursors summarized the generation of hbqs from previous studies lignin crams like components and hocs also produced higher 2 6 dcbq than other components fig s7 zhao et al 2012 kosaka et al 2017 lou et al 2019 however the yields of hbqs by lignin crams like components were ranged from nd to 3 7 molar ratio the unique structural properties or functional groups of hbqs precursors deserved detailed investigations to better explain these differences in the yields of hbqs the saturation and oxidation states of the dominant components hoc molecules lignin crams like and lipids like components were measured by dbe o c and cos values respectively fig s8 compounds with positive dbe o c value represents an unsaturated state and positive cos represents an oxidation state hocs generally had positive cos and a broad range of dbe o c fig s8a while lipids were characterized by their negative cos fig s8b and lignin crams like components had positive dbe o c fig s8c the results underscored the different contributions of molecular structures in the formation of hbqs during drinking water chlorination dbps can formed via the addition reactions with unsaturated bonds or electrophilic substitution at nucleophilic sites phungsai et al 2018 thus selective reactions are inclined to occur at activated aromatic rings or cc double bonds during chlorination phungsai et al 2018 these structures are more commonly present in hocs and lignin crams like components leading to their relatively higher hbqs yields than other components in nom 3 3 functional groups contributing to hbqs formation potentials the functional groups of specific nom components significantly affect their photochemical and redox properties wenk et al 2013 the correlations between hbqs generation and functional groups of bigger hocs and lignin crams like and smaller lipids like nom components were revealed by ftir analysis fig s9 the distinct stretching peaks were identified at 1270 1250 cm 1 aromatic co and phenolic oh and 1710 cm 1 aromatic c o busin and guo 1999 indicating that oxygen containing functional groups were abundant in the lignin crams like components and hocs while the aromatic c o aromatic co and phenolic oh groups were not observed in the lipid like sample overall nom components with more phenolic oh and aromatic c o functional groups had relatively high hbq yields the c o is present in carboxyl aldehyde and ketone and oh is a part of carboxyl to verify the significance of oh and c o in hbqs formation during chlorination molecular tagging was developed to derivatize the four functional groups namely hydroxyl carboxyl aldehyde and ketone alkylated hydroxyl and carboxyl were derivatized by mei and msc and aldehydes and ketones were derivatized by grp reaction time temperature amount of mei msc and grp were optimized in detail to maximize the derivatization efficiency text s5 s6 and fig s10 s11 the weight of different nom components was set at 5 mg during optimization a maximum yield of derivatized nom was noticed when 6 mm msc and 4 mm mei were mixed for 6 h fig s10 the maximum derivatization efficiency of aldehydes and ketones was achieved by adding 6 ml of 20 mm grp and 4 ml of 5 mm hcl at 50 c for 10 min fig s11 the average yields of hbqs decreased from 29 7 ng mgc to 10 7 ng mgc after the derivatization of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the seven representative components of nom fig 5 only 2 6 dcbq and tetrac 1 2 bq were detected in the derived samples meanwhile 2 6 dcbq and tetrac 1 2 bq were the only two hbqs detected in the tea samples and chlorinated tea polyphenols samples lou et al 2019 this may be attributed to the more abundant precursors of 2 6 dcbq and tetrac 1 2 bq than other hbqs thus they are more prone to generate during chlorination a slight decrease of hbq yield was observed when aldehydes and ketones were substituted by hydrazones grp derivatives hbqs originated from lignin crams like and hocs decreased by 33 6 and 21 2 respectively while the derivatization of the other four components led to less hbqs reduction fig 5 aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl groups accounted for 90 7 100 of hbqs generated during chlorination of the seven components of nom the average yields of hbqs decreased from 25 3 ng mgc to 8 5 ng mgc after the derivatization of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in all six mw fractions of nom fig s12 the highest decrease of hbqs was observed in the mw fractions containing the highest amount of lignin crams like components and hocs the results were further confirmed by suva values which served as indicators of dbps formation potentials hou et al 2018 the uv254 value represents the extent of conjugation in the dissolved nom compounds the conjugated molecules can undergo numerous π π transitions at close to 254 nm workman 2001 e g quinones derived from the similar level of unsaturation compounds e g phenolic compounds the suva285 was an indicator of phenols and benzene carboxylic acids hou et al 2018 krasner et al 1996 fig s13 demonstrates suva254 and suva285 of the six mw fractions nom where the two values both ranked in an order of 100 kda 50 100 kda 30 50 kda 10 30 kda 3 kda 3 10 kda the results suggested that the suva values were positively correlated with mw we further demonstrated strong positive correlations between suva values suva254 and suva285 and hbqs fig s14 deducing that uv absorbing components especially those at 285 nm were primary precursors to hbqs the positive correlations between suva values and traditional disinfection products e g thms and haas have been discussed in previous studies roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 the results of ftir and molecular tagging collectively suggested that aromatic c o and phenolic oh were the most influential functional groups leading to the formation of hbqs during chlorination 3 4 the property of functional groups responsible for hbqs formation potentials the oxidation of phenolic compounds forms quinone structures and not surprisingly hydroxyl groups play important roles in hbq generation wenk et al 2013 however the reactivity of phenolic compounds can be affected by other substituent groups e g aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl groups criquet et al 2015 the significance of aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the formation of hbqs can be explained by the electronic property of those functional groups the electron density of the carbon double bonds of compounds with electron donating substitutes e g ch2 o and or is richer than that of molecules with electron withdrawing substituent groups e g cooh cho and coor phungsai et al 2019 the electron donating substituent groups accelerated the electrophilic aromatic substitution process yielding higher final dbps e g thms haas criquet et al 2015 whereas the electron withdrawing substituent groups potentially inhibited the complete oxidation of phenolic compounds resulting in the higher formation of quinones via electron transfer reactions criquet et al 2015 the hypothesis of the contribution of functional groups was confirmed by chlorinating twelve model precursors the highest yield of hbqs was 1 71 0 08 m m which was obtained from the chlorination of 4 hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester with coor fig 6 the average yields of hbqs formed in the chlorination of eight compounds with electron withdrawing substituent groups were 0 58 m m which was approximately 29 fold greater than that of four compounds with electron donating substituent groups 0 02 m m p 0 05 fig 6 taking our attention to compounds with functional groups mentioned in section 3 3 the yields of hbqs formed from 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and p hydroxybenzaldehyde 0 23 0 01 m m and 0 34 0 01 m m respectively were three magnitudes higher than that of hydroquinone and 4 methothyphenol 0 0004 0 00002 m m and 0 0006 0 00003 m m respectively thus there was clear evidence of functional groups that affect the generation of hbqs the four functional groups contributed to hbqs formation via different mechanisms where the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring was the major precursor as it oxidized to quinone and aldehydes ketones and carboxyl groups accelerated hbqs generation the derivatization process converted carboxyl aldehyde and ketone from electron withdrawing to electron donating which resulted in the reduction of hbqs for example 4 hydroxybenzoic acid produced 384 fold of hbqs compared to that of 4 methothyphenol kosaka et al have demonstrated a similar trend of 2 6 dcbq generation by chlorinating 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 methothyphenol for 1 h resulting in 230 times higher 2 6 dcbq formed in the 4 hydroxybenzoic acid samples than that of 4 methothyphenol samples kosaka et al 2017 thus functional groups play important roles in hbqs generation meanwhile the functional structures were also responsible for the varied hbqs yields of different mw nom the higher mw fraction 50 kda was rich in lignins and hocs fig s4 with more phenol hydroxyl groups and aromatic aldehydes ketones than the lower mw fraction in comparison the lower mw fraction 50 kda was occupied by uh and lipids fig s4 which were deficient in functional structures facilitating hbqs formation the results also stressed the importance of functional structures in hbqs generation which provided novel insights into the relationship of different size fractionated nom and dbps formation 4 conclusions and implications this study systemically unveiled the characteristics of hbqs precursors in nom in related to molecular weight composition and functional groups larger mw fractions 50 kda hocs and lignin cram like components were the primary precursors of hbqs the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were found essential to hbqs formation too these results provide more comprehensive insights into the molecular mechanism of hbqs formation by nom which will be helpful for the prediction of hbqs generation of different source water and the employment of more effective treatment technologies towards hbqs control at drinking water treatment plants technologies aiming to remove larger mw and high o c nom components such as coagulation nanofiltration or membrane filtration are desired the development of advanced oxidation processes eliminating specific hbqs precursors or altering the h c and o c ratios of hbqs precursors are also in need declaration of

between molecular weight and hbqs generation of river nom was evaluated the compositional and functional characteristics of primary hbqs precursors were revealed by using orbitrap mass spectrometry combined with molecular tagging the nom fraction larger than 50 kda resulted in approximately 9 times more hbqs 50 9 2 7 ng mgc than low molecular weight fractions significant correlations were found between the yields of hbqs and lignin like and highly oxygen compounds in nom suggesting their critical roles in hbqs formation derivatizating the aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in nom could reduce hbqs yields by 90 7 100 unraveling the molecular characteristics of hbqs precursors in nom would greatly benefit the prediction of hbqs yields of different source water and develop more

introduction disinfection byproducts dbps are inevitably generated from the reactions between disinfectants and natural organic matter nom in raw water dbps have attracted intensive attentions due to their adverse health effects such as elevated risks of bladder cancer bull et al 2011 hrudey et al 2015 since johannes j rook discovered trihalomethanes thms in 1974 rook 1974 more than 700 dbps have been reported richardson et al 2007 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009 richardson and thomas 2018 halobenzoquinones hbqs are emerging dbps that have been detected in over 95 of chlorinated water at concentrations up to 291 0 ng l wang et al 2016 hu et al 2020 lou et al 2021 they can generate intracellular reactive oxygen species induce the depletion of glutathione and damage cellular proteins and dna li et al 2014 2015 wang et al 2018 li et al 2018a exhibiting relatively high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity qin et al 2010 du et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 frequently detected hbqs in disinfected water include 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 dcbq 3 4 5 6 tetrachloro 1 2 benzoquinone tetrac 1 2 bq 2 6 dibromo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 dbbq and 2 chloro 6 iodo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 cibq wang et al 2016 hu et al 2020 lou et al 2021 disinfectant dosage precursor availability temperature and ph could all affect the formation of these hbqs hu et al 2020 source water nom and contaminants such as phenol personal care products and aromatic amines were common precursors of hbqs qin et al 2010 diemert et al 2013 kosaka et al 2017 in particular nom was the dominant source of precursors contributing to the generation of hbqs in source water kosaka et al 2017 diemert et al 2013 the high complexity and large temporal and spatial variations of source water nom hampered the discovery of naturally occurring hbqs precursors and elucidation of their molecular features high resolution mass spectrometry hr ms represents one of the state of the art techniques to characterize the composition of nom phungsai et al 2016 fu et al 2020 it predicts the molecular formulas of unknown compounds with a mass error 2 ppm using the analytical mode of full spectrum screening particularly for low molecular weight compounds zhang et al 2012 phungsai et al 2018 recent studies using hr ms revealed that the formation of regulated dbps e g thms was closely related with the molecular composition of nom with high o c and h c ratios wang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 however the precursors of hbqs were mainly studied as individual compounds or surrogate parameters for example li s group found that dissolved organic carbon doc with uv absorbance at 254 nm contributed to hbqs formation diemert et al 2013 many other researchers have demonstrated that individual compounds such as phenol and aromatic amines can generate hbqs during chlorination kosaka et al 2017 zhao et al 2012 the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring hbqs precursors are not fully revealed due to the limitations of analytical instruments moreover hbqs generated from chlorination of aromatic compounds varied with functional groups kosaka et al 2017 diemert et al 2013 fortunately molecular tagging coupled with chemical derivatization was a promising technique to characterize the functional groups of compounds compared with traditional tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and ms molecular tagging has advantages in molecule separation york and bell 2020 which also enables more accurate identification of aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl in nom york and bell 2020 liu et al 2020 thus molecular tagging can provide a deeper insight into the functional groups of hbq precursors in this study we aimed to identify hbq precursors in source water nom and unravel their molecular weight composition and functional group features specific objectives were to 1 investigate the contributions of size fractionated nom to hbq formation during chlorination 2 identify the molecular composition and critical functional groups of hbq precursors using hr ms and molecular tagging and 3 unravel the mechanism of functional groups determining the generation of hbqs it is expected that the outcomes will provide more comprehensive information regarding the formation mechanism of nom generated hbqs which would be important for the prediction and elimination of hbq associated ecological and health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials the suwannee river nom srnom 2r101n and the suwannee river humic acid srha 3s101h were purchased from the

2021 and transported to the laboratory under 4 c prior to analysis the property of source water was summarized in table s2 river nom was concentrated using solid phase extraction spe with agilent bond elute ppl cartridges containing 1 g of modified and functionalized styrene divinylbenzene sdvb the ppl cartridge was selected according to its reported high recoveries of doc in environmental samples phungsai et al 2018 in brief 4 l of aqueous samples were passed through the cartridge at a flow rate of 5 6 ml min and eluted with 6 ml of water acetonitrile v v 50 50 and 6 ml acetonitrile respectively liu et al 2020 more details can be found in text s2 the recovery of doc was in the range of 49 62 similar to previous studies li et al 2016 phungsai et al 2018 srnom and collected river nom at a concentration of 100 mg l was prepared and fractionated using mwco ultrafiltration membranes following procedures described previously chu et al 2010 han et al 2015 he et al 2020 10 kda fractions were termed as high mw nom and 10 kda factions were low mw dom liu et al 2012 400 ml of each fraction at the concentration of 10 mg l was prepared for the downstream analyses 2 3 chlorination of nom samples and model precursors the chlorine dosage in hbqs formation experiments was determined based on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and nh3 n and calculated as cl2 dosage mg l 3 doc mg l 7 6 nh3 n mg l 10 mg l diemert et al 2013 the ph of the solution was kept at 7 0 0 2 with the addition of 10 mm phosphate to better illustrate the relationship of nom components and hbqs we analyzed hbqs generated by reacting 10 mg l of srnom with 60 mg l chlorine for different contact time 0 2 4 6 10 16 20 24 30 36 and 48 h the highest concentration of hbqs was observed at 6 h fig s1 and thus 6 h was selected for downstream experiments this was similar to the findings from a previous study where the maximum 2 6 dcbq concentration was obtained after a 5 h reaction of nom with chlorine kosaka et al 2017 the chlorination reaction was conducted in 250 ml glass bottles in a 25 0 1 0 c thermostatic incubator for 6 h twelve model phenol compounds were selected as the representative precursors with different functional groups 500 μm of each compound was reacted with 5 m chlorine in 100 ml solution at ph 7 0 0 2 for 6 h triplicate samples of the chlorinated compounds were subjected to uplc ms ms analysis to quantify hbqs generated using the method described in section 2 4 formic acid fa was used to quench chlorine in previous studies and 2 5 formic acid can completely quench chlorine at 1 3 mg l table s3 therefore hbqs were stabilized and the residual chlorine was quenched by 2 5 fa v v treatment for 60 min in our analyzed samples subsequently spe was used to extract and concentrate hbqs and nom in the sample according to reported methods huang et al 2013 briefly spe with waters oasis hlb cartridges 6 ml 200 mg per cartridge was used to extract hbqs from 200 ml samples and the details are described in text s3 the hbqs yields were calculated as the ratio of the generated hbqs to the initial doc concentration and expressed in ng mgc all of the conditions of hbqs formation experiments are summarized in table s4 meanwhile the chlorinated nom samples for the analysis of component changes were also pretreated via spe using an agilent bond elute ppl cartridge following the procedure described above to avoid any carryover during sample preparation spe extraction and sequential lc ms ms analysis control samples ultrapure water were prepared and analyzed along with the samples experiments were conducted in triplicate and the relative standard deviations were lower than 5 for all of the reported mean values 2 4 analysis of hbqs doc and molecular characteristic of nom hbqs were analyzed by an ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray triple quadrupole ion trap tandem mass spectrometer uplc esi qtrap ms ms waters uplc system qtrap 5500 sciex concord on canada in negative mode huang et al 2013 the spectrometer was equipped with a beh c18 column 2 1 100 mm i d 1 7 μm waters ireland and operated at 50 c eight hbqs were separated at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min within 18 min the instrument parameters are described in table s5 the method detection limits mdls of hbqs were in the range of 0 2 2 6 ng l and the recoveries were 69 96 table s6 the concentration of doc was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the specific uv absorbance suva at 285 nm suva285 and 254 nm suva254 were used to indicate the aromaticity of dom which were calculated as uv285 and uv254 divided by the doc of the solution the functional groups of nom were measured by ftir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo scientific co ltd waltham mass the concentration of residual chlorine was measured using a pocket colorimeter following the instruments instructions pocket colorimeter ⅱ analysis system hach the molecular composition of the nom was discerned by a qexactive plus mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma in negative mode all size fractionated and chlorinated samples were diluted with water and acetonitrile 40 60 and injected into the instrument directly at a flow rate of 100 μl min the analysis was conducted with a spray current of 4 5 kv in the mass range of 50 2000 to avoid cross contamination the injection system was washed with 500 μl acetonitrile between samples the formulas of identified peaks were predicted by using the trfu algorithm with a mass error of less than 2 ppm fu et al 2020 restrictive characteristics of molecules were set at 1 c 50 1 o n 5 s 2 p 1 0 3 h c 2 5 and 0 o c 1 2 similar to the general molecular characteristics of nom fu et al 2020 meanwhile the formulas were used in our study with oxygen subtracted double bond equivalents dbe o value eq 1 between 10 and 10 herzsprung et al 2014 plots of the carbon oxidation state cos eq 2 and dbe o c eq 3 served as indicators of the degrees of oxidation and unsaturation respectively the selected chemicals demonstrated in the van krevelen diagram can be categorized into seven components by the h c and o c ratios in molecular formulas fu et al 2020 liu et al 2020 kim et al 2003 the composition of each component is described in text s4 the mass peak intensities were normalized by the largest peak and calculated the percentage of all peaks in each compound by matlab 2019b 1 dbe o 1 0 5 2c h o 2 cos h 2o c 3 dbe o c 1 0 5 2c h o c where c h and o represent the number of carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a single formula spearman s rank correlations between hbqs yields and the intensity of seven components of six nom fractions as well as their correlations with the components of river water nom were calculated matlab 2019b and r were used for statistical analyses two tailed tests statistical significance p 0 05 2 5 derivatization of hbqs precursors to examine the contributions of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the generation of hbqs mei and dmso which can react with the two groups were applied to the nom samples fig s3 fujitake et al 2003 york and bell 2020 the following methylation was carried out in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks fujitake et al 2003 briefly 5 mg of sample was mixed with 5 ml of anhydrous dmso and then mixed with msc at a molar ratio of 0 5 10 mm under a stream of nitrogen the sample flask was sealed and ultra sonicated for 3 h and cooled on ice and then mei was added to the solution at a msc mei molar ratio of 1 1 3 the solution was warmed up to room temperature stirred for 4 to 12 h finally the solution was diluted in 15 ml deionized water evaporated with nitrogen gas until dmso disappeared and the solution was freeze dried details are described in text s5 the unintentionally generated nai during methylation reaction can react with ocl and thus had to be removed methylated nom was dissolved in 10 ml chloroform and passed through a membrane filter 0 22 µm ptfe millipore to remove nai the solution before and after filtration was dried and the weight difference represented the yield of methylated nom fujitake et al 2003 none of i was detected by ion exchange chromatography in the final solution the detection limit was 20 µg l to check the impact of filtration on the composition of samples 5 mg unmethylated nom as a control was treated along with the methylated samples during the filtration process finally the control nom and methylated nom were re dissolved in 50 ml deionized water the roles of aldehydes and ketones in generating hbqs were determined by deriving c o using grp liu et al 2020 the reaction mechanism is described in fig s3 1 mg nom was dissolved in 200 µl of 70 acetonitrile acetonitrile water 70 30 v v and mixed with 600 µl of 20 mm grp and 400 µl of 10 mm hcl in 70 acetonitrile text s6 the experiment was conducted at 50 c for 10 min finally the mixed solution was dried with nitrogen gas and re dissolved in 50 ml deionized water for chlorination both of the derivatives were diluted to 10 mg l for chlorination experiment meanwhile the reactions between derivatization reagents and chlorine may cause inaccuracy of the results we excluded the interference by mixing derivatization reagents with chlorine table s4 the results showed that none of hbqs were formed during chlorination process all of three derivatization reagents 10 mm were added to the 10 µg l hbqs to explore its effects on hbqs respectively as well as little loss of hbqs in the presence of derivatization reagents 3 results and discussion 3 1 hbqs generated by nom fractions with different molecular weight among the six mw fractions of nom hbqs generated by the 50 100 kda fraction 55 3 2 1 ng mgc and 100 kda fraction 46 6 1 7 ng mgc were significantly higher than those of the other four smaller mw fractions 3 1 14 4 folds higher p 0 05 fig 1 meanwhile all five hbqs were detected in the 50 100 kda and 100 kda fractions whereas the three smaller fractions generated only two hbqs namely 2 6 dcbq and tetrac 1 2 bq among all hbqs 2 6 dcbq was the most abundant and prevalent in line with the results of other studies on the frequency and concentration of 2 6 dcbq in real drinking water zhao et al 2012 lou et al 2021 in all tested source water samples the yields of hbqs in 50 kda fraction was significantly higher than that of 50 kda fraction p 0 05 fig s3 the van krevelen diagram displayed the h c and o c ratios of components in size fractionated nom fig 2 which ranged from 0 to 1 2 and 0 2 5 respectively for larger mw fractions 50 100 kda and 100 kda highly oxygen compounds hocs and lignin carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules crams like structures were dominant which accounted for over 50 of the whole components in 50 100 kda and 100 kda fractions fig s4 the o c and h c ratios of smaller mw fractions 3 10 kda and 3 kda otherwise were discontinuously distributed 0 o c 0 3 and 1 5 h c 2 0 and 0 1 o c 0 67 and 0 67 h c 1 5 these smaller mw components were featured by lipids like and lignin crams like structures components 80 in 3 10 kda and 3 kda fractions and hocs the third abundant components only accounted for 6 9 the distinct component in the larger mw fractions was hocs despite that we cannot entirely attribute the precursors of hbqs to hocs lignin crams like structures the major components of aquatic sediment and soil dom fu et al 2020 blackburn et al 2017 consisted of lignin derived and carboxylic rich alicyclic molecule cram structure components the cram components were likely to be aliphatic aldehydes ketones while the lignin derived compounds were considered to be aromatic aldehydes ketones they exhibited different properties with regard to hbqs generation potentials although lignin crams like structure components were abundant in all mw fractions the composition of each mw varied significantly as shown in fig s5 lignin crams like components detected in the above 50 kda fraction generally had a broad range of dbe o c and cos fig s5a while the below 30 kda fraction was characterized by negative dbe o c fig s5b as a result the correlation between hbqs and the whole of lignin crams like components deserved further investigation hocs were usually considered as tannin derived molecules li et al 2018b they were formed during the diagenetic processes of various organic matter kellerman et al 2014 2015 minor et al 2012 both of the two components were characterized as aromatic ring with functional groups which is the basic structure of hbqs previous study found that nom with mw 10 kda contained more aromatic structures than lower mw nom fraction 10 kda by using suva value he et al 2020 the conclusion was matched well with the distribution of aromatic compounds in different mw fractions thus deeper research on the relationship between the nom components and the formation of hbqs need to be further conducted 3 2 hbqs formation potentials of different nom components the distinct composition of different mw fractions in nom could lead to varied yields of hbqs each component of nom in the van krevelen diagram received a spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s with the generation of hbqs herzsprung et al 2012 fig 3 lignin crams like components demonstrated a strong correlation with the yields of hbqs r 0 79 p 0 01 hocs 0 67 o c 1 2 0 67 h c 1 5 were also prone to generate hbqs with a r value of 0 95 at p 0 01 while the correlations with lipids like carbohydrates like unsaturated hydrocarbons uh components aliphatic peptides like a p like and condensed aromatic structures as components were insignificant the significant correlation between hocs lignin crams like components and dbp formation also be observed for thms and haas during chlorination wang et al 2017 previous study has pointed that quinones can be formed by the oxidization of lignin structures copy and mcknight 2005 thus the oxidizing condition created by chlorination is favorable for hbqs generation the characteristic of hocs was rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups while phenol was the well studied precursors of hbqs zhao et al 2012 the information mentioned above may partly explain the strong correlation between the generation of hbqs and hocs lignin crams like structures taking our attention to the real river samples the significant correlations between hbqs generation and molecules in the hocs and lignin crams like components were also observed at p 0 05 fig s6 therefore hocs and lignin crams like play important roles in hbqs formation to validate the results the seven components of nom were acquired according to previous studies including bleached and hydrolysis of ha and exacts of peat soil details are described in text s7 stevenson 1994 chefetz et al 2002 kim et al 2003 sleighter and hatcher 2008 hocs generated the highest amount of hbqs 113 0 6 6 ng mgc followed by lignin crams like components 99 8 6 4 ng mgc a p and carbohydrates 7 2 0 3 ng mgc lipids like 1 4 0 1 ng mgc as 1 3 0 1 ng mgc and uh nd fig 4 therefore lignin crams like components and hocs also produced higher hbqs than other components these results verified that hocs and lignin crams like components were the major precursors of hbqs more detailed information of the structural and functional features of hbqs precursors deserved further investigation the formation of hbqs was closely related to the saturation and oxidation states of the precursors summarized the generation of hbqs from previous studies lignin crams like components and hocs also produced higher 2 6 dcbq than other components fig s7 zhao et al 2012 kosaka et al 2017 lou et al 2019 however the yields of hbqs by lignin crams like components were ranged from nd to 3 7 molar ratio the unique structural properties or functional groups of hbqs precursors deserved detailed investigations to better explain these differences in the yields of hbqs the saturation and oxidation states of the dominant components hoc molecules lignin crams like and lipids like components were measured by dbe o c and cos values respectively fig s8 compounds with positive dbe o c value represents an unsaturated state and positive cos represents an oxidation state hocs generally had positive cos and a broad range of dbe o c fig s8a while lipids were characterized by their negative cos fig s8b and lignin crams like components had positive dbe o c fig s8c the results underscored the different contributions of molecular structures in the formation of hbqs during drinking water chlorination dbps can formed via the addition reactions with unsaturated bonds or electrophilic substitution at nucleophilic sites phungsai et al 2018 thus selective reactions are inclined to occur at activated aromatic rings or cc double bonds during chlorination phungsai et al 2018 these structures are more commonly present in hocs and lignin crams like components leading to their relatively higher hbqs yields than other components in nom 3 3 functional groups contributing to hbqs formation potentials the functional groups of specific nom components significantly affect their photochemical and redox properties wenk et al 2013 the correlations between hbqs generation and functional groups of bigger hocs and lignin crams like and smaller lipids like nom components were revealed by ftir analysis fig s9 the distinct stretching peaks were identified at 1270 1250 cm 1 aromatic co and phenolic oh and 1710 cm 1 aromatic c o busin and guo 1999 indicating that oxygen containing functional groups were abundant in the lignin crams like components and hocs while the aromatic c o aromatic co and phenolic oh groups were not observed in the lipid like sample overall nom components with more phenolic oh and aromatic c o functional groups had relatively high hbq yields the c o is present in carboxyl aldehyde and ketone and oh is a part of carboxyl to verify the significance of oh and c o in hbqs formation during chlorination molecular tagging was developed to derivatize the four functional groups namely hydroxyl carboxyl aldehyde and ketone alkylated hydroxyl and carboxyl were derivatized by mei and msc and aldehydes and ketones were derivatized by grp reaction time temperature amount of mei msc and grp were optimized in detail to maximize the derivatization efficiency text s5 s6 and fig s10 s11 the weight of different nom components was set at 5 mg during optimization a maximum yield of derivatized nom was noticed when 6 mm msc and 4 mm mei were mixed for 6 h fig s10 the maximum derivatization efficiency of aldehydes and ketones was achieved by adding 6 ml of 20 mm grp and 4 ml of 5 mm hcl at 50 c for 10 min fig s11 the average yields of hbqs decreased from 29 7 ng mgc to 10 7 ng mgc after the derivatization of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the seven representative components of nom fig 5 only 2 6 dcbq and tetrac 1 2 bq were detected in the derived samples meanwhile 2 6 dcbq and tetrac 1 2 bq were the only two hbqs detected in the tea samples and chlorinated tea polyphenols samples lou et al 2019 this may be attributed to the more abundant precursors of 2 6 dcbq and tetrac 1 2 bq than other hbqs thus they are more prone to generate during chlorination a slight decrease of hbq yield was observed when aldehydes and ketones were substituted by hydrazones grp derivatives hbqs originated from lignin crams like and hocs decreased by 33 6 and 21 2 respectively while the derivatization of the other four components led to less hbqs reduction fig 5 aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl groups accounted for 90 7 100 of hbqs generated during chlorination of the seven components of nom the average yields of hbqs decreased from 25 3 ng mgc to 8 5 ng mgc after the derivatization of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in all six mw fractions of nom fig s12 the highest decrease of hbqs was observed in the mw fractions containing the highest amount of lignin crams like components and hocs the results were further confirmed by suva values which served as indicators of dbps formation potentials hou et al 2018 the uv254 value represents the extent of conjugation in the dissolved nom compounds the conjugated molecules can undergo numerous π π transitions at close to 254 nm workman 2001 e g quinones derived from the similar level of unsaturation compounds e g phenolic compounds the suva285 was an indicator of phenols and benzene carboxylic acids hou et al 2018 krasner et al 1996 fig s13 demonstrates suva254 and suva285 of the six mw fractions nom where the two values both ranked in an order of 100 kda 50 100 kda 30 50 kda 10 30 kda 3 kda 3 10 kda the results suggested that the suva values were positively correlated with mw we further demonstrated strong positive correlations between suva values suva254 and suva285 and hbqs fig s14 deducing that uv absorbing components especially those at 285 nm were primary precursors to hbqs the positive correlations between suva values and traditional disinfection products e g thms and haas have been discussed in previous studies roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 the results of ftir and molecular tagging collectively suggested that aromatic c o and phenolic oh were the most influential functional groups leading to the formation of hbqs during chlorination 3 4 the property of functional groups responsible for hbqs formation potentials the oxidation of phenolic compounds forms quinone structures and not surprisingly hydroxyl groups play important roles in hbq generation wenk et al 2013 however the reactivity of phenolic compounds can be affected by other substituent groups e g aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl groups criquet et al 2015 the significance of aldehydes ketones hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the formation of hbqs can be explained by the electronic property of those functional groups the electron density of the carbon double bonds of compounds with electron donating substitutes e g ch2 o and or is richer than that of molecules with electron withdrawing substituent groups e g cooh cho and coor phungsai et al 2019 the electron donating substituent groups accelerated the electrophilic aromatic substitution process yielding higher final dbps e g thms haas criquet et al 2015 whereas the electron withdrawing substituent groups potentially inhibited the complete oxidation of phenolic compounds resulting in the higher formation of quinones via electron transfer reactions criquet et al 2015 the hypothesis of the contribution of functional groups was confirmed by chlorinating twelve model precursors the highest yield of hbqs was 1 71 0 08 m m which was obtained from the chlorination of 4 hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester with coor fig 6 the average yields of hbqs formed in the chlorination of eight compounds with electron withdrawing substituent groups were 0 58 m m which was approximately 29 fold greater than that of four compounds with electron donating substituent groups 0 02 m m p 0 05 fig 6 taking our attention to compounds with functional groups mentioned in section 3 3 the yields of hbqs formed from 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and p hydroxybenzaldehyde 0 23 0 01 m m and 0 34 0 01 m m respectively were three magnitudes higher than that of hydroquinone and 4 methothyphenol 0 0004 0 00002 m m and 0 0006 0 00003 m m respectively thus there was clear evidence of functional groups that affect the generation of hbqs the four functional groups contributed to hbqs formation via different mechanisms where the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring was the major precursor as it oxidized to quinone and aldehydes ketones and carboxyl groups accelerated hbqs generation the derivatization process converted carboxyl aldehyde and ketone from electron withdrawing to electron donating which resulted in the reduction of hbqs for example 4 hydroxybenzoic acid produced 384 fold of hbqs compared to that of 4 methothyphenol kosaka et al have demonstrated a similar trend of 2 6 dcbq generation by chlorinating 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 methothyphenol for 1 h resulting in 230 times higher 2 6 dcbq formed in the 4 hydroxybenzoic acid samples than that of 4 methothyphenol samples kosaka et al 2017 thus functional groups play important roles in hbqs generation meanwhile the functional structures were also responsible for the varied hbqs yields of different mw nom the higher mw fraction 50 kda was rich in lignins and hocs fig s4 with more phenol hydroxyl groups and aromatic aldehydes ketones than the lower mw fraction in comparison the lower mw fraction 50 kda was occupied by uh and lipids fig s4 which were deficient in functional structures facilitating hbqs formation the results also stressed the importance of functional structures in hbqs generation which provided novel insights into the relationship of different size fractionated nom and dbps formation 4 conclusions and implications this study systemically unveiled the characteristics of hbqs precursors in nom in related to molecular weight composition and functional groups larger mw fractions 50 kda hocs and lignin cram like components were the primary precursors of hbqs the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were found essential to hbqs formation too these results provide more comprehensive insights into the molecular mechanism of hbqs formation by nom which will be helpful for the prediction of hbqs generation of different source water and the employment of more effective treatment technologies towards hbqs control at drinking water treatment plants technologies aiming to remove larger mw and high o c nom components such as coagulation nanofiltration or membrane filtration are desired the development of advanced oxidation processes eliminating specific hbqs precursors or altering the h c and o c ratios of hbqs precursors are also in need declaration of

16407,the stereoselective biotransformation of methamphetamine meth as a chiral compound during biological treatment in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is often ignored in this study a non racemic form of meth was detected in the raw influent of a full scale wwtp with s meth as the predominant enantiomer stereoselective biotransformation of meth in favor of s meth occurred in anaerobic anoxic and aerobic processes resulting in the detection of r meth as the only enantiomer in the secondary sedimentation tank to evaluate the stereoselective biotransformation of meth in an activated sludge system controlled laboratory experiments were conducted under aerobic and anaerobic conditions different stereoselective enrichment was observed in a racemic meth batch experiment at various initial concentrations batch experiment results with different initial concentrations of nutrient substances demonstrated that the biotransformation of s meth occurred simultaneously with the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n proving its cometabolism nature enzymes released under microbial starvation stress likely stimulated r meth biotransformation compared with the biotransformation rate of meth under the anaerobic condition the presence of dissolved oxygen led to a higher biotransformation rate of meth under the aerobic condition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methamphetamine activated sludge batch experiments stereoselective biotransformation cometabolism introduction pharmacologically active compounds pacs are released and carried in residual waters from households to

wastewater treatment duan et al 2021 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the toxic effect of enantiomers may be species dependent in aquatic environments macleod et al 2007 stanley et al 2007 for example an enrichment of fluoxetine with s enantiomer and propranolol with s enantiomer was observed in the effluent of the edmonton gold bar wwtp in canada macleod et al 2007 s fluoxetine was found to be 9 4 times more toxic to pimephales promelas than r fluoxetine stanley et al 2006 s propranolol was also found to have higher toxicity toward p promelas stanley et al 2007 in consideration of the difference in toxicity among enantiomers the stereoselective behavior of pacs in wwtps should be investigated methamphetamine meth is a common illicit drug and frequently detected in wwtps and receiving waters bishop et al 2020 du et al 2015 heuett et al 2015 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 meth contains one chiral center and exists in the form of two enantiomers several studies have investigated the enantiomeric profiling of meth in wastewater influent and effluent showing its varying nonracemic composition bagnall et al 2012 kasprzyk hordern et al 2010 wang et al 2021 for example wang et al 2021 reported that the concentrations of r meth and s meth in the wwtp influent were in the range of 2 9 ng l 13 0 ng l and 16 9 ng l 30 5 ng l respectively as to the wwtp effluent the s enantiomer was effectively removed and the concentration of r enantiomer did not change compared with that in the influent compared with the influent the enantiomeric fraction ef values varied from below 0 37 to almost 1 0 in the effluent however information describing the stereoselective behavior of meth during aerobic or anaerobic biological process in wwtps remains lacking evans et al 2016 undertook a full scale monitoring campaign in a wwtp and found an enrichment of meth with r enantiomer after sequencing batch biological treatment activated sludge microcosms were performed under an aerobic condition demonstrating that stereoselective microbial degradation favored s meth given that the stereoselective behavior of a chiral compound may differ under diverse redox conditions and that the stereoselective fate of meth under an anaerobic anoxic condition remains unclear a comprehensive investigation should be conducted to complement the stereoselective behavior of meth in wwtps harrison et al 2003 matamoros et al 2009 zipper et al 1999 in consideration of the continuous emission and unknown toxic effect that nonracemic meth may exert on aquatic organisms wang et al 2018 further studies are needed to understand the biotransformation mechanism on how microbial factors control the behavior of meth enantiomers in wwtps in this study a full scale wwtp employing an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process was selected and the stereoselective behavior of meth in individual biological treatment units was investigated activated sludge batch experiments were undertaken to observe the meth stereoselective biotransformation processes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the chiral metabolite of meth amphetamine amp was also monitored to reflect the stereoselective

sampling campaign was conducted for seven consecutive days in a full scale wwtp located in chaoyang district in beijing this wwtp utilized a2o technology integrating traditional activated sludge process biological nitrification and denitrification process and biological phosphorous removal process details of the investigated wwtp are shown in supplementary materials samples were collected in october of 2019 with a temperature range between 6 c and 18 c water samples were collected from the influent primary sedimentation tank anoxic tank aerobic tank and secondary sedimentation tank during the seven consecutive days activated sludge was also collected in the anoxic and aerobic tanks fig 1 all samples were stored in 1 l brown glass bottles at 4 c to reduce microbial activity and pretreated within 20 h seed sludge was collected from the recycled sludge tank in the wwtp the total suspended solid tss concentration of the seed sludge was 10 g l 2 3 activated sludge batch experiments activated sludge batch experiments were performed in 2 l continuously stirred reactors fed with 1 5 l of synthetic wastewater and 0 075 l of seed sludge the synthetic wastewater consisted of a mixture of sodium acetate ammonium chloride dipotassium hydrogen phosphate calcium chloride magnesium sulfate and trace elements table s2 and table s3 kampschreur et al 2007 to achieve complete nitrification and maintain the ph of batch experiments sufficient alkalinity 7 14 g of caco3 g nh4 n was provided by adding sodium bicarbonate for observing the meth stereoselective biotransformation processes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions batch experiments were performed through fixing a low nutrient load nl while keeping cod nh4 n inorganic p 100 5 1 standard work solutions of racemic meth were spiked to obtain the desired concentrations 2 and 10 μg l the final tss concentration in each batch experiment was 0 5 g l proper mixing was provided by a lab magnetic shaker running at 120 rpm initial ph was in the range of 8 3 8 6 the reactors were at controlled temperature 22 c 25 c and wrapped with aluminum to avoid light for the aerobic condition an air diffuser was used to keep dissolved oxygen do in the range of 7 8 mg l for the anaerobic condition n2 stripping 20 min was applied before the experiments and after each sampling and the reactors were immediately closed to guarantee oxygen absence for evaluating the meth stereoselective biotransformation mechanism batch experiments were performed under three conditions namely low nl medium nl and high nl the nutrient substances cod nh4 n and inorganic p in medium and high nl were 5 fold and 10 fold higher than those in low nl respectively table s2 standard work solutions of meth single isomer were spiked at a concentration of 10 μg l batch experiments with different concentrations of meth single isomer were also conducted in which meth single isomer was spiked at the concentrations of 5 10 20 and 100 μg l all batch experiments were performed under the aerobic condition the stability of meth was assessed in the reactor receiving no seed sludge and the meth adsorption experiment on activated sludge of 1 g l of sodium azide was used for sterilization bioreactor control experiments were also set in which reactors received seed sludge without meth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions meth stability and activated sludge adsorption experiments were conducted with 2 μg l of racemic meth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions after meth addition the reactors were stirred for 30 min for equilibration afterward 20 ml of liquid samples were collected at different time intervals 0 6 12 24 48 72 96 and 120 h the liquid samples were filtered through a glass microfiber filter followed with solid phase extraction after the 120 h reaction the sludge was centrifuged and lyophilized the lyophilized sludge was treated with the method described in supplementary materials all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 analytical methods tss cod nh4 n ph and temperature were measured in accordance with standard methods rice et al 2012 briefly tss was analyzed by measuring the weight difference of samples before and after drying in a 103 c 105 c oven cod and nh4 n were determined using open reflux and titrimetric methods respectively ph was measured using a ph meter leici shanghai china temperature was observed using a thermometer do was analyzed using a multiparameter hach hq40d with a luminescent optical probe liquid samples were treated with the method described in our previous study wang et al 2021 sludge samples were treated with the method described in supplementary materials in brief liquid samples were passed through solid phase extraction cartridges at a flow rate of 5 ml min six milliliters of 5 nh3 h2o was used to elute the cartridges the eluate was concentrated under a weak nitrogen stream at 40 c to near dryness and reconstituted to 1 ml with ultrapure water the samples were ready for chiral lc ms ms analysis after filtration with a 0 22 mm ptfe syringe filter activated sludge samples were centrifuged and lyophilized after 10 ml of 1 acetic acid in meoh was added the activated sludge was ultrasonic assisted extracted for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 4 c extraction was repeated one more time and the extracts were combined the extract was diluted filtered to remove solid particles and acidified to ph 2 the solution was ready for solid phase extraction the recoveries and validation parameters in the liquid and solid matrices are listed in table s4 all samples were analyzed by chiral lc ms ms performed on a waters acquity uplc system waters manchester uk chiral separation was conducted using a cbh column 100 2 mm 5 μm daicel tokyo japan which was run isocratically with 90 1 mm nh4oac ph 6 9 and 10 meoh at a rate of 0 15 ml min the column oven was maintained at 30 c and the injection volume was 20 μl 2 5 quantification and confirmation each enantiomer was quantified by multiple reaction monitoring mrm the mrm conditions and ions for each analyte are summarized in table s5 ef was used for describing chiral signatures in environmental analysis harner et al 2000 efs were calculated using the following equation 1 ef where ef denotes the enantiomeric fraction denotes the concentration of s enantiomer and denotes the concentration of r enantiomer in relation to the compounds targeted in this study ef 0 5 indicates an enrichment of s enantiomer and ef 0 5 indicates an excess of r enantiomer 2 6 kinetic studies of meth activated sludge batch experiments pseudo first order kinetics is typically used to model the micropollutant biotransformation in activated sludge reactors kennes veiga et al 2021 when applying pseudo first order kinetics in this work ln ct c0 plotted as a function of time yielded a straight line r2 0 9 the biotransformation kinetic constant kbiol l g h was therefore calculated using the following equation 2 ln c t c 0 k biol tss t where t denotes the reaction time h ct denotes the concentration at time point t μg l c0 is the initial concentration μg l and tss which is 0 5 g l in this work denotes the concentration of total suspended solid g l 3 results and discussion 3 1 enantiomeric profiling of meth in a full scale wwtp wastewater influent samples in seven consecutive days showed consistent detection of meth with an average concentration of 31 6 ng l fig 2 the highest meth concentration was determined in the sunday sample up to 44 ng l which was expected from its high consumption at the weekend an average ef value of 0 73 0 11 indicated that s enantiomer was predominant in the influent which was in accordance with previous studies wang et al 2021 xu et al 2017 the drug persisted through the primary sedimentation tank with an average concentration of 28 4 ng l and an average ef value of 0 66 0 13 after the anaerobic and anoxic treatment the concentration and ef value drastically dropped with an average concentration of 12 2 ng l and an average ef value of 0 15 0 10 indicating its stereoselective biotransformation and enrichment with r enantiomer the meth average concentration and ef value at the end of the aerobic tank were 12 2 ng l and 0 10 0 07 respectively which were similar to those at the end of the anoxic tank in the secondary sedimentation tank the meth average concentration was 10 1 ng l and the average ef value was zero indicating that s enantiomer was not detected at the sampling point removal of micropollutants was associated with their volatilization sorption to the sludge and biotransformation volatilization can be neglected when a compound has a henry s constant hc below 10 pa m3 mol and its hc kow henry s constant divided by the octanol water partition coefficient is lower than 10 4 ltd i c consultants 2001 the hc of meth is 0 24 pa m3 mol table s1 and hc kow of meth equals to 2 6 10 4 which is close to 10 4 suggesting its negligible volatilization adsorption and biotransformation were considered for meth removal in this study compared with the concentration of 23 5 ng l in the influent the concentration of s enantiomer slightly decreased to 18 3 ng l after primary treatment figure s1 after anaerobic and anoxic processes the average removal efficiency of s meth reached 90 8 after an aerobic process the removal efficiency of s meth reached 93 5 in this sampling campaign anaerobic and anoxic processes governed the removal of s meth and the aerobic process also contributed to the removal of s meth minimally the average concentration of r enantiomer in each sampling point was 9 4 10 4 10 1 11 1 and 10 1 ng l which showed the recalcitrant nature of r enantiomer the adsorption amounts of meth enantiomers onto activated sludge during these two biological processes were also monitored table s6 in the anoxic tank the concentrations of r meth and s meth were in the range of 0 34 0 81 ng g and 1 22 2 12 ng g respectively the concentrations of r meth and s meth in the aerobic tank fell in the range of 0 36 0 87 ng g and 1 37 2 01 ng g respectively the average ef values in anoxic and aerobic tanks were 0 76 0 0 3 and 0 74 0 07 respectively which were higher than 0 5 this result was likely related to the fact that s meth was the predominant enantiomer in wastewater of china wang et al 2021 xu et al 2017 although many papers have reported the stereoselective occurrence of meth before and after biological treatment in wwtps evans et al 2017 2016 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 few studies have focused on the stereoselective fate of meth in individual biological treatment compartments in a full scale wwtp as far as we know this is the first report on enantiomeric profiling of the fate of meth in individual biological treatment units in a full scale wwtp meth would present in effluent and its receiving water in nonracemic composition 3 2 enantioselective biotransformation in activated sludge batch experiments 3 2 1 removal of racemic meth under abiotic conditions as shown in figure s2 meth enantiomers showed no pronounced elimination during the 120 h sampling period in the stability experiments before the adsorption experiments the enantiomer concentration in seed sludge was monitored r enantiomer and s enantiomer in activated sludge were 0 48 0 03 ng g and 1 89 0 16 ng g respectively table s7 in the adsorption experiments r enantiomer was 74 29 7 48 ng g and s enantiomer was 75 28 7 47 ng g in activated sludge after the 120 h adsorption process table s7 which accounted for 3 71 and 3 76 of the initial spiked amounts respectively meth enantiomers showed no pronounced adsorption onto activated sludge this result agreed with the high solubility of meth logkow 2 95 bagnall et al 2013 baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 evans et al 2016 because the enantiomers of a chiral compound have identical physicochemical characteristics such as logkow value no stereoselectivity was observed under abiotic conditions e g stability and adsorption properties the concentration of meth in these two experiments deviated no more than 20 in consideration of all abiotic processes the removal of meth in batch experiments would be attributed to its biotransformation 3 2 2 biotransformation of racemic meth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions biotransformation of racemic meth was evaluated at 2 and 10 μg l for 2 μg l of racemic meth after 120 h reaction all meth was eliminated under the aerobic condition whereas 23 of meth was left under the anaerobic condition fig 3 a this result indicated that do was essential for eliminating meth ef value changed rapidly from the initial 0 50 to zero after 48 h under the aerobic condition and decreased from 0 50 to 0 12 after 120 h under the anaerobic condition showing that s enantiomer was preferentially biotransformed evans et al 2016 investigated the biotransformation of four amphetamine like compounds in activated sludge microcosms they observed that s enantiomer was preferentially transformed by microorganisms as shown in fig 3b after 120 h treatment meth at 10 μg l was eliminated under the aerobic condition whereas 40 of meth remained under the anaerobic condition the ef values at 10 μg l of meth increased from 0 50 to 0 73 after 96 h under aerobic condition and from 0 50 to 0 79 after 120 h under anaerobic condition which was opposite to the ef change at 2 μg l the opposite trend of the ef variation was likely due to the different degradation rates of the two enantiomers at high and low initial concentrations the concentrations of both enantiomers with the reaction time under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were listed in table s8 s enantiomer was not detectable concentration 0 at the time of 48 h under aerobic condition resulting in the ef 0 at 48 h despite of the detectable r enantiomer at 96 h at 10 μg l of meth the degradation rate of s enantiomer kbiol 0 05 l g h was lower than that at 2 μg l kbiol 0 119 l g h while the degradation rate of r enantiomer was quite stable at low and high initial concentrations kbiol values of 0 071 l g h at 2 μg l and 0 075 l g h at 10 μg l which led to the decreasing ef at 2 μg l and increasing ef at 10 μg l the concentration of meth adsorbed onto activated sludge after experiment was also measured as shown in table s7 after 120 h reaction the amounts of r enantiomer and s enantiomer adsorbed onto activated sludge were in the range of 0 17 0 99 and 0 16 2 70 respectively compared with the initial spiked amounts this result proved again adsorption could be considered negligible baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 evans et al 2016 in accordance with a previous study amp was a main metabolite of meth wang et al 2018 in the present study amp was detected in all experimental processes figure s3 fast generation and degradation of amp were observed under the aerobic condition amp is easily degraded by microbes bagnall et al 2013 an amp concentration of 101 57 ng l with an average ef value of 0 76 0 13 was obtained after 120 h period at 10 μg l of meth under the anaerobic condition the stereoselective enrichments of amp during 120 h treatments were consistent with those of meth in all cases this result was expected because meth enantiomers were exclusively metabolized into amp enantiomers evans et al 2016 r amp and s amp were also detected in activated sludge at 10 μg l of racemic meth under the anaerobic condition the average concentrations were 4 01 3 55 ng g and 8 84 1 34 ng g for r amp and s amp respectively and the average ef value was 0 72 0 17 table s7 this ef value was similar to that of adsorbed meth on the activated sludge 0 76 0 10 verifying that meth enantiomers were exclusively metabolized into amp enantiomers 3 2 3 biotransformation of meth single isomers single isomer batch experiments were conducted to observe if the variations in microbial activity affected the meth biotransformation kinetics under three nutrient conditions enantiomerization or racemization did not occur during these batch experiments investigating the biodegradation of nutrient substances cod nh4 n can help understand the fate of micropollutants in biological treatment processes the results of cod removal are illustrated in figure s4a at the time of 24 h cod was fully consumed 80 90 and concentrations remained constant after 24 h at three nutrient levels this result indicated that higher microbial activities of biomass were achieved to biodegrade 10 and 5 fold cod under high and medium nl conditions respectively compared with the microbial activity of the biomass to biodegrade cod under a low nl condition it also applied to nh4 n removal as shown in figure s4b at all three nutrient levels over 70 of nh4 n elimination was observed at 24 h and up to 80 at 48 h as for s meth after 120 h period 13 3 5 0 6 5 0 4 and 2 9 3 4 were left under low medium and high nl conditions respectively fig 4 a this result showed that the biotransformation rate of s meth also increased as the microbial activities of biomass increased the results of figure s4 and fig 4a indicated that the biotransformation of s meth occurred simultaneously with the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n during the 120 h period a high microbial activity of biomass to biodegrade nutrient substances led to a high s meth biotransformation rate proving cometabolism as the main mechanism behind the biotransformation of s meth kennes veiga et al 2021 king et al 1997 given that micropollutants are often present at trace concentrations they may not be used as the sole sources of carbon and energy for microbial metabolism the induction of enzymes may be responsible for their biotransformation cometabolism has also been reported as crucial for their biodegradation mazioti et al 2015 nzila 2013 tran et al 2013 the cometabolic capacities of microorganisms can lead to the fortuitous transformation of recalcitrant contaminants that cannot be efficiently used as growth substrates converting recalcitrant contaminants into degradation products jointly with oxygen gained electrons however the contribution of heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrifying activities to the biotransformation of s meth was not distinct strictly given that sodium acetate was the dominant primary substrate heterotrophic bacteria may be involved in the removal of s meth kennes veiga et al 2021 the positive effect of heterotrophic metabolism on the biotransformation of multiple micropollutants has been previously reported alvarino et al 2018 fernandez fontaina et al 2016 larcher and yargeau 2013 nguyen et al 2019 kbiol of a compound depends on its physicochemical properties and environmental conditions temperature ph oxidation reduction potential etc kennes veiga et al 2021 found that the specific activity of sludge caused by the primary substrate also affected the value of kbiol a positive correlation was observed between kbiol and the maximum cod specific activity for all nonrecalcitrant micropollutants kennes veiga et al 2021 the maximum cod specific activity is calculated through dividing the amount of cod consumed where the slope is maximum per the time required for that consumption and the tss present in the reactor at that moment in this study a positive correlation between kbiol of s meth and the maximum cod specific activity was observed figure s5 this finding suggested that the main driver during the s meth biotransformation in batch experiments was probably the primary carbon due to cometabolism fig 4b shows the r meth biotransformation profiles under three nl conditions at the time of 12 h the proportions of residual r meth were 82 5 7 0 87 5 0 4 and 77 8 14 0 under low medium and high nl conditions respectively at the time of 24 h the proportion of residual r meth rapidly dropped to 46 2 10 7 8 8 3 0 and 13 3 7 9 at low medium and high nl respectively this result implied that biotransformation rate of r meth increased after 12 h under a low nl condition 8 7 10 5 of r meth was left on the contrary r meth was totally biodegraded under medium and high nl conditions at 48 h the typical pseudo first order kinetics therefore could not apply to the biotransformation kinetics of r meth to explore the mechanism governing the biotransformation of r meth further batch experiments with different concentrations of meth single isomer were conducted as illustrated in fig 5 a the residual r meth was higher than 80 under different concentration conditions at 24 h and then rapidly dropped to below 50 at 48 h in all cases in consideration of the biodegradation profiles of nutrient substances the changed biotransformation rates of r meth may be related to the change in microbial state microorganisms were starving after the runout of nutrient substances after approximately 24 h figure s4 and low nutrient conditions were conducive to multiple substrate utilization benner et al 2013 egli 2010 in activated sludge batch experiments after the nutrient substances were consumed the tss decreased continuously including the biodegradability of extracellular polymeric substance eps and the microbial cells lysed habermacher et al 2016 eps bound and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities possess high metabolic potential to biodegrade micropollutants zumstein et al 2019 krah et al 2016 the activity of eps bound enzymes located in the sludge floc matrix or intracellular enzymes might be of pivotal importance for the elimination of r meth biotransformation of s meth followed the pseudo first order kinetics fig 5b with the pseudo first order kinetic constants shown in table 1 no significant difference existed among kbiol values of experiments at 10 μg l of racemic meth 5 μg l of s meth 10 μg l of s meth and 20 μg l of s meth under an aerobic conditions or between 10 μg l racemic meth and 5 μg l s meth under an aerobic condition kbiol of 2 μg l of racemic meth under the aerobic condition was 0 124 l g h which was comparative to the result by evans et al 2016 0 20 l g h the concentrations of amp under different nl conditions were also monitored validating its fast generation and elimination figure s6 as for the anaerobic condition the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n was also measured as shown in figure s7 the activity of biomass to biodegrade cod and nh4 n under the anaerobic condition was less than that under the aerobic condition in sum presence of do in batch experiments could enhance the biomass activity and activated sludge digestion rate to accelerate the biotransformation of meth 4 conclusions the stereoselective fate of meth in a full scale wwtp was investigated in this study the occurrence of meth in influent was in a nonracemic form with excess s enantiomer during the biological treatment s enantiomer was eliminated and the ef value drastically dropped indicating its stereoselective enrichment with r enantiomer after the secondary treatment process all s enantiomer was removed and the concentration of r enantiomer was comparative to that in the influent showing its recalcitrant nature racemic meth activated sludge batch experiments showed different stereoselective enrichment of meth isomer under 2 and 10 μg l conditions the biotransformation of s meth occurred simultaneously with the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n suggesting its cometabolism nature compared with the biotransformation rate of meth under an anaerobic condition the presence of do enhanced the activity of biomass and accelerated activated sludge digestion leading to a higher biotransformation rate of meth under an aerobic condition declaration of

16407,the stereoselective biotransformation of methamphetamine meth as a chiral compound during biological treatment in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is often ignored in this study a non racemic form of meth was detected in the raw influent of a full scale wwtp with s meth as the predominant enantiomer stereoselective biotransformation of meth in favor of s meth occurred in anaerobic anoxic and aerobic processes resulting in the detection of r meth as the only enantiomer in the secondary sedimentation tank to evaluate the stereoselective biotransformation of meth in an activated sludge system controlled laboratory experiments were conducted under aerobic and anaerobic conditions different stereoselective enrichment was observed in a racemic meth batch experiment at various initial concentrations batch experiment results with different initial concentrations of nutrient substances demonstrated that the biotransformation of s meth occurred simultaneously with the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n proving its cometabolism nature enzymes released under microbial starvation stress likely stimulated r meth biotransformation compared with the biotransformation rate of meth under the anaerobic condition the presence of dissolved oxygen led to a higher biotransformation rate of meth under the aerobic condition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methamphetamine activated sludge batch experiments stereoselective biotransformation cometabolism introduction pharmacologically active compounds pacs are released and carried in residual waters from households to wastewater treatment plants wwtps over half of pharmaceuticals in use are chiral and enantiomers of the same drug have identical physicochemical properties but interact differently with a biologically mediated environment kasprzyk hordern 2010 few papers have reported that chiral pacs were found in varying nonracemic forms in wwtp influent effluent and underwent stereoselective enrichment during wastewater treatment duan et al 2021 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the toxic effect of enantiomers may be species dependent in aquatic environments macleod et al 2007 stanley et al 2007 for example an enrichment of fluoxetine with s enantiomer and propranolol with s enantiomer was observed in the effluent of the edmonton gold bar wwtp in canada macleod et al 2007 s fluoxetine was found to be 9 4 times more toxic to pimephales promelas than r fluoxetine stanley et al 2006 s propranolol was also found to have higher toxicity toward p promelas stanley et al 2007 in consideration of the difference in toxicity among enantiomers the stereoselective behavior of pacs in wwtps should be investigated methamphetamine meth is a common illicit drug and frequently detected in wwtps and receiving waters bishop et al 2020 du et al 2015 heuett et al 2015 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 meth contains one chiral center and exists in the form of two enantiomers several studies have investigated the enantiomeric profiling of meth in wastewater influent and effluent showing its varying nonracemic composition bagnall et al 2012 kasprzyk hordern et al 2010 wang et al 2021 for example wang et al 2021 reported that the concentrations of r meth and s meth in the wwtp influent were in the range of 2 9 ng l 13 0 ng l and 16 9 ng l 30 5 ng l respectively as to the wwtp effluent the s enantiomer was effectively removed and the concentration of r enantiomer did not change compared with that in the influent compared with the influent the enantiomeric fraction ef values varied from below 0 37 to almost 1 0 in the effluent however information describing the stereoselective behavior of meth during aerobic or anaerobic biological process in wwtps remains lacking evans et al 2016 undertook a full scale monitoring campaign in a wwtp and found an enrichment of meth with r enantiomer after sequencing batch biological treatment activated sludge microcosms were performed under an aerobic condition demonstrating that stereoselective microbial degradation favored s meth given that the stereoselective behavior of a chiral compound may differ under diverse redox conditions and that the stereoselective fate of meth under an anaerobic anoxic condition remains unclear a comprehensive investigation should be conducted to complement the stereoselective behavior of meth in wwtps harrison et al 2003 matamoros et al 2009 zipper et al 1999 in consideration of the continuous emission and unknown toxic effect that nonracemic meth may exert on aquatic organisms wang et al 2018 further studies are needed to understand the biotransformation mechanism on how microbial factors control the behavior of meth enantiomers in wwtps in this study a full scale wwtp employing an

sampling campaign was conducted for seven consecutive days in a full scale wwtp located in chaoyang district in beijing this wwtp utilized a2o technology integrating traditional activated sludge process biological nitrification and denitrification process and biological phosphorous removal process details of the investigated wwtp are shown in supplementary materials samples were collected in october of 2019 with a temperature range between 6 c and 18 c water samples were collected from the influent primary sedimentation tank anoxic tank aerobic tank and secondary sedimentation tank during the seven consecutive days activated sludge was also collected in the anoxic and aerobic tanks fig 1 all samples were stored in 1 l brown glass bottles at 4 c to reduce microbial activity and pretreated within 20 h seed sludge was collected from the recycled sludge tank in the wwtp the total suspended solid tss concentration of the seed sludge was 10 g l 2 3 activated sludge batch experiments activated sludge batch experiments were performed in 2 l continuously stirred reactors fed with 1 5 l of synthetic wastewater and 0 075 l of seed sludge the synthetic wastewater consisted of a mixture of sodium acetate ammonium chloride dipotassium hydrogen phosphate calcium chloride magnesium sulfate and trace elements table s2 and table s3 kampschreur et al 2007 to achieve complete nitrification and maintain the ph of batch experiments sufficient alkalinity 7 14 g of caco3 g nh4 n was provided by adding sodium bicarbonate for observing the meth stereoselective biotransformation

dissolved oxygen do in the range of 7 8 mg l for the anaerobic condition n2 stripping 20 min was applied before the experiments and after each sampling and the reactors were immediately closed to guarantee oxygen absence for evaluating the meth stereoselective biotransformation mechanism batch experiments were performed under three conditions namely low nl medium nl and high nl the nutrient substances cod nh4 n and inorganic p in medium and high nl were 5 fold and 10 fold higher than those in low nl respectively table s2 standard work solutions of meth single isomer were spiked at a concentration of 10 μg l batch experiments with different concentrations of meth single isomer were also conducted in which meth single isomer was spiked at the concentrations of 5 10 20 and 100 μg l all batch experiments were performed under the aerobic condition the stability of meth was assessed in the reactor receiving no seed sludge and the meth adsorption experiment on activated sludge of 1 g l of sodium azide was used for sterilization bioreactor control experiments were also set in which reactors received seed sludge without meth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions meth stability and activated sludge adsorption experiments were conducted with 2 μg l of racemic meth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions after meth addition the reactors were stirred for 30 min for equilibration afterward 20 ml of liquid samples were collected at different time intervals 0 6 12 24 48 72 96 and 120 h the liquid samples were filtered through a glass microfiber filter followed with solid phase extraction after the 120 h reaction the sludge was centrifuged and lyophilized the lyophilized sludge was treated with the method described in supplementary materials all experiments were performed in

temperature was observed using a thermometer do was analyzed using a multiparameter hach hq40d with a luminescent optical probe liquid samples were treated with the method described in our previous study wang et al 2021 sludge samples were treated with the method described in supplementary materials in brief liquid samples were passed through solid phase extraction cartridges at a flow rate of 5 ml min six milliliters of 5 nh3 h2o was used to elute the cartridges the eluate was concentrated under a weak nitrogen stream at 40 c to near dryness and reconstituted to 1 ml with ultrapure water the samples were ready for chiral lc ms ms analysis after filtration with a 0 22 mm ptfe syringe filter activated sludge samples were centrifuged and lyophilized after 10 ml of 1 acetic acid in meoh was added the activated sludge was ultrasonic assisted extracted for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 4 c extraction was repeated one more time and the extracts were combined the extract was diluted filtered to remove solid particles and acidified to ph 2 the solution was ready for solid phase extraction the recoveries and validation parameters in the liquid and solid matrices are listed in table

enantiomer was quantified by multiple reaction monitoring mrm the mrm conditions and ions for each analyte are summarized in table s5 ef was used for describing chiral signatures in environmental analysis harner et al 2000 efs were calculated using the following equation 1 ef where ef denotes the enantiomeric fraction denotes the concentration of s enantiomer and denotes the concentration of r enantiomer in relation to the compounds targeted in this study ef 0 5 indicates an enrichment of s enantiomer and ef 0 5 indicates an excess of r enantiomer 2 6 kinetic studies of meth activated sludge batch experiments pseudo first order kinetics is typically used to model the micropollutant biotransformation in activated sludge reactors kennes veiga et al 2021 when applying pseudo first order kinetics in this work ln ct c0 plotted as a function of time yielded a straight line r2 0 9 the biotransformation kinetic constant kbiol l g h was therefore calculated using the following equation 2 ln c t c 0 k biol tss t where t denotes the reaction time h ct denotes the concentration at time point t μg l c0 is the initial concentration μg l and tss which is 0 5 g l in this work denotes the concentration of total suspended solid g l 3 results and discussion 3 1 enantiomeric profiling of meth in a full scale wwtp wastewater influent samples in seven consecutive days showed consistent detection of meth with an average concentration of 31 6 ng l fig 2 the highest meth concentration was determined in the sunday sample up to 44 ng l which was expected from its high consumption at the weekend an average ef value of 0 73 0 11 indicated that s enantiomer was predominant in the influent which was in accordance with previous studies wang et al 2021 xu et al 2017 the drug persisted through the primary sedimentation tank with an average concentration of 28 4 ng l and an average ef value of 0 66 0 13 after the anaerobic and anoxic treatment the concentration and ef value drastically dropped with an average concentration of 12 2 ng l and an average ef value of 0 15 0 10 indicating its stereoselective biotransformation and enrichment with r enantiomer the meth average concentration and ef value at the end of the aerobic tank were 12 2 ng l and 0 10 0 07 respectively which were similar to those at the end of the anoxic tank in the secondary sedimentation tank the meth average concentration was 10 1 ng l and the average ef value was zero indicating that s enantiomer was not detected at the sampling point removal of micropollutants was associated with their volatilization sorption to the sludge and biotransformation volatilization can be neglected when a compound has a henry s constant hc below 10 pa m3 mol and its hc kow henry s constant divided by the octanol water partition coefficient is lower than 10 4 ltd i c consultants 2001 the hc of meth is 0 24 pa m3 mol table s1 and hc kow of meth equals to 2 6 10 4 which is close to 10 4 suggesting its negligible volatilization adsorption and biotransformation were considered for meth removal in this study compared with the concentration of 23 5 ng l in the influent the concentration of s enantiomer slightly decreased to 18 3 ng l after primary treatment figure s1 after anaerobic and anoxic processes the average removal efficiency of s meth reached 90 8 after an aerobic process the removal efficiency of s meth reached 93 5 in this sampling campaign anaerobic and anoxic processes governed the removal of s meth and the aerobic process also contributed to the removal of s meth minimally the average concentration of r enantiomer in each sampling point was 9 4 10 4 10 1 11 1 and 10 1 ng l which showed the recalcitrant nature of r enantiomer the adsorption amounts of meth enantiomers onto activated sludge during these two biological processes were also monitored table s6 in the anoxic tank the concentrations of r meth and s meth were in the range of 0 34 0 81 ng g and 1 22 2 12 ng g respectively the concentrations of r meth and s meth in the aerobic tank fell in the range of 0 36 0 87 ng g and 1 37 2 01 ng g respectively the average ef values in anoxic and aerobic tanks were 0 76 0 0 3 and 0 74 0 07 respectively which were higher than 0 5 this result was likely related to the fact that s meth was the predominant enantiomer in wastewater of china wang et al 2021 xu et al 2017 although many papers have reported the stereoselective occurrence of meth before and after biological treatment in wwtps evans et al 2017 2016 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 few studies have focused on the stereoselective fate of meth in individual biological treatment compartments in a full scale wwtp as far as we know this is the first report on enantiomeric profiling of the fate of meth in individual biological treatment units in a full scale wwtp meth would present in effluent and its receiving water in nonracemic composition 3 2 enantioselective biotransformation in activated sludge batch experiments 3 2 1 removal of racemic meth under abiotic conditions as shown in figure s2 meth enantiomers showed no pronounced elimination during the 120 h sampling period in the stability experiments before the adsorption experiments the enantiomer concentration in seed sludge was monitored r enantiomer and s enantiomer in activated sludge were 0 48 0 03 ng g and 1 89 0 16 ng g respectively table s7 in the adsorption experiments r enantiomer was 74 29 7 48 ng g and s enantiomer was 75 28 7 47 ng g in activated sludge after the 120 h adsorption process table s7 which accounted for 3 71 and 3 76 of the initial spiked amounts respectively meth enantiomers showed no pronounced adsorption onto activated sludge this result agreed with the high solubility of meth logkow 2 95 bagnall et al 2013 baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 evans et al 2016 because the enantiomers of a chiral compound have identical physicochemical characteristics such as logkow value no stereoselectivity was observed under abiotic conditions e g stability and adsorption properties the concentration of meth in these two experiments deviated no more than 20 in consideration of all abiotic processes the removal of meth in batch experiments would be attributed to its biotransformation 3 2 2 biotransformation of racemic meth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions biotransformation of racemic meth was evaluated at 2 and 10 μg l for 2 μg l of racemic meth after 120 h reaction all meth was eliminated under the aerobic condition whereas 23 of meth was left under the anaerobic condition fig 3 a this result indicated that do was essential for eliminating meth ef value changed rapidly from the initial 0 50 to zero after 48 h under the aerobic condition and decreased from 0 50 to 0 12 after 120 h under the anaerobic condition showing that s enantiomer was preferentially biotransformed evans et al 2016 investigated the biotransformation of four amphetamine like compounds in activated sludge microcosms they observed that s enantiomer was preferentially transformed by microorganisms as shown in fig 3b after 120 h treatment meth at 10 μg l was eliminated under the aerobic condition whereas 40 of meth remained under the anaerobic condition the ef values at 10 μg l of meth increased from 0 50 to 0 73 after 96 h under aerobic condition and from 0 50 to 0 79 after 120 h under anaerobic condition which was opposite to the ef change at 2 μg l the opposite trend of the ef variation was likely due to the different degradation rates of the two enantiomers at high and low initial concentrations the concentrations of both enantiomers with the reaction time under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were listed in table s8 s enantiomer was not detectable concentration 0 at the time of 48 h under aerobic condition resulting in the ef 0 at 48 h despite of the detectable r enantiomer at 96 h at 10 μg l of meth the degradation rate of s enantiomer kbiol 0 05 l g h was lower than that at 2 μg l kbiol 0 119 l g h while the degradation rate of r enantiomer was quite stable at low and high initial concentrations kbiol values of 0 071 l g h at 2 μg l and 0 075 l g h at 10 μg l which led to the decreasing ef at 2 μg l and increasing ef at 10 μg l the concentration of meth adsorbed onto activated sludge after experiment was also measured as shown in table s7 after 120 h reaction the amounts of r enantiomer and s enantiomer adsorbed onto activated sludge were in the range of 0 17 0 99 and 0 16 2 70 respectively compared with the initial spiked amounts this result proved again adsorption could be considered negligible baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 evans et al 2016 in accordance with a previous study amp was a main metabolite of meth wang et al 2018 in the present study amp was detected in all experimental processes figure s3 fast generation and degradation of amp were observed under the aerobic condition amp is easily degraded by microbes bagnall et al 2013 an amp concentration of 101 57 ng l with an average ef value of 0 76 0 13 was obtained after 120 h period at 10 μg l of meth under the anaerobic condition the stereoselective enrichments of amp during 120 h treatments were consistent with those of meth in all cases this result was expected because meth enantiomers were exclusively metabolized into amp enantiomers evans et al 2016 r amp and s amp were also detected in activated sludge at 10 μg l of racemic meth under the anaerobic condition the average concentrations were 4 01 3 55 ng g and 8 84 1 34 ng g for r amp and s amp respectively and the average ef value was 0 72 0 17 table s7 this ef value was similar to that of adsorbed meth on the activated sludge 0 76 0 10 verifying that meth enantiomers were exclusively metabolized into amp enantiomers 3 2 3 biotransformation of meth single isomers single isomer batch experiments were conducted to observe if the variations in microbial activity affected the meth biotransformation kinetics under three nutrient conditions enantiomerization or racemization did not occur during these batch experiments investigating the biodegradation of nutrient substances cod nh4 n can help understand the fate of micropollutants in biological treatment processes the results of cod removal are illustrated in figure s4a at the time of 24 h cod was fully consumed 80 90 and concentrations remained constant after 24 h at three nutrient levels this result indicated that higher microbial activities of biomass were achieved to biodegrade 10 and 5 fold cod under high and medium nl conditions respectively compared with the microbial activity of the biomass to biodegrade cod under a low nl condition it also applied to nh4 n removal as shown in figure s4b at all three nutrient levels over 70 of nh4 n elimination was observed at 24 h and up to 80 at 48 h as for s meth after 120 h period 13 3 5 0 6 5 0 4 and 2 9 3 4 were left under low medium and high nl conditions respectively fig 4 a this result showed that the biotransformation rate of s meth also increased as the microbial activities of biomass increased the results of figure s4 and fig 4a indicated that the biotransformation of s meth occurred simultaneously with the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n during the 120 h period a high microbial activity of biomass to biodegrade nutrient substances led to a high s meth biotransformation rate proving cometabolism as the main mechanism behind the biotransformation of s meth kennes veiga et al 2021 king et al 1997 given that micropollutants are often present at trace concentrations they may not be used as the sole sources of carbon and energy for microbial metabolism the induction of enzymes may be responsible for their biotransformation cometabolism has also been reported as crucial for their biodegradation mazioti et al 2015 nzila 2013 tran et al 2013 the cometabolic capacities of microorganisms can lead to the fortuitous transformation of recalcitrant contaminants that cannot be efficiently used as growth substrates converting recalcitrant contaminants into degradation products jointly with oxygen gained electrons however the contribution of heterotrophic and autotrophic nitrifying activities to the biotransformation of s meth was not distinct strictly given that sodium acetate was the dominant primary substrate heterotrophic bacteria may be involved in the removal of s meth kennes veiga et al 2021 the positive effect of heterotrophic metabolism on the biotransformation of multiple micropollutants has been previously reported alvarino et al 2018 fernandez fontaina et al 2016 larcher and yargeau 2013 nguyen et al 2019 kbiol of a compound depends on its physicochemical properties and environmental conditions temperature ph oxidation reduction potential etc kennes veiga et al 2021 found that the specific activity of sludge caused by the primary substrate also affected the value of kbiol a positive correlation was observed between kbiol and the maximum cod specific activity for all nonrecalcitrant micropollutants kennes veiga et al 2021 the maximum cod specific activity is calculated through dividing the amount of cod consumed where the slope is maximum per the time required for that consumption and the tss present in the reactor at that moment in this study a positive correlation between kbiol of s meth and the maximum cod specific activity was observed figure s5 this finding suggested that the main driver during the s meth biotransformation in batch experiments was probably the primary carbon due to cometabolism fig 4b shows the r meth biotransformation profiles under three nl conditions at the time of 12 h the proportions of residual r meth were 82 5 7 0 87 5 0 4 and 77 8 14 0 under low medium and high nl conditions respectively at the time of 24 h the proportion of residual r meth rapidly dropped to 46 2 10 7 8 8 3 0 and 13 3 7 9 at low medium and high nl respectively this result implied that biotransformation rate of r meth increased after 12 h under a low nl condition 8 7 10 5 of r meth was left on the contrary r meth was totally biodegraded under medium and high nl conditions at 48 h the typical pseudo first order kinetics therefore could not apply to the biotransformation kinetics of r meth to explore the mechanism governing the biotransformation of r meth further batch experiments with different concentrations of meth single isomer were conducted as illustrated in fig 5 a the residual r meth was higher than 80 under different concentration conditions at 24 h and then rapidly dropped to below 50 at 48 h in all cases in consideration of the biodegradation profiles of nutrient substances the changed biotransformation rates of r meth may be related to the change in microbial state microorganisms were starving after the runout of nutrient substances after approximately 24 h figure s4 and low nutrient conditions were conducive to multiple substrate utilization benner et al 2013 egli 2010 in activated sludge batch experiments after the nutrient substances were consumed the tss decreased continuously including the biodegradability of extracellular polymeric substance eps and the microbial cells lysed habermacher et al 2016 eps bound and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities possess high metabolic potential to biodegrade micropollutants zumstein et al 2019 krah et al 2016 the activity of eps bound enzymes located in the sludge floc matrix or intracellular enzymes might be of pivotal importance for the elimination of r meth biotransformation of s meth followed the pseudo first order kinetics fig 5b with the pseudo first order kinetic constants shown in table 1 no significant difference existed among kbiol values of experiments at 10 μg l of racemic meth 5 μg l of s meth 10 μg l of s meth and 20 μg l of s meth under an aerobic conditions or between 10 μg l racemic meth and 5 μg l s meth under an aerobic condition kbiol of 2 μg l of racemic meth under the aerobic condition was 0 124 l g h which was comparative to the result by evans et al 2016 0 20 l g h the concentrations of amp under different nl conditions were also monitored validating its fast generation and elimination figure s6 as for the anaerobic condition the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n was also measured as shown in figure s7 the activity of biomass to biodegrade cod and nh4 n under the anaerobic condition was less than that under the aerobic condition in sum presence of do in batch experiments could enhance the biomass activity and activated sludge digestion rate to accelerate the biotransformation of meth 4 conclusions the stereoselective fate of meth in a full scale wwtp was investigated in this study the occurrence of meth in influent was in a nonracemic form with excess s enantiomer during the biological treatment s enantiomer was eliminated and the ef value drastically dropped indicating its stereoselective enrichment with r enantiomer after the secondary treatment process all s enantiomer was removed and the concentration of r enantiomer was comparative to that in the influent showing its recalcitrant nature racemic meth activated sludge batch experiments showed different stereoselective enrichment of meth isomer under 2 and 10 μg l conditions the biotransformation of s meth occurred simultaneously with the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n suggesting its cometabolism nature compared with the biotransformation rate of meth under an anaerobic condition the presence of do enhanced the activity of biomass and accelerated activated sludge digestion leading to a higher biotransformation rate of meth under an aerobic condition declaration of

the gradual acclimation of mesophilic cultures to a psychrophilic regime de cocker et al 2018 or by a short term exposure to extremely low temperature also called the cold shock kouba et al 2018 different cold adaptation strategies have been applied to enhance anammox activities at low temperatures first the enrichment of cold adapted anammox has been initiated with activated sludge and after 700 days of cultivation at 10 c relevant activities of 30 44 g n kg vss d have been achieved hendrickx et al 2014 second a gradual acclimation strategy has involved a stepwise reduction of cultivation temperature from 30 to 20 15 12 5 and finally 10 c over the period of 349 days after which an impressive activity of 91 8 g nh4 n kg vss d has been achieved de cocker et al 2018 third cold shock strategy including a rapid cooling of anammox biomass candidatus brocadia from 24 c to 5 c then 8 h of exposure to 5 c and then an increase of temperature back to 24 c has been applied three such shocks applied over the period of 45 days have incrementally increased the anammox activity at 10 c to a relevant 54 g n kg vss d compared to an order of magnitude less active control kouba et al 2018 in our most recent study with ca brocadia and ca scalindua a single cold shock 5 c 8 h doubled anammox activity at 15 c for at least 40 days indicating a highly promising long term adaptive effect kouba et al 2021 however all previous studies have been restricted to measuring the activities of anammox cultures and detecting the dominant anammox populations the absence of comparison raises questions about their relative efficiency and precise mechanisms of action a few researchers have attempted to explain the differences between the aforementioned cold adaptation strategies and their specific mechanisms in physiological terms for example rattray et al 2010 reporting on the membrane composition of ca scalindua showed that the length of a single ladderane lipid alkyl c18 c20 5 ladderane ester increased as the cultivation temperature increased from 10 to 20 c recently membrane composition was correlated to anammox temperature coefficients specifically higher relative contents of short c18 3 ladderane alkyls and large phosphatidylcholine headgroups were detected in cultures more active at 15 30 c and 10 15 c respectively kouba et al 2019 this shows that other lipid structures are also a key part of the mechanism involved in anammox adaptation to low temperatures furthermore only two metaproteomic studies assessing anammox low temperature adaptation are available in the first one changes in the protein content indicated a distinct inhibition as the temperature decreased from 35 to 15 c lin et al 2018 of the three anammox genera detected in the latter study ca jettenia displayed the most changes in protein expression suggesting that certain anammox genera may have advantages at low temperatures in the second study a reducing the temperature of anammox culture from 35 to 25 c appeared to stimulate the upregulation of cold shock proteins potentially giving candidatus b fulgida an advantage over ca b sinica and ca jettenia caeni huo et al 2020 however these proteins were unspecified despite these advances a lot remains to be known about the various mechanisms of cold adaptation to further such knowledge we tested the adaptation of a mesophilic culture of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis to main stream temperatures by the application of either a gradual cold acclimation strategy 1 c per day or cold shocks duration 1 h temperature 5 c the strategies were compared in terms of anammox activity protein expression via large scale metaproteomics and membrane composition including ladderane phospholipids specifically we aimed to understand how anammox bacteria adapt their metabolism to cold temperature and what acclimation regime can help maintain substantial anammox activities at low temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum planktonic biomass enriched in candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis was adopted as inoculum according to a 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the enrichment degree was 76 within family brocadiaceae ca kuenenia covered 97 and the rest was represented by ca brocadia 2 and ca scalindua 1 kouba et al nonpublished data the inoculum was obtained from a membrane bioreactor mbr maintained at 30 c and a ph of 7 under which the doubling time was 3 days the details of the seeding reactor operation are described in hoekstra et al 2018 2 2 bioreactor operation three fed batch reactors fbrs effective volume 1l fig s 1 were seeded by inoculum from a membrane bioreactor mbr the fbrs were kept anoxic by flushing the liquid phase with the mixture of n2 co2 95 5 co2 to maintain carbonate equilibrium in reactor liquid phase and provide co2 for anabolism table 1 shows the description of all fbrs after an initial test of anammox activity at 30 c was performed the temperature in control fbr was reduced gradually from 30 to 15 c at a rate of 1 c per day after which it remained at 15 c for 34 days in the second fbr after the initial activity test at 30 c the reactor was cooled down from 30 to 5 c in 10 min and after 60 min at 5 c it was warmed up to 15 c at the same speed as it was cooled down 1 5 c min afterward it was shocked to 5 c every 3 days 8 shocks in total the third fbr was operated identically as the second one except that the shocks were performed every 7 days 4 shocks in total in the 2nd and 3rd reactor the period with shocks was followed by a consistent operation at 15 c to perform the cold shocks a water ice nacl cooling bath with the ratio of 10 10 1 kg respectively was used this ratio resulted in a fluid temperature of 4 ⁰c which ensured a fast cooling down as well as stopping at 5 c to prevent reaching lower temperatures a polystyrene box was used as an insulating container for the cooling bath the fbrs were fed by ammonium 230 g nh4cl l 60 mg nh4 n ml and nitrite solutions 296 g nano2 l 60 mg no2 n ml other constituents of the media are described in tables s 1 2 the fbrs were operated with excess ammonium 100 200 mg nh4 n l and nitrite was spiked to 30 mg no2 n l as often as it was consumed to prevent long starvation anammox activity was determined by sampling throughout the fbr cycle and analyzing the concentration of ammonium and nitrite nitrogen spectrophotometrically on the gallery discrete analyzer thermo fisher scientific according to the standard methods chambers 2019 the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite over time were fitted with linear regressions whose slopes were determined as volumetric removal rates the biomass concentration was determined by way of optical density od at 600 nm and 660 nm using 1 ml of biomass mixture recalculated to volatile suspended solids specific anammox activity was expressed as the sum of ammonium and nitrite removal rate per mass of volatile suspended solids and time activation energies

cultures exposed to cold shocks achieved higher anammox activity than a gradually acclimated culture initial batch activity tests at 30 c showed that the metabolic activities of the three anammox cultures two shocked one gradually acclimated were 2 60 2 88 kg n kg vss d fig 1 which is higher than 1 94 0 09 kg n kg vss d in our previous study with biomass from the identical mbr kouba et al 2019 subsequently the shocked cultures were exposed to 5 c for 1 h every 3 or 7 days 15 c between each shock shocks concluded on days 26 and 22 respectively while the temperature of the gradually acclimated culture was reduced by 1 c per day during the cold shocks anammox activity was not detected between shocks 15 c the cultures that were shocked every 3 or 7 days had an average activity of 0 81 0 12 and 0 73 0 08 kg n kg vss d average standard deviation respectively the activity of the gradually acclimated culture at 30 25 20 and 15 c was 2 8 2 0 1 2 and 0 45 0 06 kg n kg vss d average standard deviation respectively or 71 25 c 42 20 c and 16 15 c of maximum activity at 30 c the relative activity of un adapted biomass in the previous study was almost identical especially at 15 c 77 25 c 31 20 c and 17 15 c kouba et al 2019 after the termination of the adaptation regimes shocks and gradual acclimation their long term effect on the activities of the cultures was assessed at 15 c interestingly the cultures shocked every 3 or 7 days had similar activities of 0 66 0 06 and 0 65 0 10 kg n kg vss d respectively whereas the gradually acclimated culture had significantly lower activity of 0 48 0 02 kg n kg vss d p value 0 05 the shocked cultures were 36 more active than the gradually acclimated culture in this post adaptation phase the temperature coefficients for 15 30 c in the shocked cultures were similar 66 kj mol and lower than the corresponding coefficient for the gradually acclimated culture 86 kj mol the activities of all cultures converged on day 40 this was 14 and 18 days cultures shocked every 3 and 7 days respectively after the last shock was concluded for each culture specifically the activities of the shocked cultures decreased to that of the level of the acclimated culture overall this shows that the cold shocks induced the more efficient adaptation of anammox to 15 c compared to the gradual acclimation if only for 14 18 days 3 2 protein expression explains the lower activity of acclimated anammox and underlying mechanisms of cold adaptation protein expression in two of the cultures shocked every 7 days gradually acclimated was determined using large scale shotgun metaproteomics i in the initial sample at 30 c ii after the conclusion of the adaptation regimes during which the shocked culture was more active than the acclimated culture 15 c and iii after the activities of the cultures converged 3 2 1 proteins involved in the nitrogen metabolism of anammox bacteria the lower activity of the gradually acclimated anammox was linked to the relative content of the proteins responsible for nitrogen conversion such as nitrate oxidoreductase nxr nitrite reductase nir hydrazine synthase hzs hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh in the gradually acclimated culture the content of these proteins decreased as compared to the initial baseline fig 2 a and b most reduced were α and β subunits of nir α and γ subunits of hzs and hdh conversely in the shocked culture the content of these proteins did not change as significantly this suggests that the lower activity of the gradually acclimated culture was due to the reduced content of several metabolic proteins the content of metabolic proteins was also linked to the decreased activity of the shocked culture 21 days post shock fig 2a in this period almost all anammox metabolic proteins nxr nir hzs hao decreased in abundance in the shocked culture while remaining the same in the gradually acclimated one thus cold shocks maintained the content of metabolic proteins only temporarily we suggest that maintaining the elevated activity for the long term would require repeating the cold shocks or optimizing cold shock parameters the most pronounced decrease was noted for nir that decreased relative protein content at the end of the experiment as compared to immediately post shock samples 2 and 3 fig 2 as compared to unchanged content in the gradually acclimated culture and points to the fact that the no production was reduced this suggests that the production of no was the bottleneck of the anammox process also the downregulation of proteins responsible for n respiration anammox process explains the decreased anammox activity post shock 3 2 2 role of cold shock proteins in anammox low temperature adaptation to explain the mechanism of cold adaptation label free quantification was used to identify the most up or down regulated proteins we attributed the most relevance to those matching the expression profile described by gottesman 2018 proteins that were both upregulated by cold shocks and then down regulated after the activities of the cultures converged only 9 proteins matched this description table 2 including the cold shock protein b cspb as compared to the initial state cold shocks temporarily upregulated cspb shocked 5 fold gradually acclimated 12 fold to a similar relative content as gradual acclimation 9 5e 03 vs 8 9e 03 the eight other suspected cold shock proteins were less abundant than cspb and either more efficiently upregulated e g ppid uspa pqqc or more abundant in the shocked culture than in the gradually acclimated one furthermore the proteomics experiment suggested that 16 other proteins table 3 were more efficiently upregulated by cold shocks bringing the total number of proteins potentially involved in the low temperature adaptation of anammox by cold shocks to 25 to complement the proteins which changed significantly we determined the expression of putative already identified cold shock proteins and other stress proteins such as heat shock proteins and universal stress proteins table s 3 confirms that cspb played the dominant role in the cold adaptation mechanism as the other putative cold shock proteins cspa cold shock protein a reca recombinase a gyra gyrase a gyrb gyrase b sigma 54 were much less abundant and much less efficiently upregulated the second most efficient putative cold shock protein was recombinase a 1 73 fold increase of the putative heat shock proteins the cold shocks uniquely upregulated only a chaperone htpg high temperature protein g 1 6 fold increase transmembrane isomerases ppid and ppic peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase d and c and several small heat shock proteins csp proteins in anammox have first been investigated in a study of several anammox populations exposed to temperature reduction from 35 to 25 c certain unspecified csp proteins were most efficiently upregulated in ca brocadia fulgida than in ca b sinica and ca jettenia caeni potentially giving ca b fulgida a metabolic advantage huo et al 2020 this suggests that the upregulation of csp proteins could be a promising mechanism of anammox adaptation to low temperatures due to the lack of anammox based metaproteomics studies the following discussion of the function structure and expression of csp proteins is based on other bacteria our results suggest that cspb plays an important role in the low temperature adaptation of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis table 2 cspb also played a major role in a study of bacillus subtilis in which the reduction of cultivation temperature from 37 to 10 c resulted in a 20 fold upregulation of cspb and mutant cells without cspb were less viable after freezing as compared to parental cells willimsky et al 1992 in comparison our study showed the somewhat less efficient upregulation of cspb 5 to 12 fold increase but this is similar to the 2 to 10 fold upregulation of dominant csps reported for escherichia coli goldstein et al 1990 structurally cspb like other csp proteins is highly conserved relatively small 7 5 kda and consists of 5 antiparallel ß strands forming a ß barrel that adopts an oligonucleotide and or oligosaccharide binding fold also like other major csp proteins cspb binds to dna and rna by the rnp1 and rnp2 nucleic acid binding motifs in order to destabilize undesirable secondary structures and maintain the nucleic acid structure in a single strand lindquist and mertens 2018 under low temperatures and other sub optimal conditions single strands of nucleic acids form stable structures by base pairing which is thought to inhibit transcription and translation csp proteins prevent this by functioning as nucleic acid chaperones which are not to be confused with protein chaperones protein chaperones not only destabilize undesirable secondary structures but also often restore the correct secondary and tertiary structures horn et al 2007 our study also suggests that ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis adapts to low temperatures by other proteins such as typa ribosome binding gtpase ppid and uspa universal stress protein a table 2 table 3 typa also known as bipa was found to possess chaperone activity and be essential for e coli and pseudomonas putida under low temperature stress choi and hwang 2018 pfennig and flower 2001 reva et al 2006 ppid was also shown to function as a chaperone matern et al 2010 and while its role has been studied under heat stress noor 2015 our study provides the first evidence of its upregulation during cold stress shocked 3 2 fold gradual acclimation 1 4 fold this dual role acting as heat or cold shock proteins in different organisms is well established for example dnak a typical heat shock protein chaperone was upregulated after cold shock in lactococcus piscium uspa in psychrotrophic l piscium cultivated at 5 c growth optimum at 26 c increased 1 4 fold first with suspected cold shock proteins and subsequently 2 1 fold in the cold acclimation phase this suggests that uspa which is synthesized continuously during cultivation at low temperatures acts as a cold acclimation protein whose upregulation starts later than csp upregulation garnier et al 2010 in comparison our study recorded the 2 6 and 1 5 fold upregulation of uspa in shocked and gradually acclimated reactors respectively suggesting the more efficient adaptation of shocked biomass to low temperature it is reasonable to assume that these csps especially ppid uspa and pqqc re started protein synthesis including the synthesis of n respiration proteins e g nxr hzs responsible for anammox activity thus we suggest that more efficient induction of csps by cold shocks compared to gradual acclimation made anammox cells more active note that cspb and typa increased significantly in both shocked and gradually acclimated cultures while this confirms their crucial role in temperature adaptation of anammox they may not be exclusively induced by the presently applied cold shock regime 3 3 structural changes in ladderane lipids of ca kuenenia under reduced temperature uplc ms ms revealed that cold shocks and gradual acclimation induced changes in ladderane composition table 4 the alkyl moieties were altered in two main ways first a significant decrease in the length of the 5 ladderanes shifted the c20 c18 c20 ratio in favor of c18 control 0 49 shocked 0 33 acclimated 0 31 second of the two ladderane esters and or ethers on the glycerol backbone the one in the sn 1 position was replaced by a straight or branched non ladderane alkyl c14 c15 c16 control 35 shocked 55 acclimation 51 these replacements were exclusively c14 or c16 and the resulting lipids comprised 25 28 sn positions 1 c14 ester 2 c20 5 ladderane and 17 20 1 c16 ester 2 c20 5 ladderane of all ladderane lipids respectively concerning the polar headgroup the content of phosphatidylcholine pc and phosphatidylglycerol pg was reduced in favor of phosphatidylethanolamine pe pe control 15 shocked 25 acclimated 24 to sum up while the adopted sampling regime does not enable us to attribute changes in ladderane composition to increased activity of the shocked culture we can state that ca kuenenia adapts to low temperatures by synthesizing shorter ladderanes by replacing ladderanes with even shorter alkyl esters or ethers and by favoring pe as the polar headgroup thus our results match with the fact that bacteria prevent membrane rigidity at lower temperatures by modulating their membrane lipidic composition and fluidity via mechanisms such as synthesizing shorter and more branched alkyls siliakus et al 2017 the increased prevalence of pe as the relatively smaller polar headgroup may ease the insertion of membrane proteins that could enable further cold adaptation van klompenburg et al 1998 3 4 strategies for adaptation of anammox bacteria to low temperatures while the non adapted ca kuenenia kouba et al 2019 and gradually acclimated cultures were similarly active on the basis of relative activities the cold shocks 5 c 1 h increased the anammox activity by 38 shocked once per 3 days 0 66 0 06 kg n kg vss d gradually acclimated 0 48 0 06 kg n kg vss d 15 c suggesting cold shocks to be the superior strategy for low temperature adaptation as the acclimated and non adapted biomasses were similarly active at lower temperatures on a relative basis we do not recommend the presently adopted gradual acclimation regime 1 c day to be adopted by operators on the biomasses dominated by ca kuenenia in the literature a gradual adaptation de cocker et al 2018 along with the enrichment of cold adapted species hendrickx et al 2014 are the established strategies for achieving high performance anammox at low temperatures 10 20 c while the cold shocks have only very recently emerged as a promising alternative our previous work in batch assays has shown that the application of 5 c for 8 h consecutively elevated the anammox activity at 10 c kouba et al 2018 while we have subsequently demonstrated that the elevated activity of one such shock can endure for 40 days kouba et al 2021 in our present work we reported a shorter duration 14 18 days of increased activity post shock the shorter duration in our study may be explained by a shorter exposure to 5 c present study 1 h kouba et al 2021 8 h on a practical note increasing the process resiliency against low temperature would require the application of the present cold shock regime once every 6 weeks which means that a 6 month winter period would require the application of 4 5 such regimes the shock applications could be made less frequent by optimizing cold shock parameters such as shock duration and temperature which have the potential to extend the time span of the increased resiliency post shock the anammox sludge could also be shocked in the late summer and autumn to prepare the bacteria for the winter season in a side reactor cooling down a concentrated anammox sludge e g return sludge line it can also be applied to the mesophilic side stream cultures before the inoculation of main stream facilities kouba et al 2021 overall this is an important step in establishing cold shocks as a viable adaptation strategy 4 conclusions mainstream anammox operations for an energy and resource efficient removal of nitrogen from municipal wastewater requires an in depth understanding of mechanisms of microbial adaptations to temperatures across seasons notably in the perspective of process control ahead of winter conditions we showed that anammox enrichment cultures of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis exposed to cold shocks 5 c 1 h shock duration shocked once every 3 or 7 days adapted to subsequent operation at low temperature 15 c more favorably 0 66 0 06 kg n kg vss d as compared to a gradually acclimated culture 1 c day 0 48 0 02 kg n kg vss d for the duration of 14 18 days post shock the increased activity of shocked cultures was linked to i maintaining the levels of proteins involved in nitrogen respiration and ii expression of several hypothetical cold shocks proteins e g ppid uspa pqqc that should be better characterized further putative cold shock proteins cspb and typa were upregulated in both cultures confirming their role in low temperature adaptation also in anammox bacteria low temperature adaptation resulted in several significant changes in the structure of characteristic membrane ladderane lipids such as higher content of shorter c18 ladderanes and even shorter c14 16 straight branched alkyls and pe as the polar headgroup overall the results underline the efficiency of cold shocks as a promising anammox adaptation strategy for mainstream operations for nitrogen removal from municipal wwtp we identified the yet unreported physiological mechanisms of adaptation of anammox microorganisms under cold shocks and gradual acclimation that underlie an increased anammox activity

graph abstract image graphical abstract keywords adaptation anammox cold shock gradually decreasing temperature kuenenia main stream of municipal sewage 1 introduction anammox bacteria can cost effectively remove nitrogen from the mainstream of wastewater treatment plants wwtp via processes such as partial nitritation and anammox pn a as well as nitrification partial denitrification and anammox n pdn a in these processes anammox eliminates the costs associated with the input of organic carbon necessary for conventional heterotrophic denitrification as estimated by daigger 2014 the conversion of ammonia to dinitrogen gas by partial nitritation anammox consumes 0 5 mg biodegradable cod mg ammonia nitrogen whereas 3 5 4 0 mg is required for nitrification denitrification however the mainstream of wwtp is much colder 10 20 c than most current anammox reactors used to treat mesophilic centrates 30 37 c making the adaptation of anammox bacteria to low temperatures a crucial issue cao et al 2017 kouba et al 2019 at 20 c some studies have reported that anammox bacteria deteriorated in activity hoekstra et al 2018 while other studies have shown the possibility to adapt anammox and increase their activity lv et al 2020 wang et al 2018 especially favorable activities were obtained by the enrichment of cold adapted populations hendrickx et al 2014 park et al 2017 by the gradual acclimation of mesophilic cultures to a psychrophilic regime de cocker et al 2018 or by a short term exposure to extremely low temperature also called the cold shock kouba et al 2018 different cold adaptation strategies have been applied to enhance anammox activities at low temperatures first the enrichment of cold adapted anammox has been initiated with activated sludge and after 700 days of cultivation at 10 c relevant activities of 30 44 g n kg vss d have been achieved hendrickx et al 2014 second a gradual acclimation strategy has involved a stepwise reduction of cultivation temperature from 30 to 20 15 12 5 and finally 10 c over the period of 349 days after which an impressive activity of 91 8 g nh4 n kg vss d has been achieved de cocker et al 2018 third cold shock strategy including a rapid cooling of anammox biomass candidatus brocadia from 24 c to 5 c then 8 h of exposure to 5 c and then an increase of temperature back to 24 c has been applied three such shocks applied over the period of 45 days have incrementally increased the anammox activity at 10 c to a relevant 54 g n kg vss d compared to an order of magnitude less active control kouba et al 2018 in our most recent study with ca brocadia and ca scalindua a single cold shock 5 c 8 h doubled anammox activity at 15 c for at least 40 days indicating a highly promising long term adaptive effect kouba et al 2021 however all previous studies have been restricted to measuring the activities of anammox cultures and detecting the dominant anammox populations the absence of comparison raises questions about their relative efficiency and precise mechanisms of action a few researchers have attempted to explain the differences between the aforementioned cold adaptation strategies and their specific mechanisms in physiological terms for example rattray et al 2010 reporting on the membrane composition of ca scalindua showed that the length of a single ladderane lipid alkyl c18 c20 5 ladderane ester increased as the cultivation temperature increased from 10 to 20 c recently membrane composition was correlated to anammox temperature coefficients specifically higher relative contents of short c18 3 ladderane alkyls and large phosphatidylcholine headgroups were detected in cultures more active at 15 30 c and 10 15 c respectively kouba et al 2019 this shows that other lipid structures are also a key part of the mechanism involved in anammox adaptation to low temperatures furthermore only two metaproteomic studies assessing anammox low temperature adaptation are available in the first one changes in the protein content indicated a distinct inhibition as the temperature decreased from 35 to 15 c lin et al 2018 of the three anammox genera detected in the latter study ca jettenia displayed the most changes in protein expression suggesting that certain anammox genera may have advantages at low temperatures in the second study a reducing the temperature of anammox culture from 35 to 25 c appeared to stimulate the upregulation of cold shock proteins potentially giving candidatus b fulgida an advantage over ca b sinica and ca jettenia caeni huo et al 2020 however these proteins were unspecified despite these advances a lot remains to be known about the various mechanisms of cold adaptation to further such knowledge we tested the adaptation of a mesophilic culture of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis to main stream temperatures by the application of either a gradual cold acclimation strategy 1 c per day or cold shocks duration 1 h temperature 5 c the strategies were compared in terms of anammox activity protein expression via large scale metaproteomics and membrane composition including ladderane phospholipids specifically we aimed to understand how anammox bacteria adapt their metabolism to cold temperature and what acclimation regime can help maintain substantial anammox activities at low temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum planktonic biomass enriched in candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis was adopted as inoculum according to a 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the enrichment degree was 76 within family brocadiaceae ca kuenenia covered 97 and the rest was represented by ca brocadia 2 and ca scalindua 1 kouba et al nonpublished data the inoculum was obtained from a membrane bioreactor mbr maintained at 30 c and a ph of 7 under which the doubling time was 3 days the details of the seeding reactor operation are described in hoekstra et al 2018 2 2 bioreactor operation three fed batch reactors fbrs effective volume 1l fig s 1 were seeded by inoculum from a membrane bioreactor mbr the fbrs were kept anoxic by flushing the liquid phase with the mixture of n2 co2 95 5 co2 to maintain carbonate equilibrium in reactor liquid phase and provide co2 for anabolism table 1 shows the description of all fbrs after an initial test of anammox activity at 30 c was performed the temperature in control fbr was reduced gradually from 30 to 15 c at a rate of 1 c per day after which it remained at 15 c for 34 days in the second fbr after the initial activity test at 30 c the reactor was cooled down from 30 to 5 c in 10 min and after 60 min at 5 c it was warmed up to 15 c at the same speed as it was cooled down 1 5 c min afterward it was shocked to 5 c every 3 days 8 shocks in total the third fbr was operated identically as the second one except that the shocks were performed every 7 days 4 shocks in total in the 2nd and 3rd reactor the period with shocks was followed by a consistent operation at 15 c to perform the cold shocks a water ice nacl cooling bath with the ratio of 10 10 1 kg respectively was used this ratio resulted in a fluid temperature of 4 ⁰c which ensured a fast cooling down as well as stopping at 5 c to prevent reaching lower temperatures a polystyrene box was used as an insulating container for the cooling bath the fbrs were fed by ammonium 230 g nh4cl l 60 mg nh4 n ml and nitrite solutions 296 g nano2 l 60 mg no2 n ml other constituents of the media are described in tables s 1 2 the fbrs were operated with excess ammonium 100 200 mg nh4 n l and nitrite was spiked to 30 mg no2 n l as often as it was consumed to prevent long starvation anammox activity was determined by sampling throughout the fbr cycle and analyzing the concentration of ammonium and nitrite nitrogen spectrophotometrically on the gallery discrete analyzer thermo fisher scientific according to the standard methods chambers 2019 the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite over time were fitted with linear regressions whose slopes were determined as volumetric removal rates the biomass concentration was determined by way of optical density od at 600 nm and 660 nm using 1 ml of biomass mixture recalculated to volatile suspended solids specific anammox activity was expressed as the sum of ammonium and nitrite removal rate per mass of volatile suspended solids and time activation energies

cultures exposed to cold shocks achieved higher anammox activity than a gradually acclimated culture initial batch activity tests at 30 c showed that the metabolic activities of the three anammox cultures two shocked one gradually acclimated were 2 60 2 88 kg n kg vss d fig 1 which is higher than 1 94 0 09 kg n kg vss d in our previous study with biomass from the identical mbr kouba et al 2019 subsequently the shocked cultures were exposed to 5 c for 1 h every 3 or 7 days 15 c between each shock shocks concluded on days 26 and 22 respectively while the temperature of the gradually acclimated culture was reduced by 1 c per day during the cold shocks anammox activity was not detected between shocks 15 c the cultures that were shocked every 3 or 7 days had an average activity of 0 81 0 12 and 0 73 0 08 kg n kg vss d average standard deviation respectively the activity of the gradually acclimated culture at 30 25 20 and 15 c was 2 8 2 0 1 2 and 0 45 0 06 kg n kg vss d average standard deviation respectively or 71 25 c 42 20 c and 16 15 c of maximum activity at 30 c the relative activity of un adapted biomass in the previous study was almost identical especially at 15 c 77 25 c 31 20 c and 17 15 c kouba et al 2019 after the termination of the adaptation regimes shocks and gradual acclimation their long term effect on the activities of the cultures was assessed at 15 c interestingly the cultures shocked every 3 or 7 days had similar activities of 0 66 0 06 and 0 65 0 10 kg n kg vss d respectively whereas the gradually acclimated culture had significantly lower activity of 0 48 0 02 kg n kg vss d p value 0 05 the shocked cultures were 36 more active than the gradually acclimated culture in this post adaptation phase the temperature coefficients for 15 30 c in the shocked cultures were similar 66 kj mol and lower than the corresponding coefficient for the gradually acclimated culture 86 kj mol the activities of all cultures converged on day 40 this was 14 and 18 days cultures shocked every 3 and 7 days respectively after the last shock was concluded for each culture specifically the activities of the shocked cultures decreased to that of the level of the acclimated culture overall this shows that the cold shocks induced the more efficient adaptation of anammox to 15 c compared to the gradual acclimation if only for 14 18 days 3 2 protein expression explains the lower activity of acclimated anammox and underlying mechanisms of cold adaptation protein expression in two of the cultures shocked every 7 days gradually acclimated was determined using large scale shotgun metaproteomics i in the initial sample at 30 c ii after the conclusion of the adaptation regimes during which the shocked culture was more active than the acclimated culture 15 c and iii after the activities of the cultures converged 3 2 1 proteins involved in the nitrogen metabolism of anammox bacteria the lower activity of the gradually acclimated anammox was linked to the relative content of the proteins responsible for nitrogen conversion such as nitrate oxidoreductase nxr nitrite reductase nir hydrazine synthase hzs hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh in the gradually acclimated culture the content of these proteins decreased as compared to the initial baseline fig 2 a and b most reduced were α and β subunits of nir α and γ subunits of hzs and hdh conversely in the shocked culture the content of these proteins did not change as significantly this suggests that the lower activity of the gradually acclimated culture was due to the reduced content of several metabolic proteins the content of metabolic proteins was also linked to the decreased activity of the shocked culture 21 days post shock fig 2a in this period almost all anammox metabolic proteins nxr nir hzs hao decreased in abundance in the shocked culture while remaining the same in the gradually acclimated one thus cold shocks maintained the content of metabolic proteins only temporarily we suggest that maintaining the elevated activity for the long term would require repeating the cold shocks or optimizing cold shock parameters the most pronounced decrease was noted for nir that decreased relative protein content at the end of the experiment as compared to immediately post shock samples 2 and 3 fig 2 as compared to unchanged content in the gradually acclimated culture and points to the fact that the no production was reduced this suggests that the production of no was the bottleneck of the anammox process also the downregulation of proteins responsible for n respiration anammox process explains the decreased anammox activity post shock 3 2 2 role of cold shock proteins in anammox low temperature adaptation to explain the mechanism of cold adaptation label free quantification was used to identify the most up or down regulated proteins we attributed the most relevance to those matching the expression profile described by gottesman 2018 proteins that were both upregulated by cold shocks and then down regulated after the activities of the cultures converged only 9 proteins matched this description table 2 including the cold shock protein b cspb as compared to the initial state cold shocks temporarily upregulated cspb shocked 5 fold gradually acclimated 12 fold to a similar relative content as gradual acclimation 9 5e 03 vs 8 9e 03 the eight other suspected cold shock proteins were less abundant than cspb and either more efficiently upregulated e g ppid uspa pqqc or more abundant in the shocked culture than in the gradually acclimated one furthermore the proteomics experiment suggested that 16 other proteins table 3 were more efficiently upregulated by cold shocks bringing the total number of proteins potentially involved in the low temperature adaptation of anammox by cold shocks to 25 to complement the proteins which changed significantly we determined the expression of putative already identified cold shock proteins and other stress proteins such as heat shock proteins and universal stress proteins table s 3 confirms that cspb played the dominant role in the cold adaptation mechanism as the other putative cold shock proteins cspa cold shock protein a reca recombinase a gyra gyrase a gyrb gyrase b sigma 54 were much less abundant and much less efficiently upregulated the second most efficient putative cold shock protein was recombinase a 1 73 fold increase of the putative heat shock proteins the cold shocks uniquely upregulated only a chaperone htpg high temperature protein g 1 6 fold increase transmembrane isomerases ppid and ppic peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase d and c and several small heat shock proteins csp proteins in anammox have first been investigated in a study of several anammox populations exposed to temperature reduction from 35 to 25 c certain unspecified csp proteins were most efficiently upregulated in ca brocadia fulgida than in ca b sinica and ca jettenia caeni potentially giving ca b fulgida a metabolic advantage huo et al 2020 this suggests that the upregulation of csp proteins could be a promising mechanism of anammox adaptation to low temperatures due to the lack of anammox based metaproteomics studies the following discussion of the function structure and expression of csp proteins is based on other bacteria our results suggest that cspb plays an important role in the low temperature adaptation of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis table 2 cspb also played a major role in a study of bacillus subtilis in which the reduction of cultivation temperature from 37 to 10 c resulted in a 20 fold upregulation of cspb and mutant cells without cspb were less viable after freezing as compared to parental cells willimsky et al 1992 in comparison our study showed the somewhat less efficient upregulation of cspb 5 to 12 fold increase but this is similar to the 2 to 10 fold upregulation of dominant csps reported for escherichia coli goldstein et al 1990 structurally cspb like other csp proteins is highly conserved relatively small 7 5 kda and consists of 5 antiparallel ß strands forming a ß barrel that adopts an oligonucleotide and or oligosaccharide binding fold also like other major csp proteins cspb binds to dna and rna by the rnp1 and rnp2 nucleic acid binding motifs in order to destabilize undesirable secondary structures and maintain the nucleic acid structure in a single strand lindquist and mertens 2018 under low temperatures and other sub optimal conditions single strands of nucleic acids form stable structures by base pairing which is thought to inhibit transcription and translation csp proteins prevent this by functioning as nucleic acid chaperones which are not to be confused with protein chaperones protein chaperones not only destabilize undesirable secondary structures but also often restore the correct secondary and tertiary structures horn et al 2007 our study also suggests that ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis adapts to low temperatures by other proteins such as typa ribosome binding gtpase ppid and uspa universal stress protein a table 2 table 3 typa also known as bipa was found to possess chaperone activity and be essential for e coli and pseudomonas putida under low temperature stress choi and hwang 2018 pfennig and flower 2001 reva et al 2006 ppid was also shown to function as a chaperone matern et al 2010 and while its role has been studied under heat stress noor 2015 our study provides the first evidence of its upregulation during cold stress shocked 3 2 fold gradual acclimation 1 4 fold this dual role acting as heat or cold shock proteins in different organisms is well established for example dnak a typical heat shock protein chaperone was upregulated after cold shock in lactococcus piscium uspa in psychrotrophic l piscium cultivated at 5 c growth optimum at 26 c increased 1 4 fold first with suspected cold shock proteins and subsequently 2 1 fold in the cold acclimation phase this suggests that uspa which is synthesized continuously during cultivation at low temperatures acts as a cold acclimation protein whose upregulation starts later than csp upregulation garnier et al 2010 in comparison our study recorded the 2 6 and 1 5 fold upregulation of uspa in shocked and gradually acclimated reactors respectively suggesting the more efficient adaptation of shocked biomass to low temperature it is reasonable to assume that these csps especially ppid uspa and pqqc re started protein synthesis including the synthesis of n respiration proteins e g nxr hzs responsible for anammox activity thus we suggest that more efficient induction of csps by cold shocks compared to gradual acclimation made anammox cells more active note that cspb and typa increased significantly in both shocked and gradually acclimated cultures while this confirms their crucial role in temperature adaptation of anammox they may not be exclusively induced by the presently applied cold shock regime 3 3 structural changes in ladderane lipids of ca kuenenia under reduced temperature uplc ms ms revealed that cold shocks and gradual acclimation induced changes in ladderane composition table 4 the alkyl moieties were altered in two main ways first a significant decrease in the length of the 5 ladderanes shifted the c20 c18 c20 ratio in favor of c18 control 0 49 shocked 0 33 acclimated 0 31 second of the two ladderane esters and or ethers on the glycerol backbone the one in the sn 1 position was replaced by a straight or branched non ladderane alkyl c14 c15 c16 control 35 shocked 55 acclimation 51 these replacements were exclusively c14 or c16 and the resulting lipids comprised 25 28 sn positions 1 c14 ester 2 c20 5 ladderane and 17 20 1 c16 ester 2 c20 5 ladderane of all ladderane lipids respectively concerning the polar headgroup the content of phosphatidylcholine pc and phosphatidylglycerol pg was reduced in favor of phosphatidylethanolamine pe pe control 15 shocked 25 acclimated 24 to sum up while the adopted sampling regime does not enable us to attribute changes in ladderane composition to increased activity of the shocked culture we can state that ca kuenenia adapts to low temperatures by synthesizing shorter ladderanes by replacing ladderanes with even shorter alkyl esters or ethers and by favoring pe as the polar headgroup thus our results match with the fact that bacteria prevent membrane rigidity at lower temperatures by modulating their membrane lipidic composition and fluidity via mechanisms such as synthesizing shorter and more branched alkyls siliakus et al 2017 the increased prevalence of pe as the relatively smaller polar headgroup may ease the insertion of membrane proteins that could enable further cold adaptation van klompenburg et al 1998 3 4 strategies for adaptation of anammox bacteria to low temperatures while the non adapted ca kuenenia kouba et al 2019 and gradually acclimated cultures were similarly active on the basis of relative activities the cold shocks 5 c 1 h increased the anammox activity by 38 shocked once per 3 days 0 66 0 06 kg n kg vss d gradually acclimated 0 48 0 06 kg n kg vss d 15 c suggesting cold shocks to be the superior strategy for low temperature adaptation as the acclimated and non adapted biomasses were similarly active at lower temperatures on a relative basis we do not recommend the presently adopted gradual acclimation regime 1 c day to be adopted by operators on the biomasses dominated by ca kuenenia in the literature a gradual adaptation de cocker et al 2018 along with the enrichment of cold adapted species hendrickx et al 2014 are the established strategies for achieving high performance anammox at low temperatures 10 20 c while the cold shocks have only very recently emerged as a promising alternative our previous work in batch assays has shown that the application of 5 c for 8 h consecutively elevated the anammox activity at 10 c kouba et al 2018 while we have subsequently demonstrated that the elevated activity of one such shock can endure for 40 days kouba et al 2021 in our present work we reported a shorter duration 14 18 days of increased activity post shock the shorter duration in our study may be explained by a shorter exposure to 5 c present study 1 h kouba et al 2021 8 h on a practical note increasing the process resiliency against low temperature would require the application of the present cold shock regime once every 6 weeks which means that a 6 month winter period would require the application of 4 5 such regimes the shock applications could be made less frequent by optimizing cold shock parameters such as shock duration and temperature which have the potential to extend the time span of the increased resiliency post shock the anammox sludge could also be shocked in the late summer and autumn to prepare the bacteria for the winter season in a side reactor cooling down a concentrated anammox sludge e g return sludge line it can also be applied to the mesophilic side stream cultures before the inoculation of main stream facilities kouba et al 2021 overall this is an important step in establishing cold shocks as a viable adaptation strategy 4 conclusions mainstream anammox operations for an energy and resource efficient removal of nitrogen from municipal wastewater requires an in depth understanding of mechanisms of microbial adaptations to temperatures across seasons notably in the perspective of process control ahead of winter conditions we showed that anammox enrichment cultures of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis exposed to cold shocks 5 c 1 h shock duration shocked once every 3 or 7 days adapted to subsequent operation at low temperature 15 c more favorably 0 66 0 06 kg n kg vss d as compared to a gradually acclimated culture 1 c day 0 48 0 02 kg n kg vss d for the duration of 14 18 days post shock the increased activity of shocked cultures was linked to i maintaining the levels of proteins involved in nitrogen respiration and ii expression of several hypothetical cold shocks proteins e g ppid uspa pqqc that should be better characterized further putative cold shock proteins cspb and typa were upregulated in both cultures confirming their role in low temperature adaptation also in anammox bacteria low temperature adaptation resulted in several significant changes in the structure of characteristic membrane ladderane lipids such as higher content of shorter c18 ladderanes and even shorter c14 16 straight branched alkyls and pe as the polar headgroup overall the results underline the efficiency of cold shocks as a promising anammox adaptation strategy for mainstream operations for nitrogen removal from municipal wwtp we identified the yet unreported physiological mechanisms of adaptation of anammox microorganisms under cold shocks and gradual acclimation that underlie an increased anammox activity

16409,systemic insecticides like neonicotinoids and the phenylpyrazole insecticide fipronil are the most widely applied insecticides around the world multiple studies analyzed insecticide residues in freshwater systems but data on seawater contamination levels are scarce this study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution and ecological risk assessment of fipronil neonicotinoids sulfoxaflor and selected transformation products tps in the chinese bohai sea and its surrounding rivers well established neonicotinoids acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid thiacloprid and thiamethoxam and tps of fipronil and imidacloprid were frequently detected detection frequency df 42 100 in freshwater the median total insecticide concentration in freshwater was significantly higher in summer 72 4 ng l 1 than in fall 23 4 ng l 1 with major contributions from neonicotinoids suggesting that pollution originates mostly from diffuse sources in 2018 acetamiprid desnitro imidacloprid fipronil desulfinyl and thiacloprid were abundant in seawater df 47 100 indicating a high stability of acetamiprid and thiacloprid and a rapid photodegradation of fipronil and imidacloprid in surface waters these results indicate that the continued use of these parent compounds may lead to their accumulation and or of their tps in shallow coastal seas consequently this may lead to their transport to open seas increasing their potential risk to marine organisms similarities between contaminant fingerprints in freshwater and seawater strongly suggest riverine discharges as main pollution source of adjacent coastal areas this is the first study to perform an ecological risk assessment of fipronil neonicotinoids sulfoxaflor and selected tps on marine ecosystems fipronil and its tps demonstrated to be environmentally relevant with potential high risks for aquatic species our study provides novel insights into the fate and ecological risk of fipronil neonicotinoids sulfoxaflor and their tps to

ecotoxicological risk 1 introduction in the last decades neonicotinoids and the phenylpyrazole insecticide fipronil have become the most widely consumed insecticides globally bass et al 2015 simon delso et al 2015 their fast growing popularity is related to their versatility of use systemic nature and long persistence ensuring the overall protection of crops against sap feeding insects over long periods bass et al 2015 bonmatin et al 2015 meanwhile numerous studies have revealed severe ecological risks of neonicotinoids and fipronil to pollinators birds mammals and aquatic organisms gibbons et al 2015 jensen 2019 van der sluijs et al 2013 weston and lydy 2014 moreover it was demonstrated that neonicotinoids indirectly reduce fish and bird populations by disrupting food webs hallmann et al 2014 yamamuro et al 2019 in europe outdoor applications of clothianidin fipronil imidacloprid and thiamethoxam have been gradually restricted due to proven toxicity to bees ec 2013 2013a whereas thiacloprid was completely banned in 2020 ec 2019 moreover neonicotinoids have been incorporated into a watch list of substances for the european monitoring program in surface waters eu 2015 495 due to possible threats to aquatic organisms ec 2015 contrastingly china has expanded its pesticide use over the last decade and has emerged as the largest producer exporter and consumer of pesticides where insecticides account for the largest proportion fao 2020 several studies reported the occurrence of neonicotinoids and fipronil in various surface water bodies at ecotoxicologically relevant concentrations chen et al 2019 morrissey et al 2015 sousa et al 2019 weston and lydy 2014 wu et al 2015 moreover it has been demonstrated that they are persistent enough to reach coastal areas li et al 2019 sousa et al 2020 nevertheless very few studies globally have investigated these insecticides in seawater li et al 2019 pan et al 2020 sousa et al 2020 and no ecological risk assessment has been performed to marine organisms so far neonicotinoids and fipronil are hydrolytically stable in surface waters but most of them are also sensitive to photodegradation anderson et al 2015 bonmatin et al 2015 gunasekara et al 2007 additionally biotransformation and microbial degradation are equally relevant fate processes for neonicotinoids and fipronil in soils anderson et al 2015 gunasekara et al 2007 michel et al 2016 therefore it is important to investigate these compounds and their transformation products tps in surface waters particularly seawater and to evaluate their risk to freshwater and marine organisms this study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of nine neonicotinoids fipronil sulfoxaflor and four selected tps in river and seawater of the bohai region china fingerprint analysis is performed to identify similarities in contaminant patterns between river and seawater the ecological risk for freshwater and marine species is estimated based on risk quotients rq 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals this study covered 15 insecticide compounds 9 neonicotinoids acetamiprid clothianidin cycloxaprid dinotefuran imidacloprid imidaclothiz

fipronil sulfone and a sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor eleven isotopically labeled internal standards is were used table s1 detailed information on the analytical standards and chemicals used for sample analysis is presented in section s1 2 2 study area the bohai sea is a semi enclosed marginal sea in the northeast of china with an area of approximately 77 000 km² zhang et al 2006 it consists of three bays liaodong bay bohai bay and laizhou bay a central area and the bohai strait that connects the bohai sea with the yellow sea gao et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 the coastal region surrounding the bohai sea including shandong province liaoning province hebei province and tianjin municipality belongs to one of the most densely populated and industrialized regions in china zhao et al 2018 there are approximately 100 rivers draining into the bohai sea among which the rivers yellow shuangtaizi daliao and luan are the major ones gao et al 2014 2 3 sampling in 2018 two sampling campaigns were conducted in the bohai sea on board of the chinese research vessel chuangxin i one in summer 18 25 august and one in fall 23 november 14 december surface seawater samples were collected at approximately 5 m depth using a sbe991plus ctd sea bird scientific usa in summer 47 seawater samples were collected figure s2 whereas in fall only 34 sampling stations were possible to be collected due to bad weather conditions that impeded the research vessel from navigating into the remaining planned stations another 2 sampling campaigns were conducted in 2018 to 36 major rivers around the bohai sea and northern yellow sea approximately at the same time as the bohai sea campaigns i e one in summer 23 30 august and one in fall 29 october 7 november these 36 rivers account for 90 of the total water discharge into the bohai sea the river water sampling stations figure s2 were located as close as possible to the river mouths while avoiding the influence of salt water more detailed information on the location of river sampling sites and sampling procedure is described in wang et al 2015 all water samples were collected in 1 l polypropylene pp bottles wrapped in aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation of photosensitive compounds rinsed twice with sampling water and stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis coordinates of river and seawater sampling sites and physicochemical properties are provided in section s2 2 4 sample extraction and instrumental analysis prior to analyte enrichment via automated solid phase extraction spe on a lc tech freestyle xana workbench lc tech gmbh germany water samples were filtrated and spiked with 20 µl is mix 0 4 ng l 1 oasis hlb cartridges hydrophilic lipophilic balanced reversed phase sorbent 6 cc 500 mg 60 µm waters usa were pre conditioned with 10 ml methanol and equilibrated with 10 ml ultrapure water sample loading was performed at a flow rate of 8 ml min 1 see section s5 for results on the test of different loading speeds after a washing step with 10 ml ultrapure water containing 5 methanol 95 5 v v the cartridges were dried under nitrogen for 60 min the target analytes were eluted using 10 ml methanol the eluate was reduced to 800 µl with vacuum using the evaporation module of the lc tech workbench after filtrating the sample extracts through regenerated cellulose syringe filters 100 µl sample extract were withdrawn and diluted with 400 µl methanol and 500 µl ultrapure water during method development and validation both filtration steps before and after spe were assessed for any impact on the absolute recoveries of target analytes and no effects were observed for all compounds target insecticides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms details on the instrumental analysis and quantification procedure are described in sections s3 and s4 respectively 2 5 quality control and quality assurance detailed information on the determination of method accuracy method detection limits mdls and method quantification limits mqls is given in section s4 relative recoveries based on matrix spike tests at several spiking levels ranged from 72 to 117 with a precision of 3 18 absolute recovery ranges of the validated method also based on several matrix spiking levels were 45 102 in seawater and 33 104 in river water mdls of individual insecticides ranged between 0 01 and 0 45 ng l 1 in seawater and 0 05 and 2 4 ng l 1 in river water mqls ranged between 0 10 and 1 0 ng l 1 in seawater and 0 10 and 7 8 ng l 1 in river water relative recoveries mdls mqls calibration curve ranges and regression coefficients of target analytes are presented in table s7 to reduce any risk of contamination a cleaning cycle for the automated spe and evaporation chamber was performed before and after each sample batch for monitoring possible carry over of target compounds during hplc ms ms analysis a solvent blank consisting of methanol ultrapure water 50 50 v v was injected every fourth sample ultrapure water or artificial seawater prepared with ultrapure water 32 psu was used as procedural blanks during the automated spe of each sample batch additionally three field blanks were used during the fall sampling campaign to the bohai sea they consisted of pre filled 1 l ultrapure water in sampling bottles which were opened at random stations during sampling and treated as normal samples from this step onwards no field blanks were used during the summer sampling campaign no target compounds were detected in instrumental or procedural blanks one field blank showed a contamination with fipronil fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone in quantifiable amounts 0 13 0 10 and 0 5 ng l 1 respectively nevertheless since these compounds were not detected at the corresponding station in which this field blank was handled and this was an isolated case within all blanks used for which we could not trace the origin we disregarded it 2 6 data and fingerprint analysis for presentation of results median concentrations were calculated for target analytes with a detection frequency df 50 in river or seawater while concentration ranges are presented for compounds with a df 50 statistical analyses for comparison of contamination levels between seasons in river and seawater and between individual compounds within the same season are described in section s6 fingerprint analysis was carried out to identify specific contaminant patterns in river and seawater in predefined investigation areas bohai bay laizhou bay liaodong bay northern yellow sea central bohai sea bohai strait see figure s2 this was performed by calculating the relative contribution of each insecticide using an adapted approach of the united states environmental protection agency usepa plumb 2004 whereby the df in each investigation area was applied as weighing factor suehring et al 2015 an insecticide was considered relevant for a given investigation area if its relative contribution was 10 further information on the calculation of relative contributions is provided in section s7 in order to identify potential affiliations between contaminant patterns in seawater and river water for the predefined investigation areas a spearman s correlation analysis was performed 2 7 ecological risk assessment potential ecological risks to marine and freshwater species were estimated by means of risk quotients rq according to the european technical guidance document on risk assessment ec 2003 the rqs were calculated as the ratio between the maximum measured environmental concentrations mec and the predicted no effect concentrations pnec the pnecs were derived from ecotoxicological data i e no observed effect concentrations noec median lethal concentrations lc50 or median effective concentrations ec50 available in the ecotox database of the usepa in combination with appropriate safety assessment factors ec 2003 sousa et al 2019 rqs were ranked as follows low risk for rq 0 1 medium risk for 0 1 rq 1 and high risk for rq 1 hernando et al 2006 sanchez bayo et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination levels in river water the total concentration of insecticides insecticides ranged from 5 1 ng l 1 luan river 14 to 205 ng l 1 shuangtaizi river 6 in summer 2018 and from 2 0 ng l 1 yalu river 3 to 264 ng l 1 yu river 32 in fall 2018 fig 1 tables s8 s9 except for the rivers xiaoling 7 dagu paiwu 23 and yu 32 higher contamination levels were observed in summer than in fall fig 1 tables s8 s9 the median insecticides was significantly higher p 1 6 10 6 in summer 72 4 ng l 1 than in fall 23 4 ng l 1 with major contributions from neonicotinoids this outcome was expected since diffuse sources agricultural applications in particular are presumed to be the main source of contamination moreover application rates of neonicotinoids are normally lower in fall than summer and spring since neonicotinoids are widely used via seed coating spring and spraying summer bonmatin et al 2015 jeschke et al 2011 this result is also in accordance with the seasonal precipitation rates in the bohai sea region with most of the annual precipitation occurring in the summer months june august liu et al 2021 as neonicotinoids exhibit a moderate to high water solubility and low to moderate soil affinity lewis et al 2016 heavy rainfalls support their rapid transport into natural waterways through surface runoff from agricultural soils anderson et al 2015 morrissey et al 2015 in summer the shuangtaizi 6 tuhai 25 and ta 34 rivers exhibited the highest insecticide contamination with insecticides between 201 and 205 ng l 1 rivers surrounding the bohai and laizhou bays were the most contaminated whereas the rivers emptying into the northern yellow sea showed relatively low insecticides fig 1 in fact the spatial distribution of insecticides in summer shows that the rivers flowing into the south southwest of the bohai sea are generally much more contaminated than those flowing into the north northeast of the bohai and yellow seas fig 1 in fall spatial differences could not be easily identified except that the rivers flowing into the laizhou bay were clearly the most contaminated ones fig 1 the yu river 32 presented a insecticides of 264 ng l 1 that was surprisingly higher than the maximum insecticides observed in summer this was mostly related to the elevated levels of imidacloprid fall 88 3 ng l 1 summer 30 3 ng l 1 and its tp desnitro imidacloprid fall 106 ng l 1 summer 8 3 ng l 1 observed in the above mentioned river in fall the xiaoling 7 and dagu paiwu 23 rivers also showed increased concentration levels of several neonicotinoids in fall compared to summer particularly acetamiprid clothianidin and thiamethoxam these results suggest point sources contamination from pesticide manufacturing sites further upstream neighboring rivers of the yu river 32 i e the jie 31 and ta 34 rivers were the only ones also showing high insecticides in fall of 145 and 115 ng l 1 respectively confirming that the laizhou bay was the area with the greatest insecticide input from rivers in fall when looking at the individual compounds the concentrations of several neonicotinoids acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid thiamethoxam fipronil and all tps were significantly higher p 0 02 in summer than in fall while no significant seasonal disparity was observed for dinotefuran imidaclothiz nitenpyram and thiacloprid in both seasons acetamiprid and desnitro imidacloprid were predominant in river water both with a df of 100 table 1 clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were also ubiquitous all with 100 df in summer and 69 clothianidin and 97 imidacloprid thiamehoxam in fall table 1 concentration ranges of acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid thiacloprid and thiamethoxam table 1 were comparable to those presented in several rivers along the chinese east coast and pearl rivers chen et al 2019 yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 new types of neonicotinoids dinotefuran nitenpyram were detected at much lower levels in this work table 1 than in the rivers along the chinese east coast and japanese estuaries chen et al 2019 hano et al 2019 imidaclothiz was solely found in three rivers in summer with a concentration of 1 93 22 0 ng l 1 the cis neonicotinoid cycloxaprid and the sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor were not detected possibly related to their recent introduction in the chinese market in 2015 and 2013 respectively hou et al 2017 yao et al 2017 to our knowledge contamination of imidaclothiz and sulfoxaflor has only been studied in china so far chen et al 2019 mahai et al 2019 pan et al 2020 while cycloxaprid has never been reported in this study the maximum concentration observed for imidaclothiz 22 0 ng l 1 was approximately four times lower than in the yangtze river chen et al 2019 compared to the well established neonicotinoids acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam fipronil was similarly frequent 69 but with significantly lower concentrations in both seasons table 1 the high dfs of fipronil may be related to the fact that even though fipronil has been restricted in china for agricultural applications since 2009 it is still authorized for maize seed coating and indoor applications besides veterinary and domestic uses li et al 2019 shi et al 2021 on the other hand its restricted use may explain why fipronil was detected at significantly lower concentrations compared to the above mentioned neonicotinoids among its tps fipronil sulfone was the most frequently detected in both seasons 92 followed by fipronil desulfinyl 92 and fipronil sulfide 83 table 1 the maximum fipronil concentration observed in this study 8 64 ng l 1 was much lower than in japan and singapore hano et al 2019 xu et al 2011 but higher than in the yangtze river estuary and elbe river michel et al 2016 pan et al 2020 few studies investigated the tps of fipronil and imidacloprid hano et al 2019 michel et al 2016 montiel leon et al 2019 pan et al 2020 in the present work the maximum concentration of desnitro imidacloprid 106 ng l 1 was higher than that detected in canada and japan up to 34 ng l 1 hano et al 2019 montiel leon et al 2019 fipronil desulfinyl fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone were also found in higher concentrations in this study table 1 than in the yangtze river estuary and the elbe river michel et al 2016 pan et al 2020 3 2 contamination levels in seawater seawater contamination was found at the low ng l 1 level for both seasons table 1 fig 1 in summer 2018 the insecticides ranged from 0 23 to 4 7 ng l 1 and in fall 2018 from 0 17 to 2 8 ng l 1 tables s10 s11 contamination levels were higher during summer than fall but no significant seasonal disparity p 0 56 of insecticides was identified fig 1 in summer the bohai bay was the most contaminated fig 1 with insecticides ranging from 0 29 to 4 7 ng l 1 in fall the laizhou bay exhibited the highest insecticides range 0 35 to 2 8 ng l 1 fig 1 when looking at the individual compounds only thiacloprid and fipronil desulfinyl were significantly higher pthiacloprid 3 5 10 3 pfipronil desulfinyl 7 1 10 7 in summer than fall but with concentrations mostly between mdl and mql tables s10 s11 acetamiprid was the most abundant with 100 df in summer and fall table 1 except for thiacloprid all other neonicotinoids were rarely detected table 1 imidacloprid was only detected in three samples in summer table 1 clothianidin was detected in only one sample in summer and in two samples in fall table 1 neither new neonicotinoids cycloxaprid dinotefuran imidaclothiz and nitenpyram nor sulfoxaflor were detected in seawater in both seasons to the best of our knowledge insecticide contamination of seawater has only been investigated in two further chinese coastal waters li et al 2019 pan et al 2020 and in portugal sousa et al 2020 all of these published very recently concentration levels of neonicotinoids were similar to those detected in the jiaozhou bay li et al 2019 and east china sea pan et al 2020 but much lower than in seawater from the portuguese atlantic coast sousa et al 2020 however it has to be considered that for the study by sousa et al 2020 seawater samples were not collected offshore but from beaches fipronil and its tps were found at slightly lower levels compared to the jiaozhou bay another semi enclosed bay on the northeastern coast of china li et al 2019 none of these studies analyzed desnitro imidacloprid which was frequently detected in the bohai sea table 1 nor did they analyze new insecticides such as cycloxaprid and sulfoxaflor dinotefuran was only analyzed in one further study pan et al 2020 whereas imidaclothiz nitenpyram and fipronil and its tps were only analyzed in chinese coastal waters li et al 2019 pan et al 2020 this study 3 3 comparison between river and seawater contamination levels acetamiprid was the only insecticide detected in all river and seawater samples in summer and fall 2018 this ubiquitous presence indicates a high persistence and stability of this neonicotinoid in surface waters which is in accordance with its aqueous stable hydrolysis and moderately long photolysis half life 34 days lewis et al 2016 in contrast to all other compounds thiacloprid showed higher dfs in seawater than in river water table 1 but mostly at concentrations between mdl and mql tables s10 s11 nevertheless concentrations of thiacloprid in river water were also relatively low up to 5 4 ng l 1 therefore these results suggest that concentrations of thiacloprid in rivers were greatly diluted in seawater rather than having degraded revealing a high persistence of this neonicotinoid in surface waters besides acetamiprid thiacloprid is the only other neonicotinoid that tends to be stable against photolysis and hydrolysis in surface waters lewis et al 2016 morrissey et al 2015 thus explaining its high persistence even at such low concentrations clothianidin and imidacloprid were frequently detected in river water but not in seawater table 1 indicating a rapid degradation in surface waters this is in accordance with their short aqueous photolysis half lives of 0 1 clothianidin and 0 2 imidacloprid days lewis et al 2016 correspondingly desnitro imidacloprid which is primarily formed by photodegradation in surface waters ding and lavine 2011 warmhoff and schneider 1999 showed a high df in seawater 70 88 fipronil desulfinyl the photodegradation product of fipronil gunasekara et al 2007 michel et al 2016 was also more abundant in seawater than its parent compound table 1 which also agrees with the short aqueous photolysis half life of fipronil 0 33 days lewis et al 2016 contrastingly fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone were rarely detected in seawater 4 and 11 respectively while being highly abundant in river water 83 and 92 respectively table 1 these compounds are more likely formed in soil via reduction fipronil sulfide or oxidation fipronil sulfone and via biotic processes but not necessarily in surface waters gunasekara et al 2007 michel et al 2016 moreover these two compounds have a considerable affinity to particulate matter cryder et al 2019 sadaria et al 2017 therefore the low abundance of fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone in seawater but not in river water might be attributed mostly to dilution degradation and or sink into riverbeds their high occurrence in river water however might be attributed to their formation in soil or urban surfaces and further transport to the rivers via runoff during rainfall events or irrigation or to their discharge from wastewater treatment plants industrial complexes or storm drain outfalls borsuah et al 2020 cryder et al 2019 gan et al 2012 sadaria et al 2017 depending on the degradation pathway several environmental factors can influence the degradation of neonicotinoids and fipronil in surface waters the abiotic degradation of systemic insecticides in aqueous environments is affected by water temperature ph and proportion of transmitted sunlight this latter depending on water depth turbidity and wavelength of incident radiation acero et al 2019 bonmatin et al 2015 pena et al 2011 the microbial degradation can be influenced by temperature and microbial community composition bonmatin et al 2015 by means of a correlation analysis he et al 2021 ascertained that water temperature was the environmental factor with the greatest impact on the spatiotemporal distribution of neonicotinoids and fipronil in seawater the data in our study do not allow for any proper correlation between water temperature and concentration levels of neonicotinoids fipronil and tps since only two seasons were investigated nevertheless water temperature and proportion of transmitted sunlight into the bohai sea and its surrounding rivers certainly play a role on the degradation of the target insecticides and tps to explain the spatiotemporal distribution of neonicotinoids and fipronil in this study however insecticide application time and rates point sources and possible rainfall events before sampling were identified as factors of greater relevance in general a similar spatial distribution of insecticide concentration levels in seawater and river water was observed indicating the discharge of target compounds from the rivers to the corresponding coastal area the discharge of neonicotinoids and fipronil from rivers to the adjacent sea has also been reported by li et al 2019 and pan et al 2020 at decreasing concentrations with increasing distance from the shore as it would be expected and generally lower dfs for the open sea pan et al 2020 than for semi enclosed marginal seas li et al 2019 this study surprisingly sousa et al 2020 observed a different trend where concentrations of neonicotinoids were much higher in seawater than in estuarine water samples 3 4 insecticide fingerprint analysis in river and seawater overall the contamination patterns of the different predefined investigation areas figure s2 were similar where the most dominant compounds in river water were acetamiprid clothianidin desnitro imidacloprid imidacloprid and thiamethoxam whereas in seawater were acetamiprid and desnitro imidacloprid table 2 the fact that the most dominant compounds in seawater were reduced to only acetamiprid and desnitro imidacloprid when compared to river water indicates that the main contributing factors for the observed contamination patterns in seawater were persistence for acetamiprid photodegradation for imidacloprid and strong dilution and degradation for clothianidin and thiamethoxam these substance patterns in river and seawater agree with the absolute results presented in table 1 the fingerprints resemblance observed for river waters table 2 also confirmed by the significant positive correlations observed between all river investigation areas fig 2 indicates that similar contamination sources were present these must be mostly diffuse and originating from agricultural areas with predominant application of well established neonicotinoids across the entire bohai region these results disagree with the patterns identified by chen et al 2019 where new neonicotinoids like dinotefuran and nitenpyram dominated the contribution profile of the chinese northeastern rivers and the yellow river the different sampling year 2016 for chen et al 2019 and 2018 for our study might be the reason for the different patterns observed indicating possible shifts on the type of neonicotinoids being applied further monitoring should be performed in order to understand if these shifts are recurrently happening in the region as with the rivers the fingerprints resemblance observed for seawater across the whole bohai sea table 2 also confirmed by the significant positive correlations observed between most seawater investigation areas fig 2 indicates that similar sources were present the surrounding rivers must be the main source of contamination as confirmed by the fingerprint correlations observed between investigation areas of river and seawater fig 2 for example in summer a significant positive correlation of the fingerprints in seawater of the bohai bay and its surrounding rivers was observed fig 2 even though in summer river water samples were collected a few days after seawater samples the results strongly indicate an input of the surrounding rivers into that bay similarly significant positive fingerprint correlations were identified in fall between the laizhou bay or bohai strait and rivers flowing into the bohai and liaodong bays fig 2 which agree with typical current flow patterns in fall li et al 2005 wang et al 2016 in summer the fingerprints of the bohai strait did not show any correlation with fingerprints of river water fig 2 this might be related to the stronger oceanic currents normally present in august but also to the bigger water exchange in that area since a greater influence of oceanic currents originating from the yellow sea seem to occur at this time of the year li et al 2005 wang et al 2016 this indicates once again that river discharges are the main source of contamination of shallow coastal seas the weaker fingerprint correlations observed in both seasons between river and seawater of the laizhou and liaodong bays fig 2 are most probably associated with the smaller amount of rivers sampled in these areas and the resulting lower insecticides for the liaodong bay a stronger dilution due to the bigger area most certainly is another contributing factor a clear seasonal trend was identified for imidacloprid and desnitro imidacloprid in river water table 2 the relative contribution of desnitro imidacloprid was greater in fall than in summer while it was lower for imidacloprid table 2 desnitro imidacloprid was also dominant in seawater whereas imidacloprid did not show any relevant contribution table 2 these results indicate again a rapid photodegradation of imidacloprid to desnitro imidacloprid ding and lavine 2011 warmhoff and schneider 1999 a high contribution of thiacloprid for seawater in the bohai strait in summer was also observed table 2 although this contribution was mostly related to values mql table s11 nevertheless this confirms our claim in section 3 3 that thiacloprid is highly persistent in surface waters 3 5 ecological risk assessment for the ecological risk assessment of target analytes a distinction was made for freshwater and seawater table 3 since marine ecosystems exhibit a greater species diversity and thus a broader distribution of species sensitivities than freshwater systems ec 2003 contrary to mahai et al 2019 and sousa et al 2019 who also estimated the risk of neonicotinoids to riverine ecosystems based on risk quotients medium to high potential risks were identified for several neonicotinoids clothianidin imidacloprid thiacloprid and thiamethoxam in at least one season table 3 the discrepancy with previously reported risk quotients can be ascribed to lower effective concentrations reported in the ecotox database for freshwater species compared to other databases such as the pesticide properties database ppdb used by mahai et al 2019 and thus lower pnec values table 3 moreover sousa et al 2019 only focused on acute toxicity data predicted by the ecosar class program but not necessarily on long term toxicity experimental data to aquatic organisms in contrast to its parent compound desnitro imidacloprid represented a low to medium risk only however the pnec used was based on a quantitative structure relationship model aalizadeh et al 2017 due to lack of experimental toxicity data on freshwater and marine species thus this classification should be rated as preliminary fipronil and its tps were classified as medium to high potential risk in river water for both seasons table 3 this strongly suggests not only a similar persistence but also a similar toxicity of the tps in the aquatic environment which has already been reported in previous risk assessment studies michel et al 2016 weston and lydy 2014 wu et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report an ecological risk assessment of neonicotinoids fipronil sulfoxaflor and the selected tps for marine ecosystems due to the limited availability of ecotoxicological data for the required trophic levels of saltwater species high assessment factors of 1000 to 10 000 had to be applied to most compounds table 3 acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid and thiacloprid represented a medium to high potential risk to marine organisms table 3 like in freshwater fipronil was classified as high risk in summer and fall table 3 among its tps toxicity data were only available for fipronil sulfide which also showed a high potential risk table 3 based on the results for freshwater a similarly high toxicity of fipronil desulfinyl and fipronil sulfone is suspected for marine organisms however it could not yet be proven thus there is a demand for improving the ecotoxicological data on marine test organisms for imidaclothiz the ecological risk assessment could not be performed due to lack of ecotoxicological data in fresh and marine waters cycloxaprid and sulfoxaflor were not detected in this study assuming their mdl in river water and seawater table s7 as maximum measured concentrations both compounds would represent a low risk to freshwater species and sulfoxaflor to marine species 4 conclusion this study indicates that a clear preference remains for well established neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and fipronil in the bohai region from our results we conclude that the continued use of acetamiprid fipronil imidacloprid and thiacloprid may lead to their accumulation or of their tps in marine waters to their transport to open seas and to a potential increased risk to marine organisms the high incidence of photodegradation products of fipronil and imidacloprid in seawater observed in the present study indicates that photodegradation products of neonicotinoids in general should be further investigated in marine environments from our results riverine discharges are the main source of contamination of adjacent coastal areas fingerprint analysis whereas diffuse sources are the main source of river contamination seasonal disparity therefore a stricter control of these compounds in agricultural and domestic use as well as further insecticide monitoring of riverine and marine ecosystems is recommended this is the first study to perform an ecological risk assessment on marine ecosystems the results indicate that several well established neonicotinoids as well as fipronil and its tps represent a potential high risk to freshwater and marine organisms this strongly indicates the environmental relevance of studying these compounds in surface waters toxicity data on marine test species are still lacking and are therefore needed for further assessment of the potential ecological risks of the studied insecticides and tps funding this work was supported by the soa state oceanic

16409,systemic insecticides like neonicotinoids and the phenylpyrazole insecticide fipronil are the most widely applied insecticides around the world multiple studies analyzed insecticide residues in freshwater systems but data on seawater contamination levels are scarce this study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution and ecological risk assessment of fipronil neonicotinoids sulfoxaflor and selected transformation products tps in the chinese bohai sea and its surrounding rivers well established neonicotinoids acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid thiacloprid and thiamethoxam and tps of fipronil and imidacloprid were frequently detected detection frequency df 42 100 in freshwater the median total insecticide concentration in freshwater was significantly higher in summer 72 4 ng l 1 than in fall 23 4 ng l 1 with major contributions from neonicotinoids suggesting that pollution originates mostly from diffuse sources in 2018 acetamiprid desnitro imidacloprid fipronil desulfinyl and thiacloprid were abundant in seawater df 47 100 indicating a high stability of acetamiprid and thiacloprid and a rapid photodegradation of fipronil and imidacloprid in surface waters these results indicate that the continued use of these parent compounds may lead to their accumulation and or of their tps in shallow coastal seas consequently this may lead to their transport to open seas increasing their potential risk to marine organisms similarities between contaminant fingerprints in freshwater and seawater strongly suggest riverine discharges as main pollution source of adjacent coastal areas this is the first study to perform an ecological risk assessment of fipronil neonicotinoids sulfoxaflor and selected tps on marine ecosystems fipronil and its tps demonstrated to be environmentally relevant with potential high risks for aquatic species our study provides novel insights into the fate and ecological risk of fipronil neonicotinoids sulfoxaflor and their tps to

ecotoxicological risk 1 introduction in the last decades neonicotinoids and the phenylpyrazole insecticide fipronil have become the most widely consumed insecticides globally bass et al 2015 simon delso et al 2015 their fast growing popularity is related to their versatility of use systemic nature and long persistence ensuring the overall protection of crops against sap feeding insects over long periods bass et al 2015 bonmatin et al 2015 meanwhile numerous studies have revealed severe ecological risks of neonicotinoids and fipronil to pollinators birds mammals and aquatic organisms gibbons et al 2015 jensen 2019 van der sluijs et al 2013 weston and lydy 2014 moreover it was demonstrated that neonicotinoids indirectly reduce fish and bird populations by disrupting food webs hallmann et al 2014 yamamuro et al 2019 in europe outdoor applications of clothianidin fipronil imidacloprid and thiamethoxam have been gradually restricted due to proven toxicity to bees ec 2013 2013a whereas thiacloprid was completely banned in 2020 ec 2019 moreover neonicotinoids have been incorporated into a watch list of substances for the european monitoring program in surface waters eu 2015 495 due to possible threats to aquatic organisms ec 2015 contrastingly china has expanded its pesticide use over the last decade and has emerged as the largest producer exporter and consumer of pesticides where insecticides account for the largest proportion fao 2020 several studies reported the occurrence of neonicotinoids and fipronil in various surface water bodies at ecotoxicologically relevant concentrations chen et al 2019 morrissey et al 2015 sousa et al 2019 weston and lydy 2014 wu et al 2015 moreover it has been demonstrated that they are persistent enough to reach coastal areas li et al 2019 sousa et al 2020 nevertheless very few studies globally have investigated these insecticides in seawater li et al 2019 pan et al 2020 sousa et al 2020 and no ecological risk assessment has been performed to marine organisms so far neonicotinoids and fipronil are hydrolytically stable in surface waters but most of them are also sensitive to photodegradation anderson et al 2015 bonmatin et al 2015 gunasekara et al 2007 additionally biotransformation and microbial degradation are equally relevant fate processes for neonicotinoids and fipronil in soils anderson et al 2015 gunasekara et al 2007 michel et al 2016 therefore it is important to investigate these compounds and their transformation products tps in surface waters particularly seawater and to evaluate their risk to freshwater and marine organisms this study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of nine neonicotinoids fipronil sulfoxaflor and four selected tps in river and seawater of the bohai region china fingerprint analysis is performed to identify similarities in contaminant patterns between river and seawater the ecological risk for freshwater and marine species is estimated based on risk quotients rq 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals this study covered 15 insecticide compounds 9 neonicotinoids acetamiprid clothianidin cycloxaprid dinotefuran imidacloprid imidaclothiz

fipronil sulfone and a sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor eleven isotopically labeled internal standards is were used table s1 detailed information on the analytical standards and chemicals used for sample analysis is presented in section s1 2 2 study area the bohai sea is a semi enclosed marginal sea in the northeast of china with an area of approximately 77 000 km² zhang et al 2006 it consists of three bays liaodong bay bohai bay and laizhou bay a central area and the bohai strait that connects the bohai sea with the yellow sea gao et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 the coastal region surrounding the bohai sea including shandong province liaoning province hebei province and tianjin municipality belongs to one of the most densely populated and industrialized regions in china zhao et al 2018 there are approximately 100 rivers draining into the bohai sea among which the rivers yellow shuangtaizi daliao and luan are the major ones gao et al 2014 2 3 sampling in 2018 two sampling campaigns were conducted in the bohai sea on board of the chinese research vessel chuangxin i one in summer 18 25 august and one in fall 23 november 14 december surface seawater samples were collected at approximately 5 m depth using a sbe991plus ctd sea bird scientific usa in summer 47 seawater samples were collected figure s2 whereas in fall only 34 sampling stations were possible to be collected due to bad weather conditions that impeded the research vessel from navigating into the remaining planned stations another 2 sampling campaigns were conducted in 2018 to 36 major rivers around the bohai sea and northern yellow sea approximately at the same time as the bohai sea campaigns i e one in summer 23 30 august and one in fall 29 october 7 november these 36 rivers account for 90 of the total water discharge into the bohai sea the river water sampling stations figure s2 were located as close as possible to the river mouths while avoiding the influence of salt water more detailed information on the location of river sampling sites and sampling procedure is described in wang et al 2015 all water samples were collected in 1 l polypropylene pp bottles wrapped in aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation of photosensitive compounds rinsed twice with sampling water and stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis coordinates of river and seawater sampling sites and physicochemical properties are provided in section s2 2 4 sample extraction and instrumental analysis prior to analyte enrichment via automated solid phase extraction spe on a lc tech freestyle xana workbench lc tech

conditioned with 10 ml methanol and equilibrated with 10 ml ultrapure water sample loading was performed at a flow rate of 8 ml min 1 see section s5 for results on the test of different loading speeds after a washing step with 10 ml ultrapure water containing 5 methanol 95 5 v v the cartridges were dried under nitrogen for 60 min the target analytes were eluted using 10 ml methanol the eluate was reduced to 800 µl with vacuum using the evaporation module of the lc tech workbench after filtrating the sample extracts through regenerated cellulose syringe filters 100 µl sample extract were withdrawn and diluted with 400 µl methanol and 500 µl ultrapure water during method development and validation both filtration steps before and after spe were assessed for any impact on the absolute recoveries of target analytes and no effects were observed for all compounds target insecticides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms details on the instrumental analysis and quantification procedure are described in sections s3 and s4 respectively 2 5 quality control and quality assurance detailed information on the determination

117 with a precision of 3 18 absolute recovery ranges of the validated method also based on several matrix spiking levels were 45 102 in seawater and 33 104 in river water mdls of individual insecticides ranged between 0 01 and 0 45 ng l 1 in seawater and 0 05 and 2 4 ng l 1 in river water mqls ranged between 0 10 and 1 0 ng l 1 in seawater and 0 10 and 7 8 ng l 1 in river water relative recoveries mdls mqls calibration curve ranges and regression coefficients of target analytes are presented in table s7 to reduce any risk of contamination a cleaning cycle for the automated spe and evaporation chamber was performed before and after each sample batch for monitoring possible carry over of target compounds during hplc ms ms analysis a solvent blank consisting of methanol ultrapure water 50 50 v v was injected every fourth sample ultrapure water or artificial seawater prepared with ultrapure water 32 psu was used as procedural blanks during the automated spe of each sample batch additionally three field blanks were used during the fall sampling campaign to the bohai sea they consisted of pre filled 1 l ultrapure water in sampling bottles which were opened at random stations during sampling and treated as normal samples from this step onwards no field blanks were used during the summer sampling campaign no target compounds were detected in instrumental or procedural blanks one field blank showed a contamination with fipronil fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone in quantifiable amounts 0 13 0 10 and 0 5 ng l 1 respectively nevertheless since these compounds were not detected at the corresponding station in which this field blank was handled and this was an isolated case within all blanks used for which we could not trace the origin we disregarded it 2 6 data and fingerprint analysis for presentation of results median concentrations were calculated for target analytes with a detection frequency df 50 in river or seawater while concentration ranges are presented for compounds with a df 50 statistical analyses for comparison of contamination levels between seasons in river and seawater and between individual compounds within the same season are described in section s6 fingerprint analysis was carried out to identify specific contaminant patterns in river and seawater in predefined investigation areas bohai bay laizhou bay liaodong bay northern yellow sea central bohai sea bohai strait see figure s2 this was performed by calculating the relative contribution of each insecticide using an adapted approach of the united states environmental protection agency usepa plumb 2004 whereby the df in each investigation area was applied as weighing factor suehring et al 2015 an insecticide was considered relevant for a given investigation area if its relative contribution was 10 further information on the calculation of relative contributions is provided in section s7 in order to identify potential affiliations between contaminant patterns in seawater and river water for the predefined investigation areas a spearman s correlation analysis was performed 2 7 ecological risk assessment potential ecological risks to marine and freshwater species were estimated by means of risk quotients rq according to the european technical guidance document on risk assessment ec 2003 the rqs were calculated as the ratio between the maximum measured environmental concentrations mec and the predicted no effect concentrations pnec the pnecs were derived from ecotoxicological data i e no observed effect concentrations noec median lethal concentrations lc50 or median effective concentrations ec50 available in the ecotox database of the usepa in combination with appropriate safety assessment factors ec 2003 sousa et al 2019 rqs were ranked as follows low risk for rq 0 1 medium risk for 0 1 rq 1 and high risk for rq 1 hernando et al 2006 sanchez bayo et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination levels in river water the total concentration of insecticides insecticides ranged from 5 1 ng l 1 luan river 14 to 205 ng l 1 shuangtaizi river 6 in summer 2018 and from 2 0 ng l 1 yalu river 3 to 264 ng l 1 yu river 32 in fall 2018 fig 1 tables s8 s9 except for the rivers xiaoling 7 dagu paiwu 23 and yu 32 higher contamination levels were observed in summer than in fall fig 1 tables s8 s9 the median insecticides was significantly higher p 1 6 10 6 in summer 72 4 ng l 1 than in fall 23 4 ng l 1 with major contributions from neonicotinoids this outcome was expected since diffuse sources agricultural applications in particular are presumed to be the main source of contamination moreover application rates of neonicotinoids are normally lower in fall than summer and spring since neonicotinoids are widely used via seed coating spring and spraying summer bonmatin et al 2015 jeschke et al 2011 this result is also in accordance with the seasonal precipitation rates in the bohai sea region with most of the annual precipitation occurring in the summer months june august liu et al 2021 as neonicotinoids exhibit a moderate to high water solubility and low to moderate soil affinity lewis et al 2016 heavy rainfalls support their rapid transport into natural waterways through surface runoff from agricultural soils anderson et al 2015 morrissey et al 2015 in summer the shuangtaizi 6 tuhai 25 and ta 34 rivers exhibited the highest insecticide contamination with insecticides between 201 and 205 ng l 1 rivers surrounding the bohai and laizhou bays were the most contaminated whereas the rivers emptying into the northern yellow sea showed relatively low insecticides fig 1 in fact the spatial distribution of insecticides in summer shows that the rivers flowing into the south southwest of the bohai sea are generally much more contaminated than those flowing into the north northeast of the bohai and yellow seas fig 1 in fall spatial differences could not be easily identified except that the rivers flowing into the laizhou bay were clearly the most contaminated ones fig 1 the yu river 32 presented a insecticides of 264 ng l 1 that was surprisingly higher than the maximum insecticides observed in summer this was mostly related to the elevated levels of imidacloprid fall 88 3 ng l 1 summer 30 3 ng l 1 and its tp desnitro imidacloprid fall 106 ng l 1 summer 8 3 ng l 1 observed in the above mentioned river in fall the xiaoling 7 and dagu paiwu 23 rivers also showed increased concentration levels of several neonicotinoids in fall compared to summer particularly acetamiprid clothianidin and thiamethoxam these results suggest point sources contamination from pesticide manufacturing sites further upstream neighboring rivers of the yu river 32 i e the jie 31 and ta 34 rivers were the only ones also showing high insecticides in fall of 145 and 115 ng l 1 respectively confirming that the laizhou bay was the area with the greatest insecticide input from rivers in fall when looking at the individual compounds the concentrations of several neonicotinoids acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid thiamethoxam fipronil and all tps were significantly higher p 0 02 in summer than in fall while no significant seasonal disparity was observed for dinotefuran imidaclothiz nitenpyram and thiacloprid in both seasons acetamiprid and desnitro imidacloprid were predominant in river water both with a df of 100 table 1 clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were also ubiquitous all with 100 df in summer and 69 clothianidin and 97 imidacloprid thiamehoxam in fall table 1 concentration ranges of acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid thiacloprid and thiamethoxam table 1 were comparable to those presented in several rivers along the chinese east coast and pearl rivers chen et al 2019 yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 new types of neonicotinoids dinotefuran nitenpyram were detected at much lower levels in this work table 1 than in the rivers along the chinese east coast and japanese estuaries chen et al 2019 hano et al 2019 imidaclothiz was solely found in three rivers in summer with a concentration of 1 93 22 0 ng l 1 the cis neonicotinoid cycloxaprid and the sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor were not detected possibly related to their recent introduction in the chinese market in 2015 and 2013 respectively hou et al 2017 yao et al 2017 to our knowledge contamination of imidaclothiz and sulfoxaflor has only been studied in china so far chen et al 2019 mahai et al 2019 pan et al 2020 while cycloxaprid has never been reported in this study the maximum concentration observed for imidaclothiz 22 0 ng l 1 was approximately four times lower than in the yangtze river chen et al 2019 compared to the well established neonicotinoids acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam fipronil was similarly frequent 69 but with significantly lower concentrations in both seasons table 1 the high dfs of fipronil may be related to the fact that even though fipronil has been restricted in china for agricultural applications since 2009 it is still authorized for maize seed coating and indoor applications besides veterinary and domestic uses li et al 2019 shi et al 2021 on the other hand its restricted use may explain why fipronil was detected at significantly lower concentrations compared to the above mentioned neonicotinoids among its tps fipronil sulfone was the most frequently detected in both seasons 92 followed by fipronil desulfinyl 92 and fipronil sulfide 83 table 1 the maximum fipronil concentration observed in this study 8 64 ng l 1 was much lower than in japan and singapore hano et al 2019 xu et al 2011 but higher than in the yangtze river estuary and elbe river michel et al 2016 pan et al 2020 few studies investigated the tps of fipronil and imidacloprid hano et al 2019 michel et al 2016 montiel leon et al 2019 pan et al 2020 in the present work the maximum concentration of desnitro imidacloprid 106 ng l 1 was higher than that detected in canada and japan up to 34 ng l 1 hano et al 2019 montiel leon et al 2019 fipronil desulfinyl fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone were also found in higher concentrations in this study table 1 than in the yangtze river estuary and the elbe river michel et al 2016 pan et al 2020 3 2 contamination levels in seawater seawater contamination was found at the low ng l 1 level for both seasons table 1 fig 1 in summer 2018 the insecticides ranged from 0 23 to 4 7 ng l 1 and in fall 2018 from 0 17 to 2 8 ng l 1 tables s10 s11 contamination levels were higher during summer than fall but no significant seasonal disparity p 0 56 of insecticides was identified fig 1 in summer the bohai bay was the most contaminated fig 1 with insecticides ranging from 0 29 to 4 7 ng l 1 in fall the laizhou bay exhibited the highest insecticides range 0 35 to 2 8 ng l 1 fig 1 when looking at the individual compounds only thiacloprid and fipronil desulfinyl were significantly higher pthiacloprid 3 5 10 3 pfipronil desulfinyl 7 1 10 7 in summer than fall but with concentrations mostly between mdl and mql tables s10 s11 acetamiprid was the most abundant with 100 df in summer and fall table 1 except for thiacloprid all other neonicotinoids were rarely detected table 1 imidacloprid was only detected in three samples in summer table 1 clothianidin was detected in only one sample in summer and in two samples in fall table 1 neither new neonicotinoids cycloxaprid dinotefuran imidaclothiz and nitenpyram nor sulfoxaflor were detected in seawater in both seasons to the best of our knowledge insecticide contamination of seawater has only been investigated in two further chinese coastal waters li et al 2019 pan et al 2020 and in portugal sousa et al 2020 all of these published very recently concentration levels of neonicotinoids were similar to those detected in the jiaozhou bay li et al 2019 and east china sea pan et al 2020 but much lower than in seawater from the portuguese atlantic coast sousa et al 2020 however it has to be considered that for the study by sousa et al 2020 seawater samples were not collected offshore but from beaches fipronil and its tps were found at slightly lower levels compared to the jiaozhou bay another semi enclosed bay on the northeastern coast of china li et al 2019 none of these studies analyzed desnitro imidacloprid which was frequently detected in the bohai sea table 1 nor did they analyze new insecticides such as cycloxaprid and sulfoxaflor dinotefuran was only analyzed in one further study pan et al 2020 whereas imidaclothiz nitenpyram and fipronil and its tps were only analyzed in chinese coastal waters li et al 2019 pan et al 2020 this study 3 3 comparison between river and seawater contamination levels acetamiprid was the only insecticide detected in all river and seawater samples in summer and fall 2018 this ubiquitous presence indicates a high persistence and stability of this neonicotinoid in surface waters which is in accordance with its aqueous stable hydrolysis and moderately long photolysis half life 34 days lewis et al 2016 in contrast to all other compounds thiacloprid showed higher dfs in seawater than in river water table 1 but mostly at concentrations between mdl and mql tables s10 s11 nevertheless concentrations of thiacloprid in river water were also relatively low up to 5 4 ng l 1 therefore these results suggest that concentrations of thiacloprid in rivers were greatly diluted in seawater rather than having degraded revealing a high persistence of this neonicotinoid in surface waters besides acetamiprid thiacloprid is the only other neonicotinoid that tends to be stable against photolysis and hydrolysis in surface waters lewis et al 2016 morrissey et al 2015 thus explaining its high persistence even at such low concentrations clothianidin and imidacloprid were frequently detected in river water but not in seawater table 1 indicating a rapid degradation in surface waters this is in accordance with their short aqueous photolysis half lives of 0 1 clothianidin and 0 2 imidacloprid days lewis et al 2016 correspondingly desnitro imidacloprid which is primarily formed by photodegradation in surface waters ding and lavine 2011 warmhoff and schneider 1999 showed a high df in seawater 70 88 fipronil desulfinyl the photodegradation product of fipronil gunasekara et al 2007 michel et al 2016 was also more abundant in seawater than its parent compound table 1 which also agrees with the short aqueous photolysis half life of fipronil 0 33 days lewis et al 2016 contrastingly fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone were rarely detected in seawater 4 and 11 respectively while being highly abundant in river water 83 and 92 respectively table 1 these compounds are more likely formed in soil via reduction fipronil sulfide or oxidation fipronil sulfone and via biotic processes but not necessarily in surface waters gunasekara et al 2007 michel et al 2016 moreover these two compounds have a considerable affinity to particulate matter cryder et al 2019 sadaria et al 2017 therefore the low abundance of fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone in seawater but not in river water might be attributed mostly to dilution degradation and or sink into riverbeds their high occurrence in river water however might be attributed to their formation in soil or urban surfaces and further transport to the rivers via runoff during rainfall events or irrigation or to their discharge from wastewater treatment plants industrial complexes or storm drain outfalls borsuah et al 2020 cryder et al 2019 gan et al 2012 sadaria et al 2017 depending on the degradation pathway several environmental factors can influence the degradation of neonicotinoids and fipronil in surface waters the abiotic degradation of systemic insecticides in aqueous environments is affected by water temperature ph and proportion of transmitted sunlight this latter depending on water depth turbidity and wavelength of incident radiation acero et al 2019 bonmatin et al 2015 pena et al 2011 the microbial degradation can be influenced by temperature and microbial community composition bonmatin et al 2015 by means of a correlation analysis he et al 2021 ascertained that water temperature was the environmental factor with the greatest impact on the spatiotemporal distribution of neonicotinoids and fipronil in seawater the data in our study do not allow for any proper correlation between water temperature and concentration levels of neonicotinoids fipronil and tps since only two seasons were investigated nevertheless water temperature and proportion of transmitted sunlight into the bohai sea and its surrounding rivers certainly play a role on the degradation of the target insecticides and tps to explain the spatiotemporal distribution of neonicotinoids and fipronil in this study however insecticide application time and rates point sources and possible rainfall events before sampling were identified as factors of greater relevance in general a similar spatial distribution of insecticide concentration levels in seawater and river water was observed indicating the discharge of target compounds from the rivers to the corresponding coastal area the discharge of neonicotinoids and fipronil from rivers to the adjacent sea has also been reported by li et al 2019 and pan et al 2020 at decreasing concentrations with increasing distance from the shore as it would be expected and generally lower dfs for the open sea pan et al 2020 than for semi enclosed marginal seas li et al 2019 this study surprisingly sousa et al 2020 observed a different trend where concentrations of neonicotinoids were much higher in seawater than in estuarine water samples 3 4 insecticide fingerprint analysis in river and seawater overall the contamination patterns of the different predefined investigation areas figure s2 were similar where the most dominant compounds in river water were acetamiprid clothianidin desnitro imidacloprid imidacloprid and thiamethoxam whereas in seawater were acetamiprid and desnitro imidacloprid table 2 the fact that the most dominant compounds in seawater were reduced to only acetamiprid and desnitro imidacloprid when compared to river water indicates that the main contributing factors for the observed contamination patterns in seawater were persistence for acetamiprid photodegradation for imidacloprid and strong dilution and degradation for clothianidin and thiamethoxam these substance patterns in river and seawater agree with the absolute results presented in table 1 the fingerprints resemblance observed for river waters table 2 also confirmed by the significant positive correlations observed between all river investigation areas fig 2 indicates that similar contamination sources were present these must be mostly diffuse and originating from agricultural areas with predominant application of well established neonicotinoids across the entire bohai region these results disagree with the patterns identified by chen et al 2019 where new neonicotinoids like dinotefuran and nitenpyram dominated the contribution profile of the chinese northeastern rivers and the yellow river the different sampling year 2016 for chen et al 2019 and 2018 for our study might be the reason for the different patterns observed indicating possible shifts on the type of neonicotinoids being applied further monitoring should be performed in order to understand if these shifts are recurrently happening in the region as with the rivers the fingerprints resemblance observed for seawater across the whole bohai sea table 2 also confirmed by the significant positive correlations observed between most seawater investigation areas fig 2 indicates that similar sources were present the surrounding rivers must be the main source of contamination as confirmed by the fingerprint correlations observed between investigation areas of river and seawater fig 2 for example in summer a significant positive correlation of the fingerprints in seawater of the bohai bay and its surrounding rivers was observed fig 2 even though in summer river water samples were collected a few days after seawater samples the results strongly indicate an input of the surrounding rivers into that bay similarly significant positive fingerprint correlations were identified in fall between the laizhou bay or bohai strait and rivers flowing into the bohai and liaodong bays fig 2 which agree with typical current flow patterns in fall li et al 2005 wang et al 2016 in summer the fingerprints of the bohai strait did not show any correlation with fingerprints of river water fig 2 this might be related to the stronger oceanic currents normally present in august but also to the bigger water exchange in that area since a greater influence of oceanic currents originating from the yellow sea seem to occur at this time of the year li et al 2005 wang et al 2016 this indicates once again that river discharges are the main source of contamination of shallow coastal seas the weaker fingerprint correlations observed in both seasons between river and seawater of the laizhou and liaodong bays fig 2 are most probably associated with the smaller amount of rivers sampled in these areas and the resulting lower insecticides for the liaodong bay a stronger dilution due to the bigger area most certainly is another contributing factor a clear seasonal trend was identified for imidacloprid and desnitro imidacloprid in river water table 2 the relative contribution of desnitro imidacloprid was greater in fall than in summer while it was lower for imidacloprid table 2 desnitro imidacloprid was also dominant in seawater whereas imidacloprid did not show any relevant contribution table 2 these results indicate again a rapid photodegradation of imidacloprid to desnitro imidacloprid ding and lavine 2011 warmhoff and schneider 1999 a high contribution of thiacloprid for seawater in the bohai strait in summer was also observed table 2 although this contribution was mostly related to values mql table s11 nevertheless this confirms our claim in section 3 3 that thiacloprid is highly persistent in surface waters 3 5 ecological risk assessment for the ecological risk assessment of target analytes a distinction was made for freshwater and seawater table 3 since marine ecosystems exhibit a greater species diversity and thus a broader distribution of species sensitivities than freshwater systems ec 2003 contrary to mahai et al 2019 and sousa et al 2019 who also estimated the risk of neonicotinoids to riverine ecosystems based on risk quotients medium to high potential risks were identified for several neonicotinoids clothianidin imidacloprid thiacloprid and thiamethoxam in at least one season table 3 the discrepancy with previously reported risk quotients can be ascribed to lower effective concentrations reported in the ecotox database for freshwater species compared to other databases such as the pesticide properties database ppdb used by mahai et al 2019 and thus lower pnec values table 3 moreover sousa et al 2019 only focused on acute toxicity data predicted by the ecosar class program but not necessarily on long term toxicity experimental data to aquatic organisms in contrast to its parent compound desnitro imidacloprid represented a low to medium risk only however the pnec used was based on a quantitative structure relationship model aalizadeh et al 2017 due to lack of experimental toxicity data on freshwater and marine species thus this classification should be rated as preliminary fipronil and its tps were classified as medium to high potential risk in river water for both seasons table 3 this strongly suggests not only a similar persistence but also a similar toxicity of the tps in the aquatic environment which has already been reported in previous risk assessment studies michel et al 2016 weston and lydy 2014 wu et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report an ecological risk assessment of neonicotinoids fipronil sulfoxaflor and the selected tps for marine ecosystems due to the limited availability of ecotoxicological data for the required trophic levels of saltwater species high assessment factors of 1000 to 10 000 had to be applied to most compounds table 3 acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid and thiacloprid represented a medium to high potential risk to marine organisms table 3 like in freshwater fipronil was classified as high risk in summer and fall table 3 among its tps toxicity data were only available for fipronil sulfide which also showed a high potential risk table 3 based on the results for freshwater a similarly high toxicity of fipronil desulfinyl and fipronil sulfone is suspected for marine organisms however it could not yet be proven thus there is a demand for improving the ecotoxicological data on marine test organisms for imidaclothiz the ecological risk assessment could not be performed due to lack of ecotoxicological data in fresh and marine waters cycloxaprid and sulfoxaflor were not detected in this study assuming their mdl in river water and seawater table s7 as maximum measured concentrations both compounds would represent a low risk to freshwater species and sulfoxaflor to marine species 4 conclusion this study indicates that a clear preference remains for well established neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and fipronil in the bohai region from our results we conclude that the continued use of acetamiprid fipronil imidacloprid and thiacloprid may lead to their accumulation or of their tps in marine waters to their transport to open seas and to a potential increased risk to marine organisms the high incidence of photodegradation products of fipronil and imidacloprid in seawater observed in the present study indicates that photodegradation products of neonicotinoids in general should be further investigated in marine environments from our results riverine discharges are the main source of contamination of adjacent coastal areas fingerprint analysis whereas diffuse sources are the main source of river contamination seasonal disparity therefore a stricter control of these compounds in agricultural and domestic use as well as further insecticide monitoring of riverine and marine ecosystems is recommended this is the first study to perform an ecological risk assessment on marine ecosystems the results indicate that several well established neonicotinoids as well as fipronil and its tps represent a potential high risk to freshwater and marine organisms this strongly indicates the environmental relevance of studying these compounds in surface waters toxicity data on marine test species are still lacking and are therefore needed for further assessment of the potential ecological risks of the studied insecticides and tps funding this work was supported by the soa state oceanic
