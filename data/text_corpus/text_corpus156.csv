enrichment lake erie 1 introduction spectral wave models which seek to describe the high frequency band of surface waves generated by the wind and restored to equilibrium pre dominately by gravity see fig 1 have a long history of development dating back to the 1950s see for example the discussions provided by the swamp and wamdi groups the swamp group 1985 wamdi group 1988 the essential feature that sets spectral wave models apart from other wave modeling approaches is the attempt to provide a statistical description of the wave field by modeling the evolution of the wave variance density spectrum rather than attempting to resolve each individual wave train of the sea surface known as the phase resolving approach wei et al 1995 the goal of a spectral wave model is computational tractability by evolving a variance density spectrum various wave properties such as significant wave height and period can be obtained over large domains in a timely fashion some of the early spectral wave models further took advantage of the fact that a portion of the spectrum was observed to have a universal shape when normalized with respect to peak frequency that could be represented by a few parameters this observation led to the development of a class of spectral wave models referred to as parametric wind sea wave models see for example hasselmann et al 1975 a class of models distinct from the traditional discrete spectral models holthuijsen 2007 that are widely used today the primary advantage of parametric wave models is the massive reduction in computational effort that they can afford compared to discrete spectral models the latter directly discretize the so called spectral energy or action in the presence of ambient currents balance equation using a sizable number of frequency typically 30 and direction 36 bins at each computational grid point in geographic space swan in contrast to this parametric wave models solve a coupled set of transport equations at each computational grid point for a small number of parameters typically 6 that describe the wave spectrum the parametric modeling approach is described in more detail in section 2 1 therefore the number of discrete equations used by a parametric model will typically be two orders of magnitude smaller than the number used by a numerically similar discrete spectral model on the same computational grid this reduction in computational effort however comes at the cost of a reduced description of the wave field specifically the wave spectrum will in general consist of both wind sea waves under the influence of the wind that generated them and swell waves that have escaped the influence of the generating wind components see fig 1 with only the former being able to be described parametrically to overcome this deficiency parametric models were often combined with discrete spectral modeling approaches for the swell components only giving rise to so called coupled hybrid models gṻnther et al 1979 which exhibit computational costs somewhere between the pure parametric and full discrete spectral modeling approaches despite the deficiencies of the parametric modeling approach in this paper we show that a return to this earlier efficient parametric approach paired with more advanced numerics proves to be sufficiently accurate for the wind sea cases considered more specifically we recast the parametric wind sea modeling paradigm into a variational weak form that is advantageous to discontinuous galerkin dg methods these methods are locally conservative can handle arbitrary meshes and can dynamically adapt in time via mesh h refinement and polynomial p refinement cockburn and shu 2001 a feature shown in conroy et al 2018 to be instrumental in capturing rapidly changing frequencies associated with large gusts of wind we further demonstrate some advantages of the dg method through a series of hindcasts over lake erie where we compare model output to observational buoy data as well as hindcast data from the well established third generation spectral wave model known as swan results indicate that this simplified parametric approach when paired with advanced numerics produces similar error measures to swan while significantly reducing the computational cost the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss general mathematical approaches to model surface gravity waves and via a number of logical deductions arrive at a simple yet accurate in the proper scenario two parameter wave model we recast this two parameter wave model into a variational weak form that is suitable for the discontinuous galerkin dg finite element method in section 3 and assess the applicability of the model in section 4 via hindcast simulations over lake erie we compare numerical results to observational buoy data as well as to hindcast data from the well established wave model known as swan it is also in section 4 where we demonstrate some advantages of the dg method in terms of using p refinement versus standard h refinement finally in section 5 we discuss some conclusions and future work 2 mathematical approaches a spectral wave model aims to describe the wave environment in a statistical sense i e in the context of the wave dynamics that are most likely to occur under a given physical condition at a specific coordinate in geographic space its foundation is built on the idea that an irregular sea surface can be described as a superposition of a large number of harmonic waves each traveling with a distinct frequency and amplitude at each geographic coordinate the spectral approach describes the sea surface η as a stochastic process and the expected value of the variance of the sea surface i e f 1 2 η 2 is distributed over frequency f and direction θ components to obtain a variance density spectrum 1 f f θ lim δ f 0 δ θ 0 1 δ f 1 δ θ f 1 2 η 2 which gives a complete statistical description of the sea surface elevation if it can be seen as a stationary gaussian process moments of the spectrum mn quantify wave characteristics at a given spatial coordinate 2 m n 0 0 2 π f n f f θ d θ d f for n 2 1 0 1 2 for example the zeroth order moment corresponds to the variance of the surface elevation σ 2 and is defined as 3 σ 2 m 0 0 f f d f the square root of m 0 multiplied by 4 is approximately the so called significant wave height or design wave height for deep water waves h m 0 4 m 0 strictly speaking significant wave height is defined as the average wave height of the third highest waves of the wind sea and is typically the most relevant wave characteristic for design purposes determining the design wave height of a given wave environment then merely consists of integrating the wave spectrum and thus quantification of the short wave dynamics re quires determining the shape and scale of the variance density spectrum at each coordinate in geographic space this can be accomplished by solving a spectral energy balance equation namely 4 f t c g f c s f s where c g i d w d k i is the wave group velocity ω 2πf is the angular wave frequency ki is the wave number with i 1 2 3 c s i d w d x i is the spectral wave velocity f e 1 θ e 2 is the gradient in spectral space where e 1 and e 2 are spectral unit vectors and s is a source term that in general is a function of atmospheric input nonlinear wave wave interactions and dissipation eq 4 can be integrated given appropriate initial conditions and boundary conditions to obtain f f θ x t which gives relevant statistical information concerning the high frequency gravity waves the result is a model that must be discretized in five dimensions two dimensions in geograhpic space x y two dimensions in spectral space f θ and the temporal dimension this makes the numerical discretization of 4 rather complex and is exacerbated by calculations of the group and spectral velocities see dietrich et al 2013 and meixner et al 2013 it is precisely this complexity that makes the numerical discretization of 4 with a dg method almost untenable in terms of full scale operational applications 2 1 parameterization of the spectrum observational wind wave studies show that nonlinear wave wave interactions tend to stabilize the spectral shape of a young wind sea in the direction that the wind is blowing hasselmann et al 1973 atmospheric input at central frequencies is redistributed to lower frequencies where it is mostly absorbed and higher frequencies greater than twice the peak frequency where it is dissipated due to white capping see hasselmann et al 1973 1975 in other words given atmospheric input into the surface waves the nonlinear wave wave interactions tend to redistribute energy through the spectrum to maintain a stabilized spectral shape hasselmann et al 1973 see figs 2 and 3 this stabilized spectrum is typically taken as the jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 and is of the form 5 e f a g 2 2 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f p f 4 ln γ exp f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 where σ σ a f f p σ b f f p the spectrum is defined in terms of five free parameters and includes three shape parameters σ a σ b and γ along with the two energy scale parameters fp and α see fig 4 where g is acceleration due to gravity the parameters σ a and σ b determine the width of the spectrum while γ defines the peak enhancement factor of the fully developed pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 the remaining parameters fp and α are energy scale parameters that define the peak frequency of the wave group and the high frequency tail of the spectrum now if we assume that the two dimensional wave spectrum can be written as f f θ x t d f θ x t e f x t then we can transform the spectral balance eq 4 into an equivalent system of advection equations in the parameter space ai i 1 n where the parameters ai are typically taken to be that of the five free parameters of the jonswap spectrum e see hasselmann et al 1973 1975 solution of the parameterized system of equations yields the variables that define e f which are functions of time and the geographical coordinate of interest when taken in combination with d f θ typically a function of the wind direction at a given geographic coordinate this gives the full two dimensional wave spectrum that can then be integrated to obtain significant wave height peak period etc and the spectral problem has been reduced to three dimensions further the shape stabilizing process of the nonlinear wave wave inter actions occur on a time scale that is much faster than that of the shift of the spectral peak energy input to the spectrum is linear while the nonlinear transfer is cubic the shape of the spectrum therefore is in a relative state of equilibrium as compared to the energy scales of the problem which in turn is dominated by the migration of the spectral peak to lower frequencies hasselmann et al 1975 because of this fact we can reduce the problem to the determination of the energy scales of the spectrum i e the peak frequency fp and the phillips constant α this can be achieved by assuming some average values for σ a σ b and γ and then by solving a two parameter system hasselmann et al 1975 2 2 momentum formulation rather than solve a two parameter system with respect to wave energy we proceed to relate the energy scales of the spectrum to the momentum of the waves this allows one to solve a momentum balance equation rather than an energy balance equation with the main advantage being that now the only source term that needs to be included is the wind friction the key step in this strategy involves relating the wave momentum to the energy variance and the frequency more specifically we follow the work of donelan and schwab schwab et al 1984 who define the wave momentum of the system as donelan 1977 m x 0 0 2 π f f θ c p f cos θ d θ d f m y 0 0 2 π f f θ c p f sin θ d θ d f where cp is the phase speed now if we make use of the non dimensional relationship hasselmann et al 1973 between non dimensional fetch x g χ u 10 where χ is fetch length peak frequency and the wind velocity measured 10 m above sea level u 10 i e 6 f p f p u 10 g 1 2 π c p u 10 3 5 x 0 33 then we can relate the peak frequency of the spectrum to the wave momentum welsh 1997 7 f p 0 0179 u 10 2 cos 2 θ w θ 0 m 3 0 1429 where θ w is the mean wind direction θ0 tan 1 my mx is the mean direction of the water waves and m m x 2 m y 2 1 2 is the magnitude of the momentum we can simplify 7 using trigonometric relations nappi 2013 8 f p 0 0179 u 10 cos θ 0 v 10 sin θ 0 2 m 3 0 1429 where u 10 and v 10 correspond to the x and y components respectively of the wind vector u 10 we calculate the phillips constant via donelan 1977 9 α 0 0097 u 10 c p 2 3 where fp and cp are related through the linear deep water wave relation lamb 1932 10 c p g 2 π f p with fp and α defined above we can assume that the shape parameters of the spectrum are equal to the average values of the jonswap spectrum and approximately integrate the spectrum schwab et al 1984 to relate the momentum and variance 11 σ 2 m c p g m 0 which can then be used to determine significant wave height what now remains is to track the wave momentum as it propagates through the hydro dynamic domain this can be accomplished by solving a wave momentum balance equation 12 m t t τ w ρ w g where t is the wave momentum flux tensor τ w is the wind stress and ρ w is the density of water the wave momentum flux components are 13 t x x 1 2 0 0 2 π f f θ cos 2 θ d θ d f t x y t y x 1 2 0 0 2 π f f θ sin θ cos θ d θ d f t y y 1 2 0 0 2 π f f θ sin 2 θ d θ d f which essentially corresponds to the kinetic energy of the system for example txx accounts for energy flowing in the x direction that contributes to mx if we further assume that the energy spectrum can be written as f f θ e f d f θ then 13 becomes 14 t x x 1 2 0 0 2 π e f d f θ cos 2 θ d θ d f t x y t y x 1 2 0 0 2 π e f d f θ sin θ cos θ d θ d f t y y 1 2 0 0 2 π e f d f θ sin 2 θ d θ d f observational studies show that the directional distribution of wave energy near the peak frequency can be roughly approximated by a cos2 θ spreading function hasselmann et al 1973 i e 15 d f θ d θ s p cos 2 θ θ 0 if θ θ 0 π 2 0 otherwise where sp is the so called spread parameter which scales the directional distribution of waves about the mean wind direction θ in reality the directional distribution of the waves depends on the frequency of the spectrum see donelan et al 1985 holthuijsen 2007 longuet higgins et al 1963 and wang and hwang 2001 however due to the fact that the two parameter wave model only makes use of the peak frequency it does not seem appropriate to use a more intricate function for d f θ rearranging 14 making use of 3 and integrating gives the final form of the momentum flux tensor 16 t x x σ 2 2 1 s p cos 2 θ s p 2 t x y t y x σ 2 2 1 s p sin θ cos θ t y y σ 2 2 1 s p sin 2 θ s p 2 what remains is to evaluate the right hand side of eq 12 more specifically because we are utilizing a momentum balance equation pressure fluctuations in the air sea interface manifest as form drag donelan 1977 17 τ w w c d u 10 0 83 c p u 10 0 83 c p where cd is the typical drag coefficient and w is the empirical fraction of stress retained by the waves which is used to compensate for the inexact ness of certain linear assumptions e g the equal partition of kinetic and potential energy see schwab et al 1984 given an initial condition on the wave momentum coupled with appropriate boundary conditions one can make use of eqs 8 10 3 16 and 17 to integrate the momentum balance eq 12 to obtain mx and my this can then be used to calculate the variance of the sea surface elevation using 11 and consequently significant wave heights here we make note of the fact that the mathematical formulation outlined above is a gross approximation to the full spectral energy balance eq 4 and must be used judiciously there are a number of situations where the model assumptions break down including when the relaxation time scales of the shape stabilizing parameters are no longer small compared to other times scales of the problem such as for instance the time scale for a wave group to propagate throughout the wind field hasselmann et al 1975 if a wave group travels faster than that of the wind speed the atmospheric input that is necessary for the nonlinear wave wave interactions to stabilize the spectral shape is no longer present and thus the assumption of a universal spectral shape breaks down hasselmann et al 1975 the obvious example of this is swell in this case a universal shape no longer describes the wave spectrum but rather the shape of the spectrum depends on the position time and spatial expanse of the wave source hasselmann et al 1975 the wind rapidly loses magnitude and or rapidly changes direction either of these situations can create cross seas of comparable frequency and potentially rebirth swell into a new wind sea hasselmann et al 1975 in order to limit the severity of these effects the two parameter dg wave model makes use of an alternative formulation to calculate the peak frequency when the wind rapidly loses magnitude and or rapidly changes direction specifically we use the formulation due to welsh 1997 f p 14340 m 0 33 nearshore effects make a significant contribution to the wave field coastal effects tend to skew the accuracy of the two parameter dg wave model however in nearshore regions that lack complexity these errors will typically be less than that of the errors introduced by the wind interpolation this is demonstrated in the relatively coarse numerical mesh that is necessary to shift the dominant error of the hindcasts in section 4 from the wind interpolation to the discretization of the pdes finally it can be noted that while our mathematical model is by no means novel the formulation we utilize does produce a wave number spectrum that is similar to a k 5 2 spectrum in the equilibrium range resio et al 2015 this is consistent with laboratory and field observations as well as results from the phase resolving model of xaio et al 2013 in fact a recent paper by resio et al 2015 highlights the fact that the discrete interaction approximation commonly used in third generation wave models forces the spectral shape significantly away from its recognized equilibrium form and cannot produce accurate estimates of energy and momentum fluxes through the spectrum as needed for coupled models our math model is old but it is consistent with observations and phase resolving methods in terms of modeling the wind sea and its mathematical structure allows us to recast it into a weak form that is advantageous for dg discretization methods 3 discontinuous galerkin dg discretization given a non overlapping finite element triangulation of the domain ω th ω e where ω e is the collection of elements in th whose boundaries we denote as ω e we obtain a weak form of 12 that is suitable for the dg method if we first multiply 12 by a suitably smooth test function v x y integrate over each element ω e th and integrate the flux term by parts to obtain 18 ω e m t v d a ω e t v d a ω e t n v d s ω e s v d a where m m x m y t t x x t x y t y x t y y s τ w x ρ w g τ w y ρ w g it can be noted that we have moved the derivative off of the flux function and on to the test function which is at our disposal to choose and thus we have weakened the constraints on the numerical solution by allowing it to contain integrable discontinuities here we make note of the fact that if v x y is set equal to 1 then the second term in 18 drops out and we arrive at the typical finite volume discretization in fact dg methods can be viewed as perturbations of the classic monotone finite volume schemes more specifically as v x y is taken to be a polynomial of higher degree the dg method correspondingly makes use of the slope convexity etc of the numerical solution to accurately calculate the flux that flows across element boundaries no matter the polynomial order utilized in the dg method the process only requires information from adjacent elements it is this aspect of the dg method that sets itself apart from most traditional finite volume methods whose stencil increases with order and partly what renders it advantageous boundary conditions are easy to implement within its framework and its local nature makes it scalable in terms of parallel computing while its finite element nature makes it amenable to unstructured meshes see cockburn and shu 2001 for details 3 1 finite element spaces and numerical fluxes in the weak form given in the previous subsection we replace m x y t by a trial solution from the finite dimensional space of functions that we define as v h m v v ω e p m ω e ω e t h where pm denotes the space of polynomials of degree m now given a set of basis functions φ ϕ0 ϕ1 ϕ m t for v h m the trial solution can be expressed as m x h ω i m x i φ m y h ω i m y i φ where m x y i are vectors of the time dependent degrees of freedom of the finite element solution over ω e and m h m x h i m y h j where i and j are unit vectors in geographic space we use products of jacobi polynomials of degree m p k k 0 m as our basis for v h m the orthogonal triangular basis is defined in terms of a collapsed coordinate system and results in a diagonal mass matrix that is trivially inverted see kubatko et al 2006 for more details substitution of the finite element approximation m h into 18 gives the discrete weak form of the problem 19 ω e m h t v h d a ω e t h v h d a ω t n v h d s ω e s h v h d a where t h t m h s h s m h and m h v h v h m here we draw attention to the fact the finite element space defined above does not enforce functional continuity across element boundaries and thus we indicate the left and right limits of a function for example v h v h m at an element boundary point xi by v h v h x i and v h v h x i respectively see fig 5 given that the trial solution and the test function may be discontinuous at element boundaries we replace the boundary flux t by an appropriately defined numerical flux t that in general depends on both left and right states of the trial solution in this work we utilize a local lax friedrichs llf flux to calculate a consistent flux across element boundaries namely t 1 2 t m h t m h 1 2 λ max m h m h where λmax is the maximum wave speed of the system which in this case is taken to be the peak phase speed cp f note that we utilize the peak phase speed rather than the group velocity c g 1 2 c p in deep water due to the fact that the peak frequency of the spectrum travels at the peak phase speed and not the group velocity of the waves 3 2 the semidiscrete dg equations with the finite element spaces and numerical fluxes defined in the previous subsection the semidiscrete dg equations take the form d d t m x y l h m h where m x y m x y 1 m x y 2 m x y l and l h is the dg spatial operator the integrals in eq 19 are evaluated using numerical quadrature rules of sufficiently high degree and we discretize the system of odes that results from the application of the dg method via so called strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta rk methods of order k 1 for dg methods employing spatial approximations of degree k see for example kubatko et al 2007 2014 4 numerical results we present numerical results for the two parameter dg wave model detailed above more specifically we verify the model against an empirical formula for fetch limited waves and evaluate the model via hindcasts over lake erie comparing model results to observational buoy data in addition to numerical results from the well established spectral wave model known as swan finally we close the section with a refinement study that examines the efficiency and accuracy of the model in terms of h refinement and p enrichment 4 1 uniform wind and fetch limited waves we verify the momentum formulation of the two parameter dg wave model against an empirical formula for significant wave height in the case of purely fetch limited waves i e the waves are limited in size due to the extent of the wind wave generation area the test case consists of a constant 10 m per second wind blowing from west to east over a 100 km circular basin in this case an expression for significant wave height is given by 20 h s 0 00366 g 0 62 χ 0 38 u 10 cos θ 1 24 where θ is the angular difference between the wind and the wave propagation directions the empirical formula 20 was derived from directional wave data collected from wave gauges mounted on a tower in lake ontario in 1976 and 1977 see bishop 1983 and donelan 1980 for more details in terms of the numerical simulation we discretize the 100 km basin with the use of triangular elements that have an average length of 5 km see fig 6 and then set the initial condition of the basin to that of a calm sea i e a sea state that possesses a minimum amount of momentum m 0 we apply a 10 m s wind for a duration of 24 h which produces a steady state solution for significant wave height the results of which can be seen in fig 6 note that the dg solution shown in red agrees well with the empirical solution shown in blue and in fact the coefficient of determination in this case is r 2 0 9928 4 2 evaluation we assess the applicability of the two parameter dg wave model in a non uniform wind driven wave environment via a series of hindcasts over lake erie the tenth largest lake in the world and the fourth largest lake by surface area of the great lakes a system of five interconnected lakes situated on the boarder of the united states and canada lake erie generates approximately 10 7 billion dollars in annual revenue ohio environmental council and due to its orientation large surface area and relatively shallow water depth is extremely susceptible to wind wave generation with seiches known to form on the lake of up to 16 ft national ocean service tidal ranges on the lake are less than 2 in national ocean service and thus the main driver of the circulation of the system is due to waves that form from atmospheric input i e the wind which renders lake erie an ideal test case for the two parameter dg wave model we use the two parameter dg wave model to simulate wave conditions over lake erie for the months of may october in the years 2009 2010 and 2011 the model is driven by wind input generated from twenty seven meteorological stations owned and operated by the national oceanic and atmospheric association noaa the positions of the 27 stations are illustrated in fig 7 here we make note of the fact that all twenty seven stations record a variety of data of which only the wind direction and wind speed are necessary input for the dg wave model more specifically an in terpolation program dibling 2012 transforms the raw wind data to that of a common interval of time and then interpolates the u and v x y components of the wind field onto the finite element mesh shown in fig 8 at ten minute intervals model output is compared to observational data obtained from three different buoys located throughout the lake where the buoys utilized consist of buoy 45005 owned and maintained by noaa s national data buoy center and buoys 45132 and 45142 owned and operated by environment canada the locations of the three buoys are shown in fig 8 where the lake depths at the buoys are 12 6 m at 45005 21 m at 45132 and 27 m at 45142 respectively the code is implemented in fortran90 and interfaced with a matlab graphical user interface gui making the model user friendly model results for the month of july 2011 are shown for each of the three buoys in fig 9 a c while statistical analyses of the data are shown in tables 1 3 and fig 10 for numerical results from the years and months listed above but not shown herein the reader is referred to nappi 2013 in general the output of the two parameter dg wave model in terms of significant wave height is well correlated to that of the observational buoy data with an average coefficient of determination over all three years of data r 2 0 857 and an average root mean square error of 0 143 m a deficiency of the model that should be highlighted however is that whenever the wind rapidly loses magnitude or changes direction the two parameter model tends to slightly undershoot the observed significant wave height this is due to the inherent assumptions embedded within the parametric model and can be controlled to some extent via the techniques of clodman 1994 4 3 evaluation via swan model we further evaluate the two parameter dg wave model and compare model output to that of the well established wave model known as swan swan is a fully discrete spectral model that solves the action balance equation over a set of direction and frequency bins in spectral space using implicit finite difference methods this allows the spectral shape of the wave energy density to evolve at each geographic point in time where the shape is determined via wind input and nonlinear source functions swan simulations were run on the same unstructured mesh as the two parameter dg wave model with identical wind input as recommended on the swan user website swan 36 directional bins along with 40 frequency bins were utilized to discretize spectral space all of the dg and swan simulations were executed on a 64 bit dell optiplex 990 machine with 16 gb ram and dual quad core 3 40 ghz intel i7 2600 processors at the computational hydrodynamics and informatics laboratory at the ohio state university for each monthly simulation the cpu time was recorded for each of the models the two parameter dg wave model and swan were each used to perform hindcasts over lake erie a total of three times for the months of june august and october 2011 the average cpu time for each of the model runs is shown in fig 11 where on average the two parameter dg wave model ran approximately 33 times as fast as swan while producing similar numerical results in terms of significant wave height see fig 9 a c it is interesting to note that even though the two models utilize distinct mathematical formulations one in terms of action the other in terms of momentum both models are well correlated with the buoy data in fact the average r value for both dg and swan correspond to r 0 94 while the average rms error of the two models only differ by 0 009 m see tables 1 3 this seems to indicate that the two parameter dg wave model while simple in form is still able to accurately predict a non uniform wind wave environment especially in the case of negligible swell effects and mean currents here we make note of the fact that the accuracy of the wind input seems to be the dominant error in both models i e additional mesh refinement does not appreciably reduce the error in the numerical prediction of the wave environment in either model 4 4 h refinement versus p refinement there are two distinct paths to increase the accuracy of the dg finite element method the first and more traditional path is known as h refinement and essentially involves increasing the number of elements utilized to discretize the numerical representation of the spatial domain see fig 12 a for instance this type of refinement is especially useful in resolving sharp gradients that may form in the numerical solution as well as capturing intricate domain boundaries such as coastlines and is typically the refinement method of choice for most numerical wave models in fact this method can be quite powerful when implemented in an adaptive fashion a feature absent in the wave literature see mandli and dawson 2014 for example aside from h refinement the accuracy of the dg method can be enhanced via polynomial enrichment i e p refinement where high order polynomials are used to discretize the weak form of the problem rather than the domain few operational wind sea models make use of this particular refinement scheme we explore h and p refinement to ascertain the most appropriate method to enhance the accuracy of the two parameter dg wave model while maintaining its inherent efficiency in particular we first coarsen the lake erie mesh until wind interpolation effects are no longer the dominant error in the numerical solution see fig 13 a hindcasts are then performed on this mesh using p 0 and p 1 where we compare numerical results to buoy data and numerical solutions from a once refined mesh also shown in fig 13 b using only p 0 see figs 14 16 as well as tables 4 8 as one would expect both h and p refinement lead to lower rms errors as well as a lower max error in the numerical solution however utilizing p refinement on the coarsest mesh gives lower error measures than p 0 on the once refined mesh except at buoy 45132 additionally p refinement uses fewer degrees of freedom and runs twice as fast as the once refined mesh with p 0 see tables 4 8 this would seem to indicate that polynomial enrichment should be the refinement method of choice however due to the fact that the refinement schemes were performed a priori and not in an adaptive fashion one cannot make such a claim in reality p refinement and h refinement need not be exclusive and for most problems a combination of both performed in an adaptive fashion could be the most powerful type of enrichment scheme see conroy et al 2018 future work will undoubtedly center around such a blueprint 5 conclusions and future work investigation results can be succinctly summarized as follows parameterized high frequency water wave models can accurately capture significant wave height in non uniform wind environments when swell and mean currents are null and display computational execution times that are significantly faster than typical discrete spectral models the quality of atmospheric input data plays a major role in the overall accuracy of wind wave models any numerical improvement in modeling this regime could benefit from new interpolation techniques as well as a more nuanced understanding of the air sea energy transfer mechanism polynomial enrichment is a viable option in wind driven water wave models p refinement uses fewer degrees of freedom and is more accurate than uniform global h refinement in the absence of shocks for instance using p 1 polynomials on a coarse mesh 116 elements produces comparable rms errors to swan on a fine mesh 2422 elements the difference in the average rms error is 0 06 m see tables 1 4 further the p 1 solution was executed in a cpu time that was significantly faster than swan 30 s vs 3 h the current formulation of the two parameter dg wave model is well suited for large lakes see nappi 2013 for an evaluation over lake michigan and will require some reworking in terms of the mathematical formulation if it is to be used in coastal ocean investigations e g storm surge scenarios this work is well underway and addresses the second bullet point listed above conroy et al 2018 while coalescing atmospheric turbulence and wind driven water waves into a tightly coupled form with swell see conroy et al 2018 for details acknowledgement the work presented herein was supported by the national science foundation under grant nos dms 0915118 and oce 1025527

enrichment lake erie 1 introduction spectral wave models which seek to describe the high frequency band of surface waves generated by the wind and restored to equilibrium pre dominately by gravity see fig 1 have a long history of development dating back to the 1950s see for example the discussions provided by the swamp and wamdi groups the swamp group 1985 wamdi group 1988 the essential feature that sets spectral wave models apart from other wave modeling approaches is the attempt to provide a statistical description of the wave field by modeling the evolution of the wave variance density spectrum rather than attempting to resolve each individual wave train of the sea surface known as the phase resolving approach wei et al 1995 the goal of a spectral wave model is computational tractability by evolving a variance density spectrum various wave properties such as significant wave height and period can be obtained over large domains in a timely fashion some of the early spectral wave models further took advantage of the fact that a portion of the spectrum was observed to have a universal shape when normalized with respect to peak frequency that could be represented by a few parameters this observation led to the development of a class of spectral wave models referred to as parametric wind sea wave models see for example hasselmann et al 1975 a class of models distinct from the traditional discrete spectral models holthuijsen 2007 that are widely used today the primary advantage of parametric wave models is the massive reduction in computational effort that they can afford compared to discrete spectral models the latter directly discretize the so called spectral energy or action in the presence of ambient currents balance equation using a sizable number of frequency typically 30 and direction 36 bins at each computational grid point in geographic space swan in contrast to this parametric wave models solve a coupled set of transport equations at each computational grid point for a small number of parameters typically 6 that describe the wave spectrum the parametric modeling approach is described in more detail in section 2 1 therefore the number of discrete equations used by a parametric model will typically be two orders of magnitude smaller than the number used by a numerically similar discrete spectral model on the same computational grid this reduction in computational effort however comes at the cost of a reduced description of the wave field specifically the wave spectrum will in general consist of both wind sea waves under the influence of the wind that generated them and swell waves that have escaped the influence of the generating wind components see fig 1 with only the former being able to be described parametrically to overcome this deficiency parametric models were often combined with discrete spectral modeling approaches for the swell components only giving rise to so called coupled hybrid models gṻnther et al 1979 which exhibit computational costs somewhere between the pure parametric and full discrete spectral modeling approaches despite the deficiencies of the parametric modeling approach in this paper we show that a return to this earlier efficient parametric approach paired with more advanced numerics proves to be sufficiently accurate for the wind sea cases considered more specifically we recast the parametric wind sea modeling paradigm into a variational weak form that is advantageous to discontinuous galerkin dg methods these methods are locally conservative can handle arbitrary meshes and can dynamically adapt in time via mesh h refinement and polynomial p refinement cockburn and shu 2001 a feature shown in conroy et al 2018 to be instrumental in capturing rapidly changing frequencies associated with large gusts of wind we further demonstrate some advantages of the dg method through a series of hindcasts over lake erie where we compare model output to observational buoy data as well as hindcast data from the well established third generation spectral wave model known as swan results indicate that this simplified parametric approach when paired with advanced numerics produces similar error measures to swan while significantly reducing the computational cost the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we discuss general mathematical approaches to model surface gravity waves and via a number of logical deductions arrive at a simple yet accurate in the proper scenario two parameter wave model we recast this two parameter wave model into a variational weak form that is suitable for the discontinuous galerkin dg finite element method in section 3 and assess the applicability of the model in section 4 via hindcast simulations over lake erie we compare numerical results to observational buoy data as well as to hindcast data from the well established wave model known as swan it is also in section 4 where we demonstrate some advantages of the dg method in terms of using p refinement versus standard h refinement finally in section 5 we discuss some conclusions and future work 2 mathematical approaches a spectral wave model aims to describe the wave environment in a statistical sense i e in the context of the wave dynamics that are most likely to occur under a given physical condition at a specific coordinate in geographic space its foundation is built on the idea that an irregular sea surface can be described as a superposition of a large number of harmonic waves each traveling with a distinct frequency and amplitude at each geographic coordinate the spectral approach describes the sea surface η as a stochastic process and the expected value of the variance of the sea surface i e f 1 2 η 2 is distributed over frequency f and direction θ components to obtain a variance density spectrum 1 f f θ lim δ f 0 δ θ 0 1 δ f 1 δ θ f 1 2 η 2 which gives a complete statistical description of the sea surface elevation if it can be seen as a stationary gaussian process moments of the spectrum mn quantify wave characteristics at a given spatial coordinate 2 m n 0 0 2 π f n f f θ d θ d f for n 2 1 0 1 2 for example the zeroth order moment corresponds to the variance of the surface elevation σ 2 and is defined as 3 σ 2 m 0 0 f f d f the square root of m 0 multiplied by 4 is approximately the so called significant wave height or design wave height for deep water waves h m 0 4 m 0 strictly speaking significant wave height is defined as the average wave height of the third highest waves of the wind sea and is typically the most relevant wave characteristic for design purposes determining the design wave height of a given wave environment then merely consists of integrating the wave spectrum and thus quantification of the short wave dynamics re quires determining the shape and scale of the variance density spectrum at each coordinate in geographic space this can be accomplished by solving a spectral energy balance equation namely 4 f t c g f c s f s where c g i d w d k i is the wave group velocity ω 2πf is the angular wave frequency ki is the wave number with i 1 2 3 c s i d w d x i is the spectral wave velocity f e 1 θ e 2 is the gradient in spectral space where e 1 and e 2 are spectral unit vectors and s is a source term that in general is a function of atmospheric input nonlinear wave wave interactions and dissipation eq 4 can be integrated given appropriate initial conditions and boundary conditions to obtain f f θ x t which gives relevant statistical information concerning the high frequency gravity waves the result is a model that must be discretized in five dimensions two dimensions in geograhpic space x y two dimensions in spectral space f θ and the temporal dimension this makes the numerical discretization of 4 rather complex and is exacerbated by calculations of the group and spectral velocities see dietrich et al 2013 and meixner et al 2013 it is precisely this complexity that makes the numerical discretization of 4 with a dg method almost untenable in terms of full scale operational applications 2 1 parameterization of the spectrum observational wind wave studies show that nonlinear wave wave interactions tend to stabilize the spectral shape of a young wind sea in the direction that the wind is blowing hasselmann et al 1973 atmospheric input at central frequencies is redistributed to lower frequencies where it is mostly absorbed and higher frequencies greater than twice the peak frequency where it is dissipated due to white capping see hasselmann et al 1973 1975 in other words given atmospheric input into the surface waves the nonlinear wave wave interactions tend to redistribute energy through the spectrum to maintain a stabilized spectral shape hasselmann et al 1973 see figs 2 and 3 this stabilized spectrum is typically taken as the jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 and is of the form 5 e f a g 2 2 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f p f 4 ln γ exp f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 where σ σ a f f p σ b f f p the spectrum is defined in terms of five free parameters and includes three shape parameters σ a σ b and γ along with the two energy scale parameters fp and α see fig 4 where g is acceleration due to gravity the parameters σ a and σ b determine the width of the spectrum while γ defines the peak enhancement factor of the fully developed pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 the remaining parameters fp and α are energy scale parameters that define the peak frequency of the wave group and the high frequency tail of the spectrum now if we assume that the two dimensional wave spectrum can be written as f f θ x t d f θ x t e f x t then we can transform the spectral balance eq 4 into an equivalent system of advection equations in the parameter space ai i 1 n where the parameters ai are typically taken to be that of the five free parameters of the jonswap spectrum e see hasselmann et al 1973 1975 solution of the parameterized system of equations yields the variables that define e f which are functions of time and the geographical coordinate of interest when taken in combination with d f θ typically a function of the wind direction at a given geographic coordinate this gives the full two dimensional wave spectrum that can then be integrated to obtain significant wave height peak period etc and the spectral problem has been reduced to three dimensions further the shape stabilizing process of the nonlinear wave wave inter actions occur on a time scale that is much faster than that of the shift of the spectral peak energy input to the spectrum is linear while the nonlinear transfer is cubic the shape of the spectrum therefore is in a relative state of equilibrium as compared to the energy scales of the problem which in turn is dominated by the migration of the spectral peak to lower frequencies hasselmann et al 1975 because of this fact we can reduce the problem to the determination of the energy scales of the spectrum i e the peak frequency fp and the phillips constant α this can be achieved by assuming some average values for σ a σ b and γ and then by solving a two parameter system hasselmann et al 1975 2 2 momentum formulation rather than solve a two parameter system with respect to wave energy we proceed to relate the energy scales of the spectrum to the momentum of the waves this allows one to solve a momentum balance equation rather than an energy balance equation with the main advantage being that now the only source term that needs to be included is the wind friction the key step in this strategy involves relating the wave momentum to the energy variance and the frequency more specifically we follow the work of donelan and schwab schwab et al 1984 who define the wave momentum of the system as donelan 1977 m x 0 0 2 π f f θ c p f cos θ d θ d f m y 0 0 2 π f f θ c p f sin θ d θ d f where cp is the phase speed now if we make use of the non dimensional relationship hasselmann et al 1973 between non dimensional fetch x g χ u 10 where χ is fetch length peak frequency and the wind velocity measured 10 m above sea level u 10 i e 6 f p f p u 10 g 1 2 π c p u 10 3 5 x 0 33 then we can relate the peak frequency of the spectrum to the wave momentum welsh 1997 7 f p 0 0179 u 10 2 cos 2 θ w θ 0 m 3 0 1429 where θ w is the mean wind direction θ0 tan 1 my mx is the mean direction of the water waves and m m x 2 m y 2 1 2 is the magnitude of the momentum we can simplify 7 using trigonometric relations nappi 2013 8 f p 0 0179 u 10 cos θ 0 v 10 sin θ 0 2 m 3 0 1429 where u 10 and v 10 correspond to the x and y components respectively of the wind vector u 10 we calculate the phillips constant via donelan 1977 9 α 0 0097 u 10 c p 2 3 where fp and cp are related through the linear deep water wave relation lamb 1932 10 c p g 2 π f p with fp and α defined above we can assume that the shape parameters of the spectrum are equal to the average values of the jonswap spectrum and approximately integrate the spectrum schwab et al 1984 to relate the momentum and variance 11 σ 2 m c p g m 0 which can then be used to determine significant wave height what now remains is to track the wave momentum as it propagates through the hydro dynamic domain this can be accomplished by solving a wave momentum balance equation 12 m t t τ w ρ w g where t is the wave momentum flux tensor τ w is the wind stress and ρ w is the density of water the wave momentum flux components are 13 t x x 1 2 0 0 2 π f f θ cos 2 θ d θ d f t x y t y x 1 2 0 0 2 π f f θ sin θ cos θ d θ d f t y y 1 2 0 0 2 π f f θ sin 2 θ d θ d f which essentially corresponds to the kinetic energy of the system for example txx accounts for energy flowing in the x direction that contributes to mx if we further assume that the energy spectrum can be written as f f θ e f d f θ then 13 becomes 14 t x x 1 2 0 0 2 π e f d f θ cos 2 θ d θ d f t x y t y x 1 2 0 0 2 π e f d f θ sin θ cos θ d θ d f t y y 1 2 0 0 2 π e f d f θ sin 2 θ d θ d f observational studies show that the directional distribution of wave energy near the peak frequency can be roughly approximated by a cos2 θ spreading function hasselmann et al 1973 i e 15 d f θ d θ s p cos 2 θ θ 0 if θ θ 0 π 2 0 otherwise where sp is the so called spread parameter which scales the directional distribution of waves about the mean wind direction θ in reality the directional distribution of the waves depends on the frequency of the spectrum see donelan et al 1985 holthuijsen 2007 longuet higgins et al 1963 and wang and hwang 2001 however due to the fact that the two parameter wave model only makes use of the peak frequency it does not seem appropriate to use a more intricate function for d f θ rearranging 14 making use of 3 and integrating gives the final form of the momentum flux tensor 16 t x x σ 2 2 1 s p cos 2 θ s p 2 t x y t y x σ 2 2 1 s p sin θ cos θ t y y σ 2 2 1 s p sin 2 θ s p 2 what remains is to evaluate the right hand side of eq 12 more specifically because we are utilizing a momentum balance equation pressure fluctuations in the air sea interface manifest as form drag donelan 1977 17 τ w w c d u 10 0 83 c p u 10 0 83 c p where cd is the typical drag coefficient and w is the empirical fraction of stress retained by the waves which is used to compensate for the inexact ness of certain linear assumptions e g the equal partition of kinetic and potential energy see schwab et al 1984 given an initial condition on the wave momentum coupled with appropriate boundary conditions one can make use of eqs 8 10 3 16 and 17 to integrate the momentum balance eq 12 to obtain mx and my this can then be used to calculate the variance of the sea surface elevation using 11 and consequently significant wave heights here we make note of the fact that the mathematical formulation outlined above is a gross approximation to the full spectral energy balance eq 4 and must be used judiciously there are a number of situations where the model assumptions break down including when the relaxation time scales of the shape stabilizing parameters are no longer small compared to other times scales of the problem such as for instance the time scale for a wave group to propagate throughout the wind field hasselmann et al 1975 if a wave group travels faster than that of the wind speed the atmospheric input that is necessary for the nonlinear wave wave interactions to stabilize the spectral shape is no longer present and thus the assumption of a universal spectral shape breaks down hasselmann et al 1975 the obvious example of this is swell in this case a universal shape no longer describes the wave spectrum but rather the shape of the spectrum depends on the position time and spatial expanse of the wave source hasselmann et al 1975 the wind rapidly loses magnitude and or rapidly changes direction either of these situations can create cross seas of comparable frequency and potentially rebirth swell into a new wind sea hasselmann et al 1975 in order to limit the severity of these effects the two parameter dg wave model makes use of an alternative formulation to calculate the peak frequency when the wind rapidly loses magnitude and or rapidly changes direction specifically we use the formulation due to welsh 1997 f p 14340 m 0 33 nearshore effects make a significant contribution to the wave field coastal effects tend to skew the accuracy of the two parameter dg wave model however in nearshore regions that lack complexity these errors will typically be less than that of the errors introduced by the wind interpolation this is demonstrated in the relatively coarse numerical mesh that is necessary to shift the dominant error of the hindcasts in section 4 from the wind interpolation to the discretization of the pdes finally it can be noted that while our mathematical model is by no means novel the formulation we utilize does produce a wave number spectrum that is similar to a k 5 2 spectrum in the equilibrium range resio et al 2015 this is consistent with laboratory and field observations as well as results from the phase resolving model of xaio et al 2013 in fact a recent paper by resio et al 2015 highlights the fact that the discrete interaction approximation commonly used in third generation wave models forces the spectral shape significantly away from its recognized equilibrium form and cannot produce accurate estimates of energy and momentum fluxes through the spectrum as needed for coupled models our math model is old but it is consistent with observations and phase resolving methods in terms of modeling the wind sea and its mathematical structure allows us to recast it into a weak form that is advantageous for dg discretization methods 3 discontinuous galerkin dg discretization given a non overlapping finite element triangulation of the domain ω th ω e where ω e is the collection of elements in th whose boundaries we denote as ω e we obtain a weak form of 12 that is suitable for the dg method if we first multiply 12 by a suitably smooth test function v x y integrate over each element ω e th and integrate the flux term by parts to obtain 18 ω e m t v d a ω e t v d a ω e t n v d s ω e s v d a where m m x m y t t x x t x y t y x t y y s τ w x ρ w g τ w y ρ w g it can be noted that we have moved the derivative off of the flux function and on to the test function which is at our disposal to choose and thus we have weakened the constraints on the numerical solution by allowing it to contain integrable discontinuities here we make note of the fact that if v x y is set equal to 1 then the second term in 18 drops out and we arrive at the typical finite volume discretization in fact dg methods can be viewed as perturbations of the classic monotone finite volume schemes more specifically as v x y is taken to be a polynomial of higher degree the dg method correspondingly makes use of the slope convexity etc of the numerical solution to accurately calculate the flux that flows across element boundaries no matter the polynomial order utilized in the dg method the process only requires information from adjacent elements it is this aspect of the dg method that sets itself apart from most traditional finite volume methods whose stencil increases with order and partly what renders it advantageous boundary conditions are easy to implement within its framework and its local nature makes it scalable in terms of parallel computing while its finite element nature makes it amenable to unstructured meshes see cockburn and shu 2001 for details 3 1 finite element spaces and numerical fluxes in the weak form given in the previous subsection we replace m x y t by a trial solution from the finite dimensional space of functions that we define as v h m v v ω e p m ω e ω e t h where pm denotes the space of polynomials of degree m now given a set of basis functions φ ϕ0 ϕ1 ϕ m t for v h m the trial solution can be expressed as m x h ω i m x i φ m y h ω i m y i φ where m x y i are vectors of the time dependent degrees of freedom of the finite element solution over ω e and m h m x h i m y h j where i and j are unit vectors in geographic space we use products of jacobi polynomials of degree m p k k 0 m as our basis for v h m the orthogonal triangular basis is defined in terms of a collapsed coordinate system and results in a diagonal mass matrix that is trivially inverted see kubatko et al 2006 for more details substitution of the finite element approximation m h into 18 gives the discrete weak form of the problem 19 ω e m h t v h d a ω e t h v h d a ω t n v h d s ω e s h v h d a where t h t m h s h s m h and m h v h v h m here we draw attention to the fact the finite element space defined above does not enforce functional continuity across element boundaries and thus we indicate the left and right limits of a function for example v h v h m at an element boundary point xi by v h v h x i and v h v h x i respectively see fig 5 given that the trial solution and the test function may be discontinuous at element boundaries we replace the boundary flux t by an appropriately defined numerical flux t that in general depends on both left and right states of the trial solution in this work we utilize a local lax friedrichs llf flux to calculate a consistent flux across element boundaries namely t 1 2 t m h t m h 1 2 λ max m h m h where λmax is the maximum wave speed of the system which in this case is taken to be the peak phase speed cp f note that we utilize the peak phase speed rather than the group velocity c g 1 2 c p in deep water due to the fact that the peak frequency of the spectrum travels at the peak phase speed and not the group velocity of the waves 3 2 the semidiscrete dg equations with the finite element spaces and numerical fluxes defined in the previous subsection the semidiscrete dg equations take the form d d t m x y l h m h where m x y m x y 1 m x y 2 m x y l and l h is the dg spatial operator the integrals in eq 19 are evaluated using numerical quadrature rules of sufficiently high degree and we discretize the system of odes that results from the application of the dg method via so called strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta rk methods of order k 1 for dg methods employing spatial approximations of degree k see for example kubatko et al 2007 2014 4 numerical results we present numerical results for the two parameter dg wave model detailed above more specifically we verify the model against an empirical formula for fetch limited waves and evaluate the model via hindcasts over lake erie comparing model results to observational buoy data in addition to numerical results from the well established spectral wave model known as swan finally we close the section with a refinement study that examines the efficiency and accuracy of the model in terms of h refinement and p enrichment 4 1 uniform wind and fetch limited waves we verify the momentum formulation of the two parameter dg wave model against an empirical formula for significant wave height in the case of purely fetch limited waves i e the waves are limited in size due to the extent of the wind wave generation area the test case consists of a constant 10 m per second wind blowing from west to east over a 100 km circular basin in this case an expression for significant wave height is given by 20 h s 0 00366 g 0 62 χ 0 38 u 10 cos θ 1 24 where θ is the angular difference between the wind and the wave propagation directions the empirical formula 20 was derived from directional wave data collected from wave gauges mounted on a tower in lake ontario in 1976 and 1977 see bishop 1983 and donelan 1980 for more details in terms of the numerical simulation we discretize the 100 km basin with the use of triangular elements that have an average length of 5 km see fig 6 and then set the initial condition of the basin to that of a calm sea i e a sea state that possesses a minimum amount of momentum m 0 we apply a 10 m s wind for a duration of 24 h which produces a steady state solution for significant wave height the results of which can be seen in fig 6 note that the dg solution shown in red agrees well with the empirical solution shown in blue and in fact the coefficient of determination in this case is r 2 0 9928 4 2 evaluation we assess the applicability of the two parameter dg wave model in a non uniform wind driven wave environment via a series of hindcasts over lake erie the tenth largest lake in the world and the fourth largest lake by surface area of the great lakes a system of five interconnected lakes situated on the boarder of the united states and canada lake erie generates approximately 10 7 billion dollars in annual revenue ohio environmental council and due to its orientation large surface area and relatively shallow water depth is extremely susceptible to wind wave generation with seiches known to form on the lake of up to 16 ft national ocean service tidal ranges on the lake are less than 2 in national ocean service and thus the main driver of the circulation of the system is due to waves that form from atmospheric input i e the wind which renders lake erie an ideal test case for the two parameter dg wave model we use the two parameter dg wave model to simulate wave conditions over lake erie for the months of may october in the years 2009 2010 and 2011 the model is driven by wind input generated from twenty seven meteorological stations owned and operated by the national oceanic and atmospheric association noaa the positions of the 27 stations are illustrated in fig 7 here we make note of the fact that all twenty seven stations record a variety of data of which only the wind direction and wind speed are necessary input for the dg wave model more specifically an in terpolation program dibling 2012 transforms the raw wind data to that of a common interval of time and then interpolates the u and v x y components of the wind field onto the finite element mesh shown in fig 8 at ten minute intervals model output is compared to observational data obtained from three different buoys located throughout the lake where the buoys utilized consist of buoy 45005 owned and maintained by noaa s national data buoy center and buoys 45132 and 45142 owned and operated by environment canada the locations of the three buoys are shown in fig 8 where the lake depths at the buoys are 12 6 m at 45005 21 m at 45132 and 27 m at 45142 respectively the code is implemented in fortran90 and interfaced with a matlab graphical user interface gui making the model user friendly model results for the month of july 2011 are shown for each of the three buoys in fig 9 a c while statistical analyses of the data are shown in tables 1 3 and fig 10 for numerical results from the years and months listed above but not shown herein the reader is referred to nappi 2013 in general the output of the two parameter dg wave model in terms of significant wave height is well correlated to that of the observational buoy data with an average coefficient of determination over all three years of data r 2 0 857 and an average root mean square error of 0 143 m a deficiency of the model that should be highlighted however is that whenever the wind rapidly loses magnitude or changes direction the two parameter model tends to slightly undershoot the observed significant wave height this is due to the inherent assumptions embedded within the parametric model and can be controlled to some extent via the techniques of clodman 1994 4 3 evaluation via swan model we further evaluate the two parameter dg wave model and compare model output to that of the well established wave model known as swan swan is a fully discrete spectral model that solves the action balance equation over a set of direction and frequency bins in spectral space using implicit finite difference methods this allows the spectral shape of the wave energy density to evolve at each geographic point in time where the shape is determined via wind input and nonlinear source functions swan simulations were run on the same unstructured mesh as the two parameter dg wave model with identical wind input as recommended on the swan user website swan 36 directional bins along with 40 frequency bins were utilized to discretize spectral space all of the dg and swan simulations were executed on a 64 bit dell optiplex 990 machine with 16 gb ram and dual quad core 3 40 ghz intel i7 2600 processors at the computational hydrodynamics and informatics laboratory at the ohio state university for each monthly simulation the cpu time was recorded for each of the models the two parameter dg wave model and swan were each used to perform hindcasts over lake erie a total of three times for the months of june august and october 2011 the average cpu time for each of the model runs is shown in fig 11 where on average the two parameter dg wave model ran approximately 33 times as fast as swan while producing similar numerical results in terms of significant wave height see fig 9 a c it is interesting to note that even though the two models utilize distinct mathematical formulations one in terms of action the other in terms of momentum both models are well correlated with the buoy data in fact the average r value for both dg and swan correspond to r 0 94 while the average rms error of the two models only differ by 0 009 m see tables 1 3 this seems to indicate that the two parameter dg wave model while simple in form is still able to accurately predict a non uniform wind wave environment especially in the case of negligible swell effects and mean currents here we make note of the fact that the accuracy of the wind input seems to be the dominant error in both models i e additional mesh refinement does not appreciably reduce the error in the numerical prediction of the wave environment in either model 4 4 h refinement versus p refinement there are two distinct paths to increase the accuracy of the dg finite element method the first and more traditional path is known as h refinement and essentially involves increasing the number of elements utilized to discretize the numerical representation of the spatial domain see fig 12 a for instance this type of refinement is especially useful in resolving sharp gradients that may form in the numerical solution as well as capturing intricate domain boundaries such as coastlines and is typically the refinement method of choice for most numerical wave models in fact this method can be quite powerful when implemented in an adaptive fashion a feature absent in the wave literature see mandli and dawson 2014 for example aside from h refinement the accuracy of the dg method can be enhanced via polynomial enrichment i e p refinement where high order polynomials are used to discretize the weak form of the problem rather than the domain few operational wind sea models make use of this particular refinement scheme we explore h and p refinement to ascertain the most appropriate method to enhance the accuracy of the two parameter dg wave model while maintaining its inherent efficiency in particular we first coarsen the lake erie mesh until wind interpolation effects are no longer the dominant error in the numerical solution see fig 13 a hindcasts are then performed on this mesh using p 0 and p 1 where we compare numerical results to buoy data and numerical solutions from a once refined mesh also shown in fig 13 b using only p 0 see figs 14 16 as well as tables 4 8 as one would expect both h and p refinement lead to lower rms errors as well as a lower max error in the numerical solution however utilizing p refinement on the coarsest mesh gives lower error measures than p 0 on the once refined mesh except at buoy 45132 additionally p refinement uses fewer degrees of freedom and runs twice as fast as the once refined mesh with p 0 see tables 4 8 this would seem to indicate that polynomial enrichment should be the refinement method of choice however due to the fact that the refinement schemes were performed a priori and not in an adaptive fashion one cannot make such a claim in reality p refinement and h refinement need not be exclusive and for most problems a combination of both performed in an adaptive fashion could be the most powerful type of enrichment scheme see conroy et al 2018 future work will undoubtedly center around such a blueprint 5 conclusions and future work investigation results can be succinctly summarized as follows parameterized high frequency water wave models can accurately capture significant wave height in non uniform wind environments when swell and mean currents are null and display computational execution times that are significantly faster than typical discrete spectral models the quality of atmospheric input data plays a major role in the overall accuracy of wind wave models any numerical improvement in modeling this regime could benefit from new interpolation techniques as well as a more nuanced understanding of the air sea energy transfer mechanism polynomial enrichment is a viable option in wind driven water wave models p refinement uses fewer degrees of freedom and is more accurate than uniform global h refinement in the absence of shocks for instance using p 1 polynomials on a coarse mesh 116 elements produces comparable rms errors to swan on a fine mesh 2422 elements the difference in the average rms error is 0 06 m see tables 1 4 further the p 1 solution was executed in a cpu time that was significantly faster than swan 30 s vs 3 h the current formulation of the two parameter dg wave model is well suited for large lakes see nappi 2013 for an evaluation over lake michigan and will require some reworking in terms of the mathematical formulation if it is to be used in coastal ocean investigations e g storm surge scenarios this work is well underway and addresses the second bullet point listed above conroy et al 2018 while coalescing atmospheric turbulence and wind driven water waves into a tightly coupled form with swell see conroy et al 2018 for details acknowledgement the work presented herein was supported by the national science foundation under grant nos dms 0915118 and oce 1025527 
781,understanding the dynamic wave signatures in near surface unsaturated soils is crucial for the application of seismic observations in hydrology we first derived and analyzed the half space spatiotemporal green s functions that correspond to the raw seismic recordings incorporating fluid pressure jump and free surface boundary conditions represented by the surface stiffness we described the dynamic wave propagation in solid frame displacement and excess fluid pressures in response to an excitation wavelet impulse and our results show that the surface hydraulic contact does not obviously alter the wave signatures in solids regardless of how strong or tiny the solid fluid viscous coupling however in fluids due to the near surface fluid diffusion across the boundary in this state the proportional term or the imagery reactance term causes the intermediate state to alter between the open pore op and closed pore cp surface the fast p p1 body and the dominant fast rayleigh r1 surface waves can always be observed near the surface as can the second rayleigh r2 surface wave at the high frequency limit with tiny solid fluid viscous coupling furthermore the surface waves in the fluid pressures do not penetrate as deeply as in the solid due to the shear motion transferring in them a high internal permeability may generate the second p p2 wave by the excited air acoustic wave propagation in fluid pore pressures showing the strong reverberations under the cp surface these changes in dynamic waves can be attributed to petrophysically plausible scenarios of flow across the free surface by imperfect hydraulic contacts or capillarity reactance keywords poroelasticity unsaturated porous media near surface 1 introduction the capability to detect subsurface spatiotemporal environmental characteristics remains a challenge in many scientific and engineering domains it is a challenge in particular for hydrology where the fluid transport and transformations in a shallow subsurface zone the near surface commonly a dozen meters deep are governed by interactions between multi physics fields occurring in highly complex material structures and often in variable porous soils and multiphase fluids in different compartments e g grayson et al 1997 these multiscale interactions are difficult to observe directly and thus hinder our capability to thoroughly understand predict and ultimately manage shallow systems in a sustainable manner geophysical observations can supply a series of powerful tools that may assist in quantifying the near surface structure and process these observational methods have an advantage in sampling in different space and time scales in a more efficient and economical way over the traditional in situ point scale sampling methods of the subsurface for hydraulic properties and states in hydrological problems e g schulze makuch et al 1999 therefore geophysical methods have emerged to support the investigation and monitoring of the hydrological states and dynamics in the near surface several new geophysical methods have emerged or have been developed in hydrological investigations e g cosentini and foti 2014 peterie et al 2015 gao et al 2017 using the relationships between geophysical attributes e g electrical resistance seismic velocity to the hydrological properties e g permeability the robustness of these relationships is vital and several of them have proven effective in providing valuable information about the near surface environment beyond sampling points new and more precise detection approaches with the information attained have been developed supported by new insights into the more established relationships between hydrological properties of interest and observable geophysical properties that are not only attained by empirical equations since fluid transport is a general mechanical problem poroelasticity in a mechanics framework combines the solid deformation and fluid flow into a uniform system biot 1956 due to the development of equipment dynamic poroelasticity shows its vitality in refined seismic detection in conventional petroleum explorations e g ba et al 2015 this theory assimilates the elastodyamics used in seismic observations and fluid permeation into estimations in hydrology under a physics mechanism and it can further be applied near the surface using a similar methodology wang 2000 cosenza et al 2002 pride 2005 a further issue that must be considered is the surface boundary in seismic observation geometry for near surface hydrological problems in which surface waves more than body waves can be generated and recorded in seismic observations as raw geophysical data e g zhang et al 2012 key to this boundary value problem is an understanding of the definition of the fluid behaviors across the free surface and the effects on near surface wave responses usually at this interface the continuity of the fluid pressure is assumed to hold throughout the dynamic wave induced fluid pressure coupling process from the onset of fluid pressure gradients to the final pressure at equilibrium corresponding to the open pore op boundary condition deresiewicz and skalak 1963 however a more general scenario has related the petrophysical fluid flow with pressure jump across the interface proportional to the relative fluid solid motion bourbié et al 1987 two possible physics sketches can be introduced one is related to an imperfect hydraulic contact in the presence of non load bearing clay minerals clogging the pore throats across the surface fig 1 a and the second is associated with the capillarity membrane resistance thereby creating a redundant pressure jump nagy and blaho 1994 fig 1b therefore the question arises how a non pressure continuity boundary condition alters the predictions of the dynamic poroelastic signatures it is known that in this small scale the heterogeneity for soil water retention at the near surface is important for energy flux ronda et al 2002 given that the model for fluid transport in porous soil is heavily used in hydrological property estimations e g dullien 1992 significant changes may possibly entail important implications in this embedded dynamic poroelastic model indeed several previous studies indicate that the variational boundary conditions associated with fluid flow changes the wave responses in fully saturated media feng and johnson 1983a b analyzed the surface wave mode generation on a water saturated medium interface approximating the seafloor case tajuddin 1984 as well as albers and wilmanski 2005 investigated surface waves under an impermeable closed pore cp free surface boundary in a simplified saturated poroelastic model neglecting viscous coupling between the solid and fluid zhang et al 2011 2012 2016 further studied the imperfect hydraulic contact on wave radiation behaviors in saturated media near free surface boundary it is noted that because of the evapotranspiration the near surface porous vadose zone bears the inflow of air however more than one fluid flows across the solid matrix with the viscous drag under a more complicated unsaturated system whereas a single fluid saturated model is insufficient the seismic wave propagations in these extended biot models were investigated generally in a full space medium configuration that corresponded to body waves to advance an understanding of the complex interactions between the multiphase systems e g santos et al 1990 tuncay and corapcioglu 1997 wei and muraleetharan 2002 lo et al 2005 2015 lo and sposito 2013 for near surface observations the surface boundary effects must be further considered especially the more general scenarios for fluid across interface can shed insight into the intensity of the interaction between land and atmosphere by mass and energy exchange despite some research accounted for the boundary value problems limited to the op case e g dai et al 2006 chao et al 2006 lo 2008 chen et al 2011 this physical process is not well elucidated furthermore the previous studies had model parameter simplifications or theoretical derivation defects which make the results lacked of practical implications the aim of this paper is to incorporate the general pressure jump boundary condition into the unsaturated model in a general fashion so that both aforementioned scenarios and possibly other scenarios can be modeled as wave response signatures in the time domain corresponding to the direct seismic observation records that previously have not been well analyzed to do so we argued that the fluid partial flow can be interpreted in the proportionality coefficient as the surface stiffness this surface stiffness captures the particular interface properties that cannot be assigned to the unsaturated medium internal we then solved the modified boundary value problem under near surface geometry within the framework of dynamic unsaturated poroelasticity and presented them as the time domain green s functions 2 theory 2 1 an unsaturated model for a two immiscible fluid flow in a deformable porous medium in the low frequency band the fluid can be considered an averaged mixture at a low frequency range but when the matrix suction is ignored the pore pressure pf in a general unified pore space can be written as e g pride 1992 coussy 2004 lo and sposito 2013 1 p f p 1 s 1 p 2 s 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the pressures of the two immiscible fluids for example the nonwetting and wetting fluids s 1 and s

surface stiffness in the mixture of the two immiscible fluids the capillary force induces the pressure gradient across the fluid interface the capillary force can be written as 16 p c p 1 p 2 this unsaturated effect generates along the interfaces of the wetting and nonwetting fluids interacted with the solid in addition pc can be written as 17 p c m π c s 1 where m is the capillary modulus or reference pressure π c s 1 is a dimensionless function to represent the capillary curve following the soil water retention curve e g van genuchten 1980 the wetting saturation s2 can be written as 18 1 χ p c n m s 2 e where s 2e is the effective wetting saturation as s 2e s 2 s 2r 1 s 2r and s2r is the residual saturation during the water imbibition or drainage χ m and n are the fitting parameters and m 1 1 n for simplicity we assume s 2r 0 eq 18 can be recast with 19 m 1 χ 20 π s 1 1 s 1 m 1 1 n 1 the relative permeability can be derived by the water retention model with conceptual pore geometry distributions e g mualem 1976 chen et al 1999 recommended the van genuchten mualem vgm model to predict the relative permeability with sufficient experimental data support the closed form can be written as 21 κ r 1 s 1 λ 1 1 s 1 m 1 2 m 22 κ r 2 1 s 2 λ 1 1 1 s 1 m 1 m 2 where λ is a fitting parameter for near surface geophysical observations for hydraulic processes there is an important boundary constraint called free surface for the multiphase systems to model the interaction between the composite and the air assuming the boundary at z 0 the equations for the constraint can be written in a cylindrical coordinate r θ z as 23 τ z z z 0 2 π r 1 f ω δ r 24 τ z r z 0 0 25 i ω ϕ s 1 u z 1 u z 0 d 1 p 1 z 0 0 26 i ω ϕ s 2 u z 2 u z 0 d 2 p 2 z 0 0 herein a finite spatial scale load applied on the surface with finite frequency spectrum as f ω for a general near surface geophysical source is applied through the effective normal stress see eq 23 at 0 0 0 the caret sign means that the parameters are in the frequency domain δ is the dirac delta function eq 24 represents the free shear stress across the surface since the induced pore pressure gradient across the surface is central to initiate the interlayer flow the continuity of the pressure across the interface dominates this multiphase diffusion in biot s poroealstic scenario the pore pressure at the interface is generally described in two equations as 25 and 26 where d 1 and d 2 are the two surface stiffness coefficients the inverse of the surface resistance coefficients for the nonwetting and the wetting fluids di and i 1 2 reflects the surface stiffness for the two fluids di is the op the surface is in perfect hydraulic contact di 0 for sealed interface as the cp no pore pressure equilibration can occur in general the intermediate state can be depicted by assigning a particular interfacial property to the surface it can be interpreted in two physical scenarios see fig 1 the surface stiffness in the real value originally envisaged by deresiewicz and skalak 1963 models a perturbed hydraulic condition as the partially open boundary condition 25 and 26 and another scenario in a frequency dependent imaginary di as a reactance term relates to the presence of capillary forces the pressure jump across the boundary can be further depicted as nagy and blaho 1994 27 i ω ϕ s j u z j u z 0 i ω w j 1 p j z 0 0 j 1 2 where wj pa m 1 is the so called membrane resistance that controls the capillarity reinforcement as this is a transient process the overall surface stiffness turns out as d j i ω w j 1 which is complex valued and frequency dependent that is it has the character of a reactance the capillary forces can extend a thin membrane over the surface pores of a wetting fluid filled porous solid at the free surface which is stiff enough to alter the hydraulic conductivity 3 dynamic wave signatures 3 1 generation of green s functions for the near surface problem using the

domain can be obtained see detail in appendix b applying the hankel transform to the boundary conditions eqs 23 26 the special solutions namely green s functions of the dynamic solid fluid coupling equations in the frequency wavenumber domain can be obtained see eqs b34 b37 in appendix b the rayleigh dominator r 0 dominates the full wave fields near surface especially for the surface waves the near surface spatiotemporal response can be extracted by the inverse transforms with some approaches to conquer oscillatory integrals e g zhang et al 2012 we seek the solution at receivers at different offsets and depths the source is selected as a ricker wavelet signature with finite frequency band 37 f t f 0 1 2 π 2 f 0 2 t 2 exp π 2 f 0 2 t 2 where f 0 is the dominant frequency of the source and f 0 is the amplitude we chose the f 0 50 hz and f 0 1000 n as common near surface seismic observations the medium properties of the multiphase system are listed in table 1 as typical sands lo et al 2007 because the geometry attenuation effects are the same for different models at a distinct offset the physical significance of these physical parameters can be identified from their corresponding wave responses in a general validity 3 2 full wave signature analysis 3 2 1 low frequency signatures fig 2 shows the full wave signatures of a vertical solid displacement and two fluid pressures under different free surface drainage conditions whereas op indicates the open pore in perfect hydraulic contact cp means the closed pore in a totally sealed interface the value of the surface stiffness d 2 refers to the constant imperfect hydraulic conductivity and is given in unit of m gpa s 1 the membrane resistance w 2 for the capillarity extended free surface is given in gpa m 1 the free surface is set to be totally open for the air as d 1 under the two partial hydraulic drainage scenarios because air is a nonwetting and thermal active fluid that may be not obviously affected by these two physical processes unfortunately there are no sufficient and experimental supports for verified results available for the surface stiffness of multiphase fluid saturated porous solids of different physical formations the free surface boundary condition bears a surface stiffness d 2 about 100 m gpa s 1 for the typical transition between the op and cp wu at al 1990 in saturated media the simple cylindrical pore assumption for the water in contact with air under near surface environment produces the membrane resistance w 2 around 0 01 1 gpa m 1 nagy and blaho 1994 therefore we choose d 2 100 m gpa s 1 and w 2 0 1 gpa m 1 for the following discussion in the time domain wave fields on the surface the first p mode p1 and the first rayleigh mode r1 can be observed distinctively while the r1 waves are dominant there are three p modes and one shear mode in an unsaturated medium e g tuncay and corapcioglu 1996 lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 see also fig 4 two slow p waves propagate very slowly in a diffusion character the real and imaginary part of wavenumbers are nearly equal therefore they diffuse strongly and cannot be clearly observed in a real soil even if we compute an extreme long time simulation not shown here the shear mode is overlapped by the r1 wave see fig 3 three p modes also cannot generate three rayleigh type surface wave modes as in a decoupled p and s wave radiation system lo 2008 in a uniform multiphase medium the second rayleigh r2 wave may not even exist as in the biot model where the r2 mode disappears under the op free surface zhang et al 2011 2012 2016 therefore we also cannot affirm the slow rayleigh waves in this unsaturated medium furthermore the wave signatures in the solid are not sensitive to the hydraulic contacts all the wave forms overlap in the p1 and r1 time windows see fig 2 top however the fluid pressures are sensitive see fig 2 middle and bottom the nonwetting fluid air totally diffuses across the interface without any perturbation on the surface except for the cp case the wetting fluid water bears resonances as under the cp surface for the two pressure jump interface reactions on the fluid flow however the amplitudes of pressure are smaller caused by the partial diffusion through the surface for the op case the fluid pressure drops to zero by the total diffusion these distinct phenomena can be further represented in the depth dependent wave signatures in fig 3 the shear waves appear in the solid displacements that link the r1 waves at a certain depth the p1s transferring waves are tangent to the shear wave fronts and connect to the p1 waves near the surface however the shear wave components do not appear in the fluid pressures because fluid does not bear shear motion moreover we further discover that the r1 waves penetrate much deeper in the solid displacement than in the fluid pressure this is because the fluid pressure cannot bear shear motion in the r1 waves and actually propagates as a transferring wave mode also inferred as a r1p2 mode in the biot mode zhang et al 2016 near surface diffusion in fluids can be observed for the op case and in the air pressure for the d 2 100 and w 2 0 1 cases the diffusive scale ld in these cases equals several centimeters therefore the diffusion occurs quite close to the surface where l d ω 1 d and the diffusivity d κ m 2 h d η 2 h u whereas h d and h u are the drained and the undrained p1 wave modulus carcione 2007 lo and sposito 2013 in the internal medium all cases show the equivalent wave signatures because the boundary constraint does not apply far from the surface the dynamic process shows as it does in a full space without differences 3 2 2 high frequency signatures in the unsaturated medium the wave induced multiphase fluid flow is similar to the biot global flow driven by the viscous coupling between the solid and fluids the critical frequency of unsaturated medium can be defined as gubaidullin et al 2004 lo et al 2015 38 f c j η j ϕ 2 π α c κ ρ j j 1 2 for most porous materials f c always equals several khz 7 11 khz for air and 116 khz for water in this unsaturated sand listed in table 1 for general field geophysical observations the wave excitations are much lower as a result when the wave propagates in the unsaturated porous medium the solid and fluids oscillate in phase around the static limit of viscous coupling without obvious dispersion for fast waves e g lo et al 2005 see also fig 4 to further verify and quantify the surface effects for wave propagations especially for the surface waves in the unsaturated porous medium systems we calculated an ideal condition to simulate the unrelaxed state for viscous coupling in which the solid and fluids move out of phase around the no flow limit feng and johnson 1983b see also fig 7 for an extremely low solid and fluid viscous coupling the biot darcy coefficients are 10 6 the amount of the abovementioned case wave structures depend crucially on the way the interface prepared which is the same as the abovementioned example in this case the source wavelet frequency band is much higher than the corresponding f c in figs 5 and 6 we plotted the corresponding wave signatures of the solid displacement and the two fluid pressures we see another slow surface wave r2 mode that is only trapped along the surface and damped in depth even for the op case see fig 6a which is different to the biot saturated model zhang et al 2012 for the cp and the extended partial connected pore surface d 2 100 and w 2 0 1 without strong diffusion near surface it can be observed in the fluid pressures while for the op surface it totally diffuses out see the middle and right panels in fig 6 the solid perturbations also show no distinctive differences see the top in fig 5 but the fluid pressures see the others in fig 5 the imperfect hydraulic conductivity d 2 100 and the capillarity membrane resistance extended surface w 2 0 1 show distinct different responses see fig 5c it is noted that before the first arrival in the solid displacement a faster body mode noted p2 can be seen in the fluid pressures whose velocity approaches 300 ms 1 in our investigation of the velocity frequency dispersion fig 7 we deduced that this mode is a slow mode in the low frequency band because the loose sand we selected is an extremely soft material in which the p1 wave velocity is even slower than the acoustic velocity 340 ms 1 in air the high frequency no flow limit can be considered to have been assigned an extremely high permeability with very low solid and fluid coupling and no fluid interactive viscous coupling and the pore air can be induced to approach its own acoustical properties therefore the pore air acoustic wave can be seen in the pressures with higher velocity but not in the solid it can also be seen that it can be reverberated strongly under the cp surface comparing the middle and right panels in fig 6b with those of figs 6a c d 4 discussion and conclusions the wave signatures under an excitation wavelet impulse are significant for near surface geophysical observations to understand the medium responses in a mechanical physical field which is crucial for hydrological interpretations for surface or crosswell seismic data using the potential decomposition and the integral transform we first considered the imperfect hydraulic contact and the capillary membrane resistance as they appear in the surface stiffness eqs 25 27 on the wave propagations in an unsaturated medium which incorporates a pressure jump proportional to the relative fluid solid motion across the free surface the wave propagations close to the low and high frequency limits were comparatively analyzed the imperfect hydraulic contacts across the free surface do not alter the dynamic wave responses in the solid neither the body modes nor the surface modes in an unsaturated multiphase system lower or higher than the critical frequency f c the p1 body wave and the great amplitude r1 surface wave can be observed whether the solid and fluid oscillate in phase by the strong solid fluid viscous coupling or out of phase by the tiny solid fluid viscous coupling at certain depths the overlapped shear wave and the transferring p1s wave can also be observed moreover a tiny viscous coupling will generate an observable r2 surface wave for all free surface cases as different from the biot model the p3 body wave is too slow to be observed and directly applied in seismic data gathering which might be investigated in refined experimental designs e g plona 1980 correspondingly the pore fluid pressures are sensitive to the interface pressure jump that can be modeled by a real or imaginary surface stiffness this constant term or a frequency reactance term leads to a partially connected pore space on the surface which makes the water flow behavior vary between the cp and the op surfaces as two pore connecting limits when the pore is connected a fluid diffusion occurs along the surface which makes the significant pressure drop near the surface the diffusion strength depends on the surface stiffness since matrix permeability stiffening by fine clay minerals and capillary forces control the process of fluid retention and formations of different fluid patches zhang et al 2014 ba et al 2016 the extended free surface property can be useful in the precise assessment of flow signatures in acoustic experiments in laboratory and field scales this might have important implications for understanding the role of interlayer flow between the earth and the atmosphere for mass and energy exchange a curious phenomenon of the fast p2 wave mode is observed only in the fluid pressures around the no flow limit in the unsaturated medium an initial interpretation might be adapted by a generation of the tiny viscous solid dragged air acoustic wave in a highly permeable solid frame in which a sealed surface induces strong reverberations in conclusion the generalized surface stiffness for near surface wave propagation generates new modeling choices in the presence of a mineral clogging or a capillary membrane resistance under different physical mechanisms therefore one infers that in the near surface fluid mobility based on the seismic wave gathering there will be significant misinterpretations towards the medium internal property estimations that do not consider surface hydraulic contacts although the under layering half space geometry with typical unsaturated parameter selections may in certain cases be too simple to resemble real sedimentary records the generalized modal analysis provides further insight into wave induced hydrological interactions in order to better understand geophysical observations for many hydrological problems acknowledgments this research is financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc under

781,understanding the dynamic wave signatures in near surface unsaturated soils is crucial for the application of seismic observations in hydrology we first derived and analyzed the half space spatiotemporal green s functions that correspond to the raw seismic recordings incorporating fluid pressure jump and free surface boundary conditions represented by the surface stiffness we described the dynamic wave propagation in solid frame displacement and excess fluid pressures in response to an excitation wavelet impulse and our results show that the surface hydraulic contact does not obviously alter the wave signatures in solids regardless of how strong or tiny the solid fluid viscous coupling however in fluids due to the near surface fluid diffusion across the boundary in this state the proportional term or the imagery reactance term causes the intermediate state to alter between the open pore op and closed pore cp surface the fast p p1 body and the dominant fast rayleigh r1 surface waves can always be observed near the surface as can the second rayleigh r2 surface wave at the high frequency limit with tiny solid fluid viscous coupling furthermore the surface waves in the fluid pressures do not penetrate as deeply as in the solid due to the shear motion transferring in them a high internal permeability may generate the second p p2 wave by the excited air acoustic wave propagation in fluid pore pressures showing the strong reverberations under the cp surface these changes in dynamic waves can be attributed to petrophysically plausible scenarios of flow across the free surface by imperfect hydraulic contacts or capillarity reactance keywords poroelasticity unsaturated porous media near surface 1 introduction the capability to detect subsurface spatiotemporal environmental characteristics remains a challenge in many scientific and engineering domains it is a challenge in particular for hydrology where the fluid transport and transformations in a shallow subsurface zone the near surface commonly a dozen meters deep are governed by interactions between multi physics fields occurring in highly complex material structures and often in variable porous soils and multiphase fluids in different compartments e g grayson et al 1997 these multiscale interactions are difficult to observe directly and thus hinder our capability to thoroughly understand predict and ultimately manage shallow systems in a sustainable manner geophysical observations can supply a series of powerful tools that may assist in quantifying the near surface structure and process these observational methods have an advantage in sampling in different space and time scales in a more efficient and economical way over the traditional in situ point scale sampling methods of the subsurface for hydraulic properties and states in hydrological problems e g schulze makuch et al 1999 therefore geophysical methods have emerged to support the investigation and monitoring of the hydrological states and dynamics in the near surface several new geophysical methods have emerged or have been developed in hydrological investigations e g cosentini and foti 2014 peterie et al 2015 gao et al 2017 using the relationships between geophysical attributes e g electrical resistance seismic velocity to the hydrological properties e g permeability the robustness of these relationships is vital and several of them have proven effective in providing valuable information about the near surface environment beyond sampling points new and more precise detection approaches with the information attained have been developed supported by new insights into the more established relationships between hydrological properties of interest and observable geophysical properties that are not only attained by empirical equations since fluid transport is a general mechanical problem poroelasticity in a mechanics framework combines the solid deformation and fluid flow into a uniform system biot 1956 due to the development of equipment dynamic poroelasticity shows its vitality in refined seismic detection in conventional petroleum explorations e g ba et al 2015 this theory assimilates the elastodyamics used in seismic observations and fluid permeation into estimations in hydrology under a physics mechanism and it can further be applied near the surface using a similar methodology wang 2000 cosenza et al 2002 pride 2005 a further issue that must be considered is the surface boundary in seismic observation geometry for near surface hydrological problems in which surface waves more than body waves can be generated and recorded in seismic observations as raw geophysical data e g zhang et al 2012 key to this boundary value problem is an understanding of the definition of the fluid behaviors across the free surface and the effects on near surface wave responses usually at this interface the continuity of the fluid pressure is assumed to hold throughout the dynamic wave induced fluid pressure coupling process from the onset of fluid pressure gradients to the final pressure at equilibrium corresponding to the open pore op boundary condition deresiewicz and skalak 1963 however a more general scenario has related the petrophysical fluid flow with pressure jump across the interface proportional to the relative fluid solid motion bourbié et al 1987 two possible physics sketches can be introduced one is related to an imperfect hydraulic contact in the presence of non load bearing clay minerals clogging the pore throats across the surface fig 1 a and the second is associated with the capillarity membrane resistance thereby creating a redundant pressure jump nagy and blaho 1994 fig 1b therefore the question arises how a non pressure continuity boundary condition alters the predictions of the dynamic poroelastic signatures it is known that in this small scale the heterogeneity for soil water retention at the near surface is important for energy flux ronda et al 2002 given that the model for fluid transport in porous soil is heavily used in hydrological property estimations e g dullien 1992 significant changes may possibly entail important implications in this embedded dynamic poroelastic model indeed several previous studies indicate that the variational boundary conditions associated with fluid flow changes the wave responses in fully saturated media feng and johnson 1983a b analyzed the surface wave mode generation on a water saturated medium interface approximating the seafloor case tajuddin 1984 as well as albers and wilmanski 2005 investigated surface waves under an impermeable closed pore cp free surface boundary in a simplified saturated poroelastic model neglecting viscous coupling between the solid and fluid zhang et al 2011 2012 2016 further studied the imperfect hydraulic contact on wave radiation behaviors in saturated media near free surface boundary it is noted that because of the evapotranspiration the near surface porous vadose zone bears the inflow of air however more than one fluid flows across the solid matrix with the viscous drag under a more complicated unsaturated system whereas a single fluid saturated model is insufficient the seismic wave propagations in these extended biot models were investigated generally in a full space medium configuration that corresponded to body waves to advance an understanding of the complex interactions between the multiphase systems e g santos et al 1990 tuncay and corapcioglu 1997 wei and muraleetharan 2002 lo et al 2005 2015 lo and sposito 2013 for near surface observations the surface boundary effects must be further considered especially the more general scenarios for fluid across interface can shed insight into the intensity of the interaction between land and atmosphere by mass and energy exchange despite some research accounted for the boundary value problems limited to the op case e g dai et al 2006 chao et al 2006 lo 2008 chen et al 2011 this physical process is not well elucidated furthermore the previous studies had model parameter simplifications or theoretical derivation defects which make the results lacked of practical implications the aim of this paper is to incorporate the general pressure jump boundary condition into the unsaturated model in a general fashion so that both aforementioned scenarios and possibly other scenarios can be modeled as wave response signatures in the time domain corresponding to the direct seismic observation records that previously have not been well analyzed to do so we argued that the fluid partial flow can be interpreted in the proportionality coefficient as the surface stiffness this surface stiffness captures the particular interface properties that cannot be assigned to the unsaturated medium internal we then solved the modified boundary value problem under near surface geometry within the framework of dynamic unsaturated poroelasticity and presented them as the time domain green s functions 2 theory 2 1 an unsaturated model for a two immiscible fluid flow in a deformable porous medium in the low frequency band the fluid can be considered an averaged mixture at a low frequency range but when the matrix suction is ignored the pore pressure pf in a general unified pore space can be written as e g pride 1992 coussy 2004 lo and sposito 2013 1 p f p 1 s 1 p 2 s 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the pressures of the two immiscible fluids for example the nonwetting and wetting fluids s 1 and s

unsaturated effect generates along the interfaces of the wetting and nonwetting fluids interacted with the solid in addition pc can be written as 17 p c m π c s 1 where m is the capillary modulus or reference pressure π c s 1 is a dimensionless function to represent the capillary curve following the soil water retention curve e g van genuchten 1980 the wetting saturation s2 can be written as 18 1

and m 1 1 n for simplicity we assume s 2r 0 eq 18 can be recast with 19 m 1 χ 20 π s 1 1 s 1 m 1 1 n 1 the relative permeability can be derived by the water retention model with conceptual pore geometry distributions e g mualem 1976 chen et al 1999 recommended the van genuchten mualem vgm model to predict the relative permeability with sufficient experimental data support the closed form can be written as 21 κ r 1 s 1 λ 1 1 s 1 m 1 2 m 22 κ r 2 1 s 2 λ 1 1 1 s 1 m 1 m 2 where λ is a fitting parameter for near surface geophysical observations for hydraulic processes there is an important boundary constraint called free surface for the multiphase systems to model the interaction between the composite and the air assuming the boundary at z 0 the equations for the constraint can be written in a cylindrical coordinate r θ z as 23 τ z z z 0 2 π r 1 f ω δ r 24 τ z r z 0 0 25 i ω ϕ s 1 u z 1 u z 0 d 1 p 1 z 0 0 26 i ω ϕ s 2 u z 2 u z 0 d 2 p 2 z 0 0 herein a finite spatial scale load applied on the surface with finite frequency spectrum as f ω for a general near surface geophysical source is applied through the effective normal stress see eq 23 at 0 0 0 the caret sign means that the parameters are in the frequency domain δ is the dirac delta function eq 24 represents the free shear stress across the surface since the induced pore pressure gradient across the surface is central to initiate the interlayer flow the continuity of the pressure across the interface dominates this multiphase diffusion in biot s poroealstic scenario the pore pressure at the interface is generally described in two equations as 25 and 26 where d 1 and d 2 are the two surface stiffness coefficients the inverse of the surface resistance coefficients for the nonwetting and the wetting fluids di and i 1 2 reflects the surface stiffness for the two fluids di is the op the surface is in perfect hydraulic contact di 0 for sealed interface as the cp no pore pressure equilibration can occur in general the intermediate state can be depicted by assigning a particular interfacial property to the surface it can be interpreted in two physical scenarios see fig 1 the surface stiffness in the real value originally envisaged by deresiewicz and skalak 1963 models a perturbed hydraulic condition as the partially open boundary condition 25 and 26 and another scenario in a frequency dependent imaginary di as a reactance term relates to the presence of capillary forces the pressure jump across the boundary can be further depicted as nagy and blaho 1994 27 i ω ϕ s j u z j u z 0 i ω w j 1 p j z 0 0 j 1 2 where wj pa m 1 is the so called membrane resistance that controls the capillarity reinforcement as this is a transient process the overall surface stiffness turns out as d j i ω w j 1 which is complex valued and frequency dependent that is it has the character of a reactance the capillary forces can extend a thin membrane over the surface pores of a wetting fluid filled porous solid at the free surface which is stiff enough to alter the hydraulic conductivity 3 dynamic wave signatures 3 1 generation of green s functions for the near surface problem using the

domain can be obtained see detail in appendix b applying the hankel transform to the boundary conditions eqs 23 26 the special solutions namely green s functions of the dynamic solid fluid coupling equations in the frequency wavenumber domain can be obtained see eqs b34 b37 in appendix b the rayleigh dominator r 0 dominates the full wave fields near surface especially for the surface waves the near surface spatiotemporal response can be extracted by the inverse transforms with some approaches to conquer oscillatory integrals e g zhang et al 2012 we seek the solution at receivers at different offsets and depths the source is selected as a ricker wavelet signature with finite frequency band 37 f t f 0 1 2 π 2 f 0 2 t 2 exp π 2 f 0 2 t 2 where f 0 is the dominant frequency of the source and f 0 is the amplitude we chose the f 0 50 hz and f 0 1000 n as common near surface seismic observations the medium properties of the multiphase system are listed in table 1 as typical sands lo et al 2007 because the geometry attenuation effects are the same for different models at a distinct offset the physical significance of these physical parameters can be identified from their corresponding wave responses in a general validity 3 2 full wave signature analysis 3 2 1 low frequency signatures fig 2 shows the full wave signatures of a vertical solid displacement and two fluid pressures under different free surface drainage conditions whereas op indicates the open pore in perfect hydraulic contact cp means the closed pore in a totally sealed interface the value of the surface stiffness d 2 refers to the constant imperfect hydraulic conductivity and is given in unit of m gpa s 1 the membrane resistance w 2 for the capillarity extended free surface is given in gpa m 1 the free surface is set to be totally open for the air as d 1 under the two partial hydraulic drainage scenarios because air is a nonwetting and thermal active fluid that may be not obviously affected by these two physical processes unfortunately there are no sufficient and experimental supports for verified results available for the surface stiffness of multiphase fluid saturated porous solids of different physical formations the free surface boundary condition bears a surface stiffness d 2 about 100 m gpa s 1 for the typical transition between the op and cp wu at al 1990 in saturated media the simple cylindrical pore assumption for the water in contact with air under near surface environment produces the membrane resistance w 2 around 0 01 1 gpa m 1 nagy and blaho 1994 therefore we choose d 2 100 m gpa s 1 and w 2 0 1 gpa m 1 for the following discussion in the time domain wave fields on the surface the first p mode p1 and the first rayleigh mode r1 can be observed distinctively while the r1 waves are dominant there are three p modes and one shear mode in an unsaturated medium e g tuncay and corapcioglu 1996 lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 see also fig 4 two slow p waves propagate very slowly in a diffusion character the real and imaginary part of wavenumbers are nearly equal therefore they diffuse strongly and cannot be clearly observed in a real soil even if we compute an extreme long time simulation not shown here the shear mode is overlapped by the r1 wave see fig 3 three p modes also cannot generate three rayleigh type surface wave modes as in a decoupled p and s wave radiation system lo 2008 in a uniform multiphase medium the second rayleigh r2 wave may not even exist as in the biot model where the r2 mode disappears under the op free surface zhang et al 2011 2012 2016 therefore we also cannot affirm the slow rayleigh waves in this unsaturated medium furthermore the wave signatures in the solid are not sensitive to the hydraulic contacts all the wave forms overlap in the p1 and r1 time windows see fig 2 top however the fluid pressures are sensitive see fig 2 middle and bottom the nonwetting fluid air totally diffuses across the interface without any perturbation on the surface except for the cp case the wetting fluid water bears resonances as under the cp surface for the two pressure jump interface reactions on the fluid flow however the amplitudes of pressure are smaller caused by the partial diffusion through the surface for the op case the fluid pressure drops to zero by the total diffusion these distinct phenomena can be further represented in the depth dependent wave signatures in fig 3 the shear waves appear in the solid displacements that link the r1 waves at a certain depth the p1s transferring waves are tangent to the shear wave fronts and connect to the p1 waves near the surface however the shear wave components do not appear in the fluid pressures because fluid does not bear shear motion moreover we further discover that the r1 waves penetrate much deeper in the solid displacement than in the fluid pressure this is because the fluid pressure cannot bear shear motion in the r1 waves and actually propagates as a transferring wave mode also inferred as a r1p2 mode in the biot mode zhang et al 2016 near surface diffusion in fluids can be observed for the op case and in the air pressure for the d 2 100 and w 2 0 1 cases the diffusive scale ld in these cases equals several centimeters therefore the diffusion occurs quite close to the surface where l d ω 1 d and the diffusivity d κ m 2 h d η 2 h u whereas h d and h u are the drained and the undrained p1 wave modulus carcione 2007 lo and sposito 2013 in the internal medium all cases show the equivalent wave signatures because the boundary constraint does not apply far from the surface the dynamic process shows as it does in a full space without differences 3 2 2 high frequency signatures in the unsaturated medium the wave induced multiphase fluid flow is similar to the biot global flow driven by the viscous coupling between the solid and fluids the critical frequency of unsaturated medium can be defined as gubaidullin et al 2004 lo et al 2015 38 f c j η j ϕ 2 π α c κ ρ j j 1 2 for most porous materials f c always equals several khz 7 11 khz for air and 116 khz for water in this unsaturated sand listed in table 1 for general field geophysical observations the wave excitations are much lower as a result when the wave propagates in the unsaturated porous medium the solid and fluids oscillate in phase around the static limit of viscous coupling without obvious dispersion for fast waves e g lo et al 2005 see also fig 4 to further verify and quantify the surface effects for wave propagations especially for the surface waves in the unsaturated porous medium systems we calculated an ideal condition to simulate the unrelaxed state for viscous coupling in which the solid and fluids move out of phase around the no flow limit feng and johnson 1983b see also fig 7 for an extremely low solid and fluid viscous coupling the biot darcy coefficients are 10 6 the amount of the abovementioned case wave structures depend crucially on the way the interface prepared which is the same as the abovementioned example in this case the source wavelet frequency band is much higher than the corresponding f c in figs 5 and 6 we plotted the corresponding wave signatures of the solid displacement and the two fluid pressures we see another slow surface wave r2 mode that is only trapped along the surface and damped in depth even for the op case see fig 6a which is different to the biot saturated model zhang et al 2012 for the cp and the extended partial connected pore surface d 2 100 and w 2 0 1 without strong diffusion near surface it can be observed in the fluid pressures while for the op surface it totally diffuses out see the middle and right panels in fig 6 the solid perturbations also show no distinctive differences see the top in fig 5 but the fluid pressures see the others in fig 5 the imperfect hydraulic conductivity d 2 100 and the capillarity membrane resistance extended surface w 2 0 1 show distinct different responses see fig 5c it is noted that before the first arrival in the solid displacement a faster body mode noted p2 can be seen in the fluid pressures whose velocity approaches 300 ms 1 in our investigation of the velocity frequency dispersion fig 7 we deduced that this mode is a slow mode in the low frequency band because the loose sand we selected is an extremely soft material in which the p1 wave velocity is even slower than the acoustic velocity 340 ms 1 in air the high frequency no flow limit can be considered to have been assigned an extremely high permeability with very low solid and fluid coupling and no fluid interactive viscous coupling and the pore air can be induced to approach its own acoustical properties therefore the pore air acoustic wave can be seen in the pressures with higher velocity but not in the solid it can also be seen that it can be reverberated strongly under the cp surface comparing the middle and right panels in fig 6b with those of figs 6a c d 4 discussion and conclusions the wave signatures under an excitation wavelet impulse are significant for near surface geophysical observations to understand the medium responses in a mechanical physical field which is crucial for hydrological interpretations for surface or crosswell seismic data using the potential decomposition and the integral transform we first considered the imperfect hydraulic contact and the capillary membrane resistance as they appear in the surface stiffness eqs 25 27 on the wave propagations in an unsaturated medium which incorporates a pressure jump proportional to the relative fluid solid motion across the free surface the wave propagations close to the low and high frequency limits were comparatively analyzed the imperfect hydraulic contacts across the free surface do not alter the dynamic wave responses in the solid neither the body modes nor the surface modes in an unsaturated multiphase system lower or higher than the critical frequency f c the p1 body wave and the great amplitude r1 surface wave can be observed whether the solid and fluid oscillate in phase by the strong solid fluid viscous coupling or out of phase by the tiny solid fluid viscous coupling at certain depths the overlapped shear wave and the transferring p1s wave can also be observed moreover a tiny viscous coupling will generate an observable r2 surface wave for all free surface cases as different from the biot model the p3 body wave is too slow to be observed and directly applied in seismic data gathering which might be investigated in refined experimental designs e g plona 1980 correspondingly the pore fluid pressures are sensitive to the interface pressure jump that can be modeled by a real or imaginary surface stiffness this constant term or a frequency reactance term leads to a partially connected pore space on the surface which makes the water flow behavior vary between the cp and the op surfaces as two pore connecting limits when the pore is connected a fluid diffusion occurs along the surface which makes the significant pressure drop near the surface the diffusion strength depends on the surface stiffness since matrix permeability stiffening by fine clay minerals and capillary forces control the process of fluid retention and formations of different fluid patches zhang et al 2014 ba et al 2016 the extended free surface property can be useful in the precise assessment of flow signatures in acoustic experiments in laboratory and field scales this might have important implications for understanding the role of interlayer flow between the earth and the atmosphere for mass and energy exchange a curious phenomenon of the fast p2 wave mode is observed only in the fluid pressures around the no flow limit in the unsaturated medium an initial interpretation might be adapted by a generation of the tiny viscous solid dragged air acoustic wave in a highly permeable solid frame in which a sealed surface induces strong reverberations in conclusion the generalized surface stiffness for near surface wave propagation generates new modeling choices in the presence of a mineral clogging or a capillary membrane resistance under different physical mechanisms therefore one infers that in the near surface fluid mobility based on the seismic wave gathering there will be significant misinterpretations towards the medium internal property estimations that do not consider surface hydraulic contacts although the under layering half space geometry with typical unsaturated parameter selections may in certain cases be too simple to resemble real sedimentary records the generalized modal analysis provides further insight into wave induced hydrological interactions in order to better understand geophysical observations for many hydrological problems acknowledgments this research is financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc under

782,event based hydrologic models are frequently used for flood design and assessment these models generally require the specification of loss values that should relate to antecedent conditions in the catchment the loss values are key calibration parameters usually defined by matching model output with recorded or derived streamflow information it is now widely recognized that climate change will impact the hydrologic cycle and affect catchment conditions therefore loss values calibrated using historical observations may not be appropriate for simulating future flooding we use the method of bottom up climate change assessment to understand the potential for future performance changes in a calibrated event based model due to changing antecedent conditions this is achieved by comparing the results against those of a continuous hydrologic model that accounts for differences in antecedent catchment storages we find that event based model performance diverges substantially from the continuous model results under the climate change scenarios which account for increased dryness and greater extreme rainfall intensities the results indicate that there is greater uncertainty in event based model results when simulating drier climatic states attributed to greater variability in antecedent conditions however when simulating increased extreme rainfall intensity giving rise to larger rainfall events and generally wetter antecedent conditions the impact of changing antecedent conditions was less important than the models representations of catchment nonlinearity this suggests that changing antecedent conditions are not always the key source of potential model performance degradation therefore applying continuous simulation will not necessarily offer an advantage in characterizing future floods this study highlights the uncertainty facing practicing engineers and hydrologists wanting to account for climate change in flood modelling and design large scale changes in engineering practice may be required to ensure that the robustness of flood modelling is maintained in a changing climate 1 introduction event based models are commonly used by practicing engineers and hydrologists to simulate historical and design flood events these models consider a single rainfall event in isolation as opposed to continuous models that simulate flow over a longer period while continuous models are more commonly used in research event based models are widely applied in flood management around the world and represent traditional practice in most countries ball et al 2016 recent studies using or developing event based models have been undertaken in australia charalambous et al 2013 gamage et al 2015 france tramblay et al 2010 berthet et al 2009 italy camici et al 2011 china kan et al 2015 huang et al 2016 iran nourali et al 2016 and japan wang et al 2007 the application of event based models for engineering design is recommended by various guidelines including the usda national engineering handbook hydrology chapters chapter 17 flood routing united states department of agriculture 2014 australian rainfall and runoff a guide to flood estimation ball et al 2016 and the uk flood estimation handbook centre for ecology and hydrology 1999 event based models are simple to use but they are limited in their ability to represent the dynamic nature of catchments because they assume simple rainfall loss models that cannot be expected to capture temporal variation in catchment wetness the moisture stored in a catchment prior to a rainfall event herein referred to as antecedent conditions can have a significant impact on the streamflow experienced at the catchment outlet hino et al 1988 mein and larson 1973 karnieli and ben asher 1993 event based model simulations require the specification of appropriate rainfall loss values to convert total rainfall to excess rainfall while maintaining the intended annual exceedance probability aep for the event often referred to as aep neutral losses where streamflow observations are available it is common practice to calibrate the loss parameters in event based models the calibration of loss values allows for deficiencies in the model s process representation to be compensated so the calibrated values are not necessarily physically representative of the actual rainfall lost to the soil however the losses for dry antecedent conditions will still be relatively larger than the losses for wet antecedent conditions if all else remains equal various hydrologic models used to estimate flood discharges have different approaches to accounting for rainfall losses in australia for catchments where runoff generation is controlled by infiltration excess mechanisms as opposed to saturation excess mechanisms johnson et al 2016 it is common to apply the initial continuing loss method this method requires the specification of an initial loss at the start of a rainfall event followed by a constant loss rate for the remainder of the event the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service usda scs curve number method widely applied in the us uses information on soil type land use and antecedent moisture level dry medium or wet to determine rainfall losses united states department of agriculture soil conservation service 1985 this is one of the infiltration methods available in the storm water management model swmm other available methods in swmm include the green ampt method which requires specification of the initial moisture deficit in the soil and horton s method which requires specification of an initial maximum rate of loss rossman 2015 the uk flood estimation handbook recommends calculating initial and maximum soil moisture for design events using two parameters the base flow index determined based on soil type and the proportion of time the catchment was wet between 1961 and 1990 determined by the uk met office through nationwide continuous modelling of soil moisture kjeldsen 2007 the calculated soil moisture values are then applied in the loss model which is based on the probability distributed model moore 1985 each of these methods inherently assumes that optimized rainfall losses will not be different for future flood events as opposed to past flood events because they do not account for systematic changes in antecedent moisture characteristics herein referred to as nonstationarity in antecedent conditions we use the definition of westra et al 2014 and define the term nonstationarity as the tendency of model parameters to vary over time meaning that their selection is dependent on the calibration period it follows that models subject to parameter nonstationarity may experience degradation in prediction performance for a climatic scenario that is different from the calibration period it is anticipated that future climate change will have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle intergovernmental panel on climate change 2013 the implication for event based models is two fold firstly the rainfall intensities associated with particular aeps are likely to change wasko and sharma 2015 min et al 2011 this can be taken into account by factoring the design rainfall for a given aep based on projections for the study area for example in australia and new zealand rainfall depths are typically scaled up based on future temperature projections relevant to the design life of the project ball et al 2016 ministry for the environment 2010 the second implication of climate change for event based models is that flood influencing catchment processes could be impacted johnson et al 2016 antecedent moisture characteristics in catchments will be impacted by future changes in rainfall and potential evaporation with trends in soil moisture already being observed makra et al 2005 destouni and verrot 2014 and predicted holsten et al 2009 it follows that loss values calibrated based on historical flood events may not be representative of future losses if these loss values are applied for climate change assessments or future infrastructure design flood risk could be estimated incorrectly in response to this problem some researchers have suggested moving towards continuous simulation for flood assessment johnson et al 2016 because continuous models can dynamically estimate water storage in a catchment this gives them the ability to account for the actual conditions in a catchment preceding a particular rainfall event which has been shown to be important for accurately simulating floods under current conditions pathiraja et al 2012 wasko et al 2015 however at this stage no direct comparison of the two modelling methods under climate change has been undertaken in this study we use the method of bottom up climate change assessment prudhomme et al 2010 to examine the implications of potential nonstationarity in rainfall losses for event based models climate change assessments are usually undertaken using a top down approach where climate projections derived from general circulation models gcm are applied in catchment scale models generally through bias correction and downscaling procedures a significant challenge for top down climate change assessments is the uncertainty surrounding future climate assumptions around emissions and the associated response of the environment as well as implicit simplifications and limitations in climate models lead to difficulty in discretely defining future climatic regimes for impact assessment wilby and dessai 2010 brown and wilby 2012 there is reason to believe that current models may not reflect the full range of uncertainty due to issues such as model similarity steinschneider et al 2015 in particular mote et al 2011 noted that no climate model in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 represented a low likelihood high sensitivity response to future emissions to overcome these limitations prudhomme wilby prudhomme et al 2010 introduced bottom up climate change assessment also referred to as scenario neutral climate change assessment a technique for testing sensitivity to climate change scenarios they investigated the possibility of climate change increasing flood risk in the uk by more than 20 the allowance recommended in british design guidelines the increases in flood risk for a range of feasible climatic changes were modelled to demonstrate how much the climate would need to change to increase flood risk by more than 20 they related this to available projections to assess the risk that this magnitude of change could occur based on current understanding information of this nature is more useful for many decision makers than the results of top down assessments which only indicate increases in flood risk for a discrete set of future projections with high uncertainty other recent examples of bottom up climate change assessment include studies by brown et al 2012 culley et al 2016 kay et al 2014 and poff et al 2016 we aim to demonstrate that this method of systematically testing the response of a system to increasingly severe climate change scenarios can also be applied to stress test hydrologic models under change by using bottom up climate change assessment to assess performance divergence between event based and continuous models under changing climatic conditions we can understand whether changing antecedent conditions is the most important factor impacting relative model performance as is commonly assumed johnson et al 2016 this can provide evidence to fill an existing research gap whether future flood predictions will be more robust if the current generation of continuous models are adopted in place of commonly used event based models calibrated on past observations in this study we evaluate the impact of feasible changes in climate on event based model performance relative to continuous model results we apply bottom up climate change assessment to test the performance divergence between an event based model and a continuous model under increasingly severe climate change scenarios we find that while changing antecedent conditions do have an impact on model performance there are other model structural differences that also need to be considered when selecting or developing a model for climate change assessment 2 data 2 1 observations the models used in this study were developed based on the catchment draining to the hydrologic reference station mitta mitta at hinnomunjie station number 401203 in victoria australia herein referred to as the catchment this catchment falls within a key water generating area for the murray darling basin donohue et al 2011 an important agricultural region for australia its area is approximately 1546 km2 fig 1 and its elevation ranges from 545 to 1860 mahd the catchment is unregulated with farmland in the lower reaches and forested areas in the upper reaches the average annual precipitation is approximately 1260 mm over the study period and the average annual runoff is approximately 250 mm daily rainfall data for this catchment was extracted from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation s csiro australian water availability project daily rainfall grids at 0 05 resolution a weighted average was applied based on grid cell area within the catchment to estimate representative daily rainfall the closest pan evaporation station with an adequate length of record is located at dartmouth reservoir station number 082076 about 30 km north of the catchment this pan has records available from 1975 to present daily pan evaporation data was provided by the bureau of meteorology bom gaps in the pan evaporation series were infilled with monthly averages and a pan coefficient of 0 75 was applied doorenbos and pruitt 1977 while temperature data was not required as an input to the hydrologic models it was used to inform climatic correlations in the climate generator section 2 2 two neighbouring stations station numbers 083025 and 083090 located about 250 m apart are situated within the catchment daily maximum temperature data was obtained from the bureau of meteorology for these two stations the record for station 083025 begins in 1957 and ends in 2009 while station 83090 has a record beginning in 2004 the datasets during the overlapping period were compared and found to have a high correlation r 0 998 with only 6 of daily measurements differing by more than 1 c data from 083025 was applied for years preceding 2005 with data from 083090 used to complete the record 2 2 climate scenarios the future climate scenarios used in this assessment were informed by the csiro and bom climate change assessments for australia commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 because the catchment is located in southern australia projections from this region were applied two of the relevant projections for future rainfall are summarized as a decrease in wet season winter spring rainfall with reductions of about 18 projected for june through november by 2090 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 some gcms project reductions greater than 30 an increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall with 5 annual exceedance probability aep rainfall over one day expected to increase by around 25 by 2090 under rcp 8 5 with the 90th percentile at 30 it is important to note that rainfall projections derived from gcms are uncertain and vary between studies commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 a key benefit of bottom up climate change assessment is that a wide range of potential future changes can be included in the investigation and the sensitivity of model performance can be explored to identify any particular weaknesses the climate generator described by srikanthan and zhou 2003 was used to generate climate data representing future scenarios this tool uses recorded climate data at a site to calibrate parameters describing the observed sequences and cross correlations between variables it then generates new replicates with equivalent climatic statistics and cross correlations maintaining the cross correlations provides an important advantage because the climatic sequences vary in a consistent physically realistic way for example the potential evaporation will typically be higher on a hot day the climate generator considers rainfall as the primary variable rainfall time series are stochastically generated using a two step process first a series of wet dry days is simulated using a first order markov chain the probability of a wet day can be expressed as siriwardena et al 2002 1 π p w d 1 p w d p w w where pw d is the likelihood of a dry day being followed by a wet day and pw w is the likelihood of a wet day being followed by another wet day herein referred to as the wet day persistence the rainfall depth for a given wet day is sampled from a gamma distribution with the following probability density function siriwardena et al 2002 2 f x x β α 1 exp x β β γ α where α is the shape parameter and β is the scale parameter of the gamma distribution γ climate series for additional variables are generated as described in srikanthan and zhou 2003 the generator was modified so that the calibrated parameters describing the historical climatic series could be perturbed producing future climate replicates that maintain the observed correlations between variables for this assessment two parameters were adjusted to represent the range of potential future climatic conditions projected for southern australia the wet day persistence eq 1 between june and november herein referred to as the wet season wet day persistence was decreased in 2 increments to a maximum of 30 below its baseline value this produced climate sequences that were drier overall in winter and spring without decreasing the likelihood of high intensity rainfall as would be the case if a decrease in the average rainfall was modelled this is consistent with projections in commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 the distribution of rainfall was adjusted to increase simulated rainfall depths based on the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 projections for extreme events this was achieved by increasing the β parameter eq 2 in 2 increments to a maximum of 30 above its baseline value simulating the full range of parameter perturbations for each of the two variables in every possible combination gave a total of 256 scenarios for each scenario 100 climatic sequences each 100 years in length were generated to provide a range of possible climate realisations that represent the specified conditions for that scenario the chosen length and number of time series aimed to represent the potential climatic variability without becoming computationally burdensome the climate generator represented the existing climatic conditions herein referred to as the current climate scenario well for most statistics with a slightly high bias for the annual maximum rainfalls fig 2 a adjusting the relevant parameters by 30 the most extreme cases considered in this study led to substantial shifts in the climatic sequences adjusting the β parameter increased the rainfall distribution of the sequences to favor greater rainfall depths as well as increasing the overall mean rainfall fig 2b adjusting the wet season wet day persistence reduced the average rainfall over the relevant months as well as increasing the proportion of dry days fig 2c because correlations between variables were maintained adjusting the wet season wet day persistence also impacted the potential evaporation during some months it had negligible effect on the annual maximum rainfall series when both parameters were perturbed by 30 the average rainfall of the generated sequences between june and november was generally slightly less than the historical average rainfall but greater than the average rainfall when only wet season wet day persistence was perturbed fig 2d the two key rainfall statistics for which potential future changes are reported by commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 wet season rainfall and 5 aep rainfall cannot be directly perturbed in the climate generator but were altered through perturbations to the wet season wet day persistence and β parameters fig 3 the changes in wet season rainfall and 5 aep rainfall achieved using the climate generator encompass the range of potential changes projected by commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 the wet season rainfall is projected to decrease with some gcms projecting reductions greater than 30 for high emissions scenarios commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 correspondingly the largest decrease in average wet season daily rainfall produced in the climate sequences is 35 fig 3a from 4 1 mm to 2 7 mm the 5 aep daily rainfall could increase by up to 30 and the maximum increase achieved in the generated sequences is 30 fig 3b from 111 mm to 145 mm it can be seen that the 5 aep rainfall depth is mainly influenced by changes in the β parameter with some random noise in the results but the wet season daily rainfall is impacted by both parameters the overall shift towards drier conditions in winter and increased extreme rainfall is represented to varying degrees in the modelled scenarios 3 methodology we used the approach of bottom up climate change assessment to understand how much the climate would have to change for the results of an event based model to diverge significantly from the results of a continuous simulation model as discussed in section 2 2 we defined a set of scenarios with increasingly severe changes in climate statistics we then tested these scenarios in an event based model and a continuous model and compared the results 3 1 model development 3 1 1 continuous model gr4j the continuous model gr4j perrin et al 2003 was adopted to create runoff series that could be used to simulate the possible catchment response to changes in antecedent conditions a lumped conceptual model was selected over a more detailed distributed model because a large number of simulations were required to represent different future climate scenarios as well as natural variability within these scenarios the gr4j model was calibrated using 39 years of discharge observations from the associated hydrologic reference station 401203 with rainfall and pet observations as inputs section 2 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was maximized to 0 71 using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua method duan et al 1992 since this study focuses on floods the simulation results were checked against the observations for the largest modelled flow event each year the modelled flood peaks matched the observations with an average ratio of modelled to observed peak of 1 07 median 1 06 the flood volumes had an average ratio of modelled to observed volume of 1 11 median 0 94 the model performance is considered adequate for this study which focuses on performance divergence between different model types under change rather than absolute model performance under historical conditions a recursive digital filter with a filter parameter of 0 925 was used to estimate the baseflow component of the gr4j results nathan and mcmahon 1990 lyne and hollick 1979 this was subtracted to produce surface runoff series because the event based model considers surface runoff only note that the gr4j results discussed hereafter refer to the results with baseflow removed rather than the direct gr4j output because continuous models have different methods of accounting for stored moisture the analysis was also undertaken using the australian water balance model boughton 2004 the extent of divergence between event based and continuous model results under climate change was comparable for the two assessments so only the results obtained using gr4j are presented 3 1 2 event based model watershed boundary network model wbnm the event based model wbnm was used in this assessment because it is commonly used in industry and open source wbnm employs the initial continuing loss model which is common practice in australia ball et al 2016 wbnm transforms the excess rainfall hyetograph to a runoff hydrograph for each subcatchment by combining the continuity equation and the storage discharge relationship to give the following routing equation boyd et al 1996 3 i t q t d s d q d q d t k m q m 1 d q d t where i t is the inflow from excess rainfall m3 s q t is the outflow m3 s s is the volume stored on the surface m3 t is the time s k is a scaling parameter and m accounts for the nonlinearity of the subcatchment response this method of calculating the storage discharge relationship is similar across common hydrologic models used in australia in wbnm the lag time for each subcatchment is calculated based on the relationship derived by askew 1970 4 l a g c a 0 57 q 0 23 where c is the lag parameter and a is the subcatchment area km2 based on this equation the value for m in eq 3 is generally fixed at 0 77 in wbnm the value for m in common australian models ranges from 0 6 to 0 8 ball et al 2016 it is worth noting that model structures vary significantly between event based hydrologic models used in different parts of the world refh commonly used in the uk uses the unit hydrograph routing method kjeldsen 2007 which assumes a linear catchment response swmm commonly used in the usa converts excess rainfall depth into a volumetric flow rate using the manning equation which inherently assumes a higher rate of nonlinearity than wbnm the wbnm model for this study was developed based on available information characterizing the catchment section 2 1 subcatchments 63 were delineated in arcgis based on srtm digital elevation data at 1 arc second resolution obtained from https earthexplorer usgs gov to provide data on the subcatchment areas centroid locations and outlet locations based on inspection of aerial imagery the catchment consists of farmland and naturally vegetated areas so the impervious fraction was set to zero a standard lag parameter c of 1 7 was applied because the catchment has a large area 1550 km2 and a time of concentration of approximately five days a daily timestep was selected the time of concentration was estimated by applying a constant rainfall rate of 1 mm day in the wbnm model with no losses and identifying when a constant flow rate was achieved at the catchment outlet the assessment was undertaken for the 5 aep flood event because it is of common interest in engineering design and likely to be adequately represented in the 100 year climate sequences each rainfall event was assumed to begin either five days prior to the associated rainfall peak five days being the estimated time of concentration for the catchment or on the most recent dry day zero rainfall the wbnm model was calibrated against the continuous model results for the current climate scenario the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 averaged over the 100 current climate 5 aep events was used as the objective function this was found to better reflect model performance than the nse for single events because it was able to recognize good model performance in reproducing peaks and volumes even when the timing was offset the nse was found to be overly sensitive to timing as discussed in moussa 2010 and sometimes favoured zero flow results over delayed peaks the sce ua optimization method was applied to maximize the kge to 0 09 the poor average performance even when optimized reflects the high variability in individual simulations when a single set of rainfall losses was applied to 100 different events 3 2 model evaluation for each scenario we assessed the performance of the event based model which was calibrated to the current climate scenario relative to the continuous model that can dynamically account for changing catchment moisture storages we defined four performance measures to assess divergence in model results average ratio of wbnm storm volume to gr4j storm volume median ratio of wbnm storm volume to gr4j storm volume average ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow median ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow these ratios demonstrate the similarity of the wbnm results to the continuous model results in terms of flood statistics that are of interest in engineering design average and median values were calculated over 100 simulated storm events where a single storm event was extracted from each of the climate sequences generated for each scenario taking the average median performance over a number of simulations allowed for the detection of systematic changes in model performance that would be overwhelmed by random noise if single events were used 3 3 bottom up climate change assessment the bottom up climate change assessment for this study involved four key stages fig 4 the first stage fig 4 red involved calibration of the climate generator to observations followed by generation of current and future climate sequences section 2 2 the second stage fig 4 blue was continuous model development and application a gr4j model of the catchment was developed through calibration to discharge observations from the hydrologic reference station 401203 section 3 1 1 the generated climatic sequences for both current and future climate scenarios 256 scenarios in total with 100 sequences each were used as the inputs to the calibrated gr4j model and the baseflow was subtracted from the simulated flows this produced the continuous surface runoff results for each climatic sequence the 5 aep peak runoff was estimated from each time series based on cunnane s plotting position cunnane 1978 the rainfall and simulated surface runoff from gr4j associated with the 5 aep flood in each sequence were extracted for simulation in the wbnm model the third stage fig 4 green was calibration and application of the event based model the wbnm model was parameterized based on available information about the catchment section 3 1 2 the initial and continuing loss values were calibrated based on the continuous model results for 5 aep events extracted from sequences with unperturbed climatic statistics current climate the same losses were then applied to model future climate scenarios in the final stage fig 4 purple the wbnm runoff hydrographs were compared with those of the associated continous simulations to assess the relative model performance section 3 2 the changes in relative model performance for increasingly severe climate scenarios were demonstrated using a response surface for each performance measure these surfaces are commonly used in bottom up climate change assessment to indicate the sensitivity of a system or process to several hypothetical changes prudhomme et al 2010 the lower left corner of the surface represents a no change scenario and incremental changes in climatic variables are represented along the respective axes a colored grid is used to show the impacts of these changes on the system or process of interest in this case event based model performance relative to gr4j results the same process was undertaken with no perturbations in climate statistics i e whereby all scenarios have current climate statistics to understand the variability inherent in the methodology the results are indicative of the uncertainty that is a consequence of assuming a particular set of rainfall loss values for all 5 aep events in a catchment under stationary climatic conditions 4 results the two flood properties of most interest to practicing engineers and hydrologists are often flood volume for applications such as detention basin design and peak flow for applications such as bridge culvert design we focus on these two model outputs when interpreting the results of this assessment 4 1 baseline wbnm model assessment some variability in event based model performance is expected when simulating different floods with the same loss values this is because different storms will have different intensities durations and antecedent conditions to understand the extent of underlying variability between the wbnm and gr4j results under current climate conditions the methodology was applied to 256 sets of 100 sequences generated with unperturbed climatic statistics the losses in wbnm were calibrated based on one set of 100 5 aep events under current climatic conditions as described in section 3 1 2 giving an initial loss of 62 4 mm and a continuing loss of 2 47 mm h these losses were applied in all wbnm simulations the results give an indication of the variability in wbnm model performance relative to the gr4j results due to natural climate variability as opposed to systematic climate change fig 5 it is clear that the event based model performance is quite variable when a single set of loss parameters is used to simulate different events for example the average ratio of wbnm modelled flood volume to the gr4j flood volume for a set of 100 sequences represented by a single gridbox on the response surface varies from 0 72 to 1 24 fig 5a while the flood volumes are modelled with relatively little bias on average fig 5a the median flood volumes are generally smaller for wbnm fig 5b this indicates that there is an asymmetric spread in the performance of the models for each scenario the volume is significantly overestimated relatively for a small number of events which results in an average ratio higher than the median a similar pattern is observed for peak flow with median ratios smaller than average ratios however there is a tendency for wbnm to give larger peaks relatively with the average ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow being greater than 1 2 for all scenarios fig 5c the median ratios are generally close to one fig 5d the tendency towards median results that are lower than the average results is attributed to differences in model structure because wbnm accounts for nonlinearity in catchment response while gr4j is linear the larger individual rainfall events are likely to produce proportionately greater flows than simulated in gr4j these events will substantially increase the average wbnm to gr4j ratios but have less influence on the median because the wbnm model losses were calibrated by minimizing kge which is strongly influenced by storm volume the ratios for storm volume are centered approximately around one the peak flow values tend to be larger in wbnm than gr4j due to the catchment linearity assumption in gr4j overall there is a reasonably high degree of variability in the outcomes of all four performance measures fig 5 there is thus considerable potential for error associated with applying one set of losses to model different floods in a catchment even in a stationary climate some flows were substantially larger in wbnm than gr4j while in other cases effective rainfall was zero with no runoff simulated these results provide an estimate of the reference variability which will also be expected to occur in the climate change simulations 4 2 bottom up climate change assessment of wbnm performance in order to examine the wbnm model performance under climate change the parameters wet season wet day persistence and β were perturbed from 0 to 30 below and above the baseline values respectively in 2 increments giving a total of 256 different climate scenarios including current climate for each climate scenario the wbnm model performance was assessed by calculating the average ratio of wbnm flow volume to gr4j flow volume fig 6 a the median ratio of wbnm flow volume to gr4j flow volume fig 6b the average ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow fig 6c the median ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow fig 6d there are clear deviations in the wbnm results from the gr4j results under changing climatic conditions beyond the previously discussed underlying variability fig 5 decreasing the wet season wet day persistence means that the catchment will be drier on average prior to flood events it follows that the rainfall losses calibrated to the wetter current climate scenario are likely to be too small which could lead to the model overestimating the flood volume this is reflected in the average performance results which tend towards larger flood magnitude in wbnm than gr4j however for both peak and volume simulation the wet season dryness has less effect on the median model performance for which there is no discernible change decreasing the wet season wet day persistence thus leads to substantially larger estimates of flooding in wbnm for some of the floods but has minimal effect on others this highlights the uncertainty facing practicing engineers around how future climatic changes should be accounted for in event based modelling the results for the 16 scenarios representing incrementally increasing wet season dryness with no changes to the β parameter are shown in fig 7 the boxplots show the ratios of modelled volume and peak between wbnm and gr4j results a value close to one indicates good agreement it is clear that the spread of results for the 100 storms simulated for each scenario is increasing indicating that the variance in model performance is greater in the drier scenarios in some cases particular event magnitudes are much larger in wbnm with modelled volumes for example more than tenfold higher than the gr4j volumes this is associated with very dry antecedent conditions prior to specific events for example one event identified from the scenario with a 30 decrease in wet season wet day persistence was the result of a total rainfall depth of 250 mm the preceding weeks were almost entirely dry and the gr4j results gave only 14 mm runoff the wbnm model on the other hand modelled 139 mm runoff this highlights the substantial impact that antecedent conditions can have on model results in extreme cases there is more variability in the simulated antecedent conditions for scenarios with smaller wet season wet day persistence the results show that the soil moisture modelled in gr4j on the day preceding each peak rainfall event became more variable with decreasing wet season wet day persistence the standard deviation of the soil moisture store prior to the rainfall peak shows a clear relationship with the standard deviation of the model performance statistics which indicates that the increased variability in event based model performance is a consequence of the changing antecedent conditions fig 8 because the model performance divergence was driven by increased variability in antecedent conditions there is evidence that the continuous model which can account for this is able to better represent the drier scenarios it follows that the continuous model results can be used as a benchmark for investigating appropriate loss values under drier conditions in the event based model the initial loss parameter in wbnm was recalibrated for three drier climate scenarios 10 20 and 30 decrease in wet season wet day persistence to test for a systematic change in the calibrated value we found that the optimal initial loss did not increase consistently with climatic dryness but the optimized model performance degraded substantially for each increasingly dry scenario table 1 this indicates that the model results under future conditions cannot be improved by simply increasing the initial loss to account for drier antecedent conditions considering now the β parameter of the gamma distribution for the daily rainfall the general shift was towards wetter conditions as this parameter was increased figs 2 and 3 the total rainfall leading up to the modelled events averaged over 100 events per scenario therefore also increased fig 9 along with increases in the magnitude of 5 aep rainfall events however as β was increased consistently higher average and median ratios were found between the wbnm and gr4j peak flows and volumes fig 6 this was contrary to our expectations it was assumed that the calibrated losses would be too high for the wetter scenarios and the flood magnitude would then be smaller in wbnm relative to the gr4j results this indicates that the deviation of the wbnm results from the gr4j results is not caused by changing antecedent conditions based on these results representation of rainfall losses was clearly less important than other model structural differences the significance of this finding is that changing antecedent conditions will not always be the key source of future uncertainty in flood modelling therefore the common assumption that adopting continuous simulation will necessarily offer an advantage is not supported one plausible explanation for this result is that wbnm accounts for nonlinearity in the catchment response eq 3 whilst gr4j is a linear catchment model this means that increases in 5 aep rainfall depths will tend to lead to proportionately higher runoff in wbnm than in gr4j to check this hypothesis the bottom up climate change assessment was repeated assuming a linear catchment response in wbnm m 1 eq 3 the peak flow results showed negligible divergence along the x axis fig 10 which indicates that representation of nonlinearity in catchment response is the key cause of divergence between gr4j and wbnm in modelling future flood peaks the storm volume statistics still diverged as rainfall intensity increased particularly the median volume ratio fig 10b given that the volume ratios tend to increase as β increased a greater proportion of the additional rainfall is being lost i e not contributing to storm runoff in gr4j to understand the reasons for this the rainfall sinks in the two models were analyzed wbnm simply subtracts any additional rainfall up until initial continuing loss values are satisfied for the timestep with the remainder being converted to additional runoff for each scenario with increasing β the average event rainfall was compared with the average effective rainfall in wbnm linear m 1 to understand how much was absorbed through additional losses in the current climate case the average rainfall depth absorbed by losses was 131 mm over the 100 5 aep events this increased as β and hence overall rainfall depth increased up to 151 mm for a 30 increase in β therefore for the most intense extreme rainfall scenario 20 mm additional rainfall was lost on average as gr4j has a more complex model structure there are more potential mechanisms for the additional water to be lost firstly some of the additional rainfall is stored as additional soil moisture according to eq 3 in perrin et al 2003 p s x 1 1 s x 1 2 tanh p n x 1 1 s x 1 tanh p n x 1 where pn is the total rainfall mm ps is rainfall entering the soil store mm x1 is the soil store capacity calibrated to 1153 mm in this model and s is the depth in the soil store mm for each scenario with increasing β and no change in wet season wet day persistence the average total ps over the 100 5 aep events was calculated it was found that average ps increased by 10 mm for a 30 increase in β secondly gr4j considers transport of groundwater between catchments as a function of the level in the routing store according to equation 18 in perrin et al 2003 f x 2 r x 3 7 2 where f is the groundwater exchange term mm r is the level in the routing store mm x2 is the water exchange coefficient mm and x3 is the reference capacity of the routing store the depth of rainfall lost through groundwater exchange increased by 8 mm on average between the current climate simulations and those with 30 increase in β thirdly the amount separated from the flow series through the baseflow filter increased by 12 mm on average in total 30 mm additional rainfall was lost on average from gr4j for the scenario with β increased 30 while the wbnm simulations lost only 20 mm of additional rainfall on average this explains why the modelled volumes in wbnm tended to be proportionately higher than those in gr4j in summary the results demonstrate that relatively complex effects of model structure can become important when simulating floods under change and it may be necessary to undertake specific testing of different model structures at a study site to understand how they will perform under change the results for the 16 scenarios with incremental increases in the β parameter with no change in wet season wet day persistence are shown in fig 11 unlike the scenarios where wet season wet day persistence was perturbed the variance in model performance shows no clear trend this indicates that the variability in antecedent conditions was not strongly impacted by increasing the rainfall distribution although antecedent conditions became wetter on average therefore employing a continuous model that can dynamically account for antecedent conditions may not offer additional benefit beyond the advantage already offered under current climate conditions in reducing model uncertainty under future climate scenarios with increased rainfall distribution both the median and average ratios for flow and volume tend to increase as β increases as indicated in fig 6 5 discussion this study investigated divergence in event based model performance relative to continuous model performance under climate change due to alterations in catchment antecedent conditions the results demonstrated that drier climatic conditions led to increased variability in the performance of an event based model relative to continuous model outputs fig 7 this increased variability in performance was shown to correlate with increased variability in simulated antecedent conditions fig 8 the magnitude of performance divergence surpassed underlying variability and tended to increase for increasingly severe climatic change fig 6 this suggests that continuous simulation could offer an advantage under drier future scenarios but given that increases in extreme rainfall are also predicted for australia this is not sufficient to recommend a complete move away from event based modelling practicing hydrologists hoping to account for drier antecedent conditions in event based models may be interested in whether systematic changes in the ideal loss parameters could be identified the wbnm model was recalibrated against the gr4j results under increasingly dry climate conditions to investigate this however it was found that even if the loss values were recalibrated the event based model could not perform as well under drier conditions there was no consistent change in the calibrated initial loss value this indicates that the parameterization of event based models by adjusting design losses for climate change scenarios is not likely to be intuitive and region specific testing may be required based on local projections it is not recommended that initial loss values be increased under drier future conditions unless there is specific evidence to support this decision at the study site adjusting the rainfall distribution to represent greater rainfall depths was not found to alter variability in the performance of the event based model relative to the continuous model results fig 11 the performance measures were impacted substantially fig 6 but this was not consistent with and therefore not dominated by changing antecedent conditions rather other differences in model structure were found to be more important when extreme rainfall was increased because the continuous model assumes linearity in catchment response but the event based model accounts for nonlinearity the same increase in rainfall tended to give a greater increase in peak flow in the event based model the effect on the performance measures was more significant than that of changing antecedent conditions which would be expected to lead to smaller peak flow values in the event based model it is unclear whether the assumptions around catchment nonlinearity in either model are optimal for simulating future floods since the degree of nonlinearity is uncertain and varies between catchments however it is widely recognized that catchments do exhibit some nonlinearity so the inflexible assumption of linear catchment response is a clear weakness in gr4j for simulation under changing conditions it is possible that catchment nonlinearity could change in the future since hydrologic changes can impact catchment geomorphology nanson et al 1995 lotsari et al 2015 if the degree of nonlinearity in a given catchment s response is sensitive to changes in climate models that allow the user to define a nonlinearity parameter such as wbnm may offer advantages over those in which catchment nonlinearity is fixed as in gr4j or implicit as in swmm investigating future changes in catchment nonlinearity is outside the scope of this study since it would require detailed hydraulic modelling and testing of many scenarios but this would be an interesting topic for future research performance divergence in simulated flood volumes was found to relate to differences in how rainfall is lost i e not converted to runoff in the models in wbnm increased continuing losses meant that the total modelled losses were larger under the increased extreme rainfall scenarios in gr4j there are three mechanisms that increase total rainfall lost 1 more rainfall lost to the soil moisture store 2 more water removed through the baseflow transfer function and 3 more flow separated from the model outputs as baseflow in combination these three mechanisms gave a relatively larger impact on storm volume in gr4j than the additional continuing losses in wbnm meaning that the gr4j flood volumes were smaller overall while gr4j has a more complex structure it is not clear that this offers a more realistic representation therefore it is not possible to say which model might simulate future storm volumes more accurately when extreme rainfall is increased the findings of this study contrast with previous work that recommends the use of continuous simulation for climate change scenarios in order to account for changing antecedent conditions johnson et al 2016 we find that future model performance may be more dependent on other modelling assumptions in some cases therefore practicing hydrologists should carefully consider the specific projections for the study area along with model structural features when selecting a flood model for climate change assessment the common assumption that continuous simulation will necessarily offer an advantage under changing conditions is not supported for cases where drier average conditions and increased extreme rainfall are projected this analysis suggests continuous models that account for catchment nonlinearity may improve future flood prediction it is worth noting that other catchment variables besides extreme rainfall intensity and antecedent conditions are also expected to be affected by climate change these include changes in vegetation due to alterations in temperature carbon dioxide concentrations and rainfall as well as changes in plant water use efficiency due to increased carbon dioxide concentrations liu et al 2016 li and ishidaira 2012 as mentioned above catchment geomorphology could also be impacted by changing hydrologic regimes processes like these are not simulated in common event based or continuous hydrologic models therefore both event based and continuous model performance may be subject to parameter nonstationarity that is not captured in the comparisons here the impact of these environmental changes on continuous model performance in particular has been the subject of several previous studies westra et al 2014 vaze et al 2010 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2014 coron et al 2012 brigode et al 2013 thirel et al 2015 fowler et al 2016 this study was able to compare model performance under change and deduce key potential sources of relative error but does not aim to prove that either model is able to provide an optimal representation of future flow to better understand how catchment response could be affected by future ecological changes it may be useful to test climate change scenarios in more complex ecohydrologic models that are able to simulate vegetation dynamically ultimately all models are subject to some limitations in their representation of catchment dynamics so it will also be important to utilize available observations of catchments under change to improve process understanding going forward based on the results of this study practitioners using event based models to simulate future flows should consider two sources of uncertainty relating to losses firstly there is uncertainty inherent in the assumption that losses calibrated to past events will apply to a separate future event under consistent climatic conditions demonstrated by the variability in results shown in fig 5 applying the calibrated losses gave zero flow for some current climate events and very large flows compared to the continuous model results for others this uncertainty is well recognized in the hydrology community tramblay et al 2010 berthet et al 2009 pathiraja et al 2012 and can be incorporated in modelling studies by applying ensembles of possible loss values constrained by a probability distribution loveridge and rahman 2014 to understand runoff sensitivity secondly there is uncertainty associated with future hydrologic changes that could impact antecedent conditions and typical catchment response fig 6 this is generally not considered in flood modelling and design but we find that applying future climate scenarios substantially increases model uncertainty and alters the relative performance of different types of models fig 6 here we have demonstrated the issue using a deterministic initial continuing loss approach but the same principle would likely apply to ensembles that are constrained based on past observations this would be a useful area of future research the effect of climate change on an event based model that uses initial continuing losses as per standard industry practice in australia ball et al 2016 has been tested here the results for drier climatic scenarios are likely to be analogous for any model in which losses are parameterized based on knowledge of past catchment behavior including swmm and refh kjeldsen 2007 however the equations translating excess rainfall to runoff differ this work has shown that assumptions around the representation of the catchment response could change the sensitivity of these models to scaling rainfall to account for climate change because refh assumes linear catchment response and swmm which applies the manning relationship implicitly assumes a higher rate of nonlinearity than the default in wbnm it is likely that for equivalent climatic changes refh would lead to smaller increases in flood risk than wbnm with swmm leading to the largest increases in flood risk the implications of structural differences in common event based models for studies that involve rainfall scaling without recalibration should be investigated through further research 6 conclusion projected future changes in climate have been shown to impact the relative performance of event based and continuous hydrologic models in simulating flooding drier climatic conditions and increased rainfall distribution were simulated based on gcm projections for southern australia for the drier climate scenarios there was a tendency for the event based model to give increasingly greater estimates of future flood magnitude for some individual events this occurred because drier antecedent conditions meant that the losses calibrated to the current climate were too small however because the antecedent conditions prior to one particular flood event will not necessarily change when the overall climate becomes drier the results were not affected in every case increasing variability in antecedent conditions under drier future scenarios was shown to correlate with variability in event based model performance this indicates that the uncertainty in event based model results increases when attempting to simulate a drier future climate and supports the notion of using continuous simulation to dynamically account for catchment moisture when the rainfall distribution was perturbed to favor greater rainfall intensities the event based model also showed a tendency to simulate larger floods than the continuous model in this case the results were more consistent between different individual events and variability in performance did not increase the changes were not consistent with the alterations in antecedent conditions which would lead one to expect smaller floods in the event based model and were instead attributed to differences in model structure because the event based model accounts for nonlinearity in catchment response but the continuous model is linear increased rainfall tended to translate to greater peak flow increases in the event based model representation of moisture storage in the catchment also contributed to performance divergence for flood volume this is in contrast with the assumption that changing antecedent conditions represents the key source of uncertainty in event based modelling of future floods based on this assessment engineers and hydrologists should be aware of the potential for event based model performance changes in a changing climate in some cases the variability in model performance may be impacted by alterations in antecedent conditions as in the case of the drier climate scenarios tested here however other assumptions inherent in the model structure will sometimes be more important overall the results of this study do not support a blanket shift towards the use of continuous simulation for future flood assessments in a changing

782,event based hydrologic models are frequently used for flood design and assessment these models generally require the specification of loss values that should relate to antecedent conditions in the catchment the loss values are key calibration parameters usually defined by matching model output with recorded or derived streamflow information it is now widely recognized that climate change will impact the hydrologic cycle and affect catchment conditions therefore loss values calibrated using historical observations may not be appropriate for simulating future flooding we use the method of bottom up climate change assessment to understand the potential for future performance changes in a calibrated event based model due to changing antecedent conditions this is achieved by comparing the results against those of a continuous hydrologic model that accounts for differences in antecedent catchment storages we find that event based model performance diverges substantially from the continuous model results under the climate change scenarios which account for increased dryness and greater extreme rainfall intensities the results indicate that there is greater uncertainty in event based model results when simulating drier climatic states attributed to greater variability in antecedent conditions however when simulating increased extreme rainfall intensity giving rise to larger rainfall events and generally wetter antecedent conditions the impact of changing antecedent conditions was less important than the models representations of catchment nonlinearity this suggests that changing antecedent conditions are not always the key source of potential model performance degradation therefore applying continuous simulation will not necessarily offer an advantage in characterizing future floods this study highlights the uncertainty facing practicing engineers and hydrologists wanting to account for climate change in flood modelling and design large scale changes in engineering practice may be required to ensure that the robustness of flood modelling is maintained in a changing climate 1 introduction event based models are commonly used by practicing engineers and hydrologists to simulate historical and design flood events these models consider a single rainfall event in isolation as opposed to continuous models that simulate flow over a longer period while continuous models are more commonly used in research event based models are widely applied in flood management around the world and represent traditional practice in most countries ball et al 2016 recent studies using or developing event based models have been undertaken in australia charalambous et al 2013 gamage et al 2015 france tramblay et al 2010 berthet et al 2009 italy camici et al 2011 china kan et al 2015 huang et al 2016 iran nourali et al 2016 and japan wang et al 2007 the application of event based models for engineering design is recommended by various guidelines including the usda national engineering handbook hydrology chapters chapter 17 flood routing united states department of agriculture 2014 australian rainfall and runoff a guide to flood estimation ball et al 2016 and the uk flood estimation handbook centre for ecology and hydrology 1999 event based models are simple to use but they are limited in their ability to represent the dynamic nature of catchments because they assume simple rainfall loss models that cannot be expected to capture temporal variation in catchment wetness the moisture stored in a catchment prior to a rainfall event herein referred to as antecedent conditions can have a significant impact on the streamflow experienced at the catchment outlet hino et al 1988 mein and larson 1973 karnieli and ben asher 1993 event based model simulations require the specification of appropriate rainfall loss values to convert total rainfall to excess rainfall while maintaining the intended annual exceedance probability aep for the event often referred to as aep neutral losses where streamflow observations are available it is common practice to calibrate the loss parameters in event based models the calibration of loss values allows for deficiencies in the model s process representation to be compensated so the calibrated values are not necessarily physically representative of the actual rainfall lost to the soil however the losses for dry antecedent conditions will still be relatively larger than the losses for wet antecedent conditions if all else remains equal various hydrologic models used to estimate flood discharges have different approaches to accounting for rainfall losses in australia for catchments where runoff generation is controlled by infiltration excess mechanisms as opposed to saturation excess mechanisms johnson et al 2016 it is common to apply the initial continuing loss method this method requires the specification of an initial loss at the start of a rainfall event followed by a constant loss rate for the remainder of the event the united states department of agriculture soil conservation service usda scs curve number method widely applied in the us uses information on soil type land use and antecedent moisture level dry medium or wet to determine rainfall losses united states department of agriculture soil conservation service 1985 this is one of the infiltration methods available in the storm water management model swmm other available methods in swmm include the green ampt method which requires specification of the initial moisture deficit in the soil and horton s method which requires specification of an initial maximum rate of loss rossman 2015 the uk flood estimation handbook recommends calculating initial and maximum soil moisture for design events using two parameters the base flow index determined based on soil type and the proportion of time the catchment was wet between 1961 and 1990 determined by the uk met office through nationwide continuous modelling of soil moisture kjeldsen 2007 the calculated soil moisture values are then applied in the loss model which is based on the probability distributed model moore 1985 each of these methods inherently assumes that optimized rainfall losses will not be different for future flood events as opposed to past flood events because they do not account for systematic changes in antecedent moisture characteristics herein referred to as nonstationarity in antecedent conditions we use the definition of westra et al 2014 and define the term nonstationarity as the tendency of model parameters to vary over time meaning that their selection is dependent on the calibration period it follows that models subject to parameter nonstationarity may experience degradation in prediction performance for a climatic scenario that is different from the calibration period it is anticipated that future climate change will have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle intergovernmental panel on climate change 2013 the implication for event based models is two fold firstly the rainfall intensities associated with particular aeps are likely to change wasko and sharma 2015 min et al 2011 this can be taken into account by factoring the design rainfall for a given aep based on projections for the study area for example in australia and new zealand rainfall depths are typically scaled up based on future temperature projections relevant to the design life of the project ball et al 2016 ministry for the environment 2010 the second implication of climate change for event based models is that flood influencing catchment processes could be impacted johnson et al 2016 antecedent moisture characteristics in catchments will be impacted by future changes in rainfall and potential evaporation with trends in soil moisture already being observed makra et al 2005 destouni and verrot 2014 and predicted holsten et al 2009 it follows that loss values calibrated based on historical flood events may not be representative of future losses if these loss values are applied for climate change assessments or future infrastructure design flood risk could be estimated incorrectly in response to this problem some researchers have suggested moving towards continuous simulation for flood assessment johnson et al 2016 because continuous models can dynamically estimate water storage in a catchment this gives them the ability to account for the actual conditions in a catchment preceding a particular rainfall event which has been shown to be important for accurately simulating floods under current conditions pathiraja et al 2012 wasko et al 2015 however at this stage no direct comparison of the two modelling methods under climate change has been undertaken in this study we use the method of bottom up climate change assessment prudhomme et al 2010 to examine the implications of potential nonstationarity in rainfall losses for event based models climate change assessments are usually undertaken using a top down approach where climate projections derived from general circulation models gcm are applied in catchment scale models generally through bias correction and downscaling procedures a significant challenge for top down climate change assessments is the uncertainty surrounding future climate assumptions around emissions and the associated response of the environment as well as implicit simplifications and limitations in climate models lead to difficulty in discretely defining future climatic regimes for impact assessment wilby and dessai 2010 brown and wilby 2012 there is reason to believe that current models may not reflect the full range of uncertainty due to issues such as model similarity steinschneider et al 2015 in particular mote et al 2011 noted that no climate model in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 represented a low likelihood high sensitivity response to future emissions to overcome these limitations prudhomme wilby prudhomme et al 2010 introduced bottom up climate change assessment also referred to as scenario neutral climate change assessment a technique for testing sensitivity to climate change scenarios they investigated the possibility of climate change increasing flood risk in the uk by more than 20 the allowance recommended in british design guidelines the increases in flood risk for a range of feasible climatic changes were modelled to demonstrate how much the climate would need to change to increase flood risk by more than 20 they related this to available projections to assess the risk that this magnitude of change could occur based on current understanding information of this nature is more useful for many decision makers than the results of top down assessments which only indicate increases in flood risk for a discrete set of future projections with high uncertainty other recent examples of bottom up climate change assessment include studies by brown et al 2012 culley et al 2016 kay et al 2014 and poff et al 2016 we aim to demonstrate that this method of systematically testing the response of a system to increasingly severe climate change scenarios can also be applied to stress test hydrologic models under change by using bottom up climate change assessment to assess performance divergence between event based and continuous models under changing climatic conditions we can understand whether changing antecedent conditions is the most important factor impacting relative model performance as is commonly assumed johnson et al 2016 this can provide evidence to fill an existing research gap whether future flood predictions will be more robust if the current generation of continuous models are adopted in place of commonly used event based models calibrated on past observations in this study we evaluate the impact of feasible changes in climate on event based model performance relative to continuous model results we apply bottom up climate change assessment to test the performance divergence between an event based model and a continuous model under increasingly severe climate change scenarios we find that while changing antecedent conditions do have an impact on model performance there are other model structural differences that also need to be considered when selecting or developing a model for climate change assessment 2 data 2 1 observations the models used in this study were developed based on the catchment draining to the hydrologic reference station mitta mitta at hinnomunjie station number 401203 in victoria australia herein referred to as the catchment this catchment falls within a key water generating area for the murray darling basin donohue et al 2011 an important agricultural region for australia its area is approximately 1546 km2 fig 1 and its elevation ranges from 545 to 1860 mahd the catchment is unregulated with farmland in the lower reaches and forested areas in the upper reaches the average annual precipitation is approximately 1260 mm over the study period and the average annual runoff is approximately 250 mm daily rainfall data for this catchment was extracted from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation s csiro australian water availability project daily rainfall grids at 0 05 resolution a weighted average was applied based on grid cell area within the catchment to estimate representative daily rainfall the closest pan evaporation station with an adequate length of record is located at dartmouth reservoir station number 082076 about 30 km north of the catchment this pan has records available from 1975 to present daily pan evaporation data was provided by the bureau of meteorology bom gaps in the pan evaporation series were infilled with monthly averages and a pan coefficient of 0 75 was applied doorenbos and pruitt 1977 while temperature data was not required as an input to the hydrologic models it was used to inform climatic correlations in the climate generator section 2 2 two neighbouring stations station numbers 083025 and 083090 located about 250 m apart are situated within the catchment daily maximum temperature data was obtained from the bureau of meteorology for these two stations the record for station 083025 begins in 1957 and ends in 2009 while station 83090 has a record beginning in 2004 the datasets during the overlapping period were compared and found to have a high correlation r 0 998 with only 6 of daily measurements differing by more than 1 c data from 083025 was applied for years preceding 2005 with data from 083090 used to complete the record 2 2 climate scenarios the future climate scenarios used in this assessment were informed by the csiro and bom climate change assessments for australia commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 because the catchment is located in southern australia projections from this region were applied two of the relevant projections for future rainfall are summarized as a decrease in wet season winter spring rainfall with reductions of about 18 projected for june through november by 2090 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 some gcms project reductions greater than 30 an increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall with 5 annual exceedance probability aep rainfall over one day expected to increase by around 25 by 2090 under rcp 8 5 with the 90th percentile at 30 it is important to note that rainfall projections derived from gcms are uncertain and vary between studies commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 a key benefit of bottom up climate change assessment is that a wide range of potential future changes can be included in the investigation and the sensitivity of model performance can be explored to identify any particular weaknesses the climate generator described by srikanthan and zhou 2003 was used to generate climate data representing future scenarios this tool uses recorded climate data at a site to calibrate parameters describing the observed sequences and cross correlations between variables it then generates new replicates with equivalent climatic statistics and cross correlations maintaining the cross correlations provides an important advantage because the climatic sequences vary in a consistent physically realistic way for example the potential evaporation will typically be higher on a hot day the climate generator considers rainfall as the primary variable rainfall time series are stochastically generated using a two step process first a series of wet dry days is simulated using a first order markov chain the probability of a wet day can be expressed as siriwardena et al 2002 1 π p w d 1 p w d p w w where pw d is the likelihood of a dry day being followed by a wet day and pw w is the likelihood of a wet day being followed by another wet day herein referred to as the wet day persistence the rainfall depth for a given wet day is sampled from a gamma distribution with the following probability density function siriwardena et al 2002 2 f x x β α 1 exp x β β γ α where α is the shape parameter and β is the scale parameter of the gamma distribution γ climate series for additional variables are generated as described in srikanthan and zhou 2003 the generator was modified so that the calibrated parameters describing the historical climatic series could be perturbed producing future climate replicates that maintain the observed correlations between variables for this assessment two parameters were adjusted to represent the range of potential future climatic conditions projected for southern australia the wet day persistence eq 1 between june and november herein referred to as the wet season wet day persistence was decreased in 2 increments to a maximum of 30 below its baseline value this produced climate sequences that were drier overall in winter and spring without decreasing the likelihood of high intensity rainfall as would be the case if a decrease in the average rainfall was modelled this is consistent with projections in commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 the distribution of rainfall was adjusted to increase simulated rainfall depths based on the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 projections for extreme events this was achieved by increasing the β parameter eq 2 in 2 increments to a maximum of 30 above its baseline value simulating the full range of parameter perturbations for each of the two variables in every possible combination gave a total of 256 scenarios for each scenario 100 climatic sequences each 100 years in length were generated to provide a range of possible climate realisations that represent the specified conditions for that scenario the chosen length and number of time series aimed to represent the potential climatic variability without becoming computationally burdensome the climate generator represented the existing climatic conditions herein referred to as the current climate scenario well for most statistics with a slightly high bias for the annual maximum rainfalls fig 2 a adjusting the relevant parameters by 30 the most extreme cases considered in this study led to substantial shifts in the climatic sequences adjusting the β parameter increased the rainfall distribution of the sequences to favor greater rainfall depths as well as increasing the overall mean rainfall fig 2b adjusting the wet season wet day persistence reduced the average rainfall over the relevant months as well as increasing the proportion of dry days fig 2c because correlations between variables were maintained adjusting the wet season wet day persistence also impacted the potential evaporation during some months it had negligible effect on the annual maximum rainfall series when both parameters were perturbed by 30 the average rainfall of the generated sequences between june and november was generally slightly less than the historical average rainfall but greater than the average rainfall when only wet season wet day persistence was perturbed fig 2d the two key rainfall statistics for which potential future changes are reported by commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 wet season rainfall and 5 aep rainfall cannot be directly perturbed in the climate generator but were altered through perturbations to the wet season wet day persistence and β parameters fig 3 the changes in wet season rainfall and 5 aep rainfall achieved using the climate generator encompass the range of potential changes projected by commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 the wet season rainfall is projected to decrease with some gcms projecting reductions greater than 30 for high emissions scenarios commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation bureau of meteorology 2015 correspondingly the largest decrease in average wet season daily rainfall produced in the climate sequences is 35 fig 3a from 4 1 mm to 2 7 mm the 5 aep daily rainfall could increase by up to 30 and the maximum increase achieved in the generated sequences is 30 fig 3b from 111 mm to 145 mm it can be seen that the 5 aep rainfall depth is mainly influenced by changes in the β parameter with some random noise in the results but the wet season daily rainfall is impacted by both parameters the overall shift towards drier conditions in winter and increased extreme rainfall is represented to varying degrees in the modelled scenarios 3 methodology we used the approach of bottom up climate change assessment to understand how much the climate would have to change for the results of an event based model to diverge significantly from the results of a continuous simulation model as discussed in section 2 2 we defined a set of scenarios with increasingly severe changes in climate statistics we then tested these scenarios in an event based model and a continuous model and compared the results 3 1 model development 3 1 1 continuous model gr4j the continuous model gr4j perrin et al 2003 was adopted to create runoff series that could be used to simulate the possible catchment response to changes in antecedent conditions a lumped conceptual model was selected over a more detailed distributed model because a large number of simulations were required to represent different future climate scenarios as well as natural variability within these scenarios the gr4j model was calibrated using 39 years of discharge observations from the associated hydrologic reference station 401203 with rainfall and pet observations as inputs section 2 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was maximized to 0 71 using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua method duan et al 1992 since this study focuses on floods the simulation results were checked against the observations for the largest modelled flow event each year the modelled flood peaks matched the observations with an average ratio of modelled to observed peak of 1 07 median 1 06 the flood volumes had an average ratio of modelled to observed volume of 1 11 median 0 94 the model performance is considered adequate for this study which focuses on performance divergence between different model types under change rather than absolute model performance under historical conditions a recursive digital filter with a filter parameter of 0 925 was used to estimate the baseflow component of the gr4j results nathan and mcmahon 1990 lyne and hollick 1979 this was subtracted to produce surface runoff series because the event based model considers surface runoff only note that the gr4j results discussed hereafter refer to the results with baseflow removed rather than the direct gr4j output because continuous models have different methods of accounting for stored moisture the analysis was also undertaken using the australian water balance model boughton 2004 the extent of divergence between event based and continuous model results under climate change was comparable for the two assessments so only the results obtained using gr4j are presented 3 1 2 event based model watershed boundary network model wbnm the event based model wbnm was used in this assessment because it is commonly used in industry and open source wbnm employs the initial continuing loss model which is common practice in australia ball et al 2016 wbnm transforms the excess rainfall hyetograph to a runoff hydrograph for each subcatchment by combining the continuity equation and the storage discharge relationship to give the following routing equation boyd et al 1996 3 i t q t d s d q d q d t k m q m 1 d q d t where i t is the inflow from excess rainfall m3 s q t is the outflow m3 s s is the volume stored on the surface m3 t is the time s k is a scaling parameter and m accounts for the nonlinearity of the subcatchment response this method of calculating the storage discharge relationship is similar across common hydrologic models used in australia in wbnm the lag time for each subcatchment is calculated based on the relationship derived by askew 1970 4 l a g c a 0 57 q 0 23 where c is the lag parameter and a is the subcatchment area km2 based on this equation the value for m in eq 3 is generally fixed at 0 77 in wbnm the value for m in common australian models ranges from 0 6 to 0 8 ball et al 2016 it is worth noting that model structures vary significantly between event based hydrologic models used in different parts of the world refh commonly used in the uk uses the unit hydrograph routing method kjeldsen 2007 which assumes a linear catchment response swmm commonly used in the usa converts excess rainfall depth into a volumetric flow rate using the manning equation which inherently assumes a higher rate of nonlinearity than wbnm the wbnm model for this study was developed based on available information characterizing the catchment section 2 1 subcatchments 63 were delineated in arcgis based on srtm digital elevation data at 1 arc second resolution obtained from https earthexplorer usgs gov to provide data on the subcatchment areas centroid locations and outlet locations based on inspection of aerial imagery the catchment consists of farmland and naturally vegetated areas so the impervious fraction was set to zero a standard lag parameter c of 1 7 was applied because the catchment has a large area 1550 km2 and a time of concentration of approximately five days a daily timestep was selected the time of concentration was estimated by applying a constant rainfall rate of 1 mm day in the wbnm model with no losses and identifying when a constant flow rate was achieved at the catchment outlet the assessment was undertaken for the 5 aep flood event because it is of common interest in engineering design and likely to be adequately represented in the 100 year climate sequences each rainfall event was assumed to begin either five days prior to the associated rainfall peak five days being the estimated time of concentration for the catchment or on the most recent dry day zero rainfall the wbnm model was calibrated against the continuous model results for the current climate scenario the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 averaged over the 100 current climate 5 aep events was used as the objective function this was found to better reflect model performance than the nse for single events because it was able to recognize good model performance in reproducing peaks and volumes even when the timing was offset the nse was found to be overly sensitive to timing as discussed in moussa 2010 and sometimes favoured zero flow results over delayed peaks the sce ua optimization method was applied to maximize the kge to 0 09 the poor average performance even when optimized reflects the high variability in individual simulations when a single set of rainfall losses was applied to 100 different events 3 2 model evaluation for each scenario we assessed the performance of the event based model which was calibrated to the current climate scenario relative to the continuous model that can dynamically account for changing catchment moisture storages we defined four performance measures to assess divergence in model results average ratio of wbnm storm volume to gr4j storm volume median ratio of wbnm storm volume to gr4j storm volume average ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow median ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow these ratios demonstrate the similarity of the wbnm results to the continuous model results in terms of flood statistics that are of interest in engineering design average and median values were calculated over 100 simulated storm events where a single storm event was extracted from each of the climate sequences generated for each scenario taking the average median performance over a number of simulations allowed for the detection of systematic changes in model performance that would be overwhelmed by random noise if single events were used 3 3 bottom up climate change assessment the bottom up climate change assessment for this study involved four key stages fig 4 the first stage fig 4 red involved calibration of the climate generator to observations followed by generation of current and future climate sequences section 2 2 the second stage fig 4 blue was continuous model development and application a gr4j model of the catchment was developed through calibration to discharge observations from the hydrologic reference station 401203 section 3 1 1 the generated climatic sequences for both current and future climate scenarios 256 scenarios in total with 100 sequences each were used as the inputs to the calibrated gr4j model and the baseflow was subtracted from the simulated flows this produced the continuous surface runoff results for each climatic sequence the 5 aep peak runoff was estimated from each time series based on cunnane s plotting position cunnane 1978 the rainfall and simulated surface runoff from gr4j associated with the 5 aep flood in each sequence were extracted for simulation in the wbnm model the third stage fig 4 green was calibration and application of the event based model the wbnm model was parameterized based on available information about the catchment section 3 1 2 the initial and continuing loss values were calibrated based on the continuous model results for 5 aep events extracted from sequences with unperturbed climatic statistics current climate the same losses were then applied to model future climate scenarios in the final stage fig 4 purple the wbnm runoff hydrographs were compared with those of the associated continous simulations to assess the relative model performance section 3 2 the changes in relative model performance for increasingly severe climate scenarios were demonstrated using a response surface for each performance measure these surfaces are commonly used in bottom up climate change assessment to indicate the sensitivity of a system or process to several hypothetical changes prudhomme et al 2010 the lower left corner of the surface represents a no change scenario and incremental changes in climatic variables are represented along the respective axes a colored grid is used to show the impacts of these changes on the system or process of interest in this case event based model performance relative to gr4j results the same process was undertaken with no perturbations in climate statistics i e whereby all scenarios have current climate statistics to understand the variability inherent in the methodology the results are indicative of the uncertainty that is a consequence of assuming a particular set of rainfall loss values for all 5 aep events in a catchment under stationary climatic conditions 4 results the two flood properties of most interest to practicing engineers and hydrologists are often flood volume for applications such as detention basin design and peak flow for applications such as bridge culvert design we focus on these two model outputs when interpreting the results of this assessment 4 1 baseline wbnm model assessment some variability in event based model performance is expected when simulating different floods with the same loss values this is because different storms will have different intensities durations and antecedent conditions to understand the extent of underlying variability between the wbnm and gr4j results under current climate conditions the methodology was applied to 256 sets of 100 sequences generated with unperturbed climatic statistics the losses in wbnm were calibrated based on one set of 100 5 aep events under current climatic conditions as described in section 3 1 2 giving an initial loss of 62 4 mm and a continuing loss of 2 47 mm h these losses were applied in all wbnm simulations the results give an indication of the variability in wbnm model performance relative to the gr4j results due to natural climate variability as opposed to systematic climate change fig 5 it is clear that the event based model performance is quite variable when a single set of loss parameters is used to simulate different events for example the average ratio of wbnm modelled flood volume to the gr4j flood volume for a set of 100 sequences represented by a single gridbox on the response surface varies from 0 72 to 1 24 fig 5a while the flood volumes are modelled with relatively little bias on average fig 5a the median flood volumes are generally smaller for wbnm fig 5b this indicates that there is an asymmetric spread in the performance of the models for each scenario the volume is significantly overestimated relatively for a small number of events which results in an average ratio higher than the median a similar pattern is observed for peak flow with median ratios smaller than average ratios however there is a tendency for wbnm to give larger peaks relatively with the average ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow being greater than 1 2 for all scenarios fig 5c the median ratios are generally close to one fig 5d the tendency towards median results that are lower than the average results is attributed to differences in model structure because wbnm accounts for nonlinearity in catchment response while gr4j is linear the larger individual rainfall events are likely to produce proportionately greater flows than simulated in gr4j these events will substantially increase the average wbnm to gr4j ratios but have less influence on the median because the wbnm model losses were calibrated by minimizing kge which is strongly influenced by storm volume the ratios for storm volume are centered approximately around one the peak flow values tend to be larger in wbnm than gr4j due to the catchment linearity assumption in gr4j overall there is a reasonably high degree of variability in the outcomes of all four performance measures fig 5 there is thus considerable potential for error associated with applying one set of losses to model different floods in a catchment even in a stationary climate some flows were substantially larger in wbnm than gr4j while in other cases effective rainfall was zero with no runoff simulated these results provide an estimate of the reference variability which will also be expected to occur in the climate change simulations 4 2 bottom up climate change assessment of wbnm performance in order to examine the wbnm model performance under climate change the parameters wet season wet day persistence and β were perturbed from 0 to 30 below and above the baseline values respectively in 2 increments giving a total of 256 different climate scenarios including current climate for each climate scenario the wbnm model performance was assessed by calculating the average ratio of wbnm flow volume to gr4j flow volume fig 6 a the median ratio of wbnm flow volume to gr4j flow volume fig 6b the average ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow fig 6c the median ratio of wbnm peak flow to gr4j peak flow fig 6d there are clear deviations in the wbnm results from the gr4j results under changing climatic conditions beyond the previously discussed underlying variability fig 5 decreasing the wet season wet day persistence means that the catchment will be drier on average prior to flood events it follows that the rainfall losses calibrated to the wetter current climate scenario are likely to be too small which could lead to the model overestimating the flood volume this is reflected in the average performance results which tend towards larger flood magnitude in wbnm than gr4j however for both peak and volume simulation the wet season dryness has less effect on the median model performance for which there is no discernible change decreasing the wet season wet day persistence thus leads to substantially larger estimates of flooding in wbnm for some of the floods but has minimal effect on others this highlights the uncertainty facing practicing engineers around how future climatic changes should be accounted for in event based modelling the results for the 16 scenarios representing incrementally increasing wet season dryness with no changes to the β parameter are shown in fig 7 the boxplots show the ratios of modelled volume and peak between wbnm and gr4j results a value close to one indicates good agreement it is clear that the spread of results for the 100 storms simulated for each scenario is increasing indicating that the variance in model performance is greater in the drier scenarios in some cases particular event magnitudes are much larger in wbnm with modelled volumes for example more than tenfold higher than the gr4j volumes this is associated with very dry antecedent conditions prior to specific events for example one event identified from the scenario with a 30 decrease in wet season wet day persistence was the result of a total rainfall depth of 250 mm the preceding weeks were almost entirely dry and the gr4j results gave only 14 mm runoff the wbnm model on the other hand modelled 139 mm runoff this highlights the substantial impact that antecedent conditions can have on model results in extreme cases there is more variability in the simulated antecedent conditions for scenarios with smaller wet season wet day persistence the results show that the soil moisture modelled in gr4j on the day preceding each peak rainfall event became more variable with decreasing wet season wet day persistence the standard deviation of the soil moisture store prior to the rainfall peak shows a clear relationship with the standard deviation of the model performance statistics which indicates that the increased variability in event based model performance is a consequence of the changing antecedent conditions fig 8 because the model performance divergence was driven by increased variability in antecedent conditions there is evidence that the continuous model which can account for this is able to better represent the drier scenarios it follows that the continuous model results can be used as a benchmark for investigating appropriate loss values under drier conditions in the event based model the initial loss parameter in wbnm was recalibrated for three drier climate scenarios 10 20 and 30 decrease in wet season wet day persistence to test for a systematic change in the calibrated value we found that the optimal initial loss did not increase consistently with climatic dryness but the optimized model performance degraded substantially for each increasingly dry scenario table 1 this indicates that the model results under future conditions cannot be improved by simply increasing the initial loss to account for drier antecedent conditions considering now the β parameter of the gamma distribution for the daily rainfall the general shift was towards wetter conditions as this parameter was increased figs 2 and 3 the total rainfall leading up to the modelled events averaged over 100 events per scenario therefore also increased fig 9 along with increases in the magnitude of 5 aep rainfall events however as β was increased consistently higher average and median ratios were found between the wbnm and gr4j peak flows and volumes fig 6 this was contrary to our expectations it was assumed that the calibrated losses would be too high for the wetter scenarios and the flood magnitude would then be smaller in wbnm relative to the gr4j results this indicates that the deviation of the wbnm results from the gr4j results is not caused by changing antecedent conditions based on these results representation of rainfall losses was clearly less important than other model structural differences the significance of this finding is that changing antecedent conditions will not always be the key source of future uncertainty in flood modelling therefore the common assumption that adopting continuous simulation will necessarily offer an advantage is not supported one plausible explanation for this result is that wbnm accounts for nonlinearity in the catchment response eq 3 whilst gr4j is a linear catchment model this means that increases in 5 aep rainfall depths will tend to lead to proportionately higher runoff in wbnm than in gr4j to check this hypothesis the bottom up climate change assessment was repeated assuming a linear catchment response in wbnm m 1 eq 3 the peak flow results showed negligible divergence along the x axis fig 10 which indicates that representation of nonlinearity in catchment response is the key cause of divergence between gr4j and wbnm in modelling future flood peaks the storm volume statistics still diverged as rainfall intensity increased particularly the median volume ratio fig 10b given that the volume ratios tend to increase as β increased a greater proportion of the additional rainfall is being lost i e not contributing to storm runoff in gr4j to understand the reasons for this the rainfall sinks in the two models were analyzed wbnm simply subtracts any additional rainfall up until initial continuing loss values are satisfied for the timestep with the remainder being converted to additional runoff for each scenario with increasing β the average event rainfall was compared with the average effective rainfall in wbnm linear m 1 to understand how much was absorbed through additional losses in the current climate case the average rainfall depth absorbed by losses was 131 mm over the 100 5 aep events this increased as β and hence overall rainfall depth increased up to 151 mm for a 30 increase in β therefore for the most intense extreme rainfall scenario 20 mm additional rainfall was lost on average as gr4j has a more complex model structure there are more potential mechanisms for the additional water to be lost firstly some of the additional rainfall is stored as additional soil moisture according to eq 3 in perrin et al 2003 p s x 1 1 s x 1 2 tanh p n x 1 1 s x 1 tanh p n x 1 where pn is the total rainfall mm ps is rainfall entering the soil store mm x1 is the soil store capacity calibrated to 1153 mm in this model and s is the depth in the soil store mm for each scenario with increasing β and no change in wet season wet day persistence the average total ps over the 100 5 aep events was calculated it was found that average ps increased by 10 mm for a 30 increase in β secondly gr4j considers transport of groundwater between catchments as a function of the level in the routing store according to equation 18 in perrin et al 2003 f x 2 r x 3 7 2 where f is the groundwater exchange term mm r is the level in the routing store mm x2 is the water exchange coefficient mm and x3 is the reference capacity of the routing store the depth of rainfall lost through groundwater exchange increased by 8 mm on average between the current climate simulations and those with 30 increase in β thirdly the amount separated from the flow series through the baseflow filter increased by 12 mm on average in total 30 mm additional rainfall was lost on average from gr4j for the scenario with β increased 30 while the wbnm simulations lost only 20 mm of additional rainfall on average this explains why the modelled volumes in wbnm tended to be proportionately higher than those in gr4j in summary the results demonstrate that relatively complex effects of model structure can become important when simulating floods under change and it may be necessary to undertake specific testing of different model structures at a study site to understand how they will perform under change the results for the 16 scenarios with incremental increases in the β parameter with no change in wet season wet day persistence are shown in fig 11 unlike the scenarios where wet season wet day persistence was perturbed the variance in model performance shows no clear trend this indicates that the variability in antecedent conditions was not strongly impacted by increasing the rainfall distribution although antecedent conditions became wetter on average therefore employing a continuous model that can dynamically account for antecedent conditions may not offer additional benefit beyond the advantage already offered under current climate conditions in reducing model uncertainty under future climate scenarios with increased rainfall distribution both the median and average ratios for flow and volume tend to increase as β increases as indicated in fig 6 5 discussion this study investigated divergence in event based model performance relative to continuous model performance under climate change due to alterations in catchment antecedent conditions the results demonstrated that drier climatic conditions led to increased variability in the performance of an event based model relative to continuous model outputs fig 7 this increased variability in performance was shown to correlate with increased variability in simulated antecedent conditions fig 8 the magnitude of performance divergence surpassed underlying variability and tended to increase for increasingly severe climatic change fig 6 this suggests that continuous simulation could offer an advantage under drier future scenarios but given that increases in extreme rainfall are also predicted for australia this is not sufficient to recommend a complete move away from event based modelling practicing hydrologists hoping to account for drier antecedent conditions in event based models may be interested in whether systematic changes in the ideal loss parameters could be identified the wbnm model was recalibrated against the gr4j results under increasingly dry climate conditions to investigate this however it was found that even if the loss values were recalibrated the event based model could not perform as well under drier conditions there was no consistent change in the calibrated initial loss value this indicates that the parameterization of event based models by adjusting design losses for climate change scenarios is not likely to be intuitive and region specific testing may be required based on local projections it is not recommended that initial loss values be increased under drier future conditions unless there is specific evidence to support this decision at the study site adjusting the rainfall distribution to represent greater rainfall depths was not found to alter variability in the performance of the event based model relative to the continuous model results fig 11 the performance measures were impacted substantially fig 6 but this was not consistent with and therefore not dominated by changing antecedent conditions rather other differences in model structure were found to be more important when extreme rainfall was increased because the continuous model assumes linearity in catchment response but the event based model accounts for nonlinearity the same increase in rainfall tended to give a greater increase in peak flow in the event based model the effect on the performance measures was more significant than that of changing antecedent conditions which would be expected to lead to smaller peak flow values in the event based model it is unclear whether the assumptions around catchment nonlinearity in either model are optimal for simulating future floods since the degree of nonlinearity is uncertain and varies between catchments however it is widely recognized that catchments do exhibit some nonlinearity so the inflexible assumption of linear catchment response is a clear weakness in gr4j for simulation under changing conditions it is possible that catchment nonlinearity could change in the future since hydrologic changes can impact catchment geomorphology nanson et al 1995 lotsari et al 2015 if the degree of nonlinearity in a given catchment s response is sensitive to changes in climate models that allow the user to define a nonlinearity parameter such as wbnm may offer advantages over those in which catchment nonlinearity is fixed as in gr4j or implicit as in swmm investigating future changes in catchment nonlinearity is outside the scope of this study since it would require detailed hydraulic modelling and testing of many scenarios but this would be an interesting topic for future research performance divergence in simulated flood volumes was found to relate to differences in how rainfall is lost i e not converted to runoff in the models in wbnm increased continuing losses meant that the total modelled losses were larger under the increased extreme rainfall scenarios in gr4j there are three mechanisms that increase total rainfall lost 1 more rainfall lost to the soil moisture store 2 more water removed through the baseflow transfer function and 3 more flow separated from the model outputs as baseflow in combination these three mechanisms gave a relatively larger impact on storm volume in gr4j than the additional continuing losses in wbnm meaning that the gr4j flood volumes were smaller overall while gr4j has a more complex structure it is not clear that this offers a more realistic representation therefore it is not possible to say which model might simulate future storm volumes more accurately when extreme rainfall is increased the findings of this study contrast with previous work that recommends the use of continuous simulation for climate change scenarios in order to account for changing antecedent conditions johnson et al 2016 we find that future model performance may be more dependent on other modelling assumptions in some cases therefore practicing hydrologists should carefully consider the specific projections for the study area along with model structural features when selecting a flood model for climate change assessment the common assumption that continuous simulation will necessarily offer an advantage under changing conditions is not supported for cases where drier average conditions and increased extreme rainfall are projected this analysis suggests continuous models that account for catchment nonlinearity may improve future flood prediction it is worth noting that other catchment variables besides extreme rainfall intensity and antecedent conditions are also expected to be affected by climate change these include changes in vegetation due to alterations in temperature carbon dioxide concentrations and rainfall as well as changes in plant water use efficiency due to increased carbon dioxide concentrations liu et al 2016 li and ishidaira 2012 as mentioned above catchment geomorphology could also be impacted by changing hydrologic regimes processes like these are not simulated in common event based or continuous hydrologic models therefore both event based and continuous model performance may be subject to parameter nonstationarity that is not captured in the comparisons here the impact of these environmental changes on continuous model performance in particular has been the subject of several previous studies westra et al 2014 vaze et al 2010 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2014 coron et al 2012 brigode et al 2013 thirel et al 2015 fowler et al 2016 this study was able to compare model performance under change and deduce key potential sources of relative error but does not aim to prove that either model is able to provide an optimal representation of future flow to better understand how catchment response could be affected by future ecological changes it may be useful to test climate change scenarios in more complex ecohydrologic models that are able to simulate vegetation dynamically ultimately all models are subject to some limitations in their representation of catchment dynamics so it will also be important to utilize available observations of catchments under change to improve process understanding going forward based on the results of this study practitioners using event based models to simulate future flows should consider two sources of uncertainty relating to losses firstly there is uncertainty inherent in the assumption that losses calibrated to past events will apply to a separate future event under consistent climatic conditions demonstrated by the variability in results shown in fig 5 applying the calibrated losses gave zero flow for some current climate events and very large flows compared to the continuous model results for others this uncertainty is well recognized in the hydrology community tramblay et al 2010 berthet et al 2009 pathiraja et al 2012 and can be incorporated in modelling studies by applying ensembles of possible loss values constrained by a probability distribution loveridge and rahman 2014 to understand runoff sensitivity secondly there is uncertainty associated with future hydrologic changes that could impact antecedent conditions and typical catchment response fig 6 this is generally not considered in flood modelling and design but we find that applying future climate scenarios substantially increases model uncertainty and alters the relative performance of different types of models fig 6 here we have demonstrated the issue using a deterministic initial continuing loss approach but the same principle would likely apply to ensembles that are constrained based on past observations this would be a useful area of future research the effect of climate change on an event based model that uses initial continuing losses as per standard industry practice in australia ball et al 2016 has been tested here the results for drier climatic scenarios are likely to be analogous for any model in which losses are parameterized based on knowledge of past catchment behavior including swmm and refh kjeldsen 2007 however the equations translating excess rainfall to runoff differ this work has shown that assumptions around the representation of the catchment response could change the sensitivity of these models to scaling rainfall to account for climate change because refh assumes linear catchment response and swmm which applies the manning relationship implicitly assumes a higher rate of nonlinearity than the default in wbnm it is likely that for equivalent climatic changes refh would lead to smaller increases in flood risk than wbnm with swmm leading to the largest increases in flood risk the implications of structural differences in common event based models for studies that involve rainfall scaling without recalibration should be investigated through further research 6 conclusion projected future changes in climate have been shown to impact the relative performance of event based and continuous hydrologic models in simulating flooding drier climatic conditions and increased rainfall distribution were simulated based on gcm projections for southern australia for the drier climate scenarios there was a tendency for the event based model to give increasingly greater estimates of future flood magnitude for some individual events this occurred because drier antecedent conditions meant that the losses calibrated to the current climate were too small however because the antecedent conditions prior to one particular flood event will not necessarily change when the overall climate becomes drier the results were not affected in every case increasing variability in antecedent conditions under drier future scenarios was shown to correlate with variability in event based model performance this indicates that the uncertainty in event based model results increases when attempting to simulate a drier future climate and supports the notion of using continuous simulation to dynamically account for catchment moisture when the rainfall distribution was perturbed to favor greater rainfall intensities the event based model also showed a tendency to simulate larger floods than the continuous model in this case the results were more consistent between different individual events and variability in performance did not increase the changes were not consistent with the alterations in antecedent conditions which would lead one to expect smaller floods in the event based model and were instead attributed to differences in model structure because the event based model accounts for nonlinearity in catchment response but the continuous model is linear increased rainfall tended to translate to greater peak flow increases in the event based model representation of moisture storage in the catchment also contributed to performance divergence for flood volume this is in contrast with the assumption that changing antecedent conditions represents the key source of uncertainty in event based modelling of future floods based on this assessment engineers and hydrologists should be aware of the potential for event based model performance changes in a changing climate in some cases the variability in model performance may be impacted by alterations in antecedent conditions as in the case of the drier climate scenarios tested here however other assumptions inherent in the model structure will sometimes be more important overall the results of this study do not support a blanket shift towards the use of continuous simulation for future flood assessments in a changing climate it is especially important that hydrologists continue to improve physical process representation in flood models acknowledgements lucy marshall is supported through an australian research

783,groundwater level knowledge is one of the crucial information for sustainable use of groundwater resources and efficient and effective conjunctive management of surface and groundwater resources despite the fact that there is an increase of water related datasets collected still groundwater information remains one of the achilles heel in terms of analysis and modeling the present paper is introducing a novel framework for filling data gaps in groundwater time series in an efficient scheme with low computational cost it utilizes direct known measurements and auxiliary regional groundwater model available information the framework employs an exogenous seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarimax stochastic model to describe the simulated groundwater level fluctuation process of a regional physical groundwater model and the ensemble smoother es for predicting the water table level the framework was evaluated by conducting three numerical experiments for five groundwater wells in the south platte alluvial aquifer the results indicate that this framework could serve as a valuable tool for the enhancement of groundwater time series for both intermittent missing data and of continuous gaps with short span which could then lift hindrances in their analysis and use in groundwater models and thus aid water management decisions keywords missing observations stochastic modeling sarimax kalman filter ensemble smoother alluvial aquifer 1 introduction data play an integral role for informed water resources planning and management long and continuous water resources records are required for hydrologic analysis as calibration validation points in physically based models for understanding and managing simulated water systems and also for forecasting purposes relevant datasets are constantly increasing both in spatial and temporal resolution due to technological innovations and advancements that has spurred data collection and reduced collection cost in the us there are several national water resources related data repositories from federal organizations e g usgs usda noaa and epa but even in data rich countries there are cases where available time series could have missing observations intermittent or continuous be of short span or even both as a result scientists and practitioners in many cases are challenged to work with short and fragmented time series in general the sources of data fragmentation could be classified into technological e g equipment failure time off for service institutional e g not an institutional priority inadequate funding and or personnel resources anthropogenic e g errors in measuring handling or storing data and natural e g floods hurricanes landslides causes salas 1993 scientific methods developed to fill in or extend fragmented time series include weighted average methods pappas et al 2014 regression methods koutsoyiannis and langousis 2011 makhuvha et al 1997 salas et al 1980 salas

data gaps specifically in groundwater level time series turns out to be an extremely challenging task especially for cases that aquifers are highly dynamic and where the existing measurements are characterized by low temporal and spatial frequency the intrinsic complexity of geology resulting to heterogeneity of aquifer parameters land cover basin hydrology along with weak monitoring initiatives and anthropogenic interventions i e groundwater pumping water diversions recharge structures are some of the contributing factors conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources to meet the growing water demands results many times in sustainable management solutions thus groundwater information is pivotal for achieving integrated water management groundwater level measurements are still the most reliable information of systems state and the fundamental building block of any further analysis despite that in many real cases the lack of systematic groundwater level measurements in combination with the different sampling timing and frequency has led to groundwater level time series with gaps and irregular time intervals thus creating challenges for modeling as well as data driven analysis oikonomou 2017 regional physically based groundwater models are becoming more representative of the aquifer systems due to improved data availability and increased computational prowess allowing finer scale representation although these developments offer the opportunity to have critical insights of the aquifers overall behavior most of the times they lack the ability to fully capture the finer local variations due to system simplifications imperfect input information and the scale of model discretization hence even though the model provides the best unbiased estimate for a modeled cell it cannot be used as a true measure of the system nevertheless the autoregressive integrated moving average arima box and pierce 1970 family of models has been extensively and repeatedly used for the analysis and forecasting in a wide range of water related studies including floods drought water management water quality ahmad et al 2001 durdu 2010 irvine and

through arima models with model variations including seasonality and or stationarity is a very common practice changnon et al 1988 mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 von asmuth et al 2008 von asmuth et al 2012 ahn and salas 1997 applied arima models for determining a uniform sampling time in order to represent the groundwater head fluctuations additionally there were also efforts using process based models such as pluricellular eigenvalues and stream depletion factor based models but given the above argumentation was decided in this effort to apply the arima cluster of models the next step is to present the kalman filter approach which is a key element in this work the original kalman filter kf kalman 1960 kalman and bucy 1961 and its many variants developed to overcome pitfalls of the standard method and non linear formulation to become possible have been extensively employed in several environmental fields aanonsen et al 2009 dee 1991 houtekamer et al 2005 keppenne and rienecker 2002 walker and houser 2001 there are many examples of the application of the kf technique in hydrology clark et al 2008 kitanidis and bras 1979 1980 rodriguez iturbe et al 1978 schreider et al 2001

conductivity in a groundwater flow and transport modeling scheme showing that enkf outperforms the smoother optimal design of groundwater monitoring networks is a common practical problem where prior information of the hydrogeological parameters is crucial studies in this domain employ the kf in different sampling frameworks with noteworthy improvements with main goals to minimize the prediction errors and the cost associated with the number of observation wells alzraiee et al 2013 herrera and pinder 2005 kollat et al 2011 zhang et al 2005 this work introduces a novel easy to implement and computationally low cost framework to fill gaps in groundwater level time series the framework consists of four components 1 regional groundwater model 2 stochastic modeling 3 ensemble smoother es van leeuwen and evensen 1996 and 4 groundwater level measurements a stochastic linear model for each point of interest is build based on the information simulated groundwater levels recharge and pumping rates from an existing regional physically based groundwater flow model the use of existing groundwater regional models expand their scope and augments their value the constructed stochastic model serves as the system s model in the es algorithm the es use the measured groundwater levels during its updating scheme the efficacy of the proposed methodology was evaluated by conducting three numerical experiments for several groundwater wells located within different parts of the south platte s alluvial aquifer the suggested framework does not require any aquifer specific parameters making it transferable to any modeled alluvial aquifer 2 material and methods 2 1 arima models the arima models is one of the most common tools for environmental time series analysis and prediction hipel and mcleod 1994 the arima models are describing how the present observation of a time series yt from a stationary or a non stationary process can be determined based on a linear relationship between previous observations y t 1 y t 2 y t p the current white noise term ε t and ones of previous time steps ε t 1 ε t 2 ε t q box and jenkins 1976 the stationary case of an arima model is commonly noted as arma p q with p to symbolize the order of the autoregressive process and q the order of the moving average process its mathematical formulation is shown in eq 1 where φ and θ are the autoregressive and moving average coefficients respectively 1 y t φ 1 y t 1 φ 2 y t 2 φ p y t p ɛ t θ 1 ɛ t 1 θ 2 ɛ t 2 θ q ɛ t q frequently time series demonstrate seasonal variations thus the arima model includes additional parameters to account for these linear cyclical relationships the general notation of such a model is known as arima p d q p d q s where d symbolizes the order of the integrative part s is the seasonality of the time series while p d q denote the order of the seasonal autocorrelation integration and the moving average processes respectively the seasonal arima sarima process could be express in the general form of eq 2 with φ φ θ θ to represent the seasonal and non seasonal autoregressive and moving average operators and b the backshift and differencing operators in cases where exogenous variables xtm are influencing the stochastic process the model takes the form of eq 3 and often abbreviated as sarimax 2 φ p b φ p b s d s d y t θ q b θ q b s ɛ t 3 φ p b φ p b s d s d y t θ q b θ q b s ɛ t α m x t m 2 2 kalman filtering techniques and the ensemble smoother the kalman filter kalman 1960 is a sequential filtering technique which is applied to linear systems whose residuals are following the gaussian distribution meinhold and singpurwalla 1983 one of the advantages of the methodology is that it combines model and ground truth information of a system into a framework that takes into account uncertainty both in the model and measurements eigbe et al 1998 to break free from the linearity constraints and the difficulty to estimate objectively the error statistics necessary to apply the kalan filter variants of the classical method were developed the most common used variants of the original algorithm include the extended kalman filter ekf gelb 1974 the unscented kalman filter julier and uhlmann 1997 wan and van der merwe 2001 and the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 the enkf has gained popularity due to its simple formulation ease of application and also to its minimal computational requirements it combines a monte carlo method for estimating the error statistics and the kalman filter evensen 1994 evensen 1997 presented the enkf successful performance on a chaotic and highly nonlinear system of the lorenz equations and there are numerous applications proving its applicability to real case studies evensen 2003 an extension to the enkf is the ensemble kalman smoother enks evensen and van leeuwen 2000 which can also be applied in highly nonlinear systems in a sequential way the main variation from the enkf is that it updates the state estimates based on the future observations in general the filter algorithms are more suitable when forecasting is the primary purpose while smoothers are more appropriate for process studies van leeuwen and evensen 1996 the es was introduced by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 is a monte carlo based kalman method that consists of a forecasting updating scheme where the system state is updated in a way that it minimizes the updated state s variance when there are known measurements of the state the es does not run in a sequential mode like enks and thus it is suitable for off line applications baù et al 2015 making it a suitable scheme for this effort the ensemble framework is used for the estimation of the error statistics let s define a f as the ensemble matrix which is holding a finite set of ensemble members the ensemble members ψ i are vectors of the forecasted model states with length n 4 a f ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ n ℜ n n the forecast error covariance matrix p e f is defined as 5 p e f a f a τ a f a τ t n 1 ℜ n n with the assumption that true mean of a τ is equal to a f for large enough ensemble members the p e f can be computed according to the following equation 6 p e f a f a f a f a f t n 1 a f a f t n 1 ℜ n n during the update step of the es the matrix a f is being corrected using m state measurements the kalman framework is allowing for incorporating uncertainty not only at the model but also in the measurements in this regard the observation vector d j where j 1 2 n can be expressed by two parts the true value vector d plus a random noise error vector ɛ 7 d j d ɛ j ℜ m similar to the forecast ensemble matrix the measurement vectors can be stored in a matrix 8 d d 1 d 2 d n ℜ m n and the ensemble of error vectors in the e matrix 9 e ɛ 1 ɛ 2 ɛ n ℜ m n the error vector ɛ is assumed to be a random process following a gaussian distribution with mean equal to zero thus the covariance matrix r e is equal to 10 r e e e t n 1 ℜ m m the following equation is the update step of the es scheme and it allows to update the estimate of the state of the system when observations are available 11 a u a f k d h a f ℜ n n where h ℜ m n is a binary matrix that maps the locations of the measurements in such way that the rows symbolize the number of the measurement and the columns the time step that was observed more specifically if the second measurement is representing the state of the system for t 10 then its location in the h matrix will be h 2 10 12 k p e f h t hp e f h t r e 1 ℜ n m lastly k is the kalman gain matrix where the formulation is responsible for minimizing the variance error while yielding the best linear unbiased estimator additionally the kalman gain matrix is incorporating both measurement and model covariance matrices r e and p e f into its calculation signifying that the correction applied to a f is related to the entrenched uncertainties in these two matrices baù et al 2015 the main disadvantage of the es is its suboptimal performance for nonlinear systems crestani et al 2013 grønnevik and evensen 2001 van leeuwen and evensen 1996 2 3 framework for filling missing groundwater level measurements in the kf literature there are also articles that deal with the problem of filling missing data alavi et al 2006 bennis et al 1997 bierkens et al 1999 gove and hollinger 2006 jarvis et al 2004 moreover scholars have proposed methods that combine stochastic time series models of groundwater head with the kf however they have focused mainly on applications of the inverse problem knotters and bierkens 2000 used the methodology in bierkens et al 1999 in order to predict the effect of interventions on groundwater dynamics on a daily time step the use of kf for parameter estimation for transfer function noise was the scope of berendrecht et al 2003 and yi et al 2004 bierkens et al 2001 combined the same framework with auxiliary information e g digital elevation model soil maps etc for calibrating a daily regional arx model with the groundwater estimated states which is to be used in applications of optimal prediction network optimization and conditional simulation at an earlier study an empirical kf algorithm incorporating a regional sarima model constructed based on monthly groundwater level data from 21 wells was evaluated for state estimation graham and tankersley 1993 a scheme for regional spatiotemporal groundwater head prediction that a simple kf and a global optimization algorithm were used for calibrating at known points transfer function noise models with excess precipitation as exogenous input and afterwards the regionalization of the model parameters for ungauged locations via clustering was evaluated by yuan et al 2008 varouchakis 2017 used an arx model and the kalman filter adaptation algorithm to predict mean and biannual groundwater levels the proposed framework is intending to introduce a viable method for groundwater level gap filling by utilizing in situ measurements and auxiliary information from a regional groundwater model in an efficient scheme with low computational cost a similar framework is neither in place nor the es has been evaluated for a similar task oikonomou et al 2015a the framework s architecture is illustrated in fig 1 the main components are 1 extracted information groundwater table levels recharge and pumping rates from a regional groundwater flow model 2 stochastic modeling of the model s output through sarimax with the exogenous inputs being recharge and pumping rates 3 the es algorithm and 4 the observation data for each location of interest the first two building blocks of the framework constitute the data from groundwater model and the measurements the simulated level time series for the well locations of interest are extracted from the model additionally the time series representing the average recharge and pumping rates for areas with different radii around each well location of interest are retrieved those different recharge and pumping averages are used to build different sarimax models during the stochastic modeling step and choose the most appropriate one the proposed scheme does not require the groundwater sampling frequency to be consistent across the observation record the only two logical constraints are to aggregate measurement data to the time step of the groundwater model in cases where the sampling frequency is higher and to fall within the period of the aquifer simulation the next main component of the framework is the construction of a groundwater stochastic model representative of the process indicated by the simulated level time series each groundwater level time series are modeled by a site specific seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average sarimax process with exogenous inputs of recharge and pumping using the statistical computing programming language r r core team 2016 the exogenous inputs were included in the stochastic model in order to give physical meaning to it the recharge and pumping time series with all the different radii are tested during the sarimax construction process to select the model that has the best fit for each location the construction of a sarimax model consists of an iterative process of three steps that include stationarity and seasonality testing and model identification the parameter estimation and diagnostic checking box and jenkins 1976 hipel and mcleod 1994 the order of integration d in the sarimax models was identified through visual identification of the autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf and appropriate statistical tests which are considered two supplementary approaches the augmented dickey fuller adf test is detecting the presence of unit root in the time series additionally the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test was utilized which complements the adf unit root test since it has low power against near unit root alternatives karlsson and löthgren 2000 seasonality as well model selection can be identified through the acf and pacf graphs the sarimax construction except from the above approaches involved also the use of the forecast package in r in order to identify the model automatically to do parameter selection and to run diagnostics of the sarimax models hyndman 2016 hyndman and khandakar 2008 the sarimax model parameter estimation was done by using maximum likelihood estimation the t test was utilized to measure statistical significance of each model parameter in order to exclude spurious terms the overall fit of model parameters with the same integration order was evaluated by the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the exogenous variables recharge and pumping are assumed to follow for each month a gaussian distribution synthetic exogenous variables are generated based on the original first order statistic of each month and with variances that are a bit larger than those computed a slightly larger variance than the computed one was introduced as to increase indirectly the ensemble uncertainty in cases where the groundwater flow model was not approximating the behavior of the measured well levels the optimal sarimax model with the exogenous synthetic time series are used to produce the ensemble of time series needed for the es algorithm at the final step the es is employed to impute the gaps in the time series by taking into account also the information provided by the groundwater level observations summarizing the proposed framework s scheme was designed keeping in mind key characteristics such as to have low computational cost since it is not dependent on the groundwater model for the generating the forecast ensemble for each evaluation point ease of implementation the ability to incorporate information from readily available groundwater models irrespective of the coarse scale of application and to have transferability in any alluvial aquifer regardless of local conditions 2 4 materials and numerical experiments 2 4 1 application area available model and data the area selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed computationally low cost groundwater data filling framework is the alluvial aquifer of south platte river the south platte river basin in northeast colorado has a drainage area of about 49 000 km2 dennehy et al 1993 and it is characterized by a semi arid climate with a high dependence on melting snow the south platte river basin on the eastern plains has undergone a huge transformation due to land reclamation agricultural development and population increase it is the most populated region of colorado since approximately 70 of state s population more than 3 700 000 is living in this particular area colorado department of local affairs 2016 the south platte is an over appropriated basin that has multiple water needs and apart from the domestic sector it has to satisfy a large agricultural demand in 2010 the estimated irrigated parcel area in the basin was 3426 km2 846 634 acres colorado decision support systems 2016 industrial activities are also present in the basin including water demand for unconventional oil and gas development oikonomou et al 2016 oikonomou et al 2015b oikonomou et al 2015c groundwater plays a substantial role in meeting these water needs particularly in the agricultural sector the physical conditions anthropogenic stresses and interventions along with the water legislative environment governing the south platte basin are adding to water system s complexity this complexity is also reflected by the different water management approaches over the time to bring groundwater into the prior appropriation system so as not to harm senior surface water rights waskom 2013 the 2002 2003 drought in colorado was a catalyst for implementing a stricter water administration requiring full augmentation for system depletions caused by pumping tributary groundwater one effect of this water management shift was the curtailment in 2007 of about 5 000 wells that lacked an approved augmentation plan waskom 2013 at the same time in certain areas of the basin were reported incidents of adversely impacted properties by high groundwater levels waskom and oikonomou 2014 forcing the state of colorado to act in this emergency colorado general assembly 2015a the state of colorado has requested research projects colorado general assembly 2012 2015b 2015c that would assist the administrative authorities to have a better understanding of surface groundwater interactions and thus to implement a basin wide efficient equitable and integrated water resources planning and management through the colorado decision support systems cdss initiative www cdss state co us a physically based groundwater flow model was built and tested by cdm smith for the south platte alluvium spdss modflow the model was developed in modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 with a monthly time step from january 1950 to december 2006 cdm smith 2013 the spdss modflow is covering approximately 6475 km2 2 500 mi2 and the aquifer is represented as a single layer having a uniform grid of 304 8 m 1000 ft which results to 555 440 cells cdm smith 2013 it was built for regional scale analysis focusing on aquifer stream interactions and thus it is not able to simulate accurately local groundwater level variations in the south platte there are few dedicated monitoring wells with continuous data loggers spanning from 2003 or 2004 until the present but the majority are irrigation wells that are measured biannually fall and spring the water table generally follows a cyclic pattern with highest observations occurring during the fall period following the irrigation season and the lowest in the spring some of the observation wells have a longer water level record going back to the 1930s and 1940s of course there are several years that the irrigation wells have no available groundwater level measurements in both intermittent and continuous fashion this is indicative that throughout the years there were periods that groundwater monitoring programs were not consistent for the purposes of this paper five south platte alluvium wells fig 2 are presented which had the longest available and the most consistent observation record these wells are monitored by the colorado division of water resources dwr and the central colorado water conservancy district ccwcd apart from the aforementioned reasons the selection was also based on representing different sections of the alluvium proximity to the stream and the well level behavior the groundwater head observations are publicly available through the state s water database called hydrobase http water state co us datamaps pages default aspx along with several metadata for each well such as its position owner s name permit number adjudicated uses and others the monthly simulated head at each well s location the mean recharge and total pumping within different radii were extracted from the spdss modflow a sarimax model for each well was used to model the groundwater head since all wells exhibited a 12 month cycle the simulated monthly water table for the five selected wells are shown in fig 3 along with the recorded actual measurements on a local scale the spdss modflow can represent a general indication of groundwater behavior seasonality without being able to simulate accurately the water table level at well 01n5531dcd that is located at the beginning of the alluvium of the beaver creek tributary of the south platte the model fails to simulate the actual general behavior of the water table at that location at the same time it captures the seasonal variability rather well small head fluctuation from fall to spring season for well 04n6422dcd located at the box elder creek tributary the spdss modflow is not able to approximate the local water table trend as well however at the same time it is capturing the magnitude of seasonal variability for the other three wells the groundwater regional model at these points is representing more appropriately the water table it should be underlined that since the groundwater head measurements are taken biannually it is assumed that those observations are representative of the true mean head for the months the measurements took place all of the tested wells are used for agricultural purposes this increases the probability of some outliers to be present in the time series since measurements may be taken after groundwater was pumped evaluating the performance of the proposed framework for filling gaps in groundwater head time series in a complex hydrologic system with multiple stresses and governed under a strict scheme can serve as an excellent proof of its robustness the south platte basin below denver and its aquifer fulfill all of the criteria making it an ideal study area 2 4 2 design and assumptions of numerical experiments the observed groundwater head over time is the only available measure of evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology the performance of the proposed methodology for filling data gaps in groundwater time series has been evaluated by three numerical experiments table 1 shows each of these experiments and their objective the first numerical experiment is assuming that all known water table measurements are available for updating the es except one the es algorithm is run iteratively treating initially as unknown the first known measurement the second iteration will treat the second known value as unknown and so forth each of the predictions are compared with the known measured value the average prediction performance is described by calculating dimensioned statistics in this case in meters namely the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae 13 rmse n 1 i 1 n e i 2 1 2 14 mae n 1 i 1 n e i where e i y i y i yi is the observed value y i the estimated value and n the sample number of observations the use of rmse though can be misleading many times due to the fact that the larger the squared error variance is the larger is the rmse value eq 13 the mae eq 14 has been suggested by willmott and matsuura 2005 as a more natural measure of average model performance error in this study both rmse and mae are presented since they represent the common measures of average prediction performance however in the results section the focus is mae at the second numerical experiment five random measurements are treated as unknowns while the rmse and mae are calculated and stored this experiment was selected in order to test the performance of the method to simulate the case of intermittent gaps present in the groundwater head time series the numerical experiment is repeated for each well with each iteration having a new random set of five values and each predicted value is compared with the respective known measurement the experiment continues until there is convergence on the mean and the standard deviation of the sample rmse convergence was assumed when there was no improvement more than 0 1 of both moments for the past 1000 runs the density histograms of rmse and mae were calculated and plotted because the number of iterations for each well could vary the density property was expressed in percentages and the entire histogram equals one the last numerical experiment is constructed to simulate the case of continuous missing values in the groundwater level a contiguous five year window is selected randomly and the observations within the window are treated as unknowns the es algorithm is employed to calculate the rmse and the mae of each iteration similar to the second numerical experiment each iteration has a new random five year window which their predictions are compared to the respective measurements the numerical experiment for each well is completed with the same convergence assumptions as in the previous numerical experiment as presented in the methodology section the modeled groundwater head at the well locations was modeled with a sarimax model different time series of the exogenous predictor variables recharge and pumping representing different radii of exogenous influence were tested in order to represent the stochastic physical process more accurately for consistency reasons the set of radii selected to be tested for each well location was 914 m 3 000 ft 1829 m 6000 ft 3048 m 10 000 ft and 4877 m 16 000 ft the radii originating from each well location that intersected the river were not taken into account for testing the effect of the exogenous variables in the sarimax fitting table 2 shows the best fitted sarimax models of each radius of influence and their corresponding aic in some cases the model approximation for pumping was not statistically significant in order to be included in the models parameters the autocorrelation function acf of the residuals of the sarimax models fig 4 is evidence of good fit box and jenkins 1976 box and pierce 1970 considering that the regional groundwater model is lacking the accuracy for local variations the autocorrelation plots show that only few autocorrelations are outside the 95 confidence interval around zero this could be attributed to the unconfined aquifer s nonlinear dynamics as the simulation with the arima family of models assumes global linearity the ensemble matrix a accounting for model uncertainty characterization is populated with 500 time series members generated from the best sarimax model for each well location recharge and pumping data extracted from spdss modflow are assumed to follow a gaussian distribution on a monthly basis since kalman approaches perform best with gaussian distributions the synthetic exogenous time series used as inputs to sarimax have the same monthly mean with an increased monthly standard deviation to account for model errors the ensemble matrix for every well generated by the best fitted sarimax was kept the same during all three numerical experiments for consistency reasons furthermore the statistics of the measurement errors in most practical applications are unknown so in order to incorporate the measurement uncertainty the measurement error covariance matrix r e was constructed assuming the errors follow a gaussian distribution for the same reason mentioned above with a mean zero and variance of 10 16 cm2 1 3 ft2 this assumption was introduced to represent the possible human error during a groundwater head measurement the incorporation of a larger error could also relax more the assumption that a single water table observation within a month is representative for the average groundwater level for that specific month 2 5 results and discussion 2 5 1 filling single missing observation sporadic gaps in groundwater level time series is a common phenomenon for groundwater aquifers that are highly dynamic the infilling of such missing points could be a very challenging task considering anthropogenic interventions and natural hydrology especially in cases with low sampling frequency biannual the purpose of this experiment is to investigate the performance of the suggested framework when one missing value is to be filled the numerical experiment was performed in an iterative fashion for all known points of each of the five selected wells presented in 2 4 1 each time only a single measurement was treated as unknown the scatter plots of the measured versus the predicted value shown in fig 5 are summarizing all performed runs for each well each point in the graphs in fig 5 represents the individual error with its magnitude being the perpendicular distance from the diagonal line in all scatter plots the data points are clustered around the diagonal indicating that the es algorithm has almost no bias furthermore the graphs show a homoscedastic behavior since in different water table levels of each well there is no difference in the variance of the prediction error in well 04n6422dcd however there is a consistent tendency of overestimation in the lower water table values this bias effect is most probably caused because the water table in the period of 1964 1970 is at the lowest point and after that it bounces back one key outcome of this numerical experiment was the inability of this methodology to predict piezometric heads when there were no similar measurements in temporal proximity the water table divergence from temporally adjacent observations could be outliers due to drought flood conditions since the south platte alluvial aquifer responds quickly to surface hydrologic variability the divergence could also be attributed to human errors during measurement or to measurements taken soon after the well was pumped low performance is expected when the sarimax model fitted on the groundwater levels simulated from the spdss modflow in the specific cell of the aquifer has no similar behavior a characteristic example of a satisfactory prediction of an observation value which is significantly different from its immediate temporal neighbors is the last known point of well 04n6506dab fig 3 despite the abrupt change of the water table the proposed methodology managed to give a rather precise estimate this is because the physical groundwater model of the well 04n6506dab is able to represent the groundwater upward trend after 2001 and this information is transferred to the sarimax model similarly at temporal points where a change in the water table is taking place and there are no intermediate observations in between the predicted value is frequently not accurate despite the fact that the es update step is assimilating all available measurements adjusting the average updated ensemble to follow an abrupt change is not possible when there are no relevant data points and when the sarimax model is not representing this change more specifically the highest water level observed at well 04n5931cb exhibits a large prediction error 3 m since there is no observation to inform the update scheme of the es for this change this specific example underscores the importance of having key measurements depicting accurately the response of the water table in time in order to guide the algorithm to acceptable predictions the prediction of an observed missing point in general is giving satisfactory results as the mae is low in all tested wells and not only the presented ones the overall estimation via the es algorithm was closer to the observed value than filling the missing points with the average water table value the rmse and mae values for each well are shown on the top right of each scatter plot of fig 5 all wells except 04n5931cb have mae less than 0 3 m it is worth reiterating that the suggested algorithm was tested on wells measured on a biannual step which had significant data gaps ensuring a realistic test on the suggested methodology the temporal scarcity of observation points in the tested wells in combination with the use of a regional groundwater model which in many cases is unable to approximate the groundwater fluctuations are impediments of having even better results 2 5 2 filling multiple missing observations the second numerical experiment is more challenging than the previous one since five random observations are treated as unknown the motivation behind the design of this experiment was to represent cases where few gaps exist in the record such gaps could be the result either of man made cause e g lack of funds or natural e g floods and may significantly affect further analysis in order for the random sample sets to be representative and have unbiased results the experiment was bootstrapped the iterations needed for the mean and standard deviation of rmse to converge for each well are not the same table 3 and thus frequency histograms are not an appropriate representation the probability distribution of two prediction error metrics rmse and mae of the results for each well is presented by density histograms in fig 6 for ease of representation the density is expressed in percentage the histograms appear to be roughly symmetric or slightly right skewed the distribution of all wells is unimodal with the only exception of the rmse histogram of well 04n5931cb the bimodal distribution can be attributed to the increased weight rmse is giving to larger errors since the random sample of unknown observations could contain values from the cluster of points between 1966 1968 that diverge from well s general trend see fig 3 the proposed methodology has a very satisfactory performance the mae for the selected wells is small less than 0 3 m similar to the first experiment well 04n5931cb has a larger sample mae median compared to other wells just below 0 4 m this is considered to be a reasonable well prediction since its outliers and non stationary behavior are challenging factors for accurate prediction the maximum mae recorded in these numerical experiments is significant however it should be kept in mind that the wells tested have low measurement frequency biannual and significant data gaps 2 5 3 filling missing continuous gaps the third numerical experiment is the most challenging of all numerical experiments since in a five year window the available information of the piezometric level is treated as unknown long periods could enclose prolonged drought occurrences and miss critical data points at the update phase of the es resulting to a poor water level prediction having the ability to reconstruct aquifer s behavior in several key sites and for critical periods such as drought events even if some acceptable error is introduced with the infilling could have significant value to water managers and could be compared with similar events such information becomes even more important when the subject aquifer is an unconfined alluvial formation where the water table is responding to surface hydrology similar to the previous numerical experiment the iterative process of treating observations within a five year period as unknown was terminated when there was convergence in the first two moments of the sample rmse table 4 presents the number of iterations needed for each well in order the current numerical experiment to be completed furthermore the prediction performance is presented in an analogous way to the second numerical experiment fig 7 shows the density histograms of the rmse and mae for all selected random samples it is clear from the presented histograms that the symmetry on both error metrics is lost with right skewness and large spread and bi multi modality are the key characteristics of the produced error distributions only well 10n4902cbc is escaping the aforementioned characteristics with the prediction performance very close to recorded values more than 70 of times the missing observations are filled with error of 0 2 m or less this high prediction performance can be attributed to the water table behavior throughout the whole observation period in all other wells the calculated errors of the randomly selected samples are performing adequately considering the large gap attempted to be filled for wells 01n5531dcd and 04n6506dab in about 40 and 50 of the times respectively the mae is less than 0 3 m wells 04n5931cb and 04n6422dcd in more than 30 of the times the mae is less than 0 4 m and 0 5 m respectively due to the gaps existing in the tested time series especially in wells 04n6422dcd and 04n6506dab there were incidents that the randomly selected five year windows contained only a few observations the errors from those samples being outliers of the general error behavior can be traced in rmse histograms as the rectangles erecting from low error bins high error outliers are occurring when the observations under prediction are including possible outliers or these values are too different from the rest of the recorded measurements in the same location example of this is the large mae values 3 5 m recorded for well 04n5931cb and stretches the importance of the existing measurements for the under prediction time interval overall the tested framework should be used with caution particularly in cases where continuous data gaps are attempted to be filled but the motivation of this numerical experiment was simulate cases where there is a need to have a representation of the aquifer s behavior 2 6 conclusions groundwater level data is the building block of data driven analysis and modeling groundwater head observations often have missing observations and suffer from inconsistent measurement frequency in the current effort a novel framework for filling gaps in groundwater head time series was proposed it attempts to enhance groundwater head time series by utilizing information of all available sources direct known measurements and auxiliary groundwater flow model information through an efficient scheme with low computational cost the framework employs an exogenous seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarimax stochastic model to describe the groundwater level fluctuation process and the es for predicting the water table level the methodology was implemented in south platte river basin which has complex hydrology due to its dependence on snowmelt furthermore there is a strict water management framework with significant manmade modification of natural hydrology the case study of south platte is characterized by well kept public water records the application of the proposed methodology in such a complex water system adds value to numerical experiments since it indicates the transferability of the framework to other areas even with less available data if a groundwater flow model exists for the area of interest then the only measured data needed for the framework s application are groundwater levels recharge and pumping data are extracted from the groundwater model directly the use of the regional groundwater model supports the claim that even if data are not perfect the presented methodology has satisfactory performance with the introduced error be small three numerical experiments were designed to evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed framework for 18 well locations with biannual measurements for brevity a representative subset of five wells is presented and discussed the scope of the first numerical experiment was to test the performance of the methodology when a single measurement is missing the performance of all wells was very satisfactory with average mae of all five wells to be 0 28 m the algorithm encountered difficulty in predicting a sudden change in water table measurement record when there were no similar measurements in temporal proximity furthermore the prediction error increased when the model was not approximating the general tendency or the seasonality of the measured values the design of the second numerical experiment assessed the cases where multiple observations were missing in a random fashion for this reason an iterative process was adopted in every run a new set of five randomly chosen observations were treated us unknowns the experiment in each well was concluded only when there was convergence on the first two moments of the sample rmse the results of all wells are also very satisfactory with similar error metrics as in the first experiment the third numerical experiment was the least successful of the three and the most challenging one since a random five year window was selected and the observations that lied within were treated as unknowns the iterative process was terminated following the same convergence criterion as in the second numerical experiment the importance of measured points to guide the updated step of the ensemble smoother es is signified in this experiment in addition it should be noted that missing data in sequential fashion does not reveal the possible occurrence of extended droughts and could lead to overestimation of the groundwater table the framework could serve as a valuable tool for enhancing groundwater time series for both intermittent missing data and of continuous gaps with short span as it was demonstrated in this effort overcoming existing data limitations with methodologies that augment the available water system information could contribute to improving the quality of input data for data driven analysis but also groundwater flow models this could provide further insight

783,groundwater level knowledge is one of the crucial information for sustainable use of groundwater resources and efficient and effective conjunctive management of surface and groundwater resources despite the fact that there is an increase of water related datasets collected still groundwater information remains one of the achilles heel in terms of analysis and modeling the present paper is introducing a novel framework for filling data gaps in groundwater time series in an efficient scheme with low computational cost it utilizes direct known measurements and auxiliary regional groundwater model available information the framework employs an exogenous seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarimax stochastic model to describe the simulated groundwater level fluctuation process of a regional physical groundwater model and the ensemble smoother es for predicting the water table level the framework was evaluated by conducting three numerical experiments for five groundwater wells in the south platte alluvial aquifer the results indicate that this framework could serve as a valuable tool for the enhancement of groundwater time series for both intermittent missing data and of continuous gaps with short span which could then lift hindrances in their analysis and use in groundwater models and thus aid water management decisions keywords missing observations stochastic modeling sarimax kalman filter ensemble smoother alluvial aquifer 1 introduction data play an integral role for informed water resources planning and management long and continuous water resources records are required for hydrologic analysis as calibration validation points in physically based models for understanding and managing simulated water systems and also for forecasting purposes relevant datasets are constantly increasing both in spatial and temporal resolution due to technological innovations and advancements that has spurred data collection and reduced collection cost in the us there are several national water resources related data repositories from federal organizations e g usgs usda noaa and epa but even in data rich countries there are cases

data gaps specifically in groundwater level time series turns out to be an extremely challenging task especially for cases that aquifers are highly dynamic and where the existing measurements are characterized by low temporal and spatial frequency the intrinsic complexity of geology resulting to heterogeneity of aquifer parameters land cover basin hydrology along with weak monitoring initiatives and anthropogenic interventions i e groundwater pumping water diversions recharge structures are some of the contributing factors conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources to meet the growing water demands results many times in sustainable management solutions thus groundwater information is pivotal for achieving integrated water management groundwater level measurements are still the most reliable information of systems state and the fundamental building block of any further analysis despite that in many real cases the lack of systematic groundwater level measurements in combination with the different sampling timing and frequency has led to groundwater level time series with gaps and irregular time intervals thus creating challenges for modeling as well as data driven analysis oikonomou 2017 regional physically based groundwater models are becoming more representative of the aquifer systems due to improved data availability and increased computational prowess allowing finer scale representation although these developments offer the opportunity to have critical insights of the aquifers overall behavior most of the times they lack the ability to fully capture the finer local variations due to system simplifications imperfect input information and the scale of model discretization hence even though the model provides the best unbiased estimate for a modeled cell it cannot be used as a true measure of the system nevertheless the autoregressive integrated moving average arima box and pierce 1970 family of models has been extensively and repeatedly used for the analysis and forecasting in a wide range of water related studies including floods drought water management water quality ahmad et al 2001 durdu 2010 irvine and

through arima models with model variations including seasonality and or stationarity is a very common practice changnon et al 1988 mirzavand and ghazavi 2014 von asmuth et al 2008 von asmuth et al 2012 ahn and salas 1997 applied arima models for determining a uniform sampling time in order to represent the groundwater head fluctuations additionally there were also efforts using process based models such as pluricellular eigenvalues and stream depletion factor based models but given the above argumentation was decided in this effort to apply the arima cluster of models the next step is to present the kalman filter approach which is a key element in this work the original kalman filter kf kalman 1960 kalman and bucy 1961 and its many variants developed to overcome pitfalls of the standard method and non linear formulation to become possible have been extensively employed in several environmental fields aanonsen et al 2009 dee 1991 houtekamer et al 2005 keppenne and rienecker

computationally low cost framework to fill gaps in groundwater level time series the framework consists of four components 1 regional groundwater model 2 stochastic modeling 3 ensemble smoother es van leeuwen and evensen 1996 and 4 groundwater level measurements a stochastic linear model for each point of interest is build based on the information simulated groundwater levels recharge and pumping rates from an existing regional physically based groundwater flow model the use of existing groundwater regional models expand their scope and augments their value the constructed stochastic model serves as the system s model in the es algorithm the es use the measured groundwater levels during its updating scheme the efficacy of the proposed methodology was evaluated by conducting three numerical experiments for several groundwater wells located within different parts of the south platte s alluvial aquifer the suggested framework does not require any aquifer specific parameters making it transferable to any modeled alluvial aquifer 2 material and methods 2 1 arima models the arima models is one of the most common tools for environmental time series analysis and prediction hipel and mcleod 1994 the arima models are describing how the present observation of a time series yt from a stationary or a non stationary process can be determined based on a linear relationship between previous observations y t 1 y t 2 y t p the current white noise term ε t and ones of previous time steps ε t 1 ε t 2 ε t q box and jenkins 1976 the stationary case of an arima model is commonly noted as arma p q with p to symbolize the order of the autoregressive process and q the order of the moving average process its mathematical formulation is shown in eq 1 where φ and θ are the autoregressive and moving average coefficients respectively 1 y t φ 1 y t 1 φ 2 y t 2 φ p y t p ɛ t θ 1 ɛ t 1 θ 2 ɛ t 2 θ q ɛ t q frequently time series demonstrate seasonal variations thus the arima model includes additional parameters to account for these linear cyclical relationships the general notation of such a model is known as arima p d q p d q s where d symbolizes the order of the integrative part s is the seasonality of the time series while p d q denote the order of the seasonal autocorrelation integration and the moving average processes respectively the seasonal arima sarima process could be express in the general form of eq 2 with φ φ θ θ to represent the seasonal and non seasonal autoregressive and moving average operators and b the backshift and differencing operators in cases where exogenous variables xtm are influencing the stochastic process the model takes the form of eq 3 and often abbreviated as sarimax 2 φ p b φ p b s d s d y t θ q b θ q b s ɛ t 3

linear systems whose residuals are following the gaussian distribution meinhold and singpurwalla 1983 one of the advantages of the methodology is that it combines model and ground truth information of a system into a framework that takes into account uncertainty both in the model and measurements eigbe et al 1998 to break free from the linearity constraints and the difficulty to estimate objectively the error statistics necessary to apply the kalan filter variants of the classical method were developed the most common used variants of the original algorithm include the extended kalman filter ekf gelb 1974 the unscented kalman filter julier and uhlmann 1997 wan and van der merwe 2001 and the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 the enkf has gained popularity due to its simple formulation ease of application and also to its minimal computational requirements it combines a monte carlo method for estimating the error statistics and the kalman filter evensen 1994 evensen 1997 presented the enkf successful performance on a chaotic and highly nonlinear system of the lorenz equations and there are numerous applications proving its applicability to real case studies evensen 2003 an extension to the enkf is the ensemble kalman smoother enks evensen and van leeuwen 2000 which can also be applied in highly nonlinear systems in a sequential way the main variation from the enkf is that it updates the state estimates based on the future observations in general the filter algorithms are more suitable when forecasting is the primary purpose while smoothers are more appropriate for process studies van leeuwen and evensen 1996 the es was introduced by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 is a monte carlo based kalman method that consists of a forecasting updating scheme where the system state is updated in a way that it minimizes the updated state s variance when there are known measurements of the state the es does not run in a sequential mode like enks and thus it is suitable for off line applications baù et al 2015 making it a suitable scheme for this effort the ensemble framework is used for the estimation of the error statistics let s define a f as the ensemble matrix which is holding a finite set of ensemble members the ensemble members ψ i are vectors of the forecasted model states with length n 4 a f ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ n ℜ n n the forecast error covariance matrix p e f is defined as 5 p e f a f a τ a f a τ t n 1 ℜ n n with the assumption that true mean of a τ is equal to a f for large enough ensemble members the p e f can be computed according to the following equation 6 p e f a f a f a f a f t n 1 a f a f t n 1 ℜ n n during the update step of the es the matrix a f is being corrected using m state measurements the kalman framework is allowing for incorporating uncertainty not only at the model but also in the measurements in this regard the observation vector d j where j 1 2 n can be expressed by two parts the true value vector d plus a random noise error vector ɛ 7 d j d ɛ j ℜ m similar to the forecast ensemble matrix the measurement vectors can be stored in a matrix 8 d d 1 d 2 d n ℜ m n and the ensemble of error vectors in the e matrix 9 e ɛ 1 ɛ 2 ɛ n ℜ m n the error vector ɛ is assumed to be a random process following a gaussian distribution with mean equal to zero thus the covariance matrix r e is equal to 10 r e e e t n 1 ℜ m m the following equation is the update step of the es scheme and it allows to update the estimate of the state of the system when observations are available 11 a u a f k d h a f ℜ n n where h ℜ m n is a binary matrix that maps the locations of the measurements in such way that the rows symbolize the number of the measurement and the columns the time step that was observed more specifically if the second measurement is representing the state of the system for t 10 then its location in the h matrix will be h 2 10 12 k p e f h t hp e f h t r e 1 ℜ n m lastly k is the kalman gain matrix where the formulation is responsible for minimizing the variance error while yielding the best linear unbiased estimator additionally the kalman gain matrix is incorporating both measurement and model covariance matrices r e and p e f into its calculation signifying that the correction applied to a f is related to the entrenched uncertainties in these two matrices baù et al 2015 the main disadvantage of the es is its suboptimal performance for nonlinear systems crestani et al 2013 grønnevik and evensen 2001 van leeuwen and evensen 1996 2 3 framework for filling missing groundwater level measurements in the kf literature there are also articles that deal with the problem of filling missing data alavi et al 2006 bennis et al 1997 bierkens et al 1999 gove and hollinger 2006 jarvis et al 2004 moreover scholars have proposed methods that combine stochastic time series models of groundwater head with the kf however they have focused mainly on applications of the inverse problem knotters and bierkens 2000 used the methodology in bierkens et al 1999 in order to predict the effect of interventions on groundwater dynamics on a daily time step the use of kf for parameter estimation for transfer function noise was the scope of berendrecht et al 2003 and yi et al 2004 bierkens et al 2001 combined the same framework with auxiliary information e g digital elevation model soil maps etc for calibrating a daily regional arx model with the groundwater estimated states which is to be used in applications of optimal prediction network optimization and conditional simulation at an earlier study an empirical kf algorithm incorporating a regional sarima model constructed based on monthly groundwater level data from 21 wells was evaluated for state estimation graham and tankersley 1993 a scheme for regional spatiotemporal groundwater head prediction that a simple kf and a global optimization algorithm were used for calibrating at known points transfer function noise models with excess precipitation as exogenous input and afterwards the regionalization of the model parameters for ungauged locations via clustering was evaluated by yuan et al 2008 varouchakis 2017 used an arx model and the kalman filter adaptation algorithm to predict mean and biannual groundwater levels the proposed framework is intending to introduce a viable method for groundwater level gap filling by utilizing in situ measurements and auxiliary information from a regional groundwater model in an efficient scheme with low computational cost a similar framework is neither in place nor the es has been evaluated for a similar task oikonomou et al 2015a the framework s architecture is illustrated in fig 1 the main components are 1 extracted information groundwater table levels recharge and pumping rates from a regional groundwater flow model 2 stochastic modeling of the model s output through sarimax with the exogenous inputs being recharge and pumping rates 3 the es algorithm and 4 the observation data for each location of interest the first two building blocks of the framework constitute the data from groundwater model and the measurements the simulated level time series for the well locations of interest are extracted from the model additionally the time series representing the average recharge and pumping rates for areas with different radii around each well location of interest are retrieved those different recharge and pumping averages are used to build different sarimax models during the stochastic modeling step and choose the most appropriate one the proposed scheme does not require the groundwater sampling frequency to be consistent across the observation record the only two logical constraints are to aggregate measurement data to the time step of the groundwater model in cases where the sampling frequency is higher and to fall within the period of the aquifer simulation the next main component of the framework is the construction of a groundwater stochastic model representative of the process indicated by the simulated level time series each groundwater level time series are modeled by a site specific seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average sarimax process with exogenous inputs of recharge and pumping using the statistical computing programming language r r core team 2016 the exogenous inputs were included in the stochastic model in order to give physical meaning to it the recharge and pumping time series with all the different radii are tested during the sarimax construction process to select the model that has the best fit for each location the construction of a sarimax model consists of an iterative process of three steps that include stationarity and seasonality testing and model identification the parameter estimation and diagnostic checking box and jenkins 1976 hipel and mcleod 1994 the order of integration d in the sarimax models was identified through visual identification of the autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf and appropriate statistical tests which are considered two supplementary approaches the augmented dickey fuller adf test is detecting the presence of unit root in the time series additionally the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test was utilized which complements the adf unit root test since it has low power against near unit root alternatives karlsson and löthgren 2000 seasonality as well model selection can be identified through the acf and pacf graphs the sarimax construction except from the above approaches involved also the use of the forecast package in r in order to identify the model automatically to do parameter selection and to run diagnostics of the sarimax models hyndman 2016 hyndman and khandakar 2008 the sarimax model parameter estimation was done by using maximum likelihood estimation the t test was utilized to measure statistical significance of each model parameter in order to exclude spurious terms the overall fit of model parameters with the same integration order was evaluated by the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the exogenous variables recharge and pumping are assumed to follow for each month a gaussian distribution synthetic exogenous variables are generated based on the original first order statistic of each month and with variances that are a bit larger than those computed a slightly larger variance than the computed one was introduced as to increase indirectly the ensemble uncertainty in cases where the groundwater flow model was not approximating the behavior of the measured well levels the optimal sarimax model with the exogenous synthetic time series are used to produce the ensemble of time series needed for the es algorithm at the final step the es is employed to impute the gaps in the time series by taking into account also the information provided by the groundwater level observations summarizing the proposed framework s scheme was designed keeping in mind key characteristics such as to have low computational cost since it is not dependent on the groundwater model for the generating the forecast ensemble for each evaluation point ease of implementation the ability to incorporate information from readily available groundwater models irrespective of the coarse scale of application and to have transferability in any alluvial aquifer regardless of local conditions 2 4 materials and numerical experiments 2 4 1 application area available model and data the area selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed computationally low cost groundwater data filling framework is the alluvial aquifer of south platte river the south platte river basin in northeast colorado has a drainage area of about 49 000 km2 dennehy et al 1993 and it is characterized by a semi arid climate with a high dependence on melting snow the south platte river basin on the eastern plains has undergone a huge transformation due to land reclamation agricultural development and population increase it is the most populated region of colorado since approximately 70 of state s population more than 3 700 000 is living in this particular area colorado department of local affairs 2016 the south platte is an over appropriated basin that has multiple water needs and apart from the domestic sector it has to satisfy a large agricultural demand in 2010 the estimated irrigated parcel area in the basin was 3426 km2 846 634 acres colorado decision support systems 2016 industrial activities are also present in the basin including water demand for unconventional oil and gas development oikonomou et al 2016 oikonomou et al 2015b oikonomou et al 2015c groundwater plays a substantial role in meeting these water needs particularly in the agricultural sector the physical conditions anthropogenic stresses and interventions along with the water legislative environment governing the south platte basin are adding to water system s complexity this complexity is also reflected by the different water management approaches over the time to bring groundwater into the prior appropriation system so as not to harm senior surface water rights waskom 2013 the 2002 2003 drought in colorado was a catalyst for implementing a stricter water administration requiring full augmentation for system depletions caused by pumping tributary groundwater one effect of this water management shift was the curtailment in 2007 of about 5 000 wells that lacked an approved augmentation plan waskom 2013 at the same time in certain areas of the basin were reported incidents of adversely impacted properties by high groundwater levels waskom and oikonomou 2014 forcing the state of colorado to act in this emergency colorado general assembly 2015a the state of colorado has requested research projects colorado general assembly 2012 2015b 2015c that would assist the administrative authorities to have a better understanding of surface groundwater interactions and thus to implement a basin wide efficient equitable and integrated water resources planning and management through the colorado decision support systems cdss initiative www cdss state co us a physically based groundwater flow model was built and tested by cdm smith for the south platte alluvium spdss modflow the model was developed in modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 with a monthly time step from january 1950 to december 2006 cdm smith 2013 the spdss modflow is covering approximately 6475 km2 2 500 mi2 and the aquifer is represented as a single layer having a uniform grid of 304 8 m 1000 ft which results to 555 440 cells cdm smith 2013 it was built for regional scale analysis focusing on aquifer stream interactions and thus it is not able to simulate accurately local groundwater level variations in the south platte there are few dedicated monitoring wells with continuous data loggers spanning from 2003 or 2004 until the present but the majority are irrigation wells that are measured biannually fall and spring the water table generally follows a cyclic pattern with highest observations occurring during the fall period following the irrigation season and the lowest in the spring some of the observation wells have a longer water level record going back to the 1930s and 1940s of course there are several years that the irrigation wells have no available groundwater level measurements in both intermittent and continuous fashion this is indicative that throughout the years there were periods that groundwater monitoring programs were not consistent for the purposes of this paper five south platte alluvium wells fig 2 are presented which had the longest available and the most consistent observation record these wells are monitored by the colorado division of water resources dwr and the central colorado water conservancy district ccwcd apart from the aforementioned reasons the selection was also based on representing different sections of the alluvium proximity to the stream and the well level behavior the groundwater head observations are publicly available through the state s water database called hydrobase http water state co us datamaps pages default aspx along with several metadata for each well such as its position owner s name permit number adjudicated uses and others the monthly simulated head at each well s location the mean recharge and total pumping within different radii were extracted from the spdss modflow a sarimax model for each well was used to model the groundwater head since all wells exhibited a 12 month cycle the simulated monthly water table for the five selected wells are shown in fig 3 along with the recorded actual measurements on a local scale the spdss modflow can represent a general indication of groundwater behavior seasonality without being able to simulate accurately the water table level at well 01n5531dcd that is located at the beginning of the alluvium of the beaver creek tributary of the south platte the model fails to simulate the actual general behavior of the water table at that location at the same time it captures the seasonal variability rather well small head fluctuation from fall to spring season for well 04n6422dcd located at the box elder creek tributary the spdss modflow is not able to approximate the local water table trend as well however at the same time it is capturing the magnitude of seasonal variability for the other three wells the groundwater regional model at these points is representing more appropriately the water table it should be underlined that since the groundwater head measurements are taken biannually it is assumed that those observations are representative of the true mean head for the months the measurements took place all of the tested wells are used for agricultural purposes this increases the probability of some outliers to be present in the time series since measurements may be taken after groundwater was pumped evaluating the performance of the proposed framework for filling gaps in groundwater head time series in a complex hydrologic system with multiple stresses and governed under a strict scheme can serve as an excellent proof of its robustness the south platte basin below denver and its aquifer fulfill all of the criteria making it an ideal study area 2 4 2 design and assumptions of numerical experiments the observed groundwater head over time is the only available measure of evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology the performance of the proposed methodology for filling data gaps in groundwater time series has been evaluated by three numerical experiments table 1 shows each of these experiments and their objective the first numerical experiment is assuming that all known water table measurements are available for updating the es except one the es algorithm is run iteratively treating initially as unknown the first known measurement the second iteration will treat the second known value as unknown and so forth each of the predictions are compared with the known measured value the average prediction performance is described by calculating dimensioned statistics in this case in meters namely the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae 13 rmse n 1 i 1 n e i 2 1 2 14 mae n 1 i 1 n e i where e i y i y i yi is the observed value y i the estimated value and n the sample number of observations the use of rmse though can be misleading many times due to the fact that the larger the squared error variance is the larger is the rmse value eq 13 the mae eq 14 has been suggested by willmott and matsuura 2005 as a more natural measure of average model performance error in this study both rmse and mae are presented since they represent the common measures of average prediction performance however in the results section the focus is mae at the second numerical experiment five random measurements are treated as unknowns while the rmse and mae are calculated and stored this experiment was selected in order to test the performance of the method to simulate the case of intermittent gaps present in the groundwater head time series the numerical experiment is repeated for each well with each iteration having a new random set of five values and each predicted value is compared with the respective known measurement the experiment continues until there is convergence on the mean and the standard deviation of the sample rmse convergence was assumed when there was no improvement more than 0 1 of both moments for the past 1000 runs the density histograms of rmse and mae were calculated and plotted because the number of iterations for each well could vary the density property was expressed in percentages and the entire histogram equals one the last numerical experiment is constructed to simulate the case of continuous missing values in the groundwater level a contiguous five year window is selected randomly and the observations within the window are treated as unknowns the es algorithm is employed to calculate the rmse and the mae of each iteration similar to the second numerical experiment each iteration has a new random five year window which their predictions are compared to the respective measurements the numerical experiment for each well is completed with the same convergence assumptions as in the previous numerical experiment as presented in the methodology section the modeled groundwater head at the well locations was modeled with a sarimax model different time series of the exogenous predictor variables recharge and pumping representing different radii of exogenous influence were tested in order to represent the stochastic physical process more accurately for consistency reasons the set of radii selected to be tested for each well location was 914 m 3 000 ft 1829 m 6000 ft 3048 m 10 000 ft and 4877 m 16 000 ft the radii originating from each well location that intersected the river were not taken into account for testing the effect of the exogenous variables in the sarimax fitting table 2 shows the best fitted sarimax models of each radius of influence and their corresponding aic in some cases the model approximation for pumping was not statistically significant in order to be included in the models parameters the autocorrelation function acf of the residuals of the sarimax models fig 4 is evidence of good fit box and jenkins 1976 box and pierce 1970 considering that the regional groundwater model is lacking the accuracy for local variations the autocorrelation plots show that only few autocorrelations are outside the 95 confidence interval around zero this could be attributed to the unconfined aquifer s nonlinear dynamics as the simulation with the arima family of models assumes global linearity the ensemble matrix a accounting for model uncertainty characterization is populated with 500 time series members generated from the best sarimax model for each well location recharge and pumping data extracted from spdss modflow are assumed to follow a gaussian distribution on a monthly basis since kalman approaches perform best with gaussian distributions the synthetic exogenous time series used as inputs to sarimax have the same monthly mean with an increased monthly standard deviation to account for model errors the ensemble matrix for every well generated by the best fitted sarimax was kept the same during all three numerical experiments for consistency reasons furthermore the statistics of the measurement errors in most practical applications are unknown so in order to incorporate the measurement uncertainty the measurement error covariance matrix r e was constructed assuming the errors follow a gaussian distribution for the same reason mentioned above with a mean zero and variance of 10 16 cm2 1 3 ft2 this assumption was introduced to represent the possible human error during a groundwater head measurement the incorporation of a larger error could also relax more the assumption that a single water table observation within a month is representative for the average groundwater level for that specific month 2 5 results and discussion 2 5 1 filling single missing observation sporadic gaps in groundwater level time series is a common phenomenon for groundwater aquifers that are highly dynamic the infilling of such missing points could be a very challenging task considering anthropogenic interventions and natural hydrology especially in cases with low sampling frequency biannual the purpose of this experiment is to investigate the performance of the suggested framework when one missing value is to be filled the numerical experiment was performed in an iterative fashion for all known points of each of the five selected wells presented in 2 4 1 each time only a single measurement was treated as unknown the scatter plots of the measured versus the predicted value shown in fig 5 are summarizing all performed runs for each well each point in the graphs in fig 5 represents the individual error with its magnitude being the perpendicular distance from the diagonal line in all scatter plots the data points are clustered around the diagonal indicating that the es algorithm has almost no bias furthermore the graphs show a homoscedastic behavior since in different water table levels of each well there is no difference in the variance of the prediction error in well 04n6422dcd however there is a consistent tendency of overestimation in the lower water table values this bias effect is most probably caused because the water table in the period of 1964 1970 is at the lowest point and after that it bounces back one key outcome of this numerical experiment was the inability of this methodology to predict piezometric heads when there were no similar measurements in temporal proximity the water table divergence from temporally adjacent observations could be outliers due to drought flood conditions since the south platte alluvial aquifer responds quickly to surface hydrologic variability the divergence could also be attributed to human errors during measurement or to measurements taken soon after the well was pumped low performance is expected when the sarimax model fitted on the groundwater levels simulated from the spdss modflow in the specific cell of the aquifer has no similar behavior a characteristic example of a satisfactory prediction of an observation value which is significantly different from its immediate temporal neighbors is the last known point of well 04n6506dab fig 3 despite the abrupt change of the water table the proposed methodology managed to give a rather precise estimate this is because the physical groundwater model of the well 04n6506dab is able to represent the groundwater upward trend after 2001 and this information is transferred to the sarimax model similarly at temporal points where a change in the water table is taking place and there are no intermediate observations in between the predicted value is frequently not accurate despite the fact that the es update step is assimilating all available measurements adjusting the average updated ensemble to follow an abrupt change is not possible when there are no relevant data points and when the sarimax model is not representing this change more specifically the highest water level observed at well 04n5931cb exhibits a large prediction error 3 m since there is no observation to inform the update scheme of the es for this change this specific example underscores the importance of having key measurements depicting accurately the response of the water table in time in order to guide the algorithm to acceptable predictions the prediction of an observed missing point in general is giving satisfactory results as the mae is low in all tested wells and not only the presented ones the overall estimation via the es algorithm was closer to the observed value than filling the missing points with the average water table value the rmse and mae values for each well are shown on the top right of each scatter plot of fig 5 all wells except 04n5931cb have mae less than 0 3 m it is worth reiterating that the suggested algorithm was tested on wells measured on a biannual step which had significant data gaps ensuring a realistic test on the suggested methodology the temporal scarcity of observation points in the tested wells in combination with the use of a regional groundwater model which in many cases is unable to approximate the groundwater fluctuations are impediments of having even better results 2 5 2 filling multiple missing observations the second numerical experiment is more challenging than the previous one since five random observations are treated as unknown the motivation behind the design of this experiment was to represent cases where few gaps exist in the record such gaps could be the result either of man made cause e g lack of funds or natural e g floods and may significantly affect further analysis in order for the random sample sets to be representative and have unbiased results the experiment was bootstrapped the iterations needed for the mean and standard deviation of rmse to converge for each well are not the same table 3 and thus frequency histograms are not an appropriate representation the probability distribution of two prediction error metrics rmse and mae of the results for each well is presented by density histograms in fig 6 for ease of representation the density is expressed in percentage the histograms appear to be roughly symmetric or slightly right skewed the distribution of all wells is unimodal with the only exception of the rmse histogram of well 04n5931cb the bimodal distribution can be attributed to the increased weight rmse is giving to larger errors since the random sample of unknown observations could contain values from the cluster of points between 1966 1968 that diverge from well s general trend see fig 3 the proposed methodology has a very satisfactory performance the mae for the selected wells is small less than 0 3 m similar to the first experiment well 04n5931cb has a larger sample mae median compared to other wells just below 0 4 m this is considered to be a reasonable well prediction since its outliers and non stationary behavior are challenging factors for accurate prediction the maximum mae recorded in these numerical experiments is significant however it should be kept in mind that the wells tested have low measurement frequency biannual and significant data gaps 2 5 3 filling missing continuous gaps the third numerical experiment is the most challenging of all numerical experiments since in a five year window the available information of the piezometric level is treated as unknown long periods could enclose prolonged drought occurrences and miss critical data points at the update phase of the es resulting to a poor water level prediction having the ability to reconstruct aquifer s behavior in several key sites and for critical periods such as drought events even if some acceptable error is introduced with the infilling could have significant value to water managers and could be compared with similar events such information becomes even more important when the subject aquifer is an unconfined alluvial formation where the water table is responding to surface hydrology similar to the previous numerical experiment the iterative process of treating observations within a five year period as unknown was terminated when there was convergence in the first two moments of the sample rmse table 4 presents the number of iterations needed for each well in order the current numerical experiment to be completed furthermore the prediction performance is presented in an analogous way to the second numerical experiment fig 7 shows the density histograms of the rmse and mae for all selected random samples it is clear from the presented histograms that the symmetry on both error metrics is lost with right skewness and large spread and bi multi modality are the key characteristics of the produced error distributions only well 10n4902cbc is escaping the aforementioned characteristics with the prediction performance very close to recorded values more than 70 of times the missing observations are filled with error of 0 2 m or less this high prediction performance can be attributed to the water table behavior throughout the whole observation period in all other wells the calculated errors of the randomly selected samples are performing adequately considering the large gap attempted to be filled for wells 01n5531dcd and 04n6506dab in about 40 and 50 of the times respectively the mae is less than 0 3 m wells 04n5931cb and 04n6422dcd in more than 30 of the times the mae is less than 0 4 m and 0 5 m respectively due to the gaps existing in the tested time series especially in wells 04n6422dcd and 04n6506dab there were incidents that the randomly selected five year windows contained only a few observations the errors from those samples being outliers of the general error behavior can be traced in rmse histograms as the rectangles erecting from low error bins high error outliers are occurring when the observations under prediction are including possible outliers or these values are too different from the rest of the recorded measurements in the same location example of this is the large mae values 3 5 m recorded for well 04n5931cb and stretches the importance of the existing measurements for the under prediction time interval overall the tested framework should be used with caution particularly in cases where continuous data gaps are attempted to be filled but the motivation of this numerical experiment was simulate cases where there is a need to have a representation of the aquifer s behavior 2 6 conclusions groundwater level data is the building block of data driven analysis and modeling groundwater head observations often have missing observations and suffer from inconsistent measurement frequency in the current effort a novel framework for filling gaps in groundwater head time series was proposed it attempts to enhance groundwater head time series by utilizing information of all available sources direct known measurements and auxiliary groundwater flow model information through an efficient scheme with low computational cost the framework employs an exogenous seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarimax stochastic model to describe the groundwater level fluctuation process and the es for predicting the water table level the methodology was implemented in south platte river basin which has complex hydrology due to its dependence on snowmelt furthermore there is a strict water management framework with significant manmade modification of natural hydrology the case study of south platte is characterized by well kept public water records the application of the proposed methodology in such a complex water system adds value to numerical experiments since it indicates the transferability of the framework to other areas even with less available data if a groundwater flow model exists for the area of interest then the only measured data needed for the framework s application are groundwater levels recharge and pumping data are extracted from the groundwater model directly the use of the regional groundwater model supports the claim that even if data are not perfect the presented methodology has satisfactory performance with the introduced error be small three numerical experiments were designed to evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed framework for 18 well locations with biannual measurements for brevity a representative subset of five wells is presented and discussed the scope of the first numerical experiment was to test the performance of the methodology when a single measurement is missing the performance of all wells was very satisfactory with average mae of all five wells to be 0 28 m the algorithm encountered difficulty in predicting a sudden change in water table measurement record when there were no similar measurements in temporal proximity furthermore the prediction error increased when the model was not approximating the general tendency or the seasonality of the measured values the design of the second numerical experiment assessed the cases where multiple observations were missing in a random fashion for this reason an iterative process was adopted in every run a new set of five randomly chosen observations were treated us unknowns the experiment in each well was concluded only when there was convergence on the first two moments of the sample rmse the results of all wells are also very satisfactory with similar error metrics as in the first experiment the third numerical experiment was the least successful of the three and the most challenging one since a random five year window was selected and the observations that lied within were treated as unknowns the iterative process was terminated following the same convergence criterion as in the second numerical experiment the importance of measured points to guide the updated step of the ensemble smoother es is signified in this experiment in addition it should be noted that missing data in sequential fashion does not reveal the possible occurrence of extended droughts and could lead to overestimation of the groundwater table the framework could serve as a valuable tool for enhancing groundwater time series for both intermittent missing data and of continuous gaps with short span as it was demonstrated in this effort overcoming existing data limitations with methodologies that augment the available water system information could contribute to improving the quality of input data for data driven analysis but also groundwater flow models this could provide further insight about alluvium aquifer dynamics and improve water management through efficient conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources supplementary materials supplementary material associated with

784,dispersion and mixing of fluids during miscible displacement in porous media are known to be strongly affected by heterogeneity and viscous fingering in this study direct pore level numerical simulations are employed to model flow and solute transport during both stable and unstable miscible displacements in two dimensional packings of circular grains longitudinal dispersion coefficients are then computed by fitting the numerically obtained concentration profiles to the analytical solution of the convection dispersion equation we observed that diffusive mixed diffusive advective and mechanical dispersion regimes are present during stable displacements whereas the middle diffusive advective regime is absent in unstable displacements due to the evolution of viscous fingers viscous fingering also increases the longitudinal dispersion coefficient several orders of magnitude compared to the stable displacement the results reveal that the scale dependency of longitudinal dispersion is a function of layering direction and viscosity contrast during stable displacement in porous domains with no layering or with the layering perpendicular to the displacement direction the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases along the length of flow until it reaches an asymptotic value when layering is in the direction of displacement however the scale dependency behavior is a function of the layering pattern in unstable displacements however longitudinal dispersion always exhibits an asymptotic behavior finally it is observed that the effect of heterogeneity and layering on the magnitude of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient diminishes as viscosity ratio increases to higher adverse values keywords longitudinal dispersion scale dependency viscous fingering

at macroscale 1 introduction the dynamics of mixing and transport of solute in porous media is the major focus of subsurface transport studies in groundwater hydrology and miscible recovery of hydrocarbon reservoirs mixing and dispersion in pore space is the combined result of molecular diffusion and convective spreading molecular diffusion is the transport of solute particles due to a concentration gradient whereas convective spreading arises from the fluctuations of velocity field inside the porous media these variations in the velocity magnitude and direction cause the solute particles to travel different paths with different velocities within a porous medium thus generating concentration contrasts this mechanism increases the size of the concentration front and provides a large surface area for molecular diffusion it is the enhanced mass transfer by molecular diffusion across this enlarged concentration front that makes convective spreading irreversible and contributes to the true mixing dentz and le borgne 2011 if there is no molecular diffusion convective spreading is a reversible phenomenon and only leads to apparent mixing jha et al 2009 the process of mixing that occurs during solute transport in pore scale is usually described as hydrodynamic dispersion in macroscale and can be quantified by dispersion coefficient dispersion coefficient k is a tensor quantity that measures the degree of mixing which originates from both diffusion and convective spreading experimental measurements of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient kl the diagonal component of k along the general direction of flow are usually carried out using breakthrough experiments correa et al 1990 jiao and hötzl 2004 arya et al 1988 bretz et al 1988 nmr spectroscopy seymour and callaghan 1997 stapf and packer 1998 lebon et al 1997 and particle tracking velocimetry moroni and cushman 2001 an alternative approach is to numerically calculate kl using digital core analysis digital core analysis enables us to describe the detailed properties of a porous medium at the pore scale micro nano scale and calculate kl at the macroscale it can be achieved by the numerical simulation of flow and transport in a pore scale digital representation of a porous medium several authors have used different methods to simulate dispersion in various types of porous media for instance some authors yao et al 1997 rolle and kitanidis 2014 mostaghimi et al 2012 bijeljic et al 2011 maier et al 2000 maier et al 2003 salles et al 1993 sallès et al 1993 coelho et al 1997 have used stochastically reconstructed models to represent porous media during dispersion simulation while others bijeljic et al 2004 bruderer and bernabé 2001 bruderer weng et al 2004 makse et al 2000 koplik et al 1988 de arcangelis l et al 1986 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 solved the flow and transport equations in the extracted equivalent pore networks of porous media dispersion coefficient magnitude during solute transport in porous media strongly depends on the mechanisms that augment convective spreading and enhance diffusion this includes viscous fingering and the variations of the velocity field due to the medium s structural heterogeneity nicolaides et al 2015 when there is an adverse viscosity ratio hydrodynamic instabilities will develop at the concentration front the resulting viscous fingers increase the size of concentration front and generate sharp concentration gradients due to the stretching steepening and tip splitting mechanisms tan and homsy 1988 both experimental jiao and hötzl 2004 brigham et al 1961 and darcy scale numerical connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 studies have shown that the additional mixing caused by the enhanced molecular diffusion at this perturbed concentration front results in a larger dispersion coefficient some authors jha et al 2013 jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b however argued that at high adverse viscosity ratios flow focusing across the flow domain due to the channeling of less viscous fluid slows down the creation of additional interface by tip splitting and hinders mixing in heterogeneous porous media the presence of microscale i e nonuniform distribution of shape and size of pores and throats and macroscale i e layering heterogeneity creates some preferred paths for flow inside the media and gives rise to a nonuniform velocity distribution it makes the leading edge of the concentration front disordered and introduces additional mixing previous laboratory measurements and numerical studies have demonstrated that an increase in the variance of pore size distribution bretz et al 1988 complexity of the pore structure brigham et al 1961 dykstra parsons coefficient of permeability fields arya et al 1988 connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 adepoju et al 2013 permeability variance john et al 2010 and longitudinal correlation length of permeability arya et al 1988 johns and garmeh 2010 john et al 2010 leads to higher dispersion coefficients at pore scale higher dispersion coefficients have been observed when medium heterogeneity becomes more complex from sandstones to carbonates bijeljic et al 2011 or the variance bruderer and bernabé 2001 bruderer weng et al 2004 and correlation length bruderer weng et al 2004 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 of pore network models increase an important characteristic of dispersion is the scale dependency along the flow length i e variation of kl along the porous medium length due to the presence of the solid phase the velocity field variations in the medium are significant and cause the concentration front to grow as the solute particles travel hence a larger surface area is available for the molecular diffusion of solute which increases the dispersion until the solute particles have traveled enough distance or time to completely sample the velocity field experimental measurements arya et al 1988 moroni and cushman 2001 as well as darcy scale connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 adepoju et al 2013 john et al 2010 mahadevan et al 2003 and pore scale bijeljic et al 2011 maier et al 2000 maier et al 2003 bijeljic et al 2004 bruderer and bernabé 2001 bruderer weng et al 2004 garmeh et al 2009 zhu and fox 2002 numerical simulations at the unit viscosity ratio i e stable flow have shown that kl increases with the displacement time or the distance traveled by solute particles until asymptotic dispersion is established at the pore level this asymptotic length scale is shown to be about five to six pore diameters for random bead packs moroni and cushman 2001 about seven grain diameters for unconfined sphere packings maier et al 2003 and hundreds of pores for consolidated media bijeljic et al 2004 at the darcy scale however due to the presence of large scale heterogeneities such as permeability layering the asymptotic length for dispersion is much higher in order of a few to hundreds of meters john et al 2010 mahadevan et al 2003 for layered permeability fields lake and hirasaki 1981 it was observed that if the ratio of the longitudinal travel time of solute particles owing to advection to their transverse travel time due to dispersion is smaller than 0 2 longitudinal dispersion coefficient never reaches its asymptotic value in the presence of viscous fingering numerical simulations of dispersion during darcy flow jha et al 2013 jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b have revealed that there is an interplay between channeling and viscous fingering as the transport of solute proceeds at early times a higher rate of mixing was observed due to the additional surface area created by fingering at later times during the flow at high adverse viscosity ratios however channeling dominates the flow and slows down the creation of the additional interface area thus making the mixing less efficient jha et al 2013 jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b despite the extensive research on mixing and dispersion in porous media there are a few studies on the combined effect of medium heterogeneity and viscous fingering on the values of kl and its scale dependency most of the previous studies focus on the scale dependency of dispersion during stable flow unit viscosity ratio and the others that account for viscous fingering nicolaides et al 2015 connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 jha et al 2013 jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b are focused on the modeling of dispersion at darcy scale which neglects the variability of heterogeneity in scales smaller than the size of the continuum gridblocks in this study we model dispersion in pore scale by solving the point equations of flow and transport in 2 dimensional pore scale models of granular porous media with different levels of heterogeneity and layering numerical simulations at different peclet numbers are carried out to investigate the effect of heterogeneity and layering on the scale dependency of kl during both unit and adverse viscosity ratio flows in what follows we first present the governing equations the physical models of the porous media the numerical approaches and the calculation procedure of kl in section two results of the dispersion simulation at both stable and unstable flows are discussed in section three finally we summarize the main conclusions of the present study in section four 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations we consider the flow of two miscible fluids with the same density ρ and different viscosities μ 1 and μ 2 μ 1 μ 2 corresponding to the displaced and displacing fluids respectively it is assumed that the fluids are first contact miscible and incompressible also we assume that the molecular diffusion coefficient d between the solutions is constant and isotropic we solve the following continuity navier stokes and advection diffusion equations simultaneously to model the dynamics of solute dispersion in pore scale granular porous media 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u p μ u 3 c t u c d c in the above equations u is the pore velocity vector p is the pressure ρ and μ are the mixture density and viscosity respectively and c denotes the concentration of solute we adopt a quarter power mixing rule to express the mixture viscosity as 4 μ c μ 1 1 4 c c 0 c inj c 0 μ 2 1 4 μ 1 1 4 4 where c inj denotes the solute concentration in the injected solution and c 0 is the initial concentration in the media which is considered to be zero in our simulations we express the equations in dimensionless form using d v d v μ 2 and v μ 2 d as the characteristic length velocity time viscosity and pressure to make the governing equations dimensionless here d is the average grain diameter of the granular porous media see fig 1 and v is the intrinsic velocity in

this study we represent the pore scale porous media as 2 dimensional packings of circular grains resembling unconsolidated granular media fig 1 the dimensions of the domains are l d and w d l d w d l w d the pore scale domains are generated using a swelling grain reconstruction algorithm with variable grain diameters d d d d taken from two different particle size distributions psd taheri et al 2017 roberts and schwartz 1985 the psds define the relative number of grains with a specific diameter in a domain fig 2 the microscale heterogeneity of the medium is characterized by the standard deviation s d d of the psds the macroscale heterogeneity is introduced in the domains as layering in the both parallel and perpendicular directions to the main flow the layering of the domains is achieved by constructing the patterns using both psds in different orders in total eight pore scale domains are generated using this approach and depicted in fig 3 pm1 and pm2 are single layer domains constructed based on psd1 and psd2 respectively pm3 pm4 and pm5 are layered domains with the layering parallel to the direction of flow pm3 is a two layer domain while pm4 and pm5 have three layers pm6 has two layers perpendicular to the direction of flow and pm7 and pm8 are three layered domains with the layering perpendicular to the direction of flow all of these domains have l d 90 and w d 30 resulting in an aspect ratio of 3 0 a l d w d 2 3 numerical method we use the commercial code comsol comsol multiphysics user s guide 2015 to solve the governing equations through a fully implicit finite element scheme the solution domain is discretized as a triangular mesh consisting of hundreds of thousands of elements such that each pore is covered with several grid elements significantly smaller than the pore size see the appendix then the initial and boundary conditions are set as illustrated in fig 4 the inlet condition left side boundary in the x direction for flow is constant injection velocity while the outlet right side boundary in the x direction is constant atmospheric pressure p 0 d we impose the danckwerts boundary conditions for mass transfer which implies the constant concentration inflow at the inlet and zero concentration gradient at the outlet in the y direction no slip and no flux boundary conditions are assumed for flow and transport respectively the perimeter of each grain is covered with the edges of the adjacent triangular mesh elements where boundary conditions for flow and transport are no slip and no flux respectively 2 4 calculation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient taylor 1953 1954 and later aris 1956 studied the transport of a passive solute in a single capillary tube and mathematically showed that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient scales with the peclet number as kl d 1 κpe 2 where pe uma d and um is the mean velocity a is the characteristic length radius and half of the side length for circular and square cross sections respectively and κ is the shape factor of the cross section 1 48 and 1 30 4 2 6 bruderer and bernabé 2001 for circular and square cross sections respectively for a real porous medium the nature of transport deviates from the taylor aris dispersion kl d pe 2 due to the inhomogeneity of medium and exhibits a different functionality as sahimi 1993 11 k l d 1 f ϕ β p e λ where the power law exponent λ 1 λ 2 brigham et al 1961 is confined to the limiting taylor aris λ 2 and mechanical dispersion λ 1 regimes bruderer and bernabé 2001 β is the mixing coefficient brigham et al 1961 and f and φ are formation resistivity factor and porosity respectively based on this functionality three different regimes for solute transport during stable flow are defined as diffusion dominated advection dominated and mixed diffusion advection babaei and joekar niasar 2016 for very low peclet numbers pe 0 1 bijeljic et al 2004 0 3 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 or 5 sahimi 1993 dispersion due to the convective spreading is insignificant and the transport regime is basically diffusion dominated and kl d 1 fφ sahimi 1993 where f and φ are formation resistivity factor and porosity respectively when peclet number is large pe 300 sahimi 1993 convective spreading is the dominant transport mechanism and the mechanical dispersion regime kl d pe holds for the intermediate values of pe both diffusion and advection actively contribute to the transport and the power law functionality kl d pe λ describes the dispersion regime in the numerical simulation of dispersion in porous media the values of kl can be computed by using the method of moments salles et al 1993 sallès et al 1993 coelho et al 1997 brenner 1980 random walk particle tracking approaches jha et al 2009 mostaghimi et al 2012 bijeljic et al 2011 maier et al 2000 maier et al 2003 salles et al 1993 bijeljic et al 2004 bruderer and bernabé 2001 bruderer weng et al 2004 john et al 2010 or fitting the concentration histories to the analytical solution of the governing advection dispersion equation ade arya et al 1988 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 mahadevan et al 2003 garmeh et al 2009 here we utilize the third approach and calculate kl by fitting the concentration histories to the analytical solution of the following 1d ade at macroscale 12 c t v c x k l 2 c x 2 this equation describes the up scaled macroscale longitudinal dispersion resulting from microscale diffusion and convective spreading at macroscale we use l length of the domain v and l v as the characteristic length velocity and time respectively to make the ade dimensionless 13 c d t d c d x d 1 p e 2 c d x d 2 where the subscript d indicates the dimensionless variables at macroscale and pe is the macroscale peclet number expressed as pe vl kl similar initial and boundary conditions as for the microscale advection diffusion equation are imposed in macroscale 14 c d x d 0 0 c d 0 t d 1 c d x d 1 t d 0 the solution of this equation in the laplace domain is 15 c d x d s s 1 ξ ξ e ξ ξ 1 e x d ξ s 1 ξ ξ e ξ ξ 1 e x d ξ where c d is the dimensionless concentration in the laplace domain s is the argument of the laplace transform and 16 ξ 1 2 p e p e 2 4 s p e in order to find the time domain solution we use the fourier series method for numerical laplace inversion of eq 15 dubner and abate 1968 17 c d x d t d e α t d t d 1 2 c d x d α real k 1 n 1 k c d x d α k π t d i where i is the imaginary unit and α and n are the parameters that control the accuracy of the numerical inversion for α the range of 4 α t d 5 are proposed lee et al 1984 while the value of n should be large enough to make sure that desired convergency is achieved throughout this study the values of α t d 4 5 and n 5000 are used to perform the laplace inversion the procedure of computing kl is as follows 1 firstly the velocity field u d x d y d t d and the spatiotemporal concentration profile c d x d y d t d are obtained by solving the eqs 5 8 in r 2 2 at each x d the velocity averaged concentration values are calculated as 18 c d x d t d u d x d y d t d c d x d y d t d d y d u d x d y d t d d y d a where u d is the x component along the general direction of flow of u d and c d is the transversely averaged concentration 3 the 1d concentration profile is then written in terms of macroscale variables as c d x d t d c d x d t d where x d x d l d and t d t d l d 4 at different values of x d along the length of the domain 0 x d 1 starting with an initial guess for pe c d t d is calculated using eqs 15 17 and then matched to the numerically obtained c d t d curve at the same x d to find the value of pe that results in the best fit 5 finally the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is computed at each x d as kl vl pe 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the numerical approach in order to validate the numerical approach we simulate hydrodynamic dispersion during flow between two parallel plates resembling a fracture and then calculate the asymptotic longitudinal dispersion coefficient analytically it has been shown that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for a fracture scales with peclet number as kl d 1 2 105 pe 2 berkowitz and zhou 1996 wang et al 2012 where pe umb d um is the mean velocity and b is the half fracture aperture fig 5 plots the variation of kl against pe 2 the slope of the graph is 0 0188 which is in an excellent agreement with the analytical value of 2 105 0 0190 3 2 dispersion at unit viscosity ratio r 0 when the viscosity ratio is unity there is no viscous fingering and therefore the flow and transport are solely dominated by dispersion and porous medium heterogeneity to explore the scale dependency of kl during stable flow a series of simulations are conducted to model longitudinal dispersion in the pore scale domains shown in fig 3 a wide range of peclet number is considered 0 01 pe 10000 and the results are illustrated in fig 6 as the plots of kl d x d at each value of pe at very low peclet numbers pe 0 1 longitudinal dispersion coefficient is almost constant along the length of domains and kl d 0 4 figs 6a and b in this range of pe diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism and kl d 1 fφ which results in f 10 for the formation resistivity factors of the pore scale domains φ 0 25 note that there is some scattering of the kl d values at small x d which is due to the lack of a good fitness of numerical results to the analytical solution this poor fitness is caused by the insufficient data points for the curve c d t d at the regions close to the inlet where c d rapidly reaches 1 when the concentration front has traveled some distance from the inlet the scattering vanishes and the plots follow a smooth trend afterwards as the peclet number increases to higher values pe 1 convective spreading advection contributes to the mixing and dispersion in two ways figs 6c h it affects both the magnitude and scale dependency of longitudinal dispersion coefficient as explained in the next subsections 3 2 1 magnitude of the longitudinal dispersion advection causes kl to increase as the peclet number increases from 1 to 10 000 at these peclet numbers the velocity field variations in the domain induced by the irregular topology of the pore space generate a distorted concentration front the intensity of this front perturbation grows with the peclet number as shown by the concentration isosurfaces in fig 7 consequently larger values of dispersion coefficient are recorded in figs 6c h for higher values of pe the magnitude of kl is also strongly dependent on both the microscale heterogeneity and layering of the porous media a comparison of the dispersion coefficient plots of fig 6 for pm1 and pm2 reveals that the domain with the higher standard deviation in the grain diameter pm2 exhibits larger kl at all pe 1 this can be further verified through the concentration isosurfaces as fig 8 depicts that the higher degree of microscale heterogeneity of pm2 compared to pm1 augments the perturbation of the concentration front to a greater extent and increases the frontal area over which molecular diffusion takes place therefore the concentration profile at a specific x d is more smeared during transport in pm2 compared to the one in pm1 and hence a higher dispersion coefficient is observed for pm2 fig 9 the effect of porous medium layering on the magnitude of kl is a function of the direction and configuration of the layers as one can observe the plots of dispersion coefficient at pe 10 figs 6d h demonstrate that layering along the general direction of flow here x direction significantly increases kl in the domains pm3 pm4 and pm5 on the other hand the layering perpendicular to the direction of flow has an insignificant impact on kl fig 9 contrasts the concentration profiles for pm1 pm2 pm4 and pm7 during transport at pe 10000 it can be seen that the concentration profile is more smeared for the case of pm4 compared to pm1 and pm2 which are single layer domains while the transport in domain pm7 exhibits a less smeared concentration front and a shift to the right when layering is in the direction of flow the concentration front in more heterogeneous layers denoted as psd2 in fig 3 travels faster and the front in less heterogeneous layers denoted as psd1 in fig 3 falls behind this forms an extended front crossflow region between the layers with different degrees of heterogeneity fig 10 the enhanced crossflow and molecular diffusion across these regions from psd2 layers toward psd1 layers improve mixing and result in more spread in the concentration profiles which eventually increases dispersion coefficient a closer look at the plots of fig 6 reveals that when layering is in the direction of flow as in pm3 pm4 and pm5 the configuration of layers in a domain also affects dispersion as kl is the highest in pm4 and the lowest in pm5 this can be explained by the analysis of concentration front propagation during dispersion in these domains as illustrated in fig 10 the dispersion of solute particles across the crossflow regions in pm4 takes place from the middle psd2 layer toward the adjacent psd1 layers shown by the arrows this creates more spread in the concentration profile and hence results in larger values for kl in pm4 compared to pm3 in which the extra solute transport occurs across a single crossflow region in the domain pm5 however the direction of solute transport across the crossflow regions is from the adjacent psd2 layers toward the middle psd1 layer and eventually generates less spread in the concentration profile and subsequently smaller kl values are resulted 3 2 2 scale dependency of the longitudinal dispersion advection introduces a scale dependency behavior in the dynamics of the longitudinal dispersion which is characterized by the plots of kl d x d at peclet numbers larger than 1 figs 6c h as the dispersion coefficients are calculated based on the averaged concentration profiles we plot the temporal change of c d at different locations along the domain length and then use them for the interpretation of the scale dependency behavior in various media for the single layer domains pm1 and pm2 kl d generally increases with distance traveled inside the medium until it reaches to an asymptotic value in the layered media the scale dependent behavior of dispersion coefficient is a function of the direction of layering if the layers are perpendicular to the direction of flow pm6 pm7 and pm8 the values of kl increase with x d during the pre asymptotic regime and gradually reach to their asymptotic values however in the domains pm3 and pm4 where layering is in the direction of flow kl always increases with distance traveled and never reaches its asymptotic value during solute transport in these media the length of crossflow region increases faster than the rate of dispersive transport of solute across this region in the transverse direction therefore there is not enough time for dispersion to redistribute concentration in the transverse direction and the spread of the concentration profile always increases with distance traveled fig 11 b this is not the case for single layer media i e pm1 and domains with layering perpendicular to the flow i e pm8 as the spread in their concentration profiles grows with x d and after some point it approaches to a limit and the shape of profiles remains approximately the same beyond that point figs 11a and d although pm5 has layering along the flow direction its kl d x d plots figs 6c h show that dispersion approaches to its asymptotic limit and the spread of concentration profiles remains the same after some distance traveled by solute particles in this medium fig 11c the configuration of layers in this medium and the direction of dispersive transport through the crossflow regions fig 10c provide enough time for transverse dispersion to distribute concentration across the domain and consequently leads to asymptotic behavior for dispersion 3 2 3 longitudinal dispersion regimes to provide insight about the various dispersion regimes during solute transport in pore scale we extract the values of kl d at x d 1 and plot them against the peclet number in fig 12 as expected diffusion dominated regime kl d 1 fφ exists at low peclet numbers pe 0 1 and the transition to mixed diffusive advective transport occurs around pe 1 as pe increases to 10 advection actively contributes to the dispersion alongside the molecular diffusion and the diffusive advective regime kl d βpe λ establishes in the interval 10 pe 100 to obtain the correlation parameters β and λ we fit a power law equation on the kl d x d plots in this interval for each domain the power low exponent λ is obtained to be in the range 1 19 λ 1 24 which is in good agreement with the experimentally reported values of λ 1 13 gist et al 1990 1 20 brigham et al 1961 1 24 legatski and katz 1967 or 1 33 kinzel and hill 1989 in berea sandstones λ 1 22 in vosges sandstone yao et al 1997 λ 1 05 1 10 in clashach sandstone sorbie et al 1987 and numerically calculated values of λ 1 17 1 35 for pore network models bijeljic et al 2004 bruderer and bernabé 2001 sorbie and clifford 1991 sahimi et al 1986 on another note we observe that the layering of domains has a noticeable impact on λ when layering is in the direction of flow i e pm3 to pm5 λ is slightly larger compared to its value in the other domains constructed from a single layer or multiple layers perpendicular to the flow as stated in the literature brigham et al 1961 the mixing coefficient β is a function of the physical geometry and heterogeneity of the porous media as well as the viscosity ratio of the flowing fluids also depending on the definition of characteristic length in peclet number different values of β may be obtained nonetheless we can use the obtained values of β to compare the macroscale inhomogeneity level of our domains since the results in fig 12 are based on a consistent definition for characteristic length i e d and unit viscosity ratio flow for single layer media β is larger for pm2 compared to pm1 0 36 and 0 26 respectively owing to its larger microscale heterogeneity in terms of s d d also it can be observed that layering along the flow direction remarkably increases the mixing coefficient β for media pm3 to pm5 in these domains layering predominately governs the variations of velocity field and dictates the level of macroscale heterogeneity the calculated values of β reveal that pm4 has the highest level of macroscale heterogeneity affecting solute dispersion with 1 01 compared to pm3 and pm5 with mixing coefficient values of β 0 77 and β 0 44 respectively in domains with the layering perpendicular to the flow pm6 to pm8 one can notice that β is almost similar to the obtained value for pm1 this suggests that the dynamics of dispersion in layered media with layering perpendicular to the direction of flow is generally controlled by the properties of the layer with less microscale heterogeneity here psd1 layer as illustrated in fig 12 dispersion behavior at its asymptotic limit for media pm6 to pm8 is approximately the same as dispersion in pm1 which is a single layer medium generated based on psd1 in the mechanical dispersion regime corresponding to 1000 pe 10000 in our simulations we obtain an approximately linear dependence of kl d with peclet number where advection is the dominant transport mechanism the mixing coefficient β is consistently larger in this regime compared to its value in the mixed diffusive advective regime and follows the same trend in both regimes 3 3 dispersion at adverse viscosity ratios r 0 viscous fingering has two contrasting effects on mixing in porous media it can improve mixing by enlarging the fluid fluid interfacial front or reduce it through bypassing some parts of the porous domain due to channeling jha et al 2011b in this section numerical simulations are performed at two different adverse viscosity ratios to investigate the effect of viscous fingering on longitudinal dispersion coefficient and its scale dependency fig 13 and fig 14 show the results for r 2 and r 5 respectively in both cases the kl d x d trend at pe 0 01 is similar to the unit viscosity ratio case reflecting a diffusion dominant regime at higher values of pe 1 however the effect of viscous fingering on the magnitude of kl and its variation along the medium length is significant comparing fig 13 and fig 14 to fig 6 indicates that during unstable displacements the values of kl are approximately two r 2 to three r 5 orders of magnitude larger than the obtained values during stable displacement r 0 as shown in fig 15 viscous fingering intensifies the solute distribution as r increases to more unfavorable values the evolution of these fingers along the domain length introduces a substantial spread in the concentration profiles fig 16 and consequently increases dispersion coefficient viscous fingering also affects the scale dependency behavior of kl when the viscosity ratio is moderately unfavorable r 2 longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases along the length of the domains and eventually reaches to its asymptotic value in the second half i e x d 0 5 of the domain length fig 13 for a high adverse viscosity ratio of r 5 the asymptotic behavior establishes at even smaller x d and kl reaches to a constant value in the first half of the domain length fig 14 contrary to the unit viscosity ratio displacements it can be observed in figs 13 and 14 that in the presence of viscous fingering dispersion is not infinitely scale dependent and it reaches to an asymptotic behavior even for the domains with layering along the displacement direction i e pm3 5 for the case of adverse viscosity ratio flow and transport are primarily dominated by viscous fingering whereas the contribution of dispersion to solute transport is rather insignificant therefore the concentration distribution across the domain is solely governed by the dynamics of fingers growth when the fingers are fully developed the spread in the concentration profiles remains almost the same as shown in fig 17 and the calculated kl asymptotes to a constant value after some x d a closer look at the plots of fig 13 and fig 14 reveals that the magnitude of kl even starts to decrease at the later sections of the domains near the outlet when x d 1 this is more obvious for pm3 5 which have layering along the flow this reduction in longitudinal dispersion coefficient could be the result of flow focusing across the domains the channeling of less viscous injecting fluid through the more viscous in place fluid occurs and dominates the flow when viscosity contrast is large jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b the extreme channeling results in the focusing of the flow and hinders the development of nearby fingers this in return has a negative impact on the expansion of concentration front and thus reduces the mixing and dispersion in the case of pm3 5 the layering along the displacement direction augments this channeling of the flow and further reduction in kl is observed in these domains similar to the stable displacement the magnitude of kl during unstable displacements is also a function of heterogeneity and layering of the domains as fig 13 and fig 14 show layering along the displacement direction increases kl for pm3 5 while layering perpendicular to that direction results in lower kl values for pm6 8 an interesting observation is that the effect of pore scale heterogeneity and layering on dispersion is more pronounced at r 2 fig 13 compared to r 5 fig 14 at moderate unfavorable viscosity ratios r 2 the fluctuations in velocity field are promoted by both medium heterogeneity and viscous fingering the contribution of heterogeneity in these fluctuations is adequately substantial to make it impactful at higher viscosity ratios r 5 however viscous fingering is very intensive and velocity field variations are mainly driven by the fingering pattern rather than heterogeneity and layering pattern accordingly the plots of kl d x d for r 5 are closer to each other and the effect of heterogeneity and layering is less noticeable to examine the effect of viscous fingering on dispersion regimes during transport at unfavorable viscosity ratio the plots of kl d at the domain outlet i e x d 1 versus peclet number are presented in fig 18 the most important effect of viscous fingering on dispersion is the elimination of middle diffusive advective transport regime as fig 18 confirms the plots of kl d with peclet number have an approximately constant slope for all pe 10 this is opposed to the unit viscosity ratio case fig 12 in which two distinct slopes were distinguishable corresponding to the 10 pe 100 and 1000 pe 10000 ranges to obtain the value of λ for 10 pe 100 in the presence of viscous fingering a power law trend line is fitted to the kl d pe plots it is clear that for both values of r λ is very close to 1 00 and kl d pe demonstrates a linear functionality this is similar to the advection dominated regime which occurs at pe 1000 during stable displacements this similarity originates from the fact that when flow and transport are dominated by viscous fingering boundary layer dispersion is irrelevant and displacement exhibits an advection like behavior this leads to the linear variation of kl d against the peclet number at all values of pe 10 where a single fingering dominated transport regime is established finally one can readily observe in fig 18 that the effect of medium pore scale heterogeneity and layering on dispersion is more significant during miscible displacement at a moderate log viscosity ratio of r 2 compared to the high log viscosity ratio of r 5 4 concluding remarks numerical pore scale simulations are carried out to model the dispersion in porous media during both stable and unstable miscible displacements we solve navier stokes and convection diffusion equations to find the velocity field and concentration profile across the heterogenous packings of circular grains the pore level heterogeneity of porous domains is characterized by their particle size distribution while layering is introduced in both longitudinal and transverse directions numerically obtained concentration profiles are then fitted to the analytical solution of the convection dispersion equation at microscale to find the longitudinal dispersion coefficient kl at different positions along the length of porous domains through this study it is observed that dispersion behaves differently for stable and unstable displacements as viscous fingering has a significant impact on the magnitude and scale dependency of kl in stable displacements i e r 0 three distinct dispersion regimes are identified based on the peclet number for pe 0 1 diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism and kl is a constant value and equal to the effective diffusion coefficient along the length of the domains a mixed diffusive advective regime takes place in the range 10 pe 100 which is characterized by the power law exponent 1 19 λ 1 24 as in kl d βpe λ for pe 1000 mechanical dispersion is established as the main transport mechanism where kl is linearly correlated with peclet number in the presence of viscous fingering r 2 and 5 however the mixed diffusive advective regime no longer exists and kl almost linearly increases with peclet number for all pe 1 due to the domination of fingering over the other mechanism of mass transport moreover viscous fingering remarkably increases kl to approximately two to three when r 2 and 5 respectively orders of magnitude larger than the stable displacement case during both stable and unstable displacements the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is discovered to be a function of pore scale heterogeneity and layering configuration of the domain a wider particle size distribution as an indicator of heterogeneity at pore level or layering along the direction of displacement result in larger values for kl whereas layering perpendicular to displacement seems to have no positive impact on dispersion however it should be noted that as log viscosity ratio increases to a higher value from r 2 to r 5 the effect of heterogeneity and layering becomes less relevant the results demonstrate that the scale dependency of dispersion during stable displacements is primarily governed by the configuration of layering in non layered media kl increases with distance travelled and approaches to an asymptotic value when layering is perpendicular to the flow dispersion reaches to its asymptotic limit while for domains with layering along the flow it depends on the configuration of layers for some specific layering patterns i e pm3 4 in this study kl shows an ever increasing trend with distance travelled and dispersion never asymptotes to a constant value in unstable displacements however dispersion always reaches to an asymptotic behavior and the higher the viscosity ratio is at smaller x d longitudinal dispersion coefficient asymptotes declarations of interest none acknowledgment the authors acknowledge the

peclet number displacements to prevent this we have used the consistent stabilization methods both streamline and crosswind diffusion techniques to stabilize the numerical solutions and minimize the artificial diffusion moreover it is essential to choose a mesh size which is fine enough to prevent excessive numerical diffusion and large enough to be computationally feasible to achieve this we had performed a mesh resolution sensitivity analysis on the domain pm2 during displacements at r 0 and pe 10000 for five different mesh resolutions the number of elements in these meshes varies from 294 191 in the coarsest mesh mesh1 to 1 441 465 in the finest mesh mesh5 fig a 1 compares the concentration profiles at the outlet of the domain for these mesh resolutions and shows how the calculated longitudinal dispersion coefficients vary with the number of elements in the mesh the results show that the concentration profiles and the obtained values for kl d are almost identical for mesh3 5 therefore it is necessary to make sure that the grid resolution is fine enough at least more than 550 000 grid elements as in the mesh3 5 to achieve accurate results in all the simulations of this work the mesh resolutions were in the range of 600 000 800 000 in order to achieve both accuracy and speed in the numerical simulations to verify that the artificial numerical diffusion does not pollute our high peclet simulations we have performed a simple test we have considered a narrow channel i e a fracture with slip walls i e uniform velocity field in the channel and slip boundary conditions at the walls and simulated the miscible displacement at r 0 and pe 10000 in this channel all the employed numerical techniques stabilization methods solvers etc were similar to the simulation runs in our porous domains fig a 2 shows the obtained concentration profile at the channel outlet during the displacement the model parameters fracture half length velocity and input diffusion coefficient are also embedded in the figure then we have calculated the output diffusion coefficient using the procedure explained in section 2 4 since the channel walls are slip boundaries there is no taylor dispersion occurring during the displacement therefore the concentration profile at the outlet must indicate a sharp front with a calculated diffusion coefficient equal to the input diffusion coefficient as fig a 2 demonstrates the concentration profile at the outlet shows a sharp front occurring at t d 1 the numerically calculated diffusion coefficient also agrees well with the input diffusion coefficient with an error about 3 7 therefore we may conclude that the artificial diffusion added by the stabilization techniques to our highest peclet number simulations has caused an error about 4 in our results note that at lower peclet numbers this error decreases significantly since far less numerical diffusion will be induced in slower displacements 
784,dispersion and mixing of fluids during miscible displacement in porous media are known to be strongly affected by heterogeneity and viscous fingering in this study direct pore level numerical simulations are employed to model flow and solute transport during both stable and unstable miscible displacements in two dimensional packings of circular grains longitudinal dispersion coefficients are then computed by fitting the numerically obtained concentration profiles to the analytical solution of the convection dispersion equation we observed that diffusive mixed diffusive advective and mechanical dispersion regimes are present during stable displacements whereas the middle diffusive advective regime is absent in unstable displacements due to the evolution of viscous fingers viscous fingering also increases the longitudinal dispersion coefficient several orders of magnitude compared to the stable displacement the results reveal that the scale dependency of longitudinal dispersion is a function of layering direction and viscosity contrast during stable displacement in porous domains with no layering or with the layering perpendicular to the displacement direction the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases along the length of flow until it reaches an asymptotic value when layering is in the direction of displacement however the scale dependency behavior is a function of the layering pattern in unstable displacements however longitudinal dispersion always exhibits an asymptotic behavior finally it is observed that the effect of heterogeneity and layering on the magnitude of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient diminishes as viscosity ratio increases to higher adverse values keywords longitudinal dispersion scale dependency viscous fingering

at macroscale 1 introduction the dynamics of mixing and transport of solute in porous media is the major focus of subsurface transport studies in groundwater hydrology and miscible recovery of hydrocarbon reservoirs mixing and dispersion in pore space is the combined result of molecular diffusion and convective spreading molecular diffusion is the transport of solute particles due to a concentration gradient whereas convective spreading arises from the fluctuations of velocity field inside the porous media these variations in the velocity magnitude and direction cause the solute particles to travel different paths with different velocities within a porous medium thus generating concentration contrasts this mechanism increases the size of the concentration front and provides a large surface area for molecular diffusion it is the enhanced mass transfer by molecular diffusion across this enlarged concentration front that makes convective spreading irreversible and contributes to the true mixing dentz and le borgne 2011 if there is no molecular diffusion convective spreading is a reversible phenomenon and only leads to apparent mixing jha et al 2009 the process of mixing that occurs during solute transport in pore scale is usually described as hydrodynamic dispersion in macroscale and can be quantified by dispersion coefficient dispersion coefficient k is a tensor quantity that measures the degree of mixing which originates from both diffusion and convective spreading experimental measurements of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient kl the diagonal component of k along the general direction of flow are usually carried out using breakthrough experiments correa et al 1990 jiao and hötzl 2004 arya et al 1988 bretz et al 1988 nmr spectroscopy seymour and callaghan 1997 stapf and packer 1998 lebon et al 1997 and particle tracking velocimetry moroni and cushman 2001 an alternative approach is to numerically calculate kl using digital core analysis digital core analysis enables us to describe the detailed properties of a porous medium at the pore scale micro nano scale and calculate kl at the macroscale it can be achieved by the numerical simulation of flow and transport in a pore scale digital representation of a porous medium several authors have used different methods to simulate dispersion in various types of porous media for instance some authors yao et al 1997 rolle and kitanidis 2014 mostaghimi et al 2012 bijeljic et al 2011 maier et al 2000 maier et al 2003 salles et al 1993 sallès et al 1993 coelho et al 1997 have used stochastically reconstructed models to represent porous media during dispersion simulation while others bijeljic et al 2004 bruderer and bernabé 2001 bruderer weng et al 2004 makse et al 2000 koplik et al 1988 de arcangelis l et al 1986 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 solved the flow and transport equations in the extracted equivalent pore networks of porous media dispersion coefficient magnitude during solute transport in porous media strongly depends on the mechanisms that augment convective spreading and enhance diffusion this includes viscous fingering and the variations of the velocity field due to the medium s structural heterogeneity nicolaides et al 2015 when there is an adverse viscosity ratio hydrodynamic instabilities will develop at the concentration front the resulting viscous fingers increase the size of concentration front and generate sharp concentration gradients due to the stretching steepening and tip splitting mechanisms tan and homsy 1988 both experimental jiao and hötzl 2004 brigham et al 1961 and darcy scale numerical connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 studies have shown that the additional mixing caused by the enhanced molecular diffusion at this perturbed concentration front results in a larger dispersion coefficient some authors jha et al 2013 jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b however argued that at high adverse viscosity ratios flow focusing across the flow domain due to the channeling of less viscous fluid slows down the creation of additional interface by tip splitting and hinders mixing in heterogeneous porous media the presence of microscale i e nonuniform distribution of shape and size of pores and throats and macroscale i e layering heterogeneity creates some preferred paths for flow inside the media and gives rise to a nonuniform velocity distribution it makes the leading edge of the concentration front disordered and introduces additional mixing previous laboratory measurements and numerical studies have demonstrated that an increase in the variance of pore size distribution bretz et al 1988 complexity of the pore structure brigham et al 1961 dykstra parsons coefficient of permeability fields arya et al 1988 connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 adepoju et al 2013 permeability variance john et al 2010 and longitudinal correlation length of permeability arya et al 1988 johns and garmeh 2010 john et al 2010 leads to higher dispersion coefficients at pore scale higher dispersion coefficients have been observed when medium heterogeneity becomes more complex from sandstones to carbonates bijeljic et al 2011 or the variance bruderer and bernabé 2001 bruderer weng et al 2004 and correlation length bruderer weng et al 2004 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 of pore network models increase an important characteristic of dispersion is the scale dependency along the flow length i e variation of kl along the porous medium length due to the presence of the solid phase the velocity field variations in the medium are significant and cause the concentration front to grow as the solute particles travel hence a larger surface area is available for the molecular diffusion of solute which increases the dispersion until the solute particles have traveled enough distance or time to completely sample the velocity field experimental measurements arya et al 1988 moroni and cushman 2001 as well as darcy scale connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 adepoju et al 2013 john et al 2010 mahadevan et al 2003 and pore scale bijeljic et al 2011 maier et al 2000 maier et al 2003 bijeljic et al 2004 bruderer and bernabé 2001 bruderer weng et al 2004 garmeh et al 2009 zhu and fox 2002 numerical simulations at the unit viscosity ratio i e stable flow have shown that kl increases with the displacement time or the distance traveled by solute particles until asymptotic dispersion is established at the pore level this asymptotic length scale is shown to be about five to six pore diameters for random bead packs moroni and cushman 2001 about seven grain diameters for unconfined sphere packings maier et al 2003 and hundreds of pores for consolidated media bijeljic et al 2004 at the darcy scale however due to the presence of large scale heterogeneities such as permeability layering the asymptotic length for dispersion is much higher in order of a few to hundreds of meters john et al 2010 mahadevan et al 2003 for layered permeability fields lake and hirasaki 1981 it was observed that if the ratio of the longitudinal travel time of solute particles owing to advection to their transverse travel time due to dispersion is smaller than 0 2 longitudinal dispersion coefficient never reaches its asymptotic value in the presence of viscous fingering numerical simulations of dispersion during darcy flow jha et al 2013 jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b have revealed that there is an interplay between channeling and viscous fingering as the transport of solute proceeds at early times a higher rate of mixing was observed due to the additional surface area created by fingering at later times during the flow at high adverse viscosity ratios however channeling dominates the flow and slows down the creation of the additional interface area thus making the mixing less efficient jha et al 2013 jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b despite the extensive research on mixing and dispersion in porous media there are a few studies on the combined effect of medium heterogeneity and viscous fingering on the values of kl and its scale dependency most of the previous studies focus on the scale dependency of dispersion during stable flow unit viscosity ratio and the others that account for viscous fingering nicolaides et al 2015 connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 jha et al 2013 jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b are focused on the modeling of dispersion at darcy scale which neglects the variability of heterogeneity in scales smaller than the size of the continuum gridblocks in this study we model dispersion in pore scale by solving the point equations of flow and transport in 2 dimensional pore scale models of granular porous media with different levels of heterogeneity and layering numerical simulations at different peclet numbers are carried out to investigate the effect of heterogeneity and layering on the scale dependency of kl during both unit and adverse viscosity ratio flows in what follows we first present the governing equations the physical models of the porous media the numerical approaches and the calculation procedure of kl in section two results of the dispersion simulation at both stable and unstable flows are discussed in section three finally we summarize the main conclusions of the present study in section four 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations we consider the flow of two miscible fluids with the same density ρ and different viscosities μ 1 and μ 2 μ 1 μ 2 corresponding to the displaced and displacing fluids respectively it is assumed that the fluids are first contact miscible and incompressible also we assume that the molecular diffusion coefficient d between the solutions is constant and isotropic we solve the following continuity navier stokes and advection diffusion equations simultaneously to model the dynamics of solute dispersion in pore scale granular porous media 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u p μ u 3 c t u c d c in the above equations u is the pore velocity vector p is the pressure ρ and μ are the mixture density and viscosity respectively and c denotes the concentration of solute we adopt a quarter power mixing rule to express the mixture viscosity as 4 μ c μ 1 1 4 c c 0 c inj c 0 μ 2 1 4 μ 1 1 4 4 where c inj denotes the solute concentration in the injected solution and c 0 is the initial concentration in the media which is considered to be zero in our simulations we express the equations in dimensionless form using d v d v μ 2 and v μ 2 d as the characteristic length velocity time viscosity and pressure to make the governing equations dimensionless here d is the average grain diameter of the granular porous media see fig 1 and v is the intrinsic velocity in

this study we represent the pore scale porous media as 2 dimensional packings of circular grains resembling unconsolidated granular media fig 1 the dimensions of the domains are l d and w d l d w d l w d the pore scale domains are generated using a swelling grain reconstruction algorithm with variable grain diameters d d d d taken from two different particle size distributions psd taheri et al 2017 roberts and schwartz 1985 the psds define the relative number of grains with a specific diameter in a domain fig 2 the microscale heterogeneity of the medium is characterized by the standard deviation s d d of the psds the macroscale heterogeneity is introduced in the domains as layering in the both parallel and perpendicular directions to the main flow the layering of the domains is achieved by constructing the patterns using both psds in different orders in total eight pore scale domains are generated using this approach and depicted in fig 3 pm1 and pm2 are single layer domains constructed based on psd1 and psd2 respectively pm3 pm4 and pm5 are layered domains with the layering parallel to the direction of flow pm3 is a two layer domain while pm4 and pm5 have three layers pm6 has two layers perpendicular to the direction of flow and pm7 and pm8 are three layered domains with the layering perpendicular to the direction of flow all of these domains have l d 90 and w d 30 resulting in an aspect ratio of 3 0 a l d w d 2 3 numerical method we use the commercial code comsol comsol multiphysics user s guide 2015 to solve the governing equations through a fully implicit finite element scheme the solution domain is discretized as a triangular mesh consisting of hundreds of thousands of elements such that each pore is covered with several grid elements significantly smaller than the pore size see the appendix then the initial and boundary conditions are set as illustrated in fig 4 the inlet condition left side boundary in the x direction for flow is constant injection velocity while the outlet right side boundary in the x direction is constant atmospheric pressure p 0 d we impose the danckwerts boundary conditions for mass transfer which implies the constant concentration inflow at the inlet and zero concentration gradient at the outlet in the y direction no slip and no flux boundary conditions are assumed for flow and transport respectively the perimeter of each grain is covered with the edges of the adjacent triangular mesh elements where boundary conditions for flow and transport are no slip and no flux respectively 2 4 calculation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient taylor 1953 1954 and later aris 1956 studied the transport of a passive solute in a single capillary tube and mathematically showed that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient scales with the peclet number as kl d 1 κpe 2 where pe uma d and um is the mean velocity a is the characteristic length radius and half of the side length for circular and square cross sections respectively and κ is the shape factor of the cross section 1 48 and 1 30 4 2 6 bruderer and bernabé 2001 for circular and square cross sections respectively for a real porous medium the nature of transport deviates from the taylor aris dispersion kl d pe 2 due to the inhomogeneity of medium and exhibits a different functionality as sahimi 1993 11 k l d 1 f ϕ β p e λ where the power law exponent λ 1 λ 2 brigham et al 1961 is confined to the limiting taylor aris λ 2 and mechanical dispersion λ 1 regimes bruderer and bernabé 2001 β is the mixing coefficient brigham et al 1961 and f and φ are formation resistivity factor and porosity respectively based on this functionality three different regimes for solute transport during stable flow are defined as diffusion dominated advection dominated and mixed diffusion advection babaei and joekar niasar 2016 for very low peclet numbers pe 0 1 bijeljic et al 2004 0 3 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 or 5 sahimi 1993 dispersion due to the convective spreading is insignificant and the transport regime is basically diffusion dominated and kl d 1 fφ sahimi 1993 where f and φ are formation resistivity factor and porosity respectively when peclet number is large pe 300 sahimi 1993 convective spreading is the dominant transport mechanism and the mechanical dispersion regime kl d pe holds for the intermediate values of pe both diffusion and advection actively contribute to the transport and the power law functionality kl d pe λ describes the dispersion regime in the numerical simulation of dispersion in porous media the values of kl can be computed by using the method of moments salles et al 1993 sallès et al 1993 coelho et al 1997 brenner 1980 random walk particle tracking approaches jha et al 2009 mostaghimi et al 2012 bijeljic et al 2011 maier et al 2000 maier et al 2003 salles et al 1993 bijeljic et al 2004 bruderer and bernabé 2001 bruderer weng et al 2004 john et al 2010 or fitting the concentration histories to the analytical solution of the governing advection dispersion equation ade arya et al 1988 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 connolly and johns 2016 johns and garmeh 2010 mahadevan et al 2003 garmeh et al 2009 here we utilize the third approach and calculate kl by fitting the concentration histories to the analytical solution of the following 1d ade at macroscale 12 c t v c x k l 2 c x 2 this equation describes the up scaled macroscale longitudinal dispersion resulting from microscale diffusion and convective spreading at macroscale we use l length of the domain v and l v as the characteristic length velocity and time respectively to make the ade dimensionless 13 c d t d c d x d 1 p e 2 c d x d 2 where the subscript d indicates the dimensionless variables at macroscale and pe is the macroscale peclet number expressed as pe vl kl similar initial and boundary conditions as for the microscale advection diffusion equation are imposed in macroscale 14 c d x d 0 0 c d 0 t d 1 c d x d 1 t d 0 the solution of this equation in the laplace domain is 15 c d x d s s 1 ξ ξ e ξ ξ 1 e x d ξ s 1 ξ ξ e ξ ξ 1 e x d ξ where c d is the dimensionless concentration in the laplace domain s is the argument of the laplace transform and 16 ξ 1 2 p e p e 2 4 s p e in order to find the time domain solution we use the fourier series method for numerical laplace inversion of eq 15 dubner and abate 1968 17 c d x d t d e α t d t d 1 2 c d x d α real k 1 n 1 k c d x d α k π t d i where i is the imaginary unit and α and n are the parameters that control the accuracy of the numerical inversion for α the range of 4 α t d 5 are proposed lee et al 1984 while the value of n should be large enough to make sure that desired convergency is achieved throughout this study the values of α t d 4 5 and n 5000 are used to perform the laplace inversion the procedure of computing kl is as follows 1 firstly the velocity field u d x d y d t d and the spatiotemporal concentration profile c d x d y d t d are obtained by solving the eqs 5 8 in r 2 2 at each x d the velocity averaged concentration values are calculated as 18 c d x d t d u d x d y d t d c d x d y d t d d y d u d x d y d t d d y d a where u d is the x component along the general direction of flow of u d and c d is the transversely averaged concentration 3 the 1d concentration profile is then written in terms of macroscale variables as c d x d t d c d x d t d where x d x d l d and t d t d l d 4 at different values of x d along the length of the domain 0 x d 1 starting with an initial guess for pe c d t d is calculated using eqs 15 17 and then matched to the numerically obtained c d t d curve at the same x d to find the value of pe that results in the best fit 5 finally the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is computed at each x d as kl vl pe 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the numerical approach in order to validate the numerical approach we simulate hydrodynamic dispersion during flow between two parallel plates resembling a fracture and then calculate the asymptotic longitudinal dispersion coefficient analytically it has been shown that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for a fracture scales with peclet number as kl d 1 2 105 pe 2 berkowitz and zhou 1996 wang et al 2012 where pe umb d um is the mean velocity and b is the half fracture aperture fig 5 plots the variation of kl against pe 2 the slope of the graph is 0 0188 which is in an excellent agreement with the analytical value of 2 105 0 0190 3 2 dispersion at unit viscosity ratio r 0 when the viscosity ratio is unity there is no viscous fingering and therefore the flow and transport are solely dominated by dispersion and porous medium heterogeneity to explore the scale dependency of kl during stable flow a series of simulations are conducted to model longitudinal dispersion in the pore scale domains shown in fig 3 a wide range of peclet number is considered 0 01 pe 10000 and the results are illustrated in fig 6 as the plots of kl d x d at each value of pe at very low peclet numbers pe 0 1 longitudinal dispersion coefficient is almost constant along the length of domains and kl d 0 4 figs 6a and b in this range of pe diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism and kl d 1 fφ which results in f 10 for the formation resistivity factors of the pore scale domains φ 0 25 note that there is some scattering of the kl d values at small x d which is due to the lack of a good fitness of numerical results to the analytical solution this poor fitness is caused by the insufficient data points for the curve c d t d at the regions close to the inlet where c d rapidly reaches 1 when the concentration front has traveled some distance from the inlet the scattering vanishes and the plots follow a smooth trend afterwards as the peclet number increases to higher values pe 1 convective spreading advection contributes to the mixing and dispersion in two ways figs 6c h it affects both the magnitude and scale dependency of longitudinal dispersion coefficient as explained in the next subsections 3 2 1 magnitude of the longitudinal dispersion advection causes kl to increase as the peclet number increases from 1 to 10 000 at these peclet numbers the velocity field variations in the domain induced by the irregular topology of the pore space generate a distorted concentration front the intensity of this front perturbation grows with the peclet number as shown by the concentration isosurfaces in fig 7 consequently larger values of dispersion coefficient are recorded in figs 6c h for higher values of pe the magnitude of kl is also strongly dependent on both the microscale heterogeneity and layering of the porous media a comparison of the dispersion coefficient plots of fig 6 for pm1 and pm2 reveals that the domain with the higher standard deviation in the grain diameter pm2 exhibits larger kl at all pe 1 this can be further verified through the concentration isosurfaces as fig 8 depicts that the higher degree of microscale heterogeneity of pm2 compared to pm1 augments the perturbation of the concentration front to a greater extent and increases the frontal area over which molecular diffusion takes place therefore the concentration profile at a specific x d is more smeared during transport in pm2 compared to the one in pm1 and hence a higher dispersion coefficient is observed for pm2 fig 9 the effect of porous medium layering on the magnitude of kl is a function of the direction and configuration of the layers as one can observe the plots of dispersion coefficient at pe 10 figs 6d h demonstrate that layering along the general direction of flow here x direction significantly increases kl in the domains pm3 pm4 and pm5 on the other hand the layering perpendicular to the direction of flow has an insignificant impact on kl fig 9 contrasts the concentration profiles for pm1 pm2 pm4 and pm7 during transport at pe 10000 it can be seen that the concentration profile is more smeared for the case of pm4 compared to pm1 and pm2 which are single layer domains while the transport in domain pm7 exhibits a less smeared concentration front and a shift to the right when layering is in the direction of flow the concentration front in more heterogeneous layers denoted as psd2 in fig 3 travels faster and the front in less heterogeneous layers denoted as psd1 in fig 3 falls behind this forms an extended front crossflow region between the layers with different degrees of heterogeneity fig 10 the enhanced crossflow and molecular diffusion across these regions from psd2 layers toward psd1 layers improve mixing and result in more spread in the concentration profiles which eventually increases dispersion coefficient a closer look at the plots of fig 6 reveals that when layering is in the direction of flow as in pm3 pm4 and pm5 the configuration of layers in a domain also affects dispersion as kl is the highest in pm4 and the lowest in pm5 this can be explained by the analysis of concentration front propagation during dispersion in these domains as illustrated in fig 10 the dispersion of solute particles across the crossflow regions in pm4 takes place from the middle psd2 layer toward the adjacent psd1 layers shown by the arrows this creates more spread in the concentration profile and hence results in larger values for kl in pm4 compared to pm3 in which the extra solute transport occurs across a single crossflow region in the domain pm5 however the direction of solute transport across the crossflow regions is from the adjacent psd2 layers toward the middle psd1 layer and eventually generates less spread in the concentration profile and subsequently smaller kl values are resulted 3 2 2 scale dependency of the longitudinal dispersion advection introduces a scale dependency behavior in the dynamics of the longitudinal dispersion which is characterized by the plots of kl d x d at peclet numbers larger than 1 figs 6c h as the dispersion coefficients are calculated based on the averaged concentration profiles we plot the temporal change of c d at different locations along the domain length and then use them for the interpretation of the scale dependency behavior in various media for the single layer domains pm1 and pm2 kl d generally increases with distance traveled inside the medium until it reaches to an asymptotic value in the layered media the scale dependent behavior of dispersion coefficient is a function of the direction of layering if the layers are perpendicular to the direction of flow pm6 pm7 and pm8 the values of kl increase with x d during the pre asymptotic regime and gradually reach to their asymptotic values however in the domains pm3 and pm4 where layering is in the direction of flow kl always increases with distance traveled and never reaches its asymptotic value during solute transport in these media the length of crossflow region increases faster than the rate of dispersive transport of solute across this region in the transverse direction therefore there is not enough time for dispersion to redistribute concentration in the transverse direction and the spread of the concentration profile always increases with distance traveled fig 11 b this is not the case for single layer media i e pm1 and domains with layering perpendicular to the flow i e pm8 as the spread in their concentration profiles grows with x d and after some point it approaches to a limit and the shape of profiles remains approximately the same beyond that point figs 11a and d although pm5 has layering along the flow direction its kl d x d plots figs 6c h show that dispersion approaches to its asymptotic limit and the spread of concentration profiles remains the same after some distance traveled by solute particles in this medium fig 11c the configuration of layers in this medium and the direction of dispersive transport through the crossflow regions fig 10c provide enough time for transverse dispersion to distribute concentration across the domain and consequently leads to asymptotic behavior for dispersion 3 2 3 longitudinal dispersion regimes to provide insight about the various dispersion regimes during solute transport in pore scale we extract the values of kl d at x d 1 and plot them against the peclet number in fig 12 as expected diffusion dominated regime kl d 1 fφ exists at low peclet numbers pe 0 1 and the transition to mixed diffusive advective transport occurs around pe 1 as pe increases to 10 advection actively contributes to the dispersion alongside the molecular diffusion and the diffusive advective regime kl d βpe λ establishes in the interval 10 pe 100 to obtain the correlation parameters β and λ we fit a power law equation on the kl d x d plots in this interval for each domain the power low exponent λ is obtained to be in the range 1 19 λ 1 24 which is in good agreement with the experimentally reported values of λ 1 13 gist et al 1990 1 20 brigham et al 1961 1 24 legatski and katz 1967 or 1 33 kinzel and hill 1989 in berea sandstones λ 1 22 in vosges sandstone yao et al 1997 λ 1 05 1 10 in clashach sandstone sorbie et al 1987 and numerically calculated values of λ 1 17 1 35 for pore network models bijeljic et al 2004 bruderer and bernabé 2001 sorbie and clifford 1991 sahimi et al 1986 on another note we observe that the layering of domains has a noticeable impact on λ when layering is in the direction of flow i e pm3 to pm5 λ is slightly larger compared to its value in the other domains constructed from a single layer or multiple layers perpendicular to the flow as stated in the literature brigham et al 1961 the mixing coefficient β is a function of the physical geometry and heterogeneity of the porous media as well as the viscosity ratio of the flowing fluids also depending on the definition of characteristic length in peclet number different values of β may be obtained nonetheless we can use the obtained values of β to compare the macroscale inhomogeneity level of our domains since the results in fig 12 are based on a consistent definition for characteristic length i e d and unit viscosity ratio flow for single layer media β is larger for pm2 compared to pm1 0 36 and 0 26 respectively owing to its larger microscale heterogeneity in terms of s d d also it can be observed that layering along the flow direction remarkably increases the mixing coefficient β for media pm3 to pm5 in these domains layering predominately governs the variations of velocity field and dictates the level of macroscale heterogeneity the calculated values of β reveal that pm4 has the highest level of macroscale heterogeneity affecting solute dispersion with 1 01 compared to pm3 and pm5 with mixing coefficient values of β 0 77 and β 0 44 respectively in domains with the layering perpendicular to the flow pm6 to pm8 one can notice that β is almost similar to the obtained value for pm1 this suggests that the dynamics of dispersion in layered media with layering perpendicular to the direction of flow is generally controlled by the properties of the layer with less microscale heterogeneity here psd1 layer as illustrated in fig 12 dispersion behavior at its asymptotic limit for media pm6 to pm8 is approximately the same as dispersion in pm1 which is a single layer medium generated based on psd1 in the mechanical dispersion regime corresponding to 1000 pe 10000 in our simulations we obtain an approximately linear dependence of kl d with peclet number where advection is the dominant transport mechanism the mixing coefficient β is consistently larger in this regime compared to its value in the mixed diffusive advective regime and follows the same trend in both regimes 3 3 dispersion at adverse viscosity ratios r 0 viscous fingering has two contrasting effects on mixing in porous media it can improve mixing by enlarging the fluid fluid interfacial front or reduce it through bypassing some parts of the porous domain due to channeling jha et al 2011b in this section numerical simulations are performed at two different adverse viscosity ratios to investigate the effect of viscous fingering on longitudinal dispersion coefficient and its scale dependency fig 13 and fig 14 show the results for r 2 and r 5 respectively in both cases the kl d x d trend at pe 0 01 is similar to the unit viscosity ratio case reflecting a diffusion dominant regime at higher values of pe 1 however the effect of viscous fingering on the magnitude of kl and its variation along the medium length is significant comparing fig 13 and fig 14 to fig 6 indicates that during unstable displacements the values of kl are approximately two r 2 to three r 5 orders of magnitude larger than the obtained values during stable displacement r 0 as shown in fig 15 viscous fingering intensifies the solute distribution as r increases to more unfavorable values the evolution of these fingers along the domain length introduces a substantial spread in the concentration profiles fig 16 and consequently increases dispersion coefficient viscous fingering also affects the scale dependency behavior of kl when the viscosity ratio is moderately unfavorable r 2 longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases along the length of the domains and eventually reaches to its asymptotic value in the second half i e x d 0 5 of the domain length fig 13 for a high adverse viscosity ratio of r 5 the asymptotic behavior establishes at even smaller x d and kl reaches to a constant value in the first half of the domain length fig 14 contrary to the unit viscosity ratio displacements it can be observed in figs 13 and 14 that in the presence of viscous fingering dispersion is not infinitely scale dependent and it reaches to an asymptotic behavior even for the domains with layering along the displacement direction i e pm3 5 for the case of adverse viscosity ratio flow and transport are primarily dominated by viscous fingering whereas the contribution of dispersion to solute transport is rather insignificant therefore the concentration distribution across the domain is solely governed by the dynamics of fingers growth when the fingers are fully developed the spread in the concentration profiles remains almost the same as shown in fig 17 and the calculated kl asymptotes to a constant value after some x d a closer look at the plots of fig 13 and fig 14 reveals that the magnitude of kl even starts to decrease at the later sections of the domains near the outlet when x d 1 this is more obvious for pm3 5 which have layering along the flow this reduction in longitudinal dispersion coefficient could be the result of flow focusing across the domains the channeling of less viscous injecting fluid through the more viscous in place fluid occurs and dominates the flow when viscosity contrast is large jha et al 2011a jha et al 2011b the extreme channeling results in the focusing of the flow and hinders the development of nearby fingers this in return has a negative impact on the expansion of concentration front and thus reduces the mixing and dispersion in the case of pm3 5 the layering along the displacement direction augments this channeling of the flow and further reduction in kl is observed in these domains similar to the stable displacement the magnitude of kl during unstable displacements is also a function of heterogeneity and layering of the domains as fig 13 and fig 14 show layering along the displacement direction increases kl for pm3 5 while layering perpendicular to that direction results in lower kl values for pm6 8 an interesting observation is that the effect of pore scale heterogeneity and layering on dispersion is more pronounced at r 2 fig 13 compared to r 5 fig 14 at moderate unfavorable viscosity ratios r 2 the fluctuations in velocity field are promoted by both medium heterogeneity and viscous fingering the contribution of heterogeneity in these fluctuations is adequately substantial to make it impactful at higher viscosity ratios r 5 however viscous fingering is very intensive and velocity field variations are mainly driven by the fingering pattern rather than heterogeneity and layering pattern accordingly the plots of kl d x d for r 5 are closer to each other and the effect of heterogeneity and layering is less noticeable to examine the effect of viscous fingering on dispersion regimes during transport at unfavorable viscosity ratio the plots of kl d at the domain outlet i e x d 1 versus peclet number are presented in fig 18 the most important effect of viscous fingering on dispersion is the elimination of middle diffusive advective transport regime as fig 18 confirms the plots of kl d with peclet number have an approximately constant slope for all pe 10 this is opposed to the unit viscosity ratio case fig 12 in which two distinct slopes were distinguishable corresponding to the 10 pe 100 and 1000 pe 10000 ranges to obtain the value of λ for 10 pe 100 in the presence of viscous fingering a power law trend line is fitted to the kl d pe plots it is clear that for both values of r λ is very close to 1 00 and kl d pe demonstrates a linear functionality this is similar to the advection dominated regime which occurs at pe 1000 during stable displacements this similarity originates from the fact that when flow and transport are dominated by viscous fingering boundary layer dispersion is irrelevant and displacement exhibits an advection like behavior this leads to the linear variation of kl d against the peclet number at all values of pe 10 where a single fingering dominated transport regime is established finally one can readily observe in fig 18 that the effect of medium pore scale heterogeneity and layering on dispersion is more significant during miscible displacement at a moderate log viscosity ratio of r 2 compared to the high log viscosity ratio of r 5 4 concluding remarks numerical pore scale simulations are carried out to model the dispersion in porous media during both stable and unstable miscible displacements we solve navier stokes and convection diffusion equations to find the velocity field and concentration profile across the heterogenous packings of circular grains the pore level heterogeneity of porous domains is characterized by their particle size distribution while layering is introduced in both longitudinal and transverse directions numerically obtained concentration profiles are then fitted to the analytical solution of the convection dispersion equation at microscale to find the longitudinal dispersion coefficient kl at different positions along the length of porous domains through this study it is observed that dispersion behaves differently for stable and unstable displacements as viscous fingering has a significant impact on the magnitude and scale dependency of kl in stable displacements i e r 0 three distinct dispersion regimes are identified based on the peclet number for pe 0 1 diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism and kl is a constant value and equal to the effective diffusion coefficient along the length of the domains a mixed diffusive advective regime takes place in the range 10 pe 100 which is characterized by the power law exponent 1 19 λ 1 24 as in kl d βpe λ for pe 1000 mechanical dispersion is established as the main transport mechanism where kl is linearly correlated with peclet number in the presence of viscous fingering r 2 and 5 however the mixed diffusive advective regime no longer exists and kl almost linearly increases with peclet number for all pe 1 due to the domination of fingering over the other mechanism of mass transport moreover viscous fingering remarkably increases kl to approximately two to three when r 2 and 5 respectively orders of magnitude larger than the stable displacement case during both stable and unstable displacements the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is discovered to be a function of pore scale heterogeneity and layering configuration of the domain a wider particle size distribution as an indicator of heterogeneity at pore level or layering along the direction of displacement result in larger values for kl whereas layering perpendicular to displacement seems to have no positive impact on dispersion however it should be noted that as log viscosity ratio increases to a higher value from r 2 to r 5 the effect of heterogeneity and layering becomes less relevant the results demonstrate that the scale dependency of dispersion during stable displacements is primarily governed by the configuration of layering in non layered media kl increases with distance travelled and approaches to an asymptotic value when layering is perpendicular to the flow dispersion reaches to its asymptotic limit while for domains with layering along the flow it depends on the configuration of layers for some specific layering patterns i e pm3 4 in this study kl shows an ever increasing trend with distance travelled and dispersion never asymptotes to a constant value in unstable displacements however dispersion always reaches to an asymptotic behavior and the higher the viscosity ratio is at smaller x d longitudinal dispersion coefficient asymptotes declarations of interest none acknowledgment the authors acknowledge the

peclet number displacements to prevent this we have used the consistent stabilization methods both streamline and crosswind diffusion techniques to stabilize the numerical solutions and minimize the artificial diffusion moreover it is essential to choose a mesh size which is fine enough to prevent excessive numerical diffusion and large enough to be computationally feasible to achieve this we had performed a mesh resolution sensitivity analysis on the domain pm2 during displacements at r 0 and pe 10000 for five different mesh resolutions the number of elements in these meshes varies from 294 191 in the coarsest mesh mesh1 to 1 441 465 in the finest mesh mesh5 fig a 1 compares the concentration profiles at the outlet of the domain for these mesh resolutions and shows how the calculated longitudinal dispersion coefficients vary with the number of elements in the mesh the results show that the concentration profiles and the obtained values for kl d are almost identical for mesh3 5 therefore it is necessary to make sure that the grid resolution is fine enough at least more than 550 000 grid elements as in the mesh3 5 to achieve accurate results in all the simulations of this work the mesh resolutions were in the range of 600 000 800 000 in order to achieve both accuracy and speed in the numerical simulations to verify that the artificial numerical diffusion does not pollute our high peclet simulations we have performed a simple test we have considered a narrow channel i e a fracture with slip walls i e uniform velocity field in the channel and slip boundary conditions at the walls and simulated the miscible displacement at r 0 and pe 10000 in this channel all the employed numerical techniques stabilization methods solvers etc were similar to the simulation runs in our porous domains fig a 2 shows the obtained concentration profile at the channel outlet during the displacement the model parameters fracture half length velocity and input diffusion coefficient are also embedded in the figure then we have calculated the output diffusion coefficient using the procedure explained in section 2 4 since the channel walls are slip boundaries there is no taylor dispersion occurring during the displacement therefore the concentration profile at the outlet must indicate a sharp front with a calculated diffusion coefficient equal to the input diffusion coefficient as fig a 2 demonstrates the concentration profile at the outlet shows a sharp front occurring at t d 1 the numerically calculated diffusion coefficient also agrees well with the input diffusion coefficient with an error about 3 7 therefore we may conclude that the artificial diffusion added by the stabilization techniques to our highest peclet number simulations has caused an error about 4 in our results note that at lower peclet numbers this error decreases significantly since far less numerical diffusion will be induced in slower displacements
