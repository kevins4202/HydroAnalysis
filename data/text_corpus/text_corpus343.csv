1715,channel bathymetry data is important to both advanced hydraulic models and mobility analyses yet obtaining bathymetry data at large scales is difficult here we propose a method to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset that can be applied at large scales with high resolution using simple hydraulic models gridded digital elevation model dem data a stream network dataset and an average flow rate for every stream being evaluated the latter two are often available from continental scale streamflow models the approach burns in one of three bathymetric profiles trapezoidal triangular or parabolic into autogenerated cross sections sampled from the dem using spatial averaging the cross sections are then used to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset which provides a realistic initial elevation surface for use in advanced hydraulic models the ability of the bathymetric profiles to replicate maximum depth and hydraulic geometry was tested in the mississippi river basin at 11 sites with observed bathymetry data for the majority of test sites the observed maximum depth fell between the minimum and maximum thalweg depths calculated using the three bathymetric profile shapes with the trapezoidal profile being the most accurate in capturing maximum depth relative depth error of 4 2 based on hydraulic geometry the triangular bathymetric profile performed best in the smaller streams while the trapezoid performed best in larger rivers a test case along the missouri river showed the topobathymetric dataset generated is easily implemented into advanced hydraulic models keywords riverine bathymetry autoroute continental scale hec ras 2d mobility data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction riverine bathymetry data is often a requirement in advanced hydraulic models and vehicle mobility models advanced hydraulic models use riverine bathymetry data to define the channel characteristics of rivers being simulated aronica et al 1998 neal et al 2015 savant et al 2019 trigg et al 2009 wing et al 2019 vehicle mobility models such as the nato reference mobility model wasfy and jayakumar 2021 and the vehicle dynamics module creighton et al 2009 require riverine bathymetry data to help characterize fording and swimming requirements along military routes for both flood modeling applications and mobility assessments high resolution less than 30 m riverine bathymetry data at large scales is needed but often not available measurement of riverine bathymetry data is often costly and time consuming manual measurement of bathymetry data using surveying equipment is localized and is often restricted to smaller streams or limited portions of larger streams and rivers mainly due to cost time and safety concerns acoustic doppler and sonar methods are effective and create dense point clouds of the bathymetric surface conner and tonina 2014 but are typically deployed from boats and are therefore difficult to implement over large river networks aerial based remote sensing platforms have proven beneficial in bathymetric estimation but often perform best in clear and shallow water kinzel et al 2013 legleiter 2015 legleiter et al 2009 marcus and fonstad 2008 pan et al 2015 additionally implementation of both boat based and aerial based bathymetric estimation is typically cost prohibitive at large scales methods have been developed to utilize multiple lidar measurements of a changing water surface in conjunction with hydraulic models to estimate the bathymetric surface smart et al 2009 although accurate in flowing water these methods require an iterative modeling approach that has typically been applied at local scales the recently launched surface water and ocean topography swot mission includes a ka band radar interferometer which is expected to provide data to assist in bathymetric estimation de moraes frasson 2021 but is anticipated for use only in rivers over 100 m wide biancamaria et al 2016 the measurements from swot will not provide channel bathymetry data explicitly thus requiring additional hydraulic relationships or data to estimate the bathymetric surface mersel et al 2013 moramarco et al 2019 schaperow et al 2019 with the limitations in measuring riverine bathymetry data estimating bathymetry data based on hydraulic relationships is common practice one of the most cited studies is leopold and maddock 1953 where power laws are used to relate the width depth and mean velocity of a channel to the bank full discharge using variable degrees of observed data several methods for estimating bathymetry have been proposed including the following 1 simplified bathymetric profiles using tuning parameters follum et al 2020 grimaldi et al 2018 neal et al 2015 schaperow et al 2019 2 entropy approaches moramarco et al 2019 singh and solomon 2022 3 reduced order modeling approaches forghani et al 2022 lee et al 2018 4 gradually varying flow theory neal et al 2021 sampson et al 2015 the method for estimating riverine bathymetry largely depends on the location scale available data and the modeler for instance the channel modification tools u s army corps of engineers usace 2023 and sub grid bathymetry brunner 2016 methods are often employed when developing hec ras 2d flow models although more advanced methods of estimating bathymetry have been successful at larger scales neal et al 2021 sampson et al 2015 typically the simplified bathymetric profiles using tuning parameters have been applied at the continental scale follum et al 2020 grimaldi et al 2018 neal et al 2015 implemented from local to continental scales follum et al 2017 2019 wahl et al 2016 the autoroute model samples a dense network of cross sections on each river segment from a digital elevation model dem due to the limited data requirements autoroute has been used to simulate flood inundation maps over large domains e g a 230 000 km2 area in the midwestern u s and a 109 500 km2 area in the mississippi delta follum et al 2017 as well as in data sparse environments e g the sava river basin follum et al 2016 and luzon philippines wahl et al 2016 to improve flood inundation mapping accuracy for low flow events follum et al 2020 modified autoroute to calculate and burn into each cross section a parabolic bathymetry profile based on the top width of the water surface calculated from the cross section and an estimated base flowrate although flood inundation results did improve the parabolic bathymetry profile shape and the accuracy of the method were not tested furthermore the bathymetry was calculated only internal to the autoroute model within the cross sections not in a continuous dataset usable by advanced hydraulic models or many vehicle mobility models from an application standpoint a tool that requires limited data and can create a continuous topobathymetric surface combined bathymetry with dem data is beneficial to 1 expedite the use of operational two dimensional flood models in the future and 2 provide an input for mobility models creighton et al 2009 mccullough et al 2017 wasfy and jayakumar 2021 the goals of this paper are to 1 modify the autoroute model to account for multiple bathymetric profile shapes 2 develop a method to create topobathymetric datasets that can be applied at local to continental scales 3 test the simulated topobathymetric data against observed bathymetry data 4 test multiple sources of flow data for use in simulating bathymetry data and 5 identify limitations of creating bathymetric or topobathymetric data at the continental scale all of these goals lead to the main objective and contribution of this paper providing a method to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset channel bathymetry only that can be applied at large scales with high resolution using simple hydraulic models gridded digital elevation model dem data a stream network dataset and an average flow rate for every stream being evaluated the latter two are often available from continental scale streamflow models using only the datasets listed we test the modified autoroute model against observed bathymetry data at 11 locations within the mississippi river basin ranging in baseflow rates from approximately 11 to over 18 000 m 3 s 1 2 methodology previous development efforts to autoroute and the autoroute postprocessing arpp have focused on improvement in flood inundation capabilities while the focus of the current development is to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset for use by other applications namely advanced flood inundation models and mobility models fig 1 summarizes the data requirements and existing capabilities of autoroute and arpp also shown in fig 1 are the proposed modifications to fulfill the goals of this paper to account for multiple bathymetric profile shapes and to create a continuous topobathymetric surface the modifications to autoroute and arpp will be tested against observed bathymetry data to determine accuracy of the proposed methods as well as identify limitations of creating a bathymetric or topobathymetric data at the continental scale to facilitate widespread application of the proposed methods a key component discussed will be the source of baseflow data to drive the bathymetry estimation method 2 1 autoroute model autoroute is a grid based model originally developed to support mobility gap crossing analyses for the military follum 2013 mckinley et al 2012 because of the simplicity and computational efficiency of the model it has more recently been utilized for flood inundation mapping although it s simplicity i e normal depth assumption leads to errors in areas near the coast and areas affected by backwater it performs well in many inland riverine environments afshari et al 2018 follum et al 2019 gutenson et al 2023 tavakoly et al 2021 inputs to the model include stream location stream cells in a gridded format gridded dem data gridded land cover data and flow data fig 1 for each stream cell the direction of flow is determined and perpendicular cross sections are sampled from the dem more details provided in follum et al 2017 the water surface within the dem is often represented as a flat surface thus the top width t sc m of the channel can be estimated for each stream cell based on the cross section profile follum et al 2020 unless the flow rate is known when the dem data was collected it is generally assumed that the water surface elevation within the dem represents average flow conditions q b m 3 s 1 for each stream cell autoroute internally uses t sc and q b to estimate a bathymetric profile that has a parabolic shape with a maximum depth z m that is adjusted to pass the user specified q b based on the manning s equation 1 q calc c u n a 5 3 p 2 3 s f 1 2 where q calc m 3 s 1 is the calculated streamflow c u is the unit constant 1 0 for metric units n is manning roughness coefficient assumed 0 03 for bathymetric surfaces based on follum et al 2017 a m 2 is the hydraulic area p m is the wetted perimeter and s f is the hydraulic slope of the channel because normal depth is assumed s f is set equal to the slope of the channel and therefore estimated from the elevation data upstream and downstream of the stream cell being analyzed more explanation found in follum et al 2017 both a and p are calculated based on the assumed parabolic shape using t sc and z follum et al 2020 further describes the method in which a bathymetric profile is estimated and subsequently burned into the cross section profile although parabolic shapes are often utilized to estimate the bathymetric profile schaperow et al 2019 bjerklie et al 2018 trapezoidal and triangular shapes are also often utilized dey et al 2019 neal et al 2015 schaperow et al 2019 usace 2023 the different profiles reflect the different hydrodynamics that occur within streams and rivers but also reflect the different landforms in which the streams and rivers reside therefore autoroute was modified to provide the user the ability to choose from a trapezoidal triangular or parabolic bathymetric profile for the trapezoidal shape the lateral distance from the bank edge to the start of the deepest part of the profile is defined by h m as shown in fig 2 h is calculated as h δ t sc where δ can be defined by the user and has a default value of 0 2 similar to the parabolic shape z is adjusted to pass q b based on the manning s equation in both the trapezoidal and triangular profiles bathymetry profiles in autoroute are calculated within the cross section where each ordinate of the cross section profile represents a cell within the model domain autoroute was also modified to output a raster where each cell value represents the bathymetric ordinate of the cross section fig 1 and fig 3 c 2 2 autoroute postprocessing script arpp follum et al 2020 introduced the arpp script to improve accuracy and computational efficiency of flood map simulations by processing water surface elevations wse in cells that are between the sampled cross section profiles comparable to how arpp is used to fill gaps between the cross sections to create a continuous flood inundation map here arpp is modified to fill gaps between the bathymetric ordinates of the cross section to create a continuous bathymetric and topobathymetric surface fig 3 demonstrates the modifications made within arpp for a test location at the confluence of the nodaway and missouri rivers approximately 18 km northwest of st joseph missouri the test location exhibits two challenging aspects for estimating bathymetry the first challenge is the confluence of the nodaway river with the much larger missouri river continuous transitions between the smaller and larger rivers are important for hydraulic modeling one of the stated goals to create a topobathymetric dataset the second challenge is the water surface in the dem data has several cells that have higher values than their surrounding cells eliminating the assumption that the water surface is flat using 1 3 arc second national elevation dataset ned gesch et al 2002 for the dem dataset and streamlines and flow rates obtained from tavakoly et al 2021 autoroute was simulated to create a bathymetric grid using the parabolic shape an average flow rate from tavakoly et al 2021 was used for q b resulting in simulated flood cells that mimic the water surface cells within the dem see fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the dem and highlights water surface locations where the dem cell values are higher than the surrounding cells fig 3 c shows the bathymetric data from autoroute where cells with bathymetry elevation data b c a r m correspond to ordinates within cross sections from autoroute not all of the cells within the channel are represented with a bathymetry estimate cells not captured by cross sections arpp in follum et al 2020 used water surface elevations of the cells and an inverse distance weighting idw method to fill in the gaps between cross sections to create a continuous flood inundation surface e g fig 3 a isotropic and anisotropic interpolation methods e g idw kriging natural neighbor spline etc are routinely used to fill in missing bathymetric data between measured cross sections merwade 2009 merwade maidment and goff 2006 dey saksena and merwade 2019 although similar approaches could be used to fill in missing bathymetric data due to the dense number of cross sections sampled using autoroute a simple linear interpolation between cross sections is used use of a linear interpolation reduces the computational efficiency compared to other approaches as well as limits the need for potential tuning parameters the goal of the linear interpolation method is to provide a bathymetric elevation value m and a topobathymetry elevation value m for each cell b c and tb c respectively within the domain for each b c a r cell fig 3 c b c is set equal to b c a r any remaining flooded cells are effectively gaps between cross sections b c g a p m fig 3 c and fig 3 d within arpp the closest b c a r cell to the b c g a p cell is identified b c a r 1 and the distance between the two cells d 1 m is calculated a second b c a r cell is also identified b c a r 2 and the distance between b c a r and b c g a p is calculated d 2 m b c a r 2 is selected so that spatially b c g a p is in between b c a r 1 and b c a r 2 b c for the gap cell is then calculated as 2 b c b c a r 1 d 1 b c a r 1 b c a r 2 d 1 d 2 in some instances b c a r 2 cannot be found in which b c g a p is spatially in between b c a r 1 and b c a r 2 in these cases b c for the gap cell is set to the same value as b c a r 1 fig 3 e shows the b c values at the confluence of the nodaway and missouri rivers a topobathymetric dataset is created internally within arpp by setting tb c for all flooded cells to b c and tb c for all non flooded cells to the dem value of that cell fig 3 f shows the tb c values for the test domain at the confluence of the nodaway and missouri rivers fig 4 shows a three dimensional view of the confluence of the nodaway and missouri rivers fig 3 b shows the approximate location of the cross view the top of fig 4 displays the dem while the bottom displays the topobathymetry using the linear interpolation method although no observed bathymetric data was found for this section of river the image clearly shows a continuous bathymetric dataset with a smooth transition no abrupt elevation changes from the smaller nodaway river into the missouri river the accuracy of the depth and shape of the bathymetric profiles will be further tested at locations with observed bathymetry data 2 3 model application in this study we compare estimated bathymetry data using the parabolic triangular and trapezoidal profiles against observed bathymetry data at eleven test locations within the mississippi river basin the observed bathymetry data was collected from the united states geological survey usgs hanson and strange 2021 holnbeck et al 2021 huizinga 2020a 2020b martin 2017 richards et al 2018 whaling and wagner 2021 the format of the observed bathymetry data ranges from individual cross sections holnbeck et al 2021 in a geospatial format to point cloud data sampled using a multibeam echosounder mapping system and an acoustic doppler current profiler huizinga 2020a the observed bathymetry data was projected to a gridded format with a spatial resolution identical to the dem data the dem data used for each test case is the 1 3 arc second ned which is a seamless elevation data set for the united states with an average relative vertical accuracy of 1 64 m gesch et al 2002 streamlines were obtained from tavakoly et al 2021 who based streamlines on the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus dataset horizon systems corporation 2007 mckay et al 2012 flow rates for each test site were obtained from tavakoly et al 2021 as well as the usgs https waterdata usgs gov nwis rt data obtained on 03 nov 2022 tavakoly et al 2021 simulated flow rates for a 10 year period 2005 2014 and accounted for the effects of 175 united states army corps of engineers dams flow rates from tavakoly et al 2021 will be referred to as simulated average flow rates q b s m 3 s 1 for the remainder of this paper q b s was calculated for each test site as the average of the entire flow simulation period table 1 using the available usgs flow data from nearby gage stations the average flow rate referred to as the usgs average flow rate q b u m 3 s 1 is also calculated for each test site q b u is calculated as the average flow rate of all available observed flow data near each test site table 1 the exception is ms31 which does not have flow measurements near the test site for ms31 q b u was set to 37 35 of the simulated flow rate at ms36 6193 5 m 3 s 1 the percentage was based on the difference between q b s at ms31 and ms36 fig 5 shows the eleven test locations the 5th order and above stream locations and the mississippi river basin boundary fig 6 shows a cross section profile at the mo1 site near brownsville nebraska that clearly indicates two different water surface elevations for the missouri river the dem data was therefore processed to lower the water surface on the nebraska side of the dem 272 394 m to the water surface elevation on the missouri side of the dem 268 684 m as also shown in fig 6 this issue of different water surface elevations for rivers that serve as the divide between states was also found and resolved at the ms31 ms37 and ms38 sites autoroute was used to create a gridded bathymetric dataset for each test site the arpp script was then used to fill the bathymetric data to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset the simulated topobathymetric data are grid based with a spatial resolution and extent identical to the dem data cross section profiles of each topobathymetric dataset will be one of the bases for comparing simulated and observed bathymetric data for each test site a line shapefile was placed perpendicular to the stream or river using the mkprofile py script alberti 2020 cross section profiles for the dem observed bathymetric data and simulated bathymetric data are sampled at 10 m increments along the line shapefile at each of the test locations 3 results 3 1 evaluation of bathymetric shape fig 7 shows the cross section profiles sampled from the dem observed bathymetry and estimated bathymetry using the parabolic trapezoidal and triangular profiles test sites with relatively similar q b u and q b s values have similar shapes of the bathymetry profiles see ms38 nc and wi for test sites with larger differences between q b u and q b s values the bathymetric profile shapes are similar but the depths of the bathymetric profiles are noticeably different see ar mo1 and ms37 the test sites with lower flow rates ar in mt nc and wi all have smaller top widths which provides limited space for the three bathymetric profiles to differentiate the mt test site has the smallest q b value and the simulated bathymetric profiles do not match the observed bathymetric profile with the simulated bathymetry datasets having a much shallower profile than the observed dataset there is clearly a discrepancy between where the dem indicates the river is located and where the observed bathymetry indicates the river is located this could partially be due to the close proximity to a bridge crossing the river the mt bathymetry data was measured as part of a bridge scour project holnbeck et al 2021 which also could lead to discrepancies the bathymetric cross section profiles for the other test sites with lower q b values tend to follow well with the observed bathymetric data especially the sites that capture the edges of the banks see ar the top width of the river i e t sc is captured well in the majority of the test sites at the ms36 site the elevation on what appears to be the water surface increases slightly on the right side triggering the autoroute model to assume the edge of water prematurely recall that the elevation profile of ms36 was not corrected such as was done for the mo1 ms31 ms37 and ms38 sites at the ms37 test site both edges of water match well with the elevation profile but the observed bathymetry shows the top width on the left bank occurring earlier than what is shown in the dem incorrect estimation of t sc directly affects the shape and depth of the bathymetric profile for the larger rivers q b 250 m 3 s 1 i e missouri and mississippi rivers mo1 mo2 ms31 ms36 ms37 and ms38 the bigger t sc values provide space for a more pronounced distinction between each bathymetry profile as can be seen in the cross section profiles fig 7 furthermore the bathymetric profile shapes are not completely preserved when conducting the spatial averaging equation 2 in the arpp script as illustrated by how the triangular bathymetric profile does not always have a definitive low point see mo1 each bathymetric profile used in this study assumes that the thalweg of the river is in the middle of the river t sc 2 this assumption is often incorrect in the larger rivers i e missouri and mississippi rivers where the thalweg with the possible exception of mo1 is closer to one of the banks of the river having the thalweg closer to one of the banks in the larger rivers is likely due to a combination of dredging for navigation as well as river hydraulics including three dimensional hydrodynamics around river bends 3 2 evaluation of hydraulic geometry and maximum channel depth although the shape of the channel cross section is important for use in advanced hydraulic models in many cases the shape of the cross section is important only for the calculation of the hydraulic geometry such as a 5 3 p 2 3 in equation 1 for sites ar mo1 mo2 ms31 ms36 and nc the observed and simulated a and p values were calculated based on the cross sections shown in fig 7 only these sites were chosen due to the observed bathymetry being sampled across the entire cross section regardless of whether q b u or q b s values were used the p values from the simulated cross sections were all within 10 of the observed p values the observed and simulated hydraulic geometry values a 5 3 p 2 3 are shown in table 2 simulated hydraulic geometries using q b s performed best at 4 of the 6 test sites comparing simulated hydraulic geometry to the observed hydraulic geometry the parabolic bathymetry profile performed best at 2 sites and the trapezoidal bathymetry profile performed best at 3 sites when using q b u the triangular bathymetry profile performed best at 4 sites and the trapezoidal bathymetry profile performed best at 2 sites when using q b s for application in advanced hydraulic models these results indicate that the hydraulic geometry using the triangular bathymetric profile may match better with the observed bathymetry in smaller streams and the trapezoidal profile may be better suited for use in larger streams the maximum depth of a section of river is important to both river crossing analysis mckinley et al 2012 wasfy and jayakumar 2021 as well as navigation concerns fig 8 compares the observed maximum depth d obs with the simulated maximum depth d sim d obs and d sim are simply the distance between the water surface elevation and the lowest point in the associated cross section profiles shown in fig 7 the distinction between the different bathymetric profiles in the larger rivers results in larger variances in d sim the difference in d sim values between the different bathymetric profiles is smaller for the test sites with lower q b values any points along the 1 1 line in fig 8 indicates the d sim and d obs values are similar the triangular bathymetric profile is always the deepest which is expected when compared to the other two profiles the trapezoidal bathymetric profile is typically the shallowest with the parabolic bathymetric profile being the shallowest in some of the lower flow test sites it is notable that both the parabolic and trapezoidal bathymetric profiles can be adjusted to change the shape of the profiles which could change which profile results in the shallowest maximum depth it is also to note that the d sim value of each cross section profile will also be affected by both the hydraulic slope measured from the dem dataset and channel roughness set constant in this study when using q b u flow rates 6 of the 11 test sites captured the d obs within the range of d sim values range associated with the three different bathymetry profiles used when using q b s flow rates 7 of the 11 test sites captured the d obs within the range of d sim values the relative depth error rde values for each cross section profile are shown in fig 9 and were calculated as 3 rde 100 d sim d obs d obs where rde values 0 indicate that d sim is overestimated and rde values less than 0 indicate that d sim is underestimated as previously discussed the mt site has the least accurate bathymetric estimation and therefore has the highest magnitude rde values for simplicity the mt site is left out of the following discussion the trapezoidal profile when using the q b s flow rate was the most accurate combination of flow and bathymetric profile with an average rde value of 4 2 and a range from 28 6 ms38 to 25 6 ar only the use of a trapezoidal profile when using the q b u flow rate had a smaller range of rde values 42 8 at ms31 to 8 6 at wi although the triangular profile was most accurate at 4 sites when using the q b u flow rate it consistently overestimates the maximum depth resulting in an average rde value of 15 2 when using q b u and 39 0 when using q b s overestimated depth at all 10 sites for both q b s and q b u the parabolic profile had the most even distribution of over and under estimation of depth overestimating at 6 sites when using q b s average rde 10 2 and 4 sites when using q b u average rde 8 1 the average and range of rde values when using the parabolic and trapezoidal profiles compare well with the nonlinear bathymetry estimation in schaperow et al 2019 which in 30 study reaches had rde values ranging from 49 to 15 with an average of 7 1 3 3 use of higher resolution dem data to this point the study has used 1 3 arc second elevation data many locations have higher resolution dem data such as the 1 9 arc second elevation data for much of the u s previous studies have shown that higher resolution elevation data has an effect on flood simulations brandt and lim 2012 cook and merwade 2009 hsu et al 2016 md ali et al 2015 largely due to improved capturing of topographic features such as slopes banks flood control measures i e levees etc here we test if higher resolution elevation data affects the bathymetry estimation at the in and mo2 test sites both test sites use the q b s flow for simulation for these two test sites the elevation of the respective water surfaces are the same in the 1 3 and 1 9 arc second elevation data fig 10 shows the cross section profiles sampled from each test location including elevations from the dem observed bathymetry and estimated bathymetry using the parabolic trapezoidal and triangular profiles the cross sections were once again sampled using the mkprofile py script but this time were sampled at 3 m increments in both test cases the t sc is reduced when going from the coarser 1 3 arc second elevation dataset to the 1 9 arc second elevation dataset for the in test site the t sc is reduced by approximately 2 when going from the 1 3 to the 1 9 arc second data at the mo2 test site the t sc is reduced by less than 1 when going from the 1 3 to the 1 9 arc second data the shape and maximum depth of the bathymetry profiles did not change substantially at the mo2 site for the in site the cross section profile in fig 10 was extended farther than in fig 7 to include the banks of the river at the in site the maximum depth remains similar between profiles using the 1 3 arc second and 1 9 arc second data but the bathymetric profile shapes are more pronounced in the 1 9 arc second data use of higher resolution elevation data provides the ability to represent the banks of a river or stream more accurately which between the two test cases was more evident in the in test site 3 4 use of topobathymetric data within advanced hydraulic models one of the stated benefits of a continuous topobathymetric dataset is for rapid deployment of more advanced hydraulic models such as hec ras 2d using q b s flow rates with the aforementioned streamline data from tavakoly et al 2021 and 1 3 arc second elevation data a topobathymetric dataset was generated for a 1 by 1 domain that encompasses kansas city mo test site mo2 and fig 3 both show examples of the topobathymetric dataset for the domain the domain includes 44 824 stream cells comprising 221 different stream segments using a single 4 2 ghz processor the autoroute simulation took approximately 2 min to sample a cross section for each stream cell and estimate a parabolic bathymetric profile the arpp took an additional 33 s to fill in the missing cells between the cross sections to create a bathymetric and a topobathymetric dataset both in tiff format it is to note when all of the nhdplus streamlines are used in this domain the number of stream cells increases by approximately 15 times and the computational times of autoroute and arpp are closer to those reported in follum et al 2020 the topobathymetric dataset was then used to develop a hec ras 2d model of a 138 km section of the missouri river near kansas city mo extending from weston mo to napoleon mo fig 11 although not explicitly tested the topobathymetric dataset was easily used to create the elevation surface needed to run the hec ras 2d model using the q b s flow rate the topobathymetry dataset provided a realistic initial estimate of the bathymetry within the channel the dem was not preprocessed and therefore some areas were not flat across the river surface resulting in higher than expected water surface elevations a user would be recommended to check and potentially refine the elevation surface possibly by using ras mapper or channel modification tools usace 2023 future work should further explore how the use of simulated topobathymetric datasets affect flood mapping capabilities within advanced hydraulic models these tests should also consider the use of global elevation datasets such as the fabdem dataset hawker et al 2022 4 discussion effort has been made to show the differences in bathymetric estimation when streamgages i e q b u are used versus when streamflow simulations i e q b s are used to approximate flow ultimately it is often unknown what flow rate was occurring when the dem was sampled and in several cases mo1 ms31 ms37 and ms38 the dem was likely sampled on different days with different q b values differences do occur in bathymetric estimation when using q b u versus q b s resulting in differences in hydraulic geometry and maximum channel depth if q b of when the dem was sampled is known it is best to use that value if a streamgage is nearby the test site use of the streamgage to calculate a flow such as the calculation of q b u would be the next recommended option because it uses actual flow measurements use of simulated flows to estimate a representative flow rate such as the calculation of q b s is shown to be a good option but would likely be the third best option due to uncertainties in the flow simulation accuracy at the continental scale the use of simulated flows to estimate bathymetry will likely be required due to the large spatial domain and the fact that every stream reach has flow rate simulation data to calculate an estimated flow examples of these continental scale flow models include the national water model nwm http water noaa gov about nwm for the continental united states the streamflow prediction tool spt snow et al 2016 used by the u s army coastal and hydraulics laboratory chl to simulate streamflows for much of the world and the group on earth observation global water sustainability geoglows hales et al 2022 model which is also operational for much of the world to provide the most accurate simulated results use of a continental scale flow model that accounts for dams is recommended tavakoly et al 2021 gutenson et al 2020 because the proposed approach uses readily available elevation data and data from continental scale flow models future application at large scales including continental scale is possible vehicle mobility models such as the nato reference mobility model often require riverine bathymetry data to help characterize fording and swimming requirements along military routes the original purpose of autoroute follum 2013 mckinley et al 2012 was to assist in providing cross section information to mobility models in areas with ephemeral streams where no bathymetry estimation was required follum et al 2020 added bathymetry estimation into autoroute to improve flood inundation mapping but also to expand the use of the cross section information to be used by mobility models in perennial streams although cross section profiles are useful in some mobility applications such as the vehicle dynamics module creighton et al 2009 bathymetry data in a two or three dimensional format is often more beneficial this work has further expanded the capabilities of autoroute and arpp to create continuous topobathymetric datasets over large domains that can readily be used in conjunction with flow and flood models to inform vehicle mobility models the maximum depth of a channel is often a consideration within mobility models instead of using a single bathymetric profile it is recommended that a range of maximum depths for each stream segment be determined by utilizing an ensemble of bathymetric profiles hydraulic models continue to advance in capabilities by capturing more of the flow physics utilizing higher resolution data and operating at larger spatial domains the methods outlined in this paper to create topobathymetric data can be applied at scales ranging from local to continental however limitations in needing a flat water surface in the cross sections will likely require further modifications to autoroute or preprocessing of the dem data nonetheless the methods outlined provide a path forward for estimating riverine bathymetry data in inland areas that currently do not have observed data although the parabolic shape was originally used in the autoroute model based on the results of this study the newly added trapezoidal and triangular profiles provide the most reasonable estimates of hydraulic geometry for use in advanced hydraulic models and are therefore recommended for future applications before using the models or methods discussed in this paper there are several limitations and assumptions that should be recognized the limitations of the simple hydraulic models utilized have previously been discussed in literature afshari et al 2018 follum 2013 follum et al 2017 follum et al 2020 gutenson et al 2023 but mainly relate to the muskingum approach used in the flow simulation and the normal depth assumption used in the flood inundation model which also assumes the entire channel including bathymetry is actively conveying water in addition this study assumes a flow rate that represents the water surface in the dem can be estimated from gage or simulated flow data future work should focus on diversified means of finding the t sc in the chosen dem data including use of globally available datasets e g hawker et al 2022 we ve noted several limitations in our current approach to identifying t sc by finding the bank points in the dem these limitations are inconsistent water surface profiles in the dem and discrepancies between where the dem indicates the river is located and where the observed bathymetry indicates the river is located to go along with an overall lack of identified bank points for smaller streams future investigations should focus on utilizing remote sensing datasets to estimate t sc e g yamazaki et al 2014 or utilizing geomorphic relationships like those first outlined by leopold and maddock 1953 5 conclusions despite the importance of channel bathymetry data obtaining the data at large scales is difficult this paper described a method to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset using simple hydraulic models a gridded digital elevation model dem dataset a stream network dataset and a flow rate for every stream being evaluated the latter two data requirements are often available from continental scale streamflow models because the datasets needed are near globally available the methods can be applied at large scales while accounting for both small and large channels the approach burns in one of three bathymetric profiles trapezoidal triangular or parabolic into autogenerated cross sections sampled from the dem using a linear interpolation approach the cross sections are then used to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset the method was tested in the mississippi river basin at 11 sites with observed bathymetry data the following is a list of our key findings the flow rate corresponding to the water surface elevation within the dem is often unknown average flow rates from local streamgages q b u and continental scale streamflow models q b s were used with the results indicating both approaches result in similar accuracy of bathymetric profiles although measured flow rates may be preferred for large scale applications the use of simulated streamflow data will likely be required due to the availability of the data all three bathymetric profile shapes performed reasonably well at the test sites 1 of the 11 site was omitted from some of the evaluations overall the hydraulic geometry of the trapezoidal and triangular bathymetric profiles matched best with the observed bathymetry although the number of test sites was limited it is recommended that the triangular bathymetric profile be used in smaller streams rivers and the trapezoidal bathymetric profile be used in larger streams rivers q b u 250 m 3 s 1 or q b s 250 m 3 s 1 the triangular bathymetry profile always had the deepest maximum depth d sim and the trapezoidal bathymetry profile typically had the shallowest d sim for 13 of the 22 tests 2 sources of flow rate data used at 11 test sites the observed maximum depth of the channel was captured within the range of d sim values range associated with the three different bathymetry profiles used bathymetry is estimated assuming a flat water surface across the stream or river although high quality dem data were used in this study the water surface was not always flat in the sampled cross sections especially in rivers that also serve as the boundary between states a preprocessing step was implemented to ensure flat water surfaces at the test sites a similar approach will likely be required before utilizing the bathymetry estimation approach at large scales the methods outlined create a continuous topobathymetric surface with smooth transitions no abrupt elevation changes at confluences of rivers which is beneficial in simulating flows in more advanced hydraulic models a topobathymetric dataset was generated for a 1 by 1 domain that includes a section of the missouri river this topobathymetric dataset was easily used to develop a hec ras 2d model although a user would be recommended to check and potentially modify the elevation surface the topobathymetry dataset provided a realistic initial estimate of the bathymetry within the channel credit authorship contribution statement michael l follum conceptualization

1715,channel bathymetry data is important to both advanced hydraulic models and mobility analyses yet obtaining bathymetry data at large scales is difficult here we propose a method to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset that can be applied at large scales with high resolution using simple hydraulic models gridded digital elevation model dem data a stream network dataset and an average flow rate for every stream being evaluated the latter two are often available from continental scale streamflow models the approach burns in one of three bathymetric profiles trapezoidal triangular or parabolic into autogenerated cross sections sampled from the dem using spatial averaging the cross sections are then used to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset which provides a realistic initial elevation surface for use in advanced hydraulic models the ability of the bathymetric profiles to replicate maximum depth and hydraulic geometry was tested in the mississippi river basin at 11 sites with observed bathymetry data for the majority of test sites the observed maximum depth fell between the minimum and maximum thalweg depths calculated using the three bathymetric profile shapes with the trapezoidal profile being the most accurate in capturing maximum depth relative depth error of 4 2 based on hydraulic geometry the triangular bathymetric profile performed best in the smaller streams while the trapezoid performed best in larger rivers a test case along the missouri river showed the topobathymetric dataset generated is easily implemented into advanced hydraulic models keywords riverine bathymetry autoroute continental scale hec ras 2d mobility data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction riverine bathymetry data is often a requirement in advanced hydraulic models and vehicle mobility models advanced hydraulic models use riverine bathymetry data to define the channel characteristics of rivers being simulated aronica et al 1998 neal et al 2015 savant et al 2019 trigg et al 2009 wing et al 2019 vehicle mobility models such as the nato reference mobility model wasfy and jayakumar 2021 and the vehicle dynamics module creighton et al 2009 require riverine bathymetry data to help characterize fording and swimming requirements along military routes for both flood modeling applications and mobility assessments high resolution less than 30 m riverine bathymetry data at large scales is needed but often not available measurement of riverine bathymetry data is often costly and time consuming manual measurement of bathymetry data using surveying equipment is localized and is often restricted to smaller streams or limited portions of larger streams and rivers mainly due to cost time and safety concerns acoustic doppler and sonar methods are effective and create dense point clouds of the bathymetric surface conner and tonina 2014 but are typically deployed from boats and are therefore difficult to implement over large river networks aerial based remote sensing platforms have proven beneficial in bathymetric estimation but often perform best in clear and shallow water kinzel et al 2013 legleiter 2015 legleiter et al 2009 marcus and fonstad 2008 pan et al 2015 additionally implementation of both boat based and aerial based bathymetric estimation is typically cost prohibitive at large scales methods have been developed to utilize multiple lidar measurements of a changing water surface in conjunction with hydraulic models to estimate the bathymetric surface smart et al 2009 although accurate in flowing water these methods require an iterative modeling approach that has typically been applied at local scales the recently launched surface water and ocean topography swot mission includes a ka band radar interferometer which is expected to provide data to assist in bathymetric estimation de moraes frasson 2021 but is anticipated for use only in rivers over 100 m wide biancamaria et al 2016 the measurements from swot will not provide channel bathymetry data explicitly thus requiring additional hydraulic relationships or data to estimate the bathymetric surface mersel et al 2013 moramarco et al 2019 schaperow et al 2019 with the limitations in measuring riverine bathymetry data estimating bathymetry data based on hydraulic relationships is common practice one of the most cited studies is leopold and maddock 1953 where power laws are used to relate the width depth and mean velocity of a channel to the bank full discharge using variable degrees of observed data several methods for estimating bathymetry have been proposed including the following 1 simplified bathymetric profiles using tuning parameters follum et al 2020 grimaldi et al 2018 neal et al 2015 schaperow et al 2019 2 entropy approaches moramarco et al 2019 singh and solomon 2022 3 reduced order modeling approaches forghani et al 2022 lee et al 2018 4 gradually varying flow theory neal et al 2021 sampson et al 2015 the method for estimating riverine bathymetry largely depends on the location scale available data and the modeler for instance the channel modification tools u s army corps of engineers usace 2023 and sub grid bathymetry brunner 2016 methods are often employed when developing hec ras 2d flow models although more advanced methods of estimating bathymetry have been successful at larger scales neal et al 2021 sampson et al 2015 typically the simplified bathymetric profiles using tuning parameters have been applied at the continental scale follum et al 2020 grimaldi et al 2018 neal et al 2015 implemented from local to continental scales follum et al 2017 2019 wahl et al 2016 the autoroute model samples a dense network of cross sections on each river segment from a digital elevation model dem due to the limited data requirements autoroute has been used to simulate flood inundation maps over large domains e g a 230 000 km2 area in the midwestern u s and a 109 500 km2 area in the mississippi delta follum et al 2017 as well as in data sparse environments e g the sava river basin follum et al 2016 and luzon philippines wahl et al 2016 to improve flood inundation mapping accuracy for low flow events follum et al 2020 modified autoroute to calculate and burn into each cross section a parabolic bathymetry profile based on the top width of the water surface calculated from the cross section and an estimated base flowrate although flood inundation results did improve the parabolic bathymetry profile shape and the accuracy of the method were not tested furthermore the bathymetry was calculated only internal to the autoroute model within the cross sections not in a continuous dataset usable by advanced hydraulic models or many vehicle mobility models from an application standpoint a tool that requires limited data and can create a continuous topobathymetric surface combined bathymetry with dem data is beneficial to 1 expedite the use of operational two dimensional flood models in the future and 2 provide an input for mobility models creighton et al 2009 mccullough et al 2017 wasfy and jayakumar 2021 the goals of this paper are to 1 modify the autoroute model to account for multiple bathymetric profile shapes 2 develop a method to create topobathymetric datasets that can be applied at local to continental scales 3 test the simulated topobathymetric data against observed bathymetry data 4 test multiple sources of flow data for use in simulating bathymetry data and 5 identify limitations of creating bathymetric or topobathymetric data at the continental scale all of these goals lead to the main objective and contribution of this paper providing a method to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset channel bathymetry only that can be applied at large scales with high resolution using simple hydraulic models gridded digital elevation model dem data a stream network dataset and an average flow rate for every stream being evaluated the latter two are often available from continental scale streamflow models using only the datasets listed we test the modified autoroute model against observed bathymetry data at 11 locations within the mississippi river basin ranging in baseflow rates from approximately 11 to over 18 000 m 3 s 1 2 methodology previous development efforts to autoroute and the autoroute postprocessing arpp have focused on improvement in flood inundation capabilities while the focus of the current development is to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset for use by other applications namely advanced flood inundation models and mobility models fig 1 summarizes the data requirements and existing capabilities of autoroute and arpp also shown in fig 1 are the proposed modifications to fulfill the goals of this paper to account for multiple bathymetric profile shapes and to create a continuous topobathymetric surface the modifications to autoroute and arpp will be tested against observed bathymetry data to determine accuracy of the proposed methods as well as identify limitations of creating a bathymetric or topobathymetric data at the continental scale to facilitate widespread application of the proposed methods a key component discussed will be the source of baseflow data to drive the bathymetry estimation method 2 1 autoroute model autoroute is a grid based model originally developed to support mobility gap crossing analyses for the military follum 2013 mckinley et al 2012 because of the simplicity and computational efficiency of the model it has more recently been utilized for flood inundation mapping although it s simplicity i e normal depth assumption leads to errors in areas near the coast and areas affected by backwater it performs well in many inland riverine environments afshari et al 2018 follum et al 2019 gutenson et al 2023 tavakoly et al 2021 inputs to the model include stream location stream cells in a gridded format gridded dem data gridded land cover data and flow data fig 1 for each stream cell the direction of flow is determined and perpendicular cross sections are sampled from the dem more details provided in follum et al 2017 the water surface within the dem is often represented as a flat surface thus the top width t sc m of the channel can be estimated for each stream cell based on the cross section profile follum et al 2020 unless the flow rate is known when the dem data was collected it is generally assumed that the water surface elevation within the dem represents average flow conditions q b m 3 s 1 for each stream cell autoroute internally uses t sc and q b to estimate a bathymetric profile that has a parabolic shape with a maximum depth z m that is adjusted to pass the user specified q b based on the manning s equation 1 q calc c u n a 5 3 p 2 3 s f 1 2 where q calc m 3 s 1 is the calculated streamflow c u is the unit constant 1 0 for metric units n is manning roughness coefficient assumed 0 03 for bathymetric surfaces based on follum et al 2017 a m 2 is the hydraulic area p m is the wetted perimeter and s f is the hydraulic slope of the channel because normal depth is assumed s f is set equal to the slope of the channel and therefore estimated from the elevation data upstream and downstream of the stream cell being analyzed more explanation found in follum et al 2017 both a and p are calculated based on the assumed parabolic shape using t sc and z follum et al 2020 further describes the method in which a bathymetric profile is estimated and subsequently burned into the cross section profile although parabolic shapes are often utilized to estimate the bathymetric profile schaperow et al 2019 bjerklie et al 2018 trapezoidal and triangular shapes are also often utilized dey et al 2019 neal et al 2015 schaperow et al 2019 usace 2023 the different profiles reflect the different hydrodynamics that occur within streams and rivers but also reflect the different landforms in which the streams and rivers reside therefore autoroute was modified to provide the user the ability to choose from a trapezoidal triangular or parabolic bathymetric profile for the trapezoidal shape the lateral distance from the bank edge to the start of the deepest part of the profile is defined by h m as shown in fig 2 h is calculated as h δ t sc where δ can be defined by the user and has a default value of 0 2 similar to the parabolic shape z is adjusted to pass q b based on the manning s equation in both the trapezoidal and triangular profiles bathymetry profiles in autoroute are calculated within the cross section where each ordinate of the cross section profile represents a cell within the model domain autoroute was also modified to output a raster where each cell value represents the bathymetric ordinate of the cross section fig 1 and fig 3 c 2 2 autoroute postprocessing script arpp follum et al 2020 introduced the arpp script to improve accuracy and computational efficiency of flood map simulations by processing water surface elevations wse in cells that are between the sampled cross section profiles comparable to how arpp is used to fill gaps between the cross sections to create a continuous flood inundation map here arpp is modified to fill gaps between the bathymetric ordinates of the cross section to create a continuous bathymetric and topobathymetric surface fig 3 demonstrates the modifications made within arpp for a test location at the confluence of the nodaway and missouri rivers approximately 18 km northwest of st joseph missouri the test location exhibits two challenging aspects for estimating bathymetry the first challenge is the confluence of the nodaway river with the much larger missouri river continuous transitions between the smaller and larger rivers are important for hydraulic modeling one of the stated goals to create a topobathymetric dataset the second challenge is the water surface in the dem data has several cells that have higher values than their surrounding cells eliminating the assumption that the water surface is flat using 1 3 arc second national elevation dataset ned gesch et al 2002 for the dem dataset and streamlines and flow rates obtained from tavakoly et al 2021 autoroute was simulated to create a bathymetric grid using the parabolic shape an average flow rate from tavakoly et al 2021 was used for q b resulting in simulated flood cells that mimic the water surface cells within the dem see fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the dem and highlights water surface locations where the dem cell values are higher than the surrounding cells fig 3 c shows the bathymetric data from autoroute where cells with bathymetry elevation data b c a r m correspond to ordinates within cross sections from autoroute not all of the cells within the channel are represented with a bathymetry estimate cells not captured by cross sections arpp in follum et al 2020 used water surface elevations of the cells and an inverse distance weighting idw method to fill in the gaps between cross sections to create a continuous flood inundation surface e g fig 3 a isotropic and anisotropic interpolation methods e g idw kriging natural neighbor spline etc are routinely used to fill in missing bathymetric data between measured cross sections merwade 2009 merwade maidment and goff 2006 dey saksena and merwade 2019 although similar approaches could be used to fill in missing bathymetric data due to the dense number of cross sections sampled using autoroute a simple linear interpolation between cross sections is used use of a linear interpolation reduces the computational efficiency compared to other approaches as well as limits the need for potential tuning parameters the goal of the linear interpolation method is to provide a bathymetric elevation value m and a topobathymetry elevation value m for each cell b c and tb c respectively within the domain for each b c a r cell fig 3 c b c is set equal to b c a r any remaining flooded cells are effectively gaps between cross sections b c g a p m fig 3 c and fig 3 d within arpp the closest b c a r cell to the b c g a p cell is identified b c a r 1 and the distance between the two cells d 1 m is calculated a second b c a r cell is also identified b c a r 2 and the distance between b c a r and b c g a p is calculated d 2 m b c a r 2 is selected so that spatially b c g a p is in between b c a r 1 and b c a r 2 b c for the gap cell is then calculated as 2 b c b c a r 1 d 1 b c a r 1 b c a r 2 d 1 d 2 in some instances b c a r 2 cannot be found in which b c g a p is spatially in between b c a r 1 and b c a r 2 in these cases b c for the gap cell is set to the same value as b c a r 1 fig 3 e shows the b c values at the confluence of the nodaway and missouri rivers a topobathymetric dataset is created internally within arpp by setting tb c for all flooded cells to b c and tb c for all non flooded cells to the dem value of that cell fig 3 f shows the tb c values for the test domain at the confluence of the nodaway and missouri rivers fig 4 shows a three dimensional view of the confluence of the nodaway and missouri rivers fig 3 b shows the approximate location of the cross view the top of fig 4 displays the dem while the bottom displays the topobathymetry using the linear interpolation method although no observed bathymetric data was found for this section of river the image clearly shows a continuous bathymetric dataset with a smooth transition no abrupt elevation changes from the smaller nodaway river into the missouri river the accuracy of the depth and shape of the bathymetric profiles will be further tested at locations with observed bathymetry data 2 3 model application in this study we compare estimated bathymetry data using the parabolic triangular and trapezoidal profiles against observed bathymetry data at eleven test locations within the mississippi river basin the observed bathymetry data was collected from the united states geological survey usgs hanson and strange 2021 holnbeck et al 2021 huizinga 2020a 2020b martin 2017 richards et al 2018 whaling and wagner 2021 the format of the observed bathymetry data ranges from individual cross sections holnbeck et al 2021 in a geospatial format to point cloud data sampled using a multibeam echosounder mapping system and an acoustic doppler current profiler huizinga 2020a the observed bathymetry data was projected to a gridded format with a spatial resolution identical to the dem data the dem data used for each test case is the 1 3 arc second ned which is a seamless elevation data set for the united states with an average relative vertical accuracy of 1 64 m gesch et al 2002 streamlines were obtained from tavakoly et al 2021 who based streamlines on the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus dataset horizon systems corporation 2007 mckay et al 2012 flow rates for each test site were obtained from tavakoly et al 2021 as well as the usgs https waterdata usgs gov nwis rt data obtained on 03 nov 2022 tavakoly et al 2021 simulated flow rates for a 10 year period 2005 2014 and accounted for the effects of 175 united states army corps of engineers dams flow rates from tavakoly et al 2021 will be referred to as simulated average flow rates q b s m 3 s 1 for the remainder of this paper q b s was calculated for each test site as the average of the entire flow simulation period table 1 using the available usgs flow data from nearby gage stations the average flow rate referred to as the usgs average flow rate q b u m 3 s 1 is also calculated for each test site q b u is calculated as the average flow rate of all available observed flow data near each test site table 1 the exception is ms31 which does not have flow measurements near the test site for ms31 q b u was set to 37 35 of the simulated flow rate at ms36 6193 5 m 3 s 1 the percentage was based on the difference between q b s at ms31 and ms36 fig 5 shows the eleven test locations the 5th order and above stream locations and the mississippi river basin boundary fig 6 shows a cross section profile at the mo1 site near brownsville nebraska that clearly indicates two different water surface elevations for the missouri river the dem data was therefore processed to lower the water surface on the nebraska side of the dem 272 394 m to the water surface elevation on the missouri side of the dem 268 684 m as also shown in fig 6 this issue of different water surface elevations for rivers that serve as the divide between states was also found and resolved at the ms31 ms37 and ms38 sites autoroute was used to create a gridded bathymetric dataset for each test site the arpp script was then used to fill the bathymetric data to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset the simulated topobathymetric data are grid based with a spatial resolution and extent identical to the dem data cross section profiles of each topobathymetric dataset will be one of the bases for comparing simulated and observed bathymetric data for each test site a line shapefile was placed perpendicular to the stream or river using the mkprofile py script alberti 2020 cross section profiles for the dem observed bathymetric data and simulated bathymetric data are sampled at 10 m increments along the line shapefile at each of the test locations 3 results 3 1 evaluation of bathymetric shape fig 7 shows the cross section profiles sampled from the dem observed bathymetry and estimated bathymetry using the parabolic trapezoidal and triangular profiles test sites with relatively similar q b u and q b s values have similar shapes of the bathymetry profiles see ms38 nc and wi for test sites with larger differences between q b u and q b s values the bathymetric profile shapes are similar but the depths of the bathymetric profiles are noticeably different see ar mo1 and ms37 the test sites with lower flow rates ar in mt nc and wi all have smaller top widths which provides limited space for the three bathymetric profiles to differentiate the mt test site has the smallest q b value and the simulated bathymetric profiles do not match the observed bathymetric profile with the simulated bathymetry datasets having a much shallower profile than the observed dataset there is clearly a discrepancy between where the dem indicates the river is located and where the observed bathymetry indicates the river is located this could partially be due to the close proximity to a bridge crossing the river the mt bathymetry data was measured as part of a bridge scour project holnbeck et al 2021 which also could lead to discrepancies the bathymetric cross section profiles for the other test sites with lower q b values tend to follow well with the observed bathymetric data especially the sites that capture the edges of the banks see ar the top width of the river i e t sc is captured well in the majority of the test sites at the ms36 site the elevation on what appears to be the water surface increases slightly on the right side triggering the autoroute model to assume the edge of water prematurely recall that the elevation profile of ms36 was not corrected such as was done for the mo1 ms31 ms37 and ms38 sites at the ms37 test site both edges of water match well with the elevation profile but the observed bathymetry shows the top width on the left bank occurring earlier than what is shown in the dem incorrect estimation of t sc directly affects the shape and depth of the bathymetric profile for the larger rivers q b 250 m 3 s 1 i e missouri and mississippi rivers mo1 mo2 ms31 ms36 ms37 and ms38 the bigger t sc values provide space for a more pronounced distinction between each bathymetry profile as can be seen in the cross section profiles fig 7 furthermore the bathymetric profile shapes are not completely preserved when conducting the spatial averaging equation 2 in the arpp script as illustrated by how the triangular bathymetric profile does not always have a definitive low point see mo1 each bathymetric profile used in this study assumes that the thalweg of the river is in the middle of the river t sc 2 this assumption is often incorrect in the larger rivers i e missouri and mississippi rivers where the thalweg with the possible exception of mo1 is closer to one of the banks of the river having the thalweg closer to one of the banks in the larger rivers is likely due to a combination of dredging for navigation as well as river hydraulics including three dimensional hydrodynamics around river bends 3 2 evaluation of hydraulic geometry and maximum channel depth although the shape of the channel cross section is important for use in advanced hydraulic models in many cases the shape of the cross section is important only for the calculation of the hydraulic geometry such as a 5 3 p 2 3 in equation 1 for sites ar mo1 mo2 ms31 ms36 and nc the observed and simulated a and p values were calculated based on the cross sections shown in fig 7 only these sites were chosen due to the observed bathymetry being sampled across the entire cross section regardless of whether q b u or q b s values were used the p values from the simulated cross sections were all within 10 of the observed p values the observed and simulated hydraulic geometry values a 5 3 p 2 3 are shown in table 2 simulated hydraulic geometries using q b s performed best at 4 of the 6 test sites comparing simulated hydraulic geometry to the observed hydraulic geometry the parabolic bathymetry profile performed best at 2 sites and the trapezoidal bathymetry profile performed best at 3 sites when using q b u the triangular bathymetry profile performed best at 4 sites and the trapezoidal bathymetry profile performed best at 2 sites when using q b s for application in advanced hydraulic models these results indicate that the hydraulic geometry using the triangular bathymetric profile may match better with the observed bathymetry in smaller streams and the trapezoidal profile may be better suited for use in larger streams the maximum depth of a section of river is important to both river crossing analysis mckinley et al 2012 wasfy and jayakumar 2021 as well as navigation concerns fig 8 compares the observed maximum depth d obs with the simulated maximum depth d sim d obs and d sim are simply the distance between the water surface elevation and the lowest point in the associated cross section profiles shown in fig 7 the distinction between the different bathymetric profiles in the larger rivers results in larger variances in d sim the difference in d sim values between the different bathymetric profiles is smaller for the test sites with lower q b values any points along the 1 1 line in fig 8 indicates the d sim and d obs values are similar the triangular bathymetric profile is always the deepest which is expected when compared to the other two profiles the trapezoidal bathymetric profile is typically the shallowest with the parabolic bathymetric profile being the shallowest in some of the lower flow test sites it is notable that both the parabolic and trapezoidal bathymetric profiles can be adjusted to change the shape of the profiles which could change which profile results in the shallowest maximum depth it is also to note that the d sim value of each cross section profile will also be affected by both the hydraulic slope measured from the dem dataset and channel roughness set constant in this study when using q b u flow rates 6 of the 11 test sites captured the d obs within the range of d sim values range associated with the three different bathymetry profiles used when using q b s flow rates 7 of the 11 test sites captured the d obs within the range of d sim values the relative depth error rde values for each cross section profile are shown in fig 9 and were calculated as 3 rde 100 d sim d obs d obs where rde values 0 indicate that d sim is overestimated and rde values less than 0 indicate that d sim is underestimated as previously discussed the mt site has the least accurate bathymetric estimation and therefore has the highest magnitude rde values for simplicity the mt site is left out of the following discussion the trapezoidal profile when using the q b s flow rate was the most accurate combination of flow and bathymetric profile with an average rde value of 4 2 and a range from 28 6 ms38 to 25 6 ar only the use of a trapezoidal profile when using the q b u flow rate had a smaller range of rde values 42 8 at ms31 to 8 6 at wi although the triangular profile was most accurate at 4 sites when using the q b u flow rate it consistently overestimates the maximum depth resulting in an average rde value of 15 2 when using q b u and 39 0 when using q b s overestimated depth at all 10 sites for both q b s and q b u the parabolic profile had the most even distribution of over and under estimation of depth overestimating at 6 sites when using q b s average rde 10 2 and 4 sites when using q b u average rde 8 1 the average and range of rde values when using the parabolic and trapezoidal profiles compare well with the nonlinear bathymetry estimation in schaperow et al 2019 which in 30 study reaches had rde values ranging from 49 to 15 with an average of 7 1 3 3 use of higher resolution dem data to this point the study has used 1 3 arc second elevation data many locations have higher resolution dem data such as the 1 9 arc second elevation data for much of the u s previous studies have shown that higher resolution elevation data has an effect on flood simulations brandt and lim 2012 cook and merwade 2009 hsu et al 2016 md ali et al 2015 largely due to improved capturing of topographic features such as slopes banks flood control measures i e levees etc here we test if higher resolution elevation data affects the bathymetry estimation at the in and mo2 test sites both test sites use the q b s flow for simulation for these two test sites the elevation of the respective water surfaces are the same in the 1 3 and 1 9 arc second elevation data fig 10 shows the cross section profiles sampled from each test location including elevations from the dem observed bathymetry and estimated bathymetry using the parabolic trapezoidal and triangular profiles the cross sections were once again sampled using the mkprofile py script but this time were sampled at 3 m increments in both test cases the t sc is reduced when going from the coarser 1 3 arc second elevation dataset to the 1 9 arc second elevation dataset for the in test site the t sc is reduced by approximately 2 when going from the 1 3 to the 1 9 arc second data at the mo2 test site the t sc is reduced by less than 1 when going from the 1 3 to the 1 9 arc second data the shape and maximum depth of the bathymetry profiles did not change substantially at the mo2 site for the in site the cross section profile in fig 10 was extended farther than in fig 7 to include the banks of the river at the in site the maximum depth remains similar between profiles using the 1 3 arc second and 1 9 arc second data but the bathymetric profile shapes are more pronounced in the 1 9 arc second data use of higher resolution elevation data provides the ability to represent the banks of a river or stream more accurately which between the two test cases was more evident in the in test site 3 4 use of topobathymetric data within advanced hydraulic models one of the stated benefits of a continuous topobathymetric dataset is for rapid deployment of more advanced hydraulic models such as hec ras 2d using q b s flow rates with the aforementioned streamline data from tavakoly et al 2021 and 1 3 arc second elevation data a topobathymetric dataset was generated for a 1 by 1 domain that encompasses kansas city mo test site mo2 and fig 3 both show examples of the topobathymetric dataset for the domain the domain includes 44 824 stream cells comprising 221 different stream segments using a single 4 2 ghz processor the autoroute simulation took approximately 2 min to sample a cross section for each stream cell and estimate a parabolic bathymetric profile the arpp took an additional 33 s to fill in the missing cells between the cross sections to create a bathymetric and a topobathymetric dataset both in tiff format it is to note when all of the nhdplus streamlines are used in this domain the number of stream cells increases by approximately 15 times and the computational times of autoroute and arpp are closer to those reported in follum et al 2020 the topobathymetric dataset was then used to develop a hec ras 2d model of a 138 km section of the missouri river near kansas city mo extending from weston mo to napoleon mo fig 11 although not explicitly tested the topobathymetric dataset was easily used to create the elevation surface needed to run the hec ras 2d model using the q b s flow rate the topobathymetry dataset provided a realistic initial estimate of the bathymetry within the channel the dem was not preprocessed and therefore some areas were not flat across the river surface resulting in higher than expected water surface elevations a user would be recommended to check and potentially refine the elevation surface possibly by using ras mapper or channel modification tools usace 2023 future work should further explore how the use of simulated topobathymetric datasets affect flood mapping capabilities within advanced hydraulic models these tests should also consider the use of global elevation datasets such as the fabdem dataset hawker et al 2022 4 discussion effort has been made to show the differences in bathymetric estimation when streamgages i e q b u are used versus when streamflow simulations i e q b s are used to approximate flow ultimately it is often unknown what flow rate was occurring when the dem was sampled and in several cases mo1 ms31 ms37 and ms38 the dem was likely sampled on different days with different q b values differences do occur in bathymetric estimation when using q b u versus q b s resulting in differences in hydraulic geometry and maximum channel depth if q b of when the dem was sampled is known it is best to use that value if a streamgage is nearby the test site use of the streamgage to calculate a flow such as the calculation of q b u would be the next recommended option because it uses actual flow measurements use of simulated flows to estimate a representative flow rate such as the calculation of q b s is shown to be a good option but would likely be the third best option due to uncertainties in the flow simulation accuracy at the continental scale the use of simulated flows to estimate bathymetry will likely be required due to the large spatial domain and the fact that every stream reach has flow rate simulation data to calculate an estimated flow examples of these continental scale flow models include the national water model nwm http water noaa gov about nwm for the continental united states the streamflow prediction tool spt snow et al 2016 used by the u s army coastal and hydraulics laboratory chl to simulate streamflows for much of the world and the group on earth observation global water sustainability geoglows hales et al 2022 model which is also operational for much of the world to provide the most accurate simulated results use of a continental scale flow model that accounts for dams is recommended tavakoly et al 2021 gutenson et al 2020 because the proposed approach uses readily available elevation data and data from continental scale flow models future application at large scales including continental scale is possible vehicle mobility models such as the nato reference mobility model often require riverine bathymetry data to help characterize fording and swimming requirements along military routes the original purpose of autoroute follum 2013 mckinley et al 2012 was to assist in providing cross section information to mobility models in areas with ephemeral streams where no bathymetry estimation was required follum et al 2020 added bathymetry estimation into autoroute to improve flood inundation mapping but also to expand the use of the cross section information to be used by mobility models in perennial streams although cross section profiles are useful in some mobility applications such as the vehicle dynamics module creighton et al 2009 bathymetry data in a two or three dimensional format is often more beneficial this work has further expanded the capabilities of autoroute and arpp to create continuous topobathymetric datasets over large domains that can readily be used in conjunction with flow and flood models to inform vehicle mobility models the maximum depth of a channel is often a consideration within mobility models instead of using a single bathymetric profile it is recommended that a range of maximum depths for each stream segment be determined by utilizing an ensemble of bathymetric profiles hydraulic models continue to advance in capabilities by capturing more of the flow physics utilizing higher resolution data and operating at larger spatial domains the methods outlined in this paper to create topobathymetric data can be applied at scales ranging from local to continental however limitations in needing a flat water surface in the cross sections will likely require further modifications to autoroute or preprocessing of the dem data nonetheless the methods outlined provide a path forward for estimating riverine bathymetry data in inland areas that currently do not have observed data although the parabolic shape was originally used in the autoroute model based on the results of this study the newly added trapezoidal and triangular profiles provide the most reasonable estimates of hydraulic geometry for use in advanced hydraulic models and are therefore recommended for future applications before using the models or methods discussed in this paper there are several limitations and assumptions that should be recognized the limitations of the simple hydraulic models utilized have previously been discussed in literature afshari et al 2018 follum 2013 follum et al 2017 follum et al 2020 gutenson et al 2023 but mainly relate to the muskingum approach used in the flow simulation and the normal depth assumption used in the flood inundation model which also assumes the entire channel including bathymetry is actively conveying water in addition this study assumes a flow rate that represents the water surface in the dem can be estimated from gage or simulated flow data future work should focus on diversified means of finding the t sc in the chosen dem data including use of globally available datasets e g hawker et al 2022 we ve noted several limitations in our current approach to identifying t sc by finding the bank points in the dem these limitations are inconsistent water surface profiles in the dem and discrepancies between where the dem indicates the river is located and where the observed bathymetry indicates the river is located to go along with an overall lack of identified bank points for smaller streams future investigations should focus on utilizing remote sensing datasets to estimate t sc e g yamazaki et al 2014 or utilizing geomorphic relationships like those first outlined by leopold and maddock 1953 5 conclusions despite the importance of channel bathymetry data obtaining the data at large scales is difficult this paper described a method to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset using simple hydraulic models a gridded digital elevation model dem dataset a stream network dataset and a flow rate for every stream being evaluated the latter two data requirements are often available from continental scale streamflow models because the datasets needed are near globally available the methods can be applied at large scales while accounting for both small and large channels the approach burns in one of three bathymetric profiles trapezoidal triangular or parabolic into autogenerated cross sections sampled from the dem using a linear interpolation approach the cross sections are then used to create a continuous topobathymetric dataset the method was tested in the mississippi river basin at 11 sites with observed bathymetry data the following is a list of our key findings the flow rate corresponding to the water surface elevation within the dem is often unknown average flow rates from local streamgages q b u and continental scale streamflow models q b s were used with the results indicating both approaches result in similar accuracy of bathymetric profiles although measured flow rates may be preferred for large scale applications the use of simulated streamflow data will likely be required due to the availability of the data all three bathymetric profile shapes performed reasonably well at the test sites 1 of the 11 site was omitted from some of the evaluations overall the hydraulic geometry of the trapezoidal and triangular bathymetric profiles matched best with the observed bathymetry although the number of test sites was limited it is recommended that the triangular bathymetric profile be used in smaller streams rivers and the trapezoidal bathymetric profile be used in larger streams rivers q b u 250 m 3 s 1 or q b s 250 m 3 s 1 the triangular bathymetry profile always had the deepest maximum depth d sim and the trapezoidal bathymetry profile typically had the shallowest d sim for 13 of the 22 tests 2 sources of flow rate data used at 11 test sites the observed maximum depth of the channel was captured within the range of d sim values range associated with the three different bathymetry profiles used bathymetry is estimated assuming a flat water surface across the stream or river although high quality dem data were used in this study the water surface was not always flat in the sampled cross sections especially in rivers that also serve as the boundary between states a preprocessing step was implemented to ensure flat water surfaces at the test sites a similar approach will likely be required before utilizing the bathymetry estimation approach at large scales the methods outlined create a continuous topobathymetric surface with smooth transitions no abrupt elevation changes at confluences of rivers which is beneficial in simulating flows in more advanced hydraulic models a topobathymetric dataset was generated for a 1 by 1 domain that includes a section of the missouri river this topobathymetric dataset was easily used to develop a hec ras 2d model although a user would be recommended to check and potentially modify the elevation surface the topobathymetry dataset provided a realistic initial estimate of the bathymetry within the channel credit authorship contribution statement michael l follum conceptualization

1716,the study of flood dynamics is generally complicated because it requires a lot of expensive sensors that might be inoperative when submerged during a flood event physical models can be helpful in order to get extra information on flood dynamics but they are expensive in material space occupation and human investment intervention maintenance assistance the objective of this work is a feasibility study on the possibility of using a small 3d printed model to make hydraulic studies for this we focus on the reproduction of a complex phenomenon which is the loop rating curve lrc in natural rivers or large channels rating curve is a relation between stage and discharge under unsteady flow condition rating curve may present a hysteresis behavior reflected by a more or less pronounced loop lrc was historically observed on natural rivers or at large laboratory channels this study is the first investigation of lrc on a small 3d printed laboratory channel we measure stage and discharge at the channel outlet and we obtain rating curves as a response to an unsteady discharge hydrograph imposed at the channel inlet we tested 11 scenarios corresponding to different flow conditions where we varied the following parameters section control freefall or weir channel slope flat 0 1 or sharp 10 time step of the discharge hydrograph 5 s or 10 s our experimental results with a small 3d printed channel are in accordance with experimental observations on large channels or natural rivers and our experimental rating curves are very well simulated by jones formula that is classically used on large channels or rivers these promising results allow the use of 3d printing technique to make small scale hydraulic models a further study of the rating curve but also of other hydraulic characteristics can be considered on more complex geometries and more varied scenarios while paying attention to the scaling which was not the case in this study as real scenarios might be considered this might be of interest from both a pedagogical and an application point of view with a reduced human material and space occupation cost keywords loop rating curve hysteresis unsteady flow small experimental channel data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the study of flood dynamics requires a dense network for monitoring water levels and the corresponding flows at different points of the river network indeed this requires a lot of sensors which can be expensive and they might be inoperative when submerged guinot and gourbesville 2003 during the last years some new no contact technologies e g based on radar sensor and camera images also on board of drones have been introduced and applied with the main aim to monitor river flow during extreme flood conditions bahmanpouri et al 2022 fulton ostrowski 2008 moramarco et al 2017 welber et al 2016 tauro et al 2014 physical models can be helpful in order to get extra information on these dynamics but these models are expensive require space and heavy technical support peña and anta 2021 the flumes dimensions vary in length between few meters and few hundreds of meters and in width and depth between 0 10 and 3 m i e hervouet and petitjean 1999 to overcome these difficulties small laboratory channels 2 to 5 m length 2 to 5 cm width and depth were built to study hydraulic processes at small scale models gaines and maynord 2001 davies et al 2003 maynord 2006 zhang et al 2020 recently majdalani et al 2019 2020 developed an easy to use low cost small size laboratory platform for experiments on channels 4 m length and a rectangular section 3 cm width 5 cm depth equipped with sensors to measure water depth at 1 s time step the resulting data were used in flood routing modelling using hydraulic models moussa and majdalani 2019 currently 3d printing techniques are used to represent case studies on small laboratory channels daladian et al 2018 henry et al 2018 oertel and shen 2022 this work is a feasibility study on the possibility of using a small 3d printed laboratory channel and new video techniques in order to measure stage discharge relationship in a controlled environment the resulting experimental platform could easily be used for teaching because it allows students to visualize measure and then model complex processes that are often difficult to observe in the field the platform is also useful for research in the understanding of flow processes on micro channels it could also be useful in engineering because it allows the construction of reduced models of course with respecting the laws of similarities in this work we focus on the reproduction of a complex phenomenon to our knowledge not studied on small channels which is the stage water level discharge water flow hysteresis or loop rating curve lrc because it requires small time steps e g 1 s measurements during the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph and because it depends on the geometric properties of the channel upstream and downstream conditions and the shape of the hydrograph the identification of rating curve is of great importance in surface hydrology because it permits to deduce reliable discharge values from stage measurements which is crucial in water management and floods drought prediction during extreme natural events hidayat et al 2011 horner et al 2018 kiang et al 2018 under steady flow condition the rating curve is a simple monotonic increasing function simple rating but under unsteady flow condition like a flood event rating curve could have a hysteresis behavior known as loop rating curve lrc if the loop is pronounced the simple monotonic function is replaced by a more complex one where two different discharge values could correspond to one same stage value herschy 1995 the loop is divided into a rising and falling limb corresponding respectively to increasing and decreasing discharge for a given stage the discharge is higher during the rising limb than during the falling limb braca 2008 both simple and loop rating curves are influenced by channel geometry friction slope cross section shape the shape of the discharge hydrograph slow or quick increase and flow conditions section or channel control channel control is the case when downstream waters do not influence upstream waters in this case the simple rating curve can be described by chézy or manning strickler relations conversely section control is a specific cross section characterized by the presence of obstacles sediments rocks weir vegetation etc and that controls to a certain extent upstream waters in this case the discharge can be described by power law relations reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 it is well known that lrc is observed for flat slopes around 0 1 and that it disappears for sharper slopes holmes 2018 also the simple rating curve is deformed and it departs from the one to one stage discharge relation in the presence of aquatic vegetation variable backwater scour and fill sand bed overflow and ponding change to channel cross section ice cover herschy 1995 historically lrc has been most widely observed on natural rivers during high flood events fread 1975 faye and blalock 1984 herschy 1995 westphal et al 1999 petersen øverleir 2006 cheng et al 2019 perret et al 2022 the first method that was used to reproduce lrc hysteresis behavior is jones formula jones 1915 several methods were since developed by introducing some corrections or rectifications to jones formula like di silvio 1969 fread 1975 marchi 1976 faye and cherry 1980 fenton 1999 perumal and ranga raju 1999 fenton and keller 2001 petersen øverleir 2006 perumal et al 2007 reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 dottori et al 2009 and muste et al 2020 it is rare to observe lrc in experimental channels eventually because of the practical difficulty of generating a variable discharge hydrograph with high precision in both time and discharge intensity to our knowledge the only laboratory experiments where lrc was observed were done on the two following large experimental channels i a 10 m long 40 cm wide and 50 cm high channel at kyoto university japan nezu and nakagawa 1994 and ii a 16 8 m long 60 cm wide and 80 cm high channel at école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne epfl switzerland song and graf 1996 in this study we present the first experimental investigation of lrc on a small 3d printed laboratory channel 180 cm long 3 cm wide and 4 cm high the objective is to verify the feasibility of using small 3d printed models to make complex hydraulic studies for that we check here the capacity of such a model to reproduce a rather complex hydraulic phenomenon such as the lrc we generate an experimental flood event consisting of a high precision variable discharge hydrograph after showing the experimental results of rating curves we use the classical jones formula to simulate the ensemble of the rating curves corresponding to different flow conditions in order to check the physical consistency of the results 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup a 3d printed model pla material was generated from the dtm of the var river mouth south east of france http opendata nicecotedazur org used for hydraulic modelling in abily et al 2016 the considered section is about 200 m wide and 10 km long during 1994 flood event the peak discharge has been estimated at 3770 m3 s guinot and gourbesville 2003 we insist on the fact that this is not a scale model in the sense that no similarity study is done here the dimensions width depth of the bed of the small 3d printed channel were chosen according to the characteristics of the feeding pump the objective of this study was to verify the possibility of using a small 3d printed channel to carry out complex hydraulic studies such as the reproduction of lrc the resulting experimental channel is 180 cm long 3 cm wide and 4 cm mean height fig 1 left a peristaltic pump imposes an unsteady discharge hydrograph at the channel input the discharge hydrograph can have any mathematical shape and discharge intensity can be varied at the time step of 1 s this is done due to a special pump control device based on arduino uno where pump rotation speed can be varied automatically each second according to a prescribed voltage information that mimics the mathematical shape of the discharge hydrograph at the channel outlet water is accumulated on two high precision scales 0 1 g precision 30 kg maximum capacity each that permit to measure the discharge at the time step of 1 s with these two scales we are able to test discharge hydrographs with total water consumption up to 60 l we also installed a ruler 0 5 mm precision at the channel outlet to track stage variation in time fig 1 bottom right the ruler is filmed by a webcam during the totality of the flood event the videos are then visually inspected and stage at the channel outlet is determined at the time step of 5 s a fluorescent dye is added to water to facilitate ruler readings by coupling stage and discharge measurements at the channel outlet fig 1 top right for different flow conditions we get the corresponding rating curves by analyzing the measured discharge hydrographs at the channel outlet obtained from scales the discharge experimental error is estimated about 5 ml s thus the measured experimental rating curves are plotted with error bars of 0 5 mm for stage and 5 ml s for discharge in this study we impose at the experimental channel inlet an unsteady discharge hydrograph that has a mathematical shape inspired from the extreme flood event of november 1994 at the var river where data is given at the regular time step of δt flood 1 h fig 2 left we adapt the time step and the discharge intensity to our small 3d printed experimental channel for discharge intensity the maximum of the simulated event is about 100 ml s and the proportional variation of discharge intensities is the same in both real and simulated flood event for time step we test δt flood 5 s and δt flood 10 s that separate regularly two different values of discharge fig 2 right which results in a flood event twice longer for the second time step in this study we call δt flood the time step of the discharge hydrograph the total duration of a simulated flood event is 10 min 2 2 experimental protocol the experimental flood event is imposed at the channel inlet we measure stage and discharge rating curve at the channel outlet for different flow conditions freefall condition at the channel outlet with or without obstacles installation of a weir at the channel outlet with three elevation gaps between weir and channel outlet bed δh weir river 1 cm 0 cm and 1 cm for each of the three elevation gaps we test two contrasted channel slopes flat slope of 0 1 and sharp slope of 10 finally for the flat slope and for weir condition we test two time steps of the variable discharge hydrograph δt flood 10 s and δt flood 5 s therefore in this study we vary the following flow conditions hydrograph time step δt flood 10 s and δt flood 5 s channel slope flat or sharp and channel outlet condition freefall or weir concerning channel slope we test two contrasted slopes a sharp slope 10 and a flat slope 0 1 the purpose is to evaluate the impact of slope on the shape of the rating curves precisely the occurrence of lrc concerning channel outlet condition we test freefall condition with or without obstacles in the latter case obstacles consist of metallic prisms 8 cm3 obstacles partially occlude the channel section and water can still circulate around them fig 3 the aim of introducing obstacles is to simulate the real life situation where river section is partially occluded by rocks sediments and debris of natural or anthropic nature the freefall condition is tested with flat slope and δt flood 10 s after testing the freefall condition we install a weir at the channel outlet the aim is to simulate real life situation at the river mouth where the sea level could vary upward and enters into the river bed because of a storm or a tsunami or an increase of sea level due to global warming therefore we conceived and printed a 3d model consisting of a small basin adapted to the channel outlet geometry and equipped at its end with a weir of different possible elevations in this study we test 3 elevation gaps between the weir and the channel outlet bed h weir h river δh weir river 1 cm 0 cm and 1 cm the latter situation would correspond to an increase of sea level fig 4 illustrates a situation where δh weir river 1 cm with flat channel slope at the minimum and maximum discharges of the hydrograph the ensemble of 11 tested scenarios is detailed in table 1 according to different flow conditions for each tested scenario two replicates were done we then take the mean of the two replicates to represent the scenario result 2 3 rating curves simulation in the literature various methods corresponding to various hydraulic conditions were developed to simulate the lrc dottori et al 2009 we choose the most popular jones formula jones 1915 1a q calc q unsteady q steady 1 1 cs h t 1 2 1b c q steady a where the calculated discharge q calc ml s is assumed to be an unsteady discharge q unsteady ml s q steady ml s is the steady discharge h m is the stage t s is the time s is the local channel slope c m s 1 is the wave celerity a l h m2 the wet area with l 0 03 m is the channel width in jones formula q unsteady is estimated by a correction of q steady by taking into account the time variation of both h and q steady since our flow conditions correspond to a section control rather than channel control q steady is considered to follow a power law equation reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 2 q steady a h b where a and b are the rating curve constants under steady state condition in this study we calculate q unstedy based on the sole information of stage h under unsteady state condition as generally done in literature relative to theoretical calculation of lrc fread 1975 petersen øverleir 2006 muste et al 2020 we evaluate the following discharge 3 q calc a h b 1 1 cs h t 1 2 where the slope s is known and c can be determined by eq 1b we optimize the parameters a and b by minimizing the square error se opt between the measured discharge q mes and q calc 4 se opt i q calc i q mes i 2 to evaluate the total error stemming from experimental discharge measurements 5 ml s for each data point we calculate the se exp error number 5 se exp i 5 ml s 2 where i varies from one to the number of data points in each rating curve to evaluate the performance of the optimization procedure we calculate the ratio rse 6 r se se opt se exp if rse 1 the errors resulting from optimization procedure se opt are less than the errors resulting from discharge measurements se exp in this case we consider that the optimization is successful and that the simulation of the rating curve is very good as we did not pay attention to the scaling we also calculate for all scenarios the froude fr and reynolds re numbers at minimum and maximum discharges of the rating curves 7 fr u gh r e ul ν where g 9 81 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration ν 10 6 m2 s 1 is the kinematic viscosity of water l 0 03 m is the channel width h m is the stage and u m s 1 q mes l h the calculation of these two numbers will help us in the analysis and understanding of the results 3 results experimental rating curves corresponding to freefall condition at the channel outlet without or with obstacles sc1 and sc2 are shown in fig 5 we can see that lrc occurs for both scenarios and that it is more pronounced in the presence of obstacles sc2 this result is in accordance with literature where complex geometry of river section results in looped or non unique ratings herschy 1995 moreover this result is interesting because i it shows that lrc occurs at small size laboratory channel and ii in comparison to large natural rivers this result suggests that it would be possible to observe lrc on a river upstream a natural fall the latter situation has rarely been observed on natural rivers because generally stage discharge monitoring stations are rarely implemented near natural falls experimental rating curves corresponding to weir condition at the channel outlet sc3 to sc11 are shown in fig 6 we can see that for a flat slope and δt flood 10 s lrc occurs for different elevation gaps between weir and channel outlet bed δh weir river 1 cm 0 cm and 1 cm fig 6 sc3 4 5 if we compare fig 5 sc2 and fig 6 sc3 4 5 it seems that lrc is more pronounced in the presence of obstacles that occlude partially the channel section than in the presence of weir that occludes completely the channel section if we reduce the time step of the discharge hydrograph δt flood 5 s lrc still occurs for δh weir river 1 cm but does not partially occur for δh weir river 0 cm and 1 cm fig 6 sc6 7 8 we can deduce that lrc is globally more pronounced for δt flood 10 s than for δt flood 5 s this can be explained by the fact that if δt flood becomes very small at least less than the water wave travel time between the inlet and outlet of the channel the discharge hydrograph at the inlet would tend to a dirac signal and its shape would hardly be reproduced at the outlet in our experimental channel the water wave travel time between the inlet and outlet of the channel is about 3 s to 5 s depending on the slope and the discharge intensity δt flood 5 s is thus a lower limit situation we can guess that if we test a very high value of δt flood much larger than 10 s lrc would also be less pronounced because in this case the discharge hydrograph will tend to a succession of steady states steps rather than a smooth unsteady state lrc would unlikely occur in steady states therefore time resolution of discharge hydrograph has an impact on the occurrence of lrc it should be higher than the water wave travel time between the inlet and outlet but not high enough to break the smoothness of the unsteady discharge hydrograph and lead to a succession of steady discharge steps if the channel slope becomes sharp 10 in our study lrc does not occur for all elevation gaps fig 6 sc9 10 11 specially for δh weir river 1 cm compare sc6 and sc9 in fig 6 this result is in accordance with literature studies on natural rivers where lrc occurs more likely for flat river slopes around 0 1 fread 1975 faye and blalock 1984 holmes 2018 this result is important because it shows that hydraulic behavior in large natural rivers is also reproduced in small 3d printed channel 180 cm long 3 cm wide 4 cm high comparing the froude fr and reynolds re numbers between figs 5 and 6 we see that lrc occurs roughly for fr 0 4 and re 5000 this suggests that lrc is more likely pronounced in fluvial and laminar flow conditions we are aware that our findings on a small 3d printed channel cannot be directly extrapolated to large natural rivers without taking into account the scale variation effect for this reason the non dimensional numbers fr and re could be helpful in future studies as a link between small and large scale hydraulic behavior now we try to simulate the experimental rating curves with jones formula as indicated in section 2 3 rating curves simulation for all scenarios are given in supplemental material figure s1 along with the corresponding stage discharge time variation here we show a selection of simulated rating curves sc1 sc2 sc6 and sc9 that correspond to different flow conditions at the channel outlet fig 7 the results of parameter optimization a b for all scenarios are given in table 2 along with the optimization performance ratio rse eq 6 as for the performance of the optimization procedure table 2 shows that the ratio rse is always 1 for all scenarios we can thus consider that our experimental rating curves are very well simulated by jones formula for different flow conditions whether lrc occurs or not we consider that the simulation result is of great importance because it shows that the hydraulic laws that are used at large natural rivers can be used at small experimental channels therefore the major findings of our study are i our lrc experimental results on a small 3d printed channel are in accordance with experimental observations at a large natural rivers and ii our lrc experimental results obtained on a small 3d printed channel are very well verified by hydraulic laws used for large rivers jones formula this study opens the possibility of using a small 3d scale model to perform complex hydraulic studies in particular it enables to investigate lrc with much more detail on small laboratory channels because it is much easier to control and explore flow condition parameters at small size model rather than at natural size river flow conditions are generally influenced by geometrical parameters and by the discharge hydrograph signal shape of the flood event using the 3d printing technique we are able to explore the geometrical flow parameters by building channels with complex geometry different roughness variable bed slope and different types of section control obstacles weir that would mimic natural situations like the presence of a dam or a confluence or a lake using the high precision pump control device we are able to explore a large panel of discharge hydrographs having different shapes different intensities and different time resolution such future investigation would address the questions of i which parameters make the lrc more pronounced ii does the rising and falling limb of lrc always occur in the same sense rising limb is above falling limb when discharge is expressed as a function of stage iii or are there some situations where the sense of rising and falling limb is reversed rising limb is below falling limb when discharge is expressed as a function of stage as real scenarios are considered this might be of interest from both a pedagogical and an application point of view with a reduced cost human material space occupation 4 discussion 4 1 experimental platform and 3d printing this work is part of the development of a novel platform to study the dampening of water and solute transport in an experimental channel under unsteady flow conditions moussa and majdalani 2019 majdalani et al 2019 majdalani et al 2020 our initial goal in the three aforementioned studies was to have the smallest size of experimental platform that is useful for research project studies teaching activities and that allows to do rational experiments characterized by small space occupation short experimental duration high measurement precision high quality and reproducible experimental curves low water and energy consumption and the possibility to test a large variety of hydrograph scenarios the first application of the platform in 2019 aimed at collecting an important set of experimental data to validate a new flood routing model which enables to evaluate lateral flow either gains or losses in a channel using the analytical solution of the inverse problem of the diffusive wave equation moussa and majdalani 2019 for that we built a 4 m long serpentine channel with 3 cm width and 5 cm height the inflow is introduced at the channel input whereas both lateral gains and losses are uniformly distributed along the channel we realized 62 experimental scenarios corresponding to different shapes of inflow and lateral flow for each experiment three replicates were made this allowed to validate the numerical modelling of water and solute transport and to verify the coherence of the experimental data it also showed an example of use of the platform providing a large set of hydrograph data sets discharge water depth and solute for the purposes of numerical modelling in scientific research kirstetter et al 2021 the work done herein aims to go further in the development of the platform and has a dual purpose the first is technical and it aims to use 3d printing technique to represent a natural channel the second is scientific and it addresses the question whether we could or not observe the stage discharge hysteresis for low water levels and small channel sections for that as a feasibility example we use a 3d printer to build a small distorted model thanks to the digital terrain model of the var river and we incorporate the platform s experimental devices pumps discharge depth and solute measurements etc to simulate the inflows and the eventual lateral gains and losses the results show first that 3d printing enables to build microscale physical models mspm which opens up prospects for various applications 3d printing is easy to use rapid and cheap which can speed up the development and production time of hydraulic models for operational projects 3d printing can create hydraulic models that are more realistic and closer to real world conditions providing a better understanding of how water behaves in real world situations this section discusses i 3d printing models at 1 1 scale ii 3d printed mspm for hydraulic applications iii stage discharge hysteresis 4 2 3d printing models at 1 1 scale 3d printed physical models can be used to simulate real world water flows representing natural channels on a 1 1 scale in the laboratory the objective is to study complex hydraulic phenomena such as runoff genesis on hillslopes erosion solute transfer grains transfer etc understanding these physical processes is essential for applications in fluid mechanics hydrology eco hydrology and environmental sciences the injection of dye also allows identifying path flows as well as obtaining the necessary data for lagrangian and eulerian approaches to study free surface flows this allows i a better understanding of the behavior of runoff process according to environmental conditions and anthropogenic structures ii the study of complex hydraulic characteristics such as turbulence water velocity and flow in natural environments iii the acquisition of numerous accurate spatiotemporal data discharge depth concentration necessary for the validation of hydraulic numerical models for complex upstream downstream and boundary conditions kirstetter et al 2021 iv the development of management solutions 4 3 3d printed mspm for hydraulic applications 3d printing enables also to build mspm of natural rivers for engineering projects like water management studies peña and anta 2021 mspm were first applied on large rivers such as the mississippi gaines and maynord 2001 maynord 2006 or medium size basins 100 km2 davies et al 2003 the realization of mspm with 3d printing for hydraulic applications presents several advantages study of theoretical complex branch networks mignot et al 2008 mignot et al 2013 branched networks can be so easily constructed like y channel with two inlets and one outlet to study the mixing laws of solutes around the confluence or more complex branched networks by increasing the number of pumps used in the experimental platform it would be easy to add punctual or distributed gains losses to different parts of the channel network the development of measuring devices also opens up many application perspectives such as the study on the influence of river flow confluences on the open channel stage discharge relationship wang et al 2019 design verification 3d printed mspm can be used to verify the design of a hydraulic system before starting the production this allows potential problems to be identified and corrected before they become critical optimization of structures 3d printed mspm can help to optimize existing hydraulic systems oertel and shen 2022 shen and oertel 2023 when using a mspm it is possible to identify areas of weakness and therefore suggest improvements it is possible to test various structures and configurations to find the one that offers the best hydraulic performance in addition by using 3d printing it is possible to design more complex hydraulic models with finer details and more precise shapes thus many hydraulic processes around singularities can be easily studied weirs steps waterfalls overbank flow dikes reservoirs etc this allows maximizing the efficiency of existing or new hydraulic systems custom design 3d printed mspm can be designed to meet specific design needs dimensions shapes and materials this allows custom solutions for specific projects different sensors allowing to obtain accurate water discharge depth and concentration data could be integrated in the experimental platform oertel and shen 2022 this is useful to predict scenarios or to replay past scenarios and also to validate approaches such as computational codes and numerical methods kirstetter et al 2021 teaching and training 3d printed mspm can also be used to train technicians and engineers on the principles of hydraulics or as demonstration model to discuss with elected officials stakeholders and the population mspm allow a practical understanding of the theoretical concepts the experimental platform and the example of the var mspm were used for pedagogic purposes like practical works and trainings on courses at both polytech montpellier university of montpellier and polytech nice university of nice côte d azur 4 4 stage discharge hysteresis stage discharge hysteresis is a hydraulic phenomenon that occurs when water flow characteristics vary based on time variation of flow this phenomenon can be observed in several hydraulic situations such as floods water level changes discharge variations etc stage discharge hysteresis studies in river or free surface hydraulics are important to better understand hydraulic phenomena and to develop more accurate predictive models for floods and other hydraulic events lee et al 2017 muste et al 2020 these studies can also help in designing more efficient hydraulic structures to meet varying flow conditions in the field stage discharge hysteresis studies can be done using measurement sensors such as pressure or water level sensors lee et al 2017 however there are few research studies that investigate the possibility of reproducing the hysteresis phenomenon using mspm in free surface hydraulics a main result of this paper is the observation of stage discharge hysteresis relationships on small cross section channels 3 cm width 4 cm height for different configurations of inflows and downstream conditions the use of 3d printing mspm enables to reproduce rivers with complex shapes however the use of 3d printing to reproduce the stage discharge hysteresis phenomenon on mspm requires a more delicate approach as the hysteresis phenomenon depends on many factors such as fluid characteristics flow conditions and river bed properties these results also open many perspectives for applications with different shapes of cross sections and longitudinal profiles of rivers different shapes of flood waves different types of downstream conditions and for specific experimental setups such as hydraulic basins test channels or control valves which control water flow conditions 5 conclusion in this study we have shown the feasibility of using a small 3d printed channel in reproducing complex flood events the platform is easy to use low cost short duration experimentation and low water volume consumption it enables to reproduce complex hydraulic processes on small channels and to provide dense spatiotemporal experimental data necessary for verifying and validating hydraulic models in this context we investigated the complex process of loop rating curve lrc on a small 3d printed channel 180 cm long 3 cm wide 4 cm high under unsteady discharge hydrograph simulation of a flood event we tested 11 scenarios sc1 to sc11 corresponding to different flow conditions where we varied the following parameters section control freefall or weir channel slope flat 0 1 or sharp 10 time step of the discharge hydrograph δt flood 10 s or 5 s in the case of freefall condition we investigated how rating curve is influenced by the presence of obstacles that partially occlude the channel section in the case of weir condition we investigated three elevation gaps between weir and channel outlet bed δh weir river 1 cm 0 cm and 1 cm we found that lrc occurs in a freefall condition sc1 sc2 and that the loop is more pronounced in the presence of obstacles sc2 lrc occurs in a weir condition for different elevation gaps δh weir river sc3 sc4 sc5 the time step of the unsteady discharge hydrograph has an impact on the occurrence of lrc by reducing δt flood from 10 s to 5 s lrc still occurs in some situations sc6 but does not partially occur in other situations sc7 sc8 the slope has a major impact on lrc for a sharp slope condition lrc does not occur sc9 sc10 sc11 which is in accordance with literature observations on large natural rivers all scenarios corresponding to different flow conditions sc1 to sc11 were very well simulated by jones formula that is classically used on large channels or rivers therefore our experimental results on a small 3d printed channel are in accordance with experimental observations on large rivers and they are very well simulated by hydraulic laws used on large rivers jones formula these promising results permit future investigation of lrc with much more detail on small size laboratory channels where flow conditions and channel geometrical parameters are well controlled and can be widely varied in order to test complex flow conditions our experimental platform is complementary to large scale hydraulic laboratories numerical modelling and field data indeed the main interest of its small size remains the short experimental duration which enables to simulate a large variety of high precision hydrograph scenarios of water and solute transport under unsteady flow conditions both lagrangian and eulerian approaches can be studied easily thanks to the dimensions of the model e g study of flood wave routing along the channel lagrangian approach and hysteresis study eulerian approach by increasing the number of pumps and sensors complex branched networks with different inlets and lateral gains and losses can be studied 3d printed physical models can be used to simulate real world water flows representing natural channels on a 1 1 scale in the laboratory to study runoff and erosion processes for applications in hydrology eco hydrology and environmental sciences microscale physical models mspm can be developed for hydraulic applications such as the study of theoretical complex branch networks design verification optimization of structures custom design teaching and training an important point will be the reflection for the model construction regarding similitude defining the scale of the model and verifying similarity scaling laws such as the non dimensional reynolds and froude numbers the experimental 3d printed mspm could be used for teaching for research for engineering and for

1716,the study of flood dynamics is generally complicated because it requires a lot of expensive sensors that might be inoperative when submerged during a flood event physical models can be helpful in order to get extra information on flood dynamics but they are expensive in material space occupation and human investment intervention maintenance assistance the objective of this work is a feasibility study on the possibility of using a small 3d printed model to make hydraulic studies for this we focus on the reproduction of a complex phenomenon which is the loop rating curve lrc in natural rivers or large channels rating curve is a relation between stage and discharge under unsteady flow condition rating curve may present a hysteresis behavior reflected by a more or less pronounced loop lrc was historically observed on natural rivers or at large laboratory channels this study is the first investigation of lrc on a small 3d printed laboratory channel we measure stage and discharge at the channel outlet and we obtain rating curves as a response to an unsteady discharge hydrograph imposed at the channel inlet we tested 11 scenarios corresponding to different flow conditions where we varied the following parameters section control freefall or weir channel slope flat 0 1 or sharp 10 time step of the discharge hydrograph 5 s or 10 s our experimental results with a small 3d printed channel are in accordance with experimental observations on large channels or natural rivers and our experimental rating curves are very well simulated by jones formula that is classically used on large channels or rivers these promising results allow the use of 3d printing technique to make small scale hydraulic models a further study of the rating curve but also of other hydraulic characteristics can be considered on more complex geometries and more varied scenarios while paying attention to the scaling which was not the case in this study as real scenarios might be considered this might be of interest from both a pedagogical and an application point of view with a reduced human material and space occupation cost keywords loop rating curve hysteresis unsteady flow small experimental channel data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the study of flood dynamics requires a dense network for monitoring water levels and the corresponding flows at different points of the river network indeed this requires a lot of sensors which can be expensive and they might be inoperative when submerged guinot and gourbesville 2003 during the last years some new no contact technologies e g based on radar sensor and camera images also on board of drones have been introduced and applied with the main aim to monitor river flow during extreme flood conditions bahmanpouri et al 2022 fulton ostrowski 2008 moramarco et al 2017 welber et al 2016 tauro et al 2014 physical models can be helpful in order to get extra information on these dynamics but these models are expensive require space and heavy technical support peña and anta 2021 the flumes dimensions vary in length between few meters and few hundreds of meters and in width and depth between 0 10 and 3 m i e hervouet and petitjean 1999 to overcome these difficulties small laboratory channels 2 to 5 m length 2 to 5 cm width and depth were built to study hydraulic processes at small scale models gaines and maynord 2001 davies et al 2003 maynord 2006 zhang et al 2020 recently majdalani et al 2019 2020 developed an easy to use low cost small size laboratory platform for experiments on channels 4 m length and a rectangular section 3 cm width 5 cm depth equipped with sensors to measure water depth at 1 s time step the resulting data were used in flood routing modelling using hydraulic models moussa and majdalani 2019 currently 3d printing techniques are used to represent case studies on small laboratory channels daladian et al 2018 henry et al 2018 oertel and shen 2022 this work is a feasibility study on the possibility of using a small 3d printed laboratory channel and new video techniques in order to measure stage discharge relationship in a controlled environment the resulting experimental platform could easily be used for teaching because it allows students to visualize measure and then model complex processes that are often difficult to observe in the field the platform is also useful for research in the understanding of flow processes on micro channels it could also be useful in engineering because it allows the construction of reduced models of course with respecting the laws of similarities in this work we focus on the reproduction of a complex phenomenon to our knowledge not studied on small channels which is the stage water level discharge water flow hysteresis or loop rating curve lrc because it requires small time steps e g 1 s measurements during the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph and because it depends on the geometric properties of the channel upstream and downstream conditions and the shape of the hydrograph the identification of rating curve is of great importance in surface hydrology because it permits to deduce reliable discharge values from stage measurements which is crucial in water management and floods drought prediction during extreme natural events hidayat et al 2011 horner et al 2018 kiang et al 2018 under steady flow condition the rating curve is a simple monotonic increasing function simple rating but under unsteady flow condition like a flood event rating curve could have a hysteresis behavior known as loop rating curve lrc if the loop is pronounced the simple monotonic function is replaced by a more complex one where two different discharge values could correspond to one same stage value herschy 1995 the loop is divided into a rising and falling limb corresponding respectively to increasing and decreasing discharge for a given stage the discharge is higher during the rising limb than during the falling limb braca 2008 both simple and loop rating curves are influenced by channel geometry friction slope cross section shape the shape of the discharge hydrograph slow or quick increase and flow conditions section or channel control channel control is the case when downstream waters do not influence upstream waters in this case the simple rating curve can be described by chézy or manning strickler relations conversely section control is a specific cross section characterized by the presence of obstacles sediments rocks weir vegetation etc and that controls to a certain extent upstream waters in this case the discharge can be described by power law relations reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 it is well known that lrc is observed for flat slopes around 0 1 and that it disappears for sharper slopes holmes 2018 also the simple rating curve is deformed and it departs from the one to one stage discharge relation in the presence of aquatic vegetation variable backwater scour and fill sand bed overflow and ponding change to channel cross section ice cover herschy 1995 historically lrc has been most widely observed on natural rivers during high flood events fread 1975 faye and blalock 1984 herschy 1995 westphal et al 1999 petersen øverleir 2006 cheng et al 2019 perret et al 2022 the first method that was used to reproduce lrc hysteresis behavior is jones formula jones 1915 several methods were since developed by introducing some corrections or rectifications to jones formula like di silvio 1969 fread 1975 marchi 1976 faye and cherry 1980 fenton 1999 perumal and ranga raju 1999 fenton and keller 2001 petersen øverleir 2006 perumal et al 2007 reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 dottori et al 2009 and muste et al 2020 it is rare to observe lrc in experimental channels eventually because of the practical difficulty of generating a variable discharge hydrograph with high precision in both time and discharge intensity to our knowledge the only laboratory experiments where lrc was observed were done on the two following large experimental channels i a 10 m long 40 cm wide and 50 cm high channel at kyoto university japan nezu and nakagawa 1994 and ii a 16 8 m long 60 cm wide and 80 cm high channel at école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne epfl switzerland song and graf 1996 in this study we present the first experimental investigation of lrc on a small 3d printed laboratory channel 180 cm long 3 cm wide and 4 cm high the objective is to verify the feasibility of using small 3d printed models to make complex hydraulic studies for that we check here the capacity of such a model to reproduce a rather complex hydraulic phenomenon such as the lrc we generate an experimental flood event consisting of a high precision variable discharge hydrograph after showing the experimental results of rating curves we use the classical jones formula to simulate the ensemble of the rating curves corresponding to different flow conditions in order to check the physical consistency of the results 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup a 3d printed model pla material was generated from the dtm of the var river mouth south east of france http opendata nicecotedazur org used for hydraulic modelling in abily et al 2016 the considered section is about 200 m wide and 10 km long during 1994 flood event the peak discharge has been estimated at 3770 m3 s guinot and gourbesville 2003 we insist on the fact that this is not a scale model in the sense that no similarity study is done here the dimensions width depth of the bed of the small 3d printed channel were chosen according to the characteristics of the feeding pump the objective of this study was to verify the possibility of using a small 3d printed channel to carry out complex hydraulic studies such as the reproduction of lrc the resulting experimental channel is 180 cm long 3 cm wide and 4 cm mean height fig 1 left a peristaltic pump imposes an unsteady discharge hydrograph at the channel input the discharge hydrograph can have any mathematical shape and discharge intensity can be varied at the time step of 1 s this is done due to a special pump control device based on arduino uno where pump rotation speed can be varied automatically each second according to a prescribed voltage information that mimics the mathematical shape of the discharge hydrograph at the channel outlet water is accumulated on two high precision scales 0 1 g precision 30 kg maximum capacity each that permit to measure the discharge at the time step of 1 s with these two scales we are able to test discharge hydrographs with total water consumption up to 60 l we also installed a ruler 0 5 mm precision at the channel outlet to track stage variation in time fig 1 bottom right the ruler is filmed by a webcam during the totality of the flood event the videos are then visually inspected and stage at the channel outlet is determined at the time step of 5 s a fluorescent dye is added to water to facilitate ruler readings by coupling stage and discharge measurements at the channel outlet fig 1 top right for different flow conditions we get the corresponding rating curves by analyzing the measured discharge hydrographs at the channel outlet obtained from scales the discharge experimental error is estimated about 5 ml s thus the measured experimental rating curves are plotted with error bars of 0 5 mm for stage and 5 ml s for discharge in this study we impose at the experimental channel inlet an unsteady discharge hydrograph that has a mathematical shape inspired from the extreme flood event of november 1994 at the var river where data is given at the regular time step of δt flood 1 h fig 2 left we adapt the time step and the discharge intensity to our small 3d printed experimental channel for discharge intensity the maximum of the simulated event is about 100 ml s and the proportional variation of discharge intensities is the same in both real and simulated flood event for time step we test δt flood 5 s and δt flood 10 s that separate regularly two different values of discharge fig 2 right which results in a flood event twice longer for the second time step in this study we call δt flood the time step of the discharge hydrograph the total duration of a simulated flood event is 10 min 2 2 experimental protocol the experimental flood event is imposed at the channel inlet we measure stage and discharge rating curve at the channel outlet for different flow conditions freefall condition at the channel outlet with or without obstacles installation of a weir at the channel outlet with three elevation gaps between weir and channel outlet bed δh weir river 1 cm 0 cm and 1 cm for each of the three elevation gaps we test two contrasted channel slopes flat slope of 0 1 and sharp slope of 10 finally for the flat slope and for weir condition we test two time steps of the variable discharge hydrograph δt flood 10 s and δt flood 5 s therefore in this study we vary the following flow conditions hydrograph time step δt flood 10 s and δt flood 5 s channel slope flat or sharp and channel outlet condition freefall or weir concerning channel slope we test two contrasted slopes a sharp slope 10 and a flat slope 0 1 the purpose is to evaluate the impact of slope on the shape of the rating curves precisely the occurrence of lrc concerning channel outlet condition we test freefall condition with or without obstacles in the latter case obstacles consist of metallic prisms 8 cm3 obstacles partially occlude the channel section and water can still circulate around them fig 3 the aim of introducing obstacles is to simulate the real life situation where river section is partially occluded by rocks sediments and debris of natural or anthropic nature the freefall condition is tested with flat slope and δt flood 10 s after testing the freefall condition we install a weir at the channel outlet the aim is to simulate real life situation at the river mouth where the sea level could vary upward and enters into the river bed because of a storm or a tsunami or an increase of sea level due to global warming therefore we conceived and printed a 3d model consisting of a small basin adapted to the channel outlet geometry and equipped at its end with a weir of different possible elevations in this study we test 3 elevation gaps between the weir and the channel outlet bed h weir h river δh weir river 1 cm 0 cm and 1 cm the latter situation would correspond to an increase of sea level fig 4 illustrates a situation where δh weir river 1 cm with flat channel slope at the minimum and maximum discharges of the hydrograph the ensemble of 11 tested scenarios is detailed in table 1 according to different flow conditions for each tested scenario two replicates were done we then take the mean of the two replicates to represent the scenario result 2 3 rating curves simulation in the literature various methods corresponding to various hydraulic conditions were developed to simulate the lrc dottori et al 2009 we choose the most popular jones formula jones 1915 1a q calc q unsteady q steady 1 1 cs h t 1 2 1b c q steady a where the calculated discharge q calc ml s is assumed to be an unsteady discharge q unsteady ml s q steady ml s is the steady discharge h m is the stage t s is the time s is the local channel slope c m s 1 is the wave celerity a l h m2 the wet area with l 0 03 m is the channel width in jones formula q unsteady is estimated by a correction of q steady by taking into account the time variation of both h and q steady since our flow conditions correspond to a section control rather than channel control q steady is considered to follow a power law equation reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 2 q steady a h b where a and b are the rating curve constants under steady state condition in this study we calculate q unstedy based on the sole information of stage h under unsteady state condition as generally done in literature relative to theoretical calculation of lrc fread 1975 petersen øverleir 2006 muste et al 2020 we evaluate the following discharge 3 q calc a h b 1 1 cs h t 1 2 where the slope s is known and c can be determined by eq 1b we optimize the parameters a and b by minimizing the square error se opt between the measured discharge q mes and q calc 4 se opt i q calc i q mes i 2 to evaluate the total error stemming from experimental discharge measurements 5 ml s for each data point we calculate the se exp error number 5 se exp i 5 ml s 2 where i varies from one to the number of data points in each rating curve to evaluate the performance of the optimization procedure we calculate the ratio rse 6 r se se opt se exp if rse 1 the errors resulting from optimization procedure se opt are less than the errors resulting from discharge measurements se exp in this case we consider that the optimization is successful and that the simulation of the rating curve is very good as we did not pay attention to the scaling we also calculate for all scenarios the froude fr and reynolds re numbers at minimum and maximum discharges of the rating curves 7 fr u gh r e ul ν where g 9 81 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration ν 10 6 m2 s 1 is the kinematic viscosity of water l 0 03 m is the channel width h m is the stage and u m s 1 q mes l h the calculation of these two numbers will help us in the analysis and understanding of the results 3 results experimental rating curves corresponding to freefall condition at the channel outlet without or with obstacles sc1 and sc2 are shown in fig 5 we can see that lrc occurs for both scenarios and that it is more pronounced in the presence of obstacles sc2 this result is in accordance with literature where complex geometry of river section results in looped or non unique ratings herschy 1995 moreover this result is interesting because i it shows that lrc occurs at small size laboratory channel and ii in comparison to large natural rivers this result suggests that it would be possible to observe lrc on a river upstream a natural fall the latter situation has rarely been observed on natural rivers because generally stage discharge monitoring stations are rarely implemented near natural falls experimental rating curves corresponding to weir condition at the channel outlet sc3 to sc11 are shown in fig 6 we can see that for a flat slope and δt flood 10 s lrc occurs for different elevation gaps between weir and channel outlet bed δh weir river 1 cm 0 cm and 1 cm fig 6 sc3 4 5 if we compare fig 5 sc2 and fig 6 sc3 4 5 it seems that lrc is more pronounced in the presence of obstacles that occlude partially the channel section than in the presence of weir that occludes completely the channel section if we reduce the time step of the discharge hydrograph δt flood 5 s lrc still occurs for δh weir river 1 cm but does not partially occur for δh weir river 0 cm and 1 cm fig 6 sc6 7 8 we can deduce that lrc is globally more pronounced for δt flood 10 s than for δt flood 5 s this can be explained by the fact that if δt flood becomes very small at least less than the water wave travel time between the inlet and outlet of the channel the discharge hydrograph at the inlet would tend to a dirac signal and its shape would hardly be reproduced at the outlet in our experimental channel the water wave travel time between the inlet and outlet of the channel is about 3 s to 5 s depending on the slope and the discharge intensity δt flood 5 s is thus a lower limit situation we can guess that if we test a very high value of δt flood much larger than 10 s lrc would also be less pronounced because in this case the discharge hydrograph will tend to a succession of steady states steps rather than a smooth unsteady state lrc would unlikely occur in steady states therefore time resolution of discharge hydrograph has an impact on the occurrence of lrc it should be higher than the water wave travel time between the inlet and outlet but not high enough to break the smoothness of the unsteady discharge hydrograph and lead to a succession of steady discharge steps if the channel slope becomes sharp 10 in our study lrc does not occur for all elevation gaps fig 6 sc9 10 11 specially for δh weir river 1 cm compare sc6 and sc9 in fig 6 this result is in accordance with literature studies on natural rivers where lrc occurs more likely for flat river slopes around 0 1 fread 1975 faye and blalock 1984 holmes 2018 this result is important because it shows that hydraulic behavior in large natural rivers is also reproduced in small 3d printed channel 180 cm long 3 cm wide 4 cm high comparing the froude fr and reynolds re numbers between figs 5 and 6 we see that lrc occurs roughly for fr 0 4 and re 5000 this suggests that lrc is more likely pronounced in fluvial and laminar flow conditions we are aware that our findings on a small 3d printed channel cannot be directly extrapolated to large natural rivers without taking into account the scale variation effect for this reason the non dimensional numbers fr and re could be helpful in future studies as a link between small and large scale hydraulic behavior now we try to simulate the experimental rating curves with jones formula as indicated in section 2 3 rating curves simulation for all scenarios are given in supplemental material figure s1 along with the corresponding stage discharge time variation here we show a selection of simulated rating curves sc1 sc2 sc6 and sc9 that correspond to different flow conditions at the channel outlet fig 7 the results of parameter optimization a b for all scenarios are given in table 2 along with the optimization performance ratio rse eq 6 as for the performance of the optimization procedure table 2 shows that the ratio rse is always 1 for all scenarios we can thus consider that our experimental rating curves are very well simulated by jones formula for different flow conditions whether lrc occurs or not we consider that the simulation result is of great importance because it shows that the hydraulic laws that are used at large natural rivers can be used at small experimental channels therefore the major findings of our study are i our lrc experimental results on a small 3d printed channel are in accordance with experimental observations at a large natural rivers and ii our lrc experimental results obtained on a small 3d printed channel are very well verified by hydraulic laws used for large rivers jones formula this study opens the possibility of using a small 3d scale model to perform complex hydraulic studies in particular it enables to investigate lrc with much more detail on small laboratory channels because it is much easier to control and explore flow condition parameters at small size model rather than at natural size river flow conditions are generally influenced by geometrical parameters and by the discharge hydrograph signal shape of the flood event using the 3d printing technique we are able to explore the geometrical flow parameters by building channels with complex geometry different roughness variable bed slope and different types of section control obstacles weir that would mimic natural situations like the presence of a dam or a confluence or a lake using the high precision pump control device we are able to explore a large panel of discharge hydrographs having different shapes different intensities and different time resolution such future investigation would address the questions of i which parameters make the lrc more pronounced ii does the rising and falling limb of lrc always occur in the same sense rising limb is above falling limb when discharge is expressed as a function of stage iii or are there some situations where the sense of rising and falling limb is reversed rising limb is below falling limb when discharge is expressed as a function of stage as real scenarios are considered this might be of interest from both a pedagogical and an application point of view with a reduced cost human material space occupation 4 discussion 4 1 experimental platform and 3d printing this work is part of the development of a novel platform to study the dampening of water and solute transport in an experimental channel under unsteady flow conditions moussa and majdalani 2019 majdalani et al 2019 majdalani et al 2020 our initial goal in the three aforementioned studies was to have the smallest size of experimental platform that is useful for research project studies teaching activities and that allows to do rational experiments characterized by small space occupation short experimental duration high measurement precision high quality and reproducible experimental curves low water and energy consumption and the possibility to test a large variety of hydrograph scenarios the first application of the platform in 2019 aimed at collecting an important set of experimental data to validate a new flood routing model which enables to evaluate lateral flow either gains or losses in a channel using the analytical solution of the inverse problem of the diffusive wave equation moussa and majdalani 2019 for that we built a 4 m long serpentine channel with 3 cm width and 5 cm height the inflow is introduced at the channel input whereas both lateral gains and losses are uniformly distributed along the channel we realized 62 experimental scenarios corresponding to different shapes of inflow and lateral flow for each experiment three replicates were made this allowed to validate the numerical modelling of water and solute transport and to verify the coherence of the experimental data it also showed an example of use of the platform providing a large set of hydrograph data sets discharge water depth and solute for the purposes of numerical modelling in scientific research kirstetter et al 2021 the work done herein aims to go further in the development of the platform and has a dual purpose the first is technical and it aims to use 3d printing technique to represent a natural channel the second is scientific and it addresses the question whether we could or not observe the stage discharge hysteresis for low water levels and small channel sections for that as a feasibility example we use a 3d printer to build a small distorted model thanks to the digital terrain model of the var river and we incorporate the platform s experimental devices pumps discharge depth and solute measurements etc to simulate the inflows and the eventual lateral gains and losses the results show first that 3d printing enables to build microscale physical models mspm which opens up prospects for various applications 3d printing is easy to use rapid and cheap which can speed up the development and production time of hydraulic models for operational projects 3d printing can create hydraulic models that are more realistic and closer to real world conditions providing a better understanding of how water behaves in real world situations this section discusses i 3d printing models at 1 1 scale ii 3d printed mspm for hydraulic applications iii stage discharge hysteresis 4 2 3d printing models at 1 1 scale 3d printed physical models can be used to simulate real world water flows representing natural channels on a 1 1 scale in the laboratory the objective is to study complex hydraulic phenomena such as runoff genesis on hillslopes erosion solute transfer grains transfer etc understanding these physical processes is essential for applications in fluid mechanics hydrology eco hydrology and environmental sciences the injection of dye also allows identifying path flows as well as obtaining the necessary data for lagrangian and eulerian approaches to study free surface flows this allows i a better understanding of the behavior of runoff process according to environmental conditions and anthropogenic structures ii the study of complex hydraulic characteristics such as turbulence water velocity and flow in natural environments iii the acquisition of numerous accurate spatiotemporal data discharge depth concentration necessary for the validation of hydraulic numerical models for complex upstream downstream and boundary conditions kirstetter et al 2021 iv the development of management solutions 4 3 3d printed mspm for hydraulic applications 3d printing enables also to build mspm of natural rivers for engineering projects like water management studies peña and anta 2021 mspm were first applied on large rivers such as the mississippi gaines and maynord 2001 maynord 2006 or medium size basins 100 km2 davies et al 2003 the realization of mspm with 3d printing for hydraulic applications presents several advantages study of theoretical complex branch networks mignot et al 2008 mignot et al 2013 branched networks can be so easily constructed like y channel with two inlets and one outlet to study the mixing laws of solutes around the confluence or more complex branched networks by increasing the number of pumps used in the experimental platform it would be easy to add punctual or distributed gains losses to different parts of the channel network the development of measuring devices also opens up many application perspectives such as the study on the influence of river flow confluences on the open channel stage discharge relationship wang et al 2019 design verification 3d printed mspm can be used to verify the design of a hydraulic system before starting the production this allows potential problems to be identified and corrected before they become critical optimization of structures 3d printed mspm can help to optimize existing hydraulic systems oertel and shen 2022 shen and oertel 2023 when using a mspm it is possible to identify areas of weakness and therefore suggest improvements it is possible to test various structures and configurations to find the one that offers the best hydraulic performance in addition by using 3d printing it is possible to design more complex hydraulic models with finer details and more precise shapes thus many hydraulic processes around singularities can be easily studied weirs steps waterfalls overbank flow dikes reservoirs etc this allows maximizing the efficiency of existing or new hydraulic systems custom design 3d printed mspm can be designed to meet specific design needs dimensions shapes and materials this allows custom solutions for specific projects different sensors allowing to obtain accurate water discharge depth and concentration data could be integrated in the experimental platform oertel and shen 2022 this is useful to predict scenarios or to replay past scenarios and also to validate approaches such as computational codes and numerical methods kirstetter et al 2021 teaching and training 3d printed mspm can also be used to train technicians and engineers on the principles of hydraulics or as demonstration model to discuss with elected officials stakeholders and the population mspm allow a practical understanding of the theoretical concepts the experimental platform and the example of the var mspm were used for pedagogic purposes like practical works and trainings on courses at both polytech montpellier university of montpellier and polytech nice university of nice côte d azur 4 4 stage discharge hysteresis stage discharge hysteresis is a hydraulic phenomenon that occurs when water flow characteristics vary based on time variation of flow this phenomenon can be observed in several hydraulic situations such as floods water level changes discharge variations etc stage discharge hysteresis studies in river or free surface hydraulics are important to better understand hydraulic phenomena and to develop more accurate predictive models for floods and other hydraulic events lee et al 2017 muste et al 2020 these studies can also help in designing more efficient hydraulic structures to meet varying flow conditions in the field stage discharge hysteresis studies can be done using measurement sensors such as pressure or water level sensors lee et al 2017 however there are few research studies that investigate the possibility of reproducing the hysteresis phenomenon using mspm in free surface hydraulics a main result of this paper is the observation of stage discharge hysteresis relationships on small cross section channels 3 cm width 4 cm height for different configurations of inflows and downstream conditions the use of 3d printing mspm enables to reproduce rivers with complex shapes however the use of 3d printing to reproduce the stage discharge hysteresis phenomenon on mspm requires a more delicate approach as the hysteresis phenomenon depends on many factors such as fluid characteristics flow conditions and river bed properties these results also open many perspectives for applications with different shapes of cross sections and longitudinal profiles of rivers different shapes of flood waves different types of downstream conditions and for specific experimental setups such as hydraulic basins test channels or control valves which control water flow conditions 5 conclusion in this study we have shown the feasibility of using a small 3d printed channel in reproducing complex flood events the platform is easy to use low cost short duration experimentation and low water volume consumption it enables to reproduce complex hydraulic processes on small channels and to provide dense spatiotemporal experimental data necessary for verifying and validating hydraulic models in this context we investigated the complex process of loop rating curve lrc on a small 3d printed channel 180 cm long 3 cm wide 4 cm high under unsteady discharge hydrograph simulation of a flood event we tested 11 scenarios sc1 to sc11 corresponding to different flow conditions where we varied the following parameters section control freefall or weir channel slope flat 0 1 or sharp 10 time step of the discharge hydrograph δt flood 10 s or 5 s in the case of freefall condition we investigated how rating curve is influenced by the presence of obstacles that partially occlude the channel section in the case of weir condition we investigated three elevation gaps between weir and channel outlet bed δh weir river 1 cm 0 cm and 1 cm we found that lrc occurs in a freefall condition sc1 sc2 and that the loop is more pronounced in the presence of obstacles sc2 lrc occurs in a weir condition for different elevation gaps δh weir river sc3 sc4 sc5 the time step of the unsteady discharge hydrograph has an impact on the occurrence of lrc by reducing δt flood from 10 s to 5 s lrc still occurs in some situations sc6 but does not partially occur in other situations sc7 sc8 the slope has a major impact on lrc for a sharp slope condition lrc does not occur sc9 sc10 sc11 which is in accordance with literature observations on large natural rivers all scenarios corresponding to different flow conditions sc1 to sc11 were very well simulated by jones formula that is classically used on large channels or rivers therefore our experimental results on a small 3d printed channel are in accordance with experimental observations on large rivers and they are very well simulated by hydraulic laws used on large rivers jones formula these promising results permit future investigation of lrc with much more detail on small size laboratory channels where flow conditions and channel geometrical parameters are well controlled and can be widely varied in order to test complex flow conditions our experimental platform is complementary to large scale hydraulic laboratories numerical modelling and field data indeed the main interest of its small size remains the short experimental duration which enables to simulate a large variety of high precision hydrograph scenarios of water and solute transport under unsteady flow conditions both lagrangian and eulerian approaches can be studied easily thanks to the dimensions of the model e g study of flood wave routing along the channel lagrangian approach and hysteresis study eulerian approach by increasing the number of pumps and sensors complex branched networks with different inlets and lateral gains and losses can be studied 3d printed physical models can be used to simulate real world water flows representing natural channels on a 1 1 scale in the laboratory to study runoff and erosion processes for applications in hydrology eco hydrology and environmental sciences microscale physical models mspm can be developed for hydraulic applications such as the study of theoretical complex branch networks design verification optimization of structures custom design teaching and training an important point will be the reflection for the model construction regarding similitude defining the scale of the model and verifying similarity scaling laws such as the non dimensional reynolds and froude numbers the experimental 3d printed mspm could be used for teaching for research for engineering and for

1717,infiltration is a crucial process in various fields such as hydrology agriculture urban soils and particularly for sustainable urban drainage systems suds operation over the past century the physics of infiltration has been extensively studied by developing models that estimate the dynamics of infiltration in this study three physically based infiltration models ch1 ch2 and ch3 have been developed as part of the canoe hydrobox ch platform designed to simulate and evaluate the performance of suds the three models rely on similar approaches to the green ampt ga model by describing the water flux as the product of the equivalent hydraulic gradient and the equivalent hydraulic conductivity the models differ in their ways of defining the hydraulic gradient and conductivity from the hydric conditions soil parameters and geometric features the two first models ch1 and ch2 consider an increase in the hydraulic conductivity with infiltrated water amount whereas the last model ch3 considers only the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the hydraulic gradient the first model considers the difference between the surface water pressure head and the height of infiltrated water the other two models consider the difference between the surface water pressure head and the isostatic water pressure head at the surface in equilibrium with the height of infiltrated water these models were applied to simulate water infiltration processes into dry wet and intermediate wet soils we compared these results with the numerical solution of the richards equation using hydrus software the comparison allowed the assessment of the capability of ch models to satisfy the critical principles of soil water infiltration subsequently we used the three models to invert six real experimental infiltration data to test their capability to work in inverse mode the two models ch1 and ch2 produced specific time evolution of infiltration rates in disagreement with the physics of water infiltration under regular conditions e g no water repellence the third model ch3 performed the best for both direct and indirect modes and is therefore considered as the best candidate the ch3 model will be implemented in the new version of canoe hydrobox ch platform this study provides a basis for further research into hydrological models for suds and their hydraulic performance keywords urban hydrology infiltration model infiltration processes bioretention systems green ampt data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urbanization impacts the physical properties of urban soils resulting in changes in water movement and the capacity of soils to act as a sink for water transported pollution fletcher et al 2015 o loughlin et al 1996 as a result the hydrological cycle is significantly altered due to the reduction in the soil capacity to infiltrate water woltemade 2010 leading to changes in river and stream flow regimes marsalek et al 2008 miller and hess 2017 the increase in impervious surfaces increases surface runoff booth 1991 sustainable urban drainage systems suds are widely implemented for stormwater management to mitigate effects arising from the generation of runoff in urban areas bertrand krajewski et al 2000 liu et al 2012 suds aim to shift the water cycle back towards its natural cycle by reducing runoff volumes attenuating peak flows and improving water quality through various processes including infiltration filtration and biological water uptake fletcher et al 2015 suds include filter strips grassed swales bioretention facilities green roofs and permeable pavements chocat 2008 davis 2008 2005 some suds like infiltration basins are more infiltration oriented and aim to infiltrate water into a soil substrate and into underlying natural soil when the hydrogeological context allows for it ben slimene et al 2017 goutaland et al 2013 lassabatere et al 2010 others like swales play the combined roles of flow conveyance and storage but also involve infiltration fardel et al 2019 these systems may be implemented on the site s parent soil or constructed with a porous material with specific and controlled properties in these contexts water infiltration into the subsoil whether natural or artificial is one of the targets and must be understood properly the hydrological performance of suds relies in large part on the infiltration capacity of soils constitutive of suds which in turn is dependent on the soil hydraulic properties such as the water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves in addition to experimental conditions i e initial water content bockhorn et al 2017 rinderer and seibert 2012 zhu et al 2012 therefore a proper quantification and modeling of water infiltration in suds is of prime importance the models developed for water infiltration may be either empirical or theoretical including philip meyer and warrick brutsaert and haverkamp models angulo jaramillo et al 2016 marinoschi 2006 there is an increasing emphasis however on the development and use of physically based models carbone et al 2015 among these approaches the conceptual physically based green ampt model has been the subject of several investigations warrick and broadbridge 1992 and is widely used to model suds for instance the green ampt approach is incorporated in the widely used swmm software package among other options including the hortonian or the curve number infiltration models to simulate water infiltration roesner 2009 rossman 2010 richards equation has been solved numerically for decades to predict water infiltration processes in many contexts including the investigation on the hydraulic performances of suds tedoldi et al 2016 hydrus is one of the best known software modules for solving the richards equation allowing for many types of initial and boundary conditions and types of soils radcliffe and simunek 2018 the hydrus suite has been widely used in the literature for the description of the hydraulic behavior of various types of suds brunetti et al 2016 hilten et al 2008 li and babcock 2015 newcomer et al 2014 osman 2013 palla et al 2009 however hydrus requires knowledge of the entire unsaturated hydraulic properties of soils requiring the prior characterization of soils with hydraulic methods like the beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters best method angulo jaramillo et al 2016 bouarafa et al 2019 di prima et al 2020 kanso et al 2018 lassabatère et al 2006 such a requirement drastically increases the level of complexity of these models and requires a large amount of specific data effectively precluding their use by decision makers designers and practitioners therefore there is a need for easy to operate physically based models with lower calibration effort based on relatively easy data to collect and monitor e g water levels and flows the availability of parsimonious models with acceptable goodness of fit is essential to accurately predict the impact of the suds facilities in management of stormwater in current and future cities with this aim bonneau et al 2021 implemented a physically based simplified model for the prediction of water fluxes in bioretention systems named here ch1 where ch stands for canoe hydrobox hydrobox being the lid module integrated in the canoe software see chocat 2013 and montoya coronado et al 2022 this model was designed to avoid over parametrization and simulate hydraulic fluxes in bioretention systems after calibration of the model with two contrasting rainfall events representing a low and high values of rainfall intensity the model predicts the following variables water infiltration at the soil surface soil water storage vertical gravity driven infiltration in the filter media exfiltration and underdrain and outflow fluxes however the results from this study proved that some parts of the physics were not adequately represented and that improvement was still needed bonneau et al 2021 the authors related these inconsistencies to the inaccurate quantification of the infiltration component among others therefore the aim of this study is to improve the infiltration module implemented by bonneau et al 2021 regarding the physics of water infiltration into soils this module considers darcy s law to relate the infiltration rate to the equivalent hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity those being estimated from the physical and geometric features of the bioretention system to complement the ch1 model we propose two physically based models ch2 and ch3 to provide alternative definitions of the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity with the final aim being to improve both the prediction of water infiltration direct mode modeling and parameter estimation inverse mode modeling the three models ch1 ch2 and ch3 were assessed regarding their capability to accurately predict fluxes for the case of water infiltration into a soil profile which is the main component of the suds hydrological balance at the beginning of rainfall events in bioretention systems or in infiltration basins and swales we thus focus on the infiltration component and neglect all the other components considered by bonneau et al 2021 e g evapotranspiration underdrain etc these models were tested against both numerically generated data simulation of infiltration into an infinite soil profile with hydrus software for different synthetic soils and initial saturation degrees and real experimental data real infiltration runs performed in the field the models were assessed regarding their ability to fit the synthetic and real infiltration data comply with the physics governing water infiltration into soils and provide accurate estimates of hydraulic parameters e g saturated hydraulic conductivity when used in the inverse mode the final goal of this study is to provide an insight into the selection of the best infiltration module before its implementation into the broader numerical ch platform for the design and evaluation of suds including swales and infiltration basins along with bioretention systems 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 water infiltration into soils infiltration at the soil surface and water redistribution in the soil are governed by the richards equation eq 1c that combines darcy s law eq 1a with the mass conservation equation eq 1b 1a q k θ 1 h z 1b θ t q z 1c θ t z k θ 1 h z where q lt 1 is the water flux k θ lt 1 stands for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity h l for the water pressure head and θ l3 l 3 for the water content solving eq 1c requires knowledge of the hydraulic functions i e the water retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity several models were developed for these functions and a review can be found in angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the van genuchten 1980 model with the mualem condition is often considered for the description of the water retention curve the mualem 1976 model for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is also among the most frequently used models these models are as follows 2a θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 2b k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θ r l3 l 3 and θ s l3 l 3 stand for the residual and the saturated water contents α l 1 is the scale parameter for the water pressure head k s lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s e θ θ r θ s θ r is the saturation degree n m 1 1 n mualem s condition and l are hydraulic shape parameters solving eq 1 for given water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions allows the determination of flow variables leading to the type of results described in fig 1 a c for the case of water infiltration into a uniform profile with uniform initial water contents and water pressure heads and for a constant water pressure head h a imposed at the soil surface fig 1a c describes the typical characteristics of the variables involved in infiltrating water into homogeneous soils fig 1a and 1b represent respectively the water pressure head and water content profiles as a function of time each line corresponds to a specific time fig 1c shows the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration at the soil surface in the beginning the difference in water pressure head δ h h a h i between the surface and the soil applies to a very thick soil layer above the wetting front positioned at small depths z wf fig 1a the capillary part of the hydraulic gradient h z δ h z wf then takes extremely large values close to infinity with time the wetting front moves downwards thus increasing the depth of the wetting front z wf and then decreasing the capillary component of the hydraulic gradient given that the gravity part of the hydraulic gradient remains the same i e 1 the total hydraulic gradient follows the same decreasing trend for very long times when the wetting front reaches quasi infinite values if allowed to do so for example where the soil layer is deep enough z wf the capillary part of the hydraulic gradient tends towards zero h z δ h z wf 0 and consequently the hydraulic gradient tends towards unity meaning that the infiltration tends towards k s consequently the infiltration rate decreases from infinity to the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity at steady state fig 1c i e q z 0 t k s giving the cumulative infiltration i t its specific shape with a concave part for the transient state followed by a linear part for the steady state fig 1c these features result from the principles of the physics of water infiltration into homogeneous semi infinite soils angulo jaramillo et al 2016 lassabatere et al 2009 2 2 design of the proposed sets of infiltration models the canoe hydrobox platform is based on the reservoir approach assimilating the soil profile to a block of given depth z s o i l l and a given area at the surface a 1 m 2 l2 fig 1g l the water flux q t lt 1 is averaged at the scale of the block and related to an equivalent hydraulic gradient i e q ll 1 and equivalent hydraulic conductivity k e q lt 1 3 q t k e q i e q several assumptions must be made to define k e q and i e q and to relate the averaged infiltration rate q t to the cumulative infiltration at the surface i t l leading to the definition of a characteristic function q i the green and ampt 1911 model is also based on the same approach but with specific definitions of k e q and i e q the design of k e q and i e q and the characteristic function q i are described below for the proposed models ch1 2 and 3 for these models we assume that there are no fluxes at the base of the soil block 2 2 1 hydraulic conductivity k e q for the hydraulic conductivity k e q is either equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity k e q k s like for the green and ampt 1911 model or is equal to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k e q k s e k s needing the quantification of the saturation degree s e at the scale of the soil block in this study we consider the approach implemented by bonneau et al 2021 to estimate the profile averaged saturation degree s e e q these authors considered that the total volume of water present in the profile v w a l3 could be converted into an equivalent volume of water v w b l3 in the same profile with a homogeneous saturation degree s e e q fig 1h then at any time t the total water content θ l3 l 3 in the profile is computed as the sum of the initial water content and the contribution of infiltration from the surface see fig 1h 4 θ θ i v w a d d e d a z s o i l where θ i l3 l 3 corresponds to the initial water content assumed homogeneous over the entire soil depth and v w a d d e d l3 to the volume of water added to the soil block due to the water infiltration at the surface to go further v w a d d e d can be easily related to the cumulative infiltration i l in eq 4 considering that it corresponds to v w a d d e d divided by the infiltration surface i e i v w a d d e d a leading to 5 θ θ i i z s o i l and thus one obtains the following expression for the saturation degree s e e q 6 s e e q s e i i z s o i l θ s θ r where s e i represents the initial saturation degree therefore the equivalent saturation degree s e e q can be inserted into the hydraulic conductivity function as defined by the mualem 1976 model k s e eq 2b to compute the hydraulic conductivity k e q c h 1 lt 1 as a function of the cumulative infiltration i 7 k e q c h 1 i k s s e i i z s o i l θ s θ r l 1 1 s e i i z s o i l θ s θ r 1 m m 2 for the specific case of the saturation degree description with the eq 6 the subscript ch1 in k e q c h 1 i refers to the fact that this function was developed for the design of the ch1 model considering the case of no leakage at the base of the soil block the volume of water added to the soil block cannot exceed the volume of voids initially filled with air and thus available for the water entering in the soil block i e a z s o i l θ s θ i the maximum infiltration corresponds to i m a x z s o i l θ s θ i and no quantities should be computed for larger cumulative infiltration i i m a x corresponding to the saturation degrees s e 1 which is meaningless with regards to the principles of soil physics 2 2 2 hydraulic gradient ieq 2 2 2 1 green ampt ga model the green and ampt 1911 model considers the saturated region of the soil between the surface and the position of the wetting front z w f to compute the hydraulic gradient over this region fig 1d e at the surface the water pressure head imposed at the soil surface is positive h a 0 and the water content equals the saturated water content for infiltration experiments h a corresponds to the water height in the ring the ga model assumes stepwise functions for both water content and water pressure heads water content shifts between the initial and the saturated values of water content θ i and θ s respectively at the wetting front water pressure head shifts from the value at the wetting front h w f to the value imposed at the surface h a the difference in the water pressure head can be considered δ h h a h w f l and the equivalent hydraulic gradient i e q g a ll 1 can be computed from the gravity driven 1 and capillary driven gradient h z δ h z w f 8 i e q g a 1 δ h z w f the replacement of the position of the wetting front as a function of the cumulative infiltration z w f i δ θ mass conservation leads to the following final expression 9a i e q g a i 1 δ θ δ h i 9b i e q g a i 1 θ s θ i h a h w f i several approaches have already been proposed for the definition of h w f see kale and sahoo 2011 for a review including applications to stormwater control measures lee et al 2013 as a first approach we equate h w f to the initial water pressure head h w f h i this choice is discussed in results and discussion with regard to alternative options and the direct optimization of h w f is also proposed 2 2 2 2 ch1 model and related hydraulic gradient the ch1 model implemented by bonneau et al 2021 computes the hydraulic gradient between the surface and the lower depth of the soil column z s o i l the water pressure head gradient h z considers that the water pressure head is fixed at the surface at h a and that the water pressure head at the lower boundary is in equilibrium with the column of water above in other words the water in the profile is allowed to drain instantaneously until the lower limit at z z s o i l no leakage at the base of the reservoir and to form a saturated zone with a specific height h w imposing the lower water pressure head fig 1h these assumptions were considered for coarse materials like in the base of bioretention systems with water drainage and storage layers the depth of saturated soil is then computed from the total quantity of water in the profile v w l3 and the saturated water content θ s considering a stepwise distribution into the profile for water content θ z fig 1h 10 v w t a 0 z soil θ z t d z a 0 h w t θ s d z a h w t θ s eq 10 is an approximation since it considers that the water content above the saturated zone is negligible and that all the water present in the profile saturates the soils over the depth h w the depth h w l can then be easily derived from the volume of water v w 11 h w t v w t a θ s the volume v w is equal to the initial volume added with the volume of infiltrated water leading to 12 v w t a z s o i l θ i a i t 13 h w t v w t a θ s a z s o i l θ i a i t a θ s 14 h w t θ i θ s z s o i l i t θ s the equivalent hydraulic gradient i e q c h 1 t ll 1 can be computed by dividing the difference in water pressure head δ h h a h w l by the total distance z s o i l l fig 1 leading to 15 i e q c h 1 t 1 h a h w t z s o i l 16a i e q c h 1 t 1 h a z s o i l θ i θ s i t z s o i l θ s 16b i e q c h 1 i 1 h a z s o i l θ i θ s i z s o i l θ s again eq 16 are valid as long as there are no water leaks at the lower boundary of the soil block otherwise additional fluxes should be added to the expression of h w t 2 2 2 3 alternative hydraulic gradient for ch2 and ch3 the water pressure head gradient previously computed for the ch1 model may lead to h a z s o i l θ i θ s i z s o i l θ s 0 meaning a hydraulic gradient lower than unity i e q 1 see eq 16 this implies that the infiltration rate may be lower than the gravity driven infiltration which is meaningless with regards to the physics of water infiltration into quasi infinite soils two enhanced ch2 and ch3 models are developed as alternative ways to quantify the hydraulic gradient as previously assumed for ch1 the water initially present in the soil profile is still allowed to drain and create a saturated zone of a depth of h w i at time zero but the computation of the initial water pressure head at the surface and over the profile h i was modified in this new version h i l equates to the initial isostatic water pressure head and then relates to the initial water pressure head at the base of the soil block h w i l leading to 17 h i z s o i l h w i 18 h i z s o i l θ i θ s θ s 19 δ h h a h i 20 δ h h a z s o i l θ s θ i θ s to compute the hydraulic gradient we divide the difference of water pressure head δ h with the position of the wetting front as suggested by green and ampt 1911 instead of the soil block depth z s o i l this leads to the following expressions 21 i e q c h 2 3 t 1 h a z s o i l θ s θ i θ s z w f t 22a i e q c h 2 3 t 1 h a z s o i l θ s θ i θ s θ s θ i i t 22b i e q c h 2 3 i 1 h a z s o i l θ s θ i θ s θ s θ i i in eqs 22a and 22b the position of the wetting front z w f is replaced by its expression as a function of cumulative infiltration i e z w f t i t θ s θ i 2 2 3 summary of the set of models 2 2 3 1 ch1 model the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is taken as the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k e q c h 1 i as defined by eq 7 and the hydraulic gradient i e q c h 1 i as defined by eq 16 2 2 3 2 new ch2 model the ch2 model considers only the change in hydraulic gradient i e q c h 2 3 i as defined by eq 22 instead of i e q c h 1 i while the equivalent hydraulic conductivity remains defined by the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k e q c h 2 i k e q c h 1 i using eq 7 2 2 3 3 new ch3 model the hydraulic gradient relies on the alternative function i e q c h 2 3 i defined by eq 22 like the ch2 model whereas the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is fixed at the saturated hydraulic conductivity k e q c h 3 i k s this model can be seen as equivalent to the ga model for the specific case of h w f z s o i l θ s θ i θ s in other words the ch3 model corresponds to a version of the ga model parametrized as a function of the reservoir hydraulic and geometrical features i e z s o i l θ i and θ s once the options are selected for the equivalent hydraulic conductivity k e q and hydraulic gradient i e q all the models define the infiltration rate as the product of k e q and i e q leading to the function q i 3 material and methods the ch models were evaluated using two approaches in this study firstly the ch models were evaluated in direct mode and were used to model different scenarios of water infiltration 12 types of soils with three levels of initial saturation their numerical results were compared to those provided by the ga approach and those generated numerically with hydrus 1d numerical solution of richards equation then the ch models were tested in inverse mode therefore the ch models as well as the ga approach and hydrus 1d model were used to invert water infiltration data acquired with the single ring procedure angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the quality of fits and the estimates for hydraulic parameters were compared and discussed those steps allowed the assessment of the ch models under both direct and inverse modes 3 1 field experiments the experimental data involve six infiltration tests undertaken on vegetated soils with a large ring infiltrometer that is under development within the framework of the infiltron project https www infiltron org the ring 50 cm in diameter was directly inserted into the ground 5 cm insertion and a constant height of water between 5 and 10 cm was imposed in the ring corresponding to a water pressure head of approximately h a 0 1 m two big reservoirs located nearby maintain constant water level in the ring fig 2 the operators monitored the drop in water level in the reservoirs to measure the infiltration rates the cumulative infiltrations were then deduced by dividing the volume of infiltrated water by the ring surface these experiments were performed at two sites fig 2 in the campus of the entpe located in vaulx en velin lyon france more details on the characterization of the loamy soil may be found in previous works concialdi et al 2020 we also sampled the soil to obtain the value of the initial water content and the soil bulk density leading to the following derivations i entpe 1 site the initial averaged water content value was measured at 0 31 cm3 cm 3 the dry bulk density was measured at 1 24 g cm 3 corresponding to a porosity value of 0 53 cm3 cm 3 assuming the default value of the mineral density i e 2 65 g cm 3 ii entpe 2 site the initial averaged water content value was measured at 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the dry bulk density was measured at 1 28 g cm 3 which corresponds to a porosity value of 0 52 cm3 cm 3 under the above assumption given the large dimension of the ring i e 50 cm in diameter we consider that the lateral flux is negligible this flux being proportional to the inverse of the ring radius smettem et al 1994 and then expected to be negligible for our large ring consequently we consider that the water infiltration is mainly 1d instead of 3d and the data can be modeled by the proposed models that were designed for 1d infiltration into soils water ponding depths in the ring 10 cm are higher than those observed in other measurement methods such as beerkan experiments 1 cm see angulo jaramillo et al 2016 for a review such conditions result from the design of the prototype of infiltrometer developed for the infiltron project these conditions are expected to ensure full saturation of all the soil pores including the largest ones and to promote preferential flow e g lassabatere et al 2014 3 2 direct modeling with hydrus 1d we considered the numerically generated data as the reference since they are directly based on the numerical solving of richards equation eq 1 without any simplification this study modeled 1d vertical infiltration processes with hydrus 1d software šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the models were thoroughly tested using twelve common synthetic soils with diverse hydraulic characteristics from the carsel and parrish database carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 summarizes the corresponding hydraulic parameters as described by eqs 2 for water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves for all of the soils a numerical domain 2 5 m deep and a step discretization of 5 mm were used to calculate the water infiltration we used a 5 cm constant water pressure head at the soil surface and uniform initial water contents and water pressure heads with several values to mimic contrasting scenarios initially dry or wet soils the value of 5 cm for the water pressure head imposed at the surface was chosen as being intermediate between the observed water depth 10 cm in the large ring of the prototype developed for the infiltron project lassabatere et al 2020 and used in our study and regular values usually used for regular beerkan experiments 1 cm the lower boundary was designed as free drainage as usually considered for an unsaturated soil profile with small depths šimůnek 2006 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the time steps were managed with the hydrus 1d adaptive method considering a minimum time step fixed at values between 10 9 and 10 3 min depending on the soil and the difficulty of convergence the total time was designed to allow the numerical modeling of water infiltration until the attainment of the lower boundary of the numerical model more details regarding the numerical modeling may be found in previous studies bouarafa et al 2019 lassabatère et al 2006 3 3 inverse modeling of infiltration using hydrus 1d inverse modeling with hydrus has been used extensively to determine soil hydraulic characteristics hopmans and simunek 1999 köhne et al 2006 kool et al 1985 van dam et al 1994 we considered the water infiltration experiments detailed above for inverse modeling with hydrus for its fitting procedure the hydrus software considers an objective function defined as the sum of the square errors and minimizes this objective function by using the levenberg marquardt nonlinear optimization method simůnek et al 2009 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and the value of the scale parameter for water pressure head α were the sole soil hydraulic parameters to be optimized the number of optimized parameters was reduced to two in order to prevent non uniqueness and equifinality pollacco et al 2013 šimůnek and van genuchten 1997 the shape parameter n was fixed at the value of loamy soils n 1 56 since this value represents an average value among all types of soils the shape parameter m was then deduced considering that m 1 1 n the shape parameter l was fixed at its by default value l 0 5 lastly the residual water content was considered as zero and the saturated water content was set to the soil porosity 3 4 inverse modeling using ch and ga models the inverse modeling approach was used to fit the studied models including the ga model and the proposed ch models to the experimental data and to determine the related hydraulic parameters and the soil properties solving the inverse problem consists of the optimization of an objective function that corresponds to minimizing the difference between observed and simulated values hopmans et al 2002 in this study we considered the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse which is defined as follows 23 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively n is the total number of paired values x refers to the mean of the variable x the monte carlo optimization technique was used this technique consists of generating a random sample of 1 million parameter sets based on plausible value intervals computing the nse objective function for all sets and selecting the best fit i e the parameter set that maximizes the nse function eckhardt 1987 note that the maximization of the nse objective function corresponds to the minimization of the distance between the observed and the simulated data two scenarios are considered all the model parameters are listed in table 2 for the first scenario we considered the optimization of k s the other parameters being derived from field measures or fixed a priori to the values of a loam soil for ch1 and ch2 models the shape parameters n and l were fixed at the typical value of loam soils the remaining models making no use of these parameters for all the models the saturated water content θ s was deduced from the dry bulk density measured on the field the residual water content θ r was fixed at zero the initial water content θ i was measured in the field the water pressure head at surface h a was fixed at the water depth measured in the ring in addition to the hydraulic parameters and experimental conditions all the ch models have a specific parameter that corresponds to the depth of the soil profile z s o i l this last parameter must remain high enough to allow the storage in the soil profile of the total amount of infiltrated water we then selected a value of z s o i l 10 m lastly for the ga model the value of h w f h i was deduced from the initial saturation degree considering the water retention curve eq 2a with the value of hydraulic parameters of a loamy soil α 3 6 10 3 mm 1 and n 1 56 for the second scenario we considered that other parameters could vary apart from those fixed by the experimental conditions for ch1 and ch2 we considered that the hydraulic parameters n and hence m could be optimized for ch3 we allowed the initial water content θ i to be optimised to improve the fits for the ga model the value of h w f was also optimized lastly the parameter z s o i l was allowed to vary with the following condition z s o i l i t o t θ s θ i otherwise some observed cumulative infiltrations may not be modeled by the ch models which provide predictions only over the interval i 0 i m a x z s o i l θ s θ i all the details of model parametrization are provided in table 2 appendix b shows the results of fits when only the saturated hydraulic parameter is optimized it demonstrates the need to vary other parameters than k s 3 5 model assessment in this study the accuracy and robustness of the model predictions are evaluated using four criteria nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 23 normalized root mean square error nrmse percent bias indicator pbias and coefficient of determination r 2 eq 24 these criteria are computed to quantify the accuracy of fits and alignments of models to observations inverse mode or reference

respectively these statistics of the goodness of fits are usually used for the modeling of suds moriasi et al 2007 and have the following meaning the nse determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 all computations were done using r free software the scripts for the computation of results illustrated in figs 3 5 can be downloaded online at https zenodo org record 7190966 lassabatere and asry 2022 4 results and discussion 4 1 ch models in direct mode in the direct mode ch predictions were compared to numerically generated data obtained with hydrus 1d numerically generated data are considered as the reference since they are obtained by the numerical solving of richards equation without any simplification the simulated data produced by ch1 do not fit well to the hydrus 1d synthetic infiltration rate curve fig 3a i the ch1 model predicts values of q t that are very low close to zero compared to the synthetic curves consequently this model is clearly biased with a bias around 95 100 in most cases table 3 pbias for qch1 model the other statistics of the ch1 model are very close to those corresponding to a zero cumulative infiltration table 3 q ch 1 versus i t 0 the ch2 model also provides much smaller values than the synthetic infiltration rates fig 3a i the ch2 model gets closer to the reference synthetic curves for the sandy soils in particular for the largest values of the initial saturation degrees fig 3b c or for the loam at the largest initial saturation degree fig 3f the large underestimation is confirmed by the very low values of the pbias for the ch2 models with values in the range of 90 100 for the silt soil table 3 the situation improves in particular for the sandy soil at the largest values of the initial saturation degree table 3 sand at s e i 0 5 or 0 9 however the ch2 model continues to underestimate the reference synthetic curve with pbias values in the range of 35 65 for the case of the sandy soil with an initial saturation degree of 0 9 the situation improves till reaching quite a good fit fig 3c the related values of nse becomes positive nse 0 52 and a small value for the nrmse nrmse 0 69 however this model ch2 presents a typical shape with a substantial increase at the end of the cumulative infiltration which does not comply to the physics of water infiltration into quasi infinite homogeneous wettable soils in addition it remains less accurate than the ga model the specificity of the shapes of the ch2 model has implications for potential applications for the modeling of water infiltration into water repellent soils at low values of initial saturation degrees the ch2 model predicts a zero infiltration rate increasing to a maximum value similar to the ch3 model prediction at i max fig 3a d g such a shape is opposite to the regular shape that decreases from infinity to the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity modeling by abou najm et al 2021 is of relevance here those authors modeled such a trend at the beginning of water infiltration when water repellence remains active and before water infiltration recovers its full potential abou najm et al 2021 fig 1 such a pattern is likely to occur where there is a particularly strong water repellency the second typical shape of ch2 involves a two step decreasing increasing pattern and represents weak water repellence as observed in a layered profile by beatty and smith 2013 fig 4 consequently if the ch2 model does not comply with the regular shapes of water infiltration governed by the regular physics richards equation this model could be considered for alternative applications like water infiltration into water repellent soils provided that further investigations are conducted to test its applicability for such applications the ch3 model and the ga models present a shape in compliance with the physics of water infiltration into soils with a decrease of the infiltration rate with the cumulative infiltration note that the ch3 model can be considered as a specific case of the ga model with a particularly parametrization of the parameter h wf which explains the similarity of shapes between the two models the two models present good alignments with the synthetic curves in many situations fig 3 however for other situations the ga model performs very poorly in particular for fine soils at low initial saturation degrees conversely the ch3 model never deviates too much from the reference synthetic data the comparison of the statistics of the goodness of fit illustrates the robustness of the ch3 model less variation between cases and the better alignments in many cases see table 3 the alignment of the ch3 model is particularly accurate for the cases of the silt and the sand at s e i 0 9 fig 3c i table 3 the poor performance of the ga model may be questioned the ga model is expected to perform better for large contrasts in water content between the initial and final states and thus for coarse soils kale and sahoo 2011 which may explain in part its poor performance in addition it may result from the choice of the value h w f h i previous studies have shown that the definition of the parameter h w f is quite difficult and depends on the type of soil and on initial conditions kale and sahoo 2011 rawls et al 1983 given the poor performance of the ga model in our cases we may conclude that setting the water pressure head at the wetting front h w f to the initial value h i is not a viable option another expression should be proposed to address this concern the ch3 model provides an attractive alternative parametrization of h w f indeed the model fits are improved in most cases and even if not always optimal such a parametrization appears as a promising solution to characterizing the pressure head at the wetting front 4 2 ch models in indirect mode 4 2 1 numerical inversion the numerical model hydrus 1d was fitted to the experimental data by optimizing the hydraulic parameters related to the hydraulic functions see material and method section the numerical inversion provided accurate fits for the six experiments see fig 4 curve 5 the values of the statistics of goodness of fit confirmed the accuracy for the fits in all cases with values of the nse between 0 67 and 0 89 nrmse between 0 32 and 0 56 pbias between 1 8 and 6 3 and coefficient of determination r 2 between 0 73 and 0 93 table 4 the optimized values for the hydraulic conductivity do not vary to a large extent and have an average of 183 mm h with a standard deviation of 162 mm h the optimized values of the scale parameter α have an average value of 0 203 mm 1 and a standard deviation of 0 256 mm 1 those values correspond to a soil between sand and loamy sand for the estimation of k s and to a loamy sand for the parameter α considering the soil databases defined by carsel and parrish 1988 these data point to a typical behavior of a coarse material with a high hydraulic conductivity and little water retention by capillarity high absolute value of α see di prima et al 2020 4 2 2 inversion using ch ga models the model s performance was evaluated with a high degree of freedom in terms of the number of calibration parameters to achieve this all parameters were permitted to vary except for those that can be reliably determined from field measurements such as water content and bulk density appendix b shows that the optimization of only k s is not enough to provide satisfying fits fig 5 versus fig 4 and satifactory values of the statistics of goodness of fit table 5 versus table 4 the ch1 model fails to fit experimental data particularly the maximum infiltration rate at the beginning of the experimental tests the infiltration rate curve predicted with ch1 shows a two step trend curve with a slight increase followed by a larger decrease fig 4c more typical of water infiltration rates impacted by water repellence abou najm et al 2021 the decrease remains very light and the ch1 model remains unable to properly capture the marked decrease of observations e g fig 4c consequently the statistics of goodness of fit are not satisfactory table 4 ch1 model the best indicator is the pbias that remains low below 2 8 however the model completely misses the observed falling trend resulting in low r 2 and nse values table 4 ch1 model the estimations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity are very far from the reference values provided by hydrus 1d with relative errors in the order of 103 104 table 4 er ks this result is logical indeed for a given value of saturated hydraulic conductivity the ch1 model predicts very low infiltration rates in comparison to the reference infiltration see fig 3 and analytical analysis in appendix a consequently the fit of ch1 model to observations requires to over increase the values of k s to align the model on the observations large overestimations of k s are then expected to be systematic when inverting with the ch1 model the ch2 model exhibits the typical shapes of the curves with a classical decrease in infiltration rate in the first part of the curve e g fig 4a i 100 mm followed by a final increase e g fig 4a i 100 mm this shape was already depicted in the previous section fig 3 and is analyzed in appendix a as stated above such a typical two step decreasing increasing trend may be more appropriate for modeling water infiltration into water repellent soils for some experimental data the ch2 model is close to the observations fig 4 entpe1 2 entpe2 2 and entpe2 3 for others these models underestimate the observed data fig 4 entpe1 1 entpe1 3 and entpe2 1 the results show that the statistics of goodness of fit with nse 0 7 nrmse 0 50 pbias 10 in absolute value and r 2 0 7 get closer to the statistics related to hydrus 1d table 4 the fits lead to large over estimations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s table 4 for the other datasets the fits are less accurate and the optimization procedure has resulted in z s o i l being equal to the lower threshold z s o i l i t o t θ s θ i table 4 underlined values of z s o i l sensitivity analysis proves that the fit would have been improved with lower values of z s o i l and fit to sub datasets of experimental data appendix a however in this study we wanted to fit the whole set of experimental data which implies applying the threshold z s o i l i t o t θ s θ i the model overestimated the saturated hydraulic conductivity but to a lesser extent than for the previous examples entpe1 2 entpe2 2 and entpe2 3 even the case of entpe1 3 led to a slight underestimation table 4 thus despite fits of lower quality the estimations of k s got closer to the targeted values and may be considered as satisfying in general the ch3 model gives at least the shapes of the curves with a classical decrease of infiltration rate with the cumulative infiltration in compliance with the physics of water infiltration into soils for the experiments entpe1 2 entpe2 2 and entpe2 3 the improvement provided accurate fits with a very satisfactory alignment of the model to the observations and resultant high values of nse low values of nrmse and pbias and high values of r 2 table 4 conversely the improvement was not enough for the other cases the values of parameters show that the optimized values of z s o i l remained close to their lower threshold z s o i l i t o t θ s θ i table 4 z s o i l column underlined values for these cases the model remained far below the observations for the 2 3 of the data thus revealing an inadequate concavity fig 4 regarding the quality of estimates the predictions of the saturated hydraulic conductivity are close to the reference values hydrus 1d with relative errors er ks below 25 in all cases this model is much better than the models ch1 and ch2 lastly the ga model performed well at all times provided that the parameter h w f was properly optimized the ga model provided very good fits for all the experiments fig 4 the values of the statistics of the goodness of fits were similar to those of the hydrus 1d model revealing accurate fits table 4 similarly the values of the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity were also similar with relative errors in the order of 5 in absolute value for most experiments and never higher than 20 our findings show that the ga approach is appropriate to model water infiltration in the contexts applied here provided that the parameter h w f is optimized the conclusion is that among the ch models the model ch3 is the best candidate with good fits and related estimates when its parameters z s o i l and θ i are optimized if one considers the use of the ch3 model for suds hydrological simulations z s o i l is equivalent to the total soil layer of the suds hence only two parameters have to be estimated the initial water content and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ch3 appears to be easy to calibrate only two parameters and to perform well for both direct and inverse simulations as stated above the ch3 model is based on a ga approach with a specific parametrization of the parameter h w f with h w f z s o i l θ s θ i θ s the consequences of such a parametrization require that h w f varies between 0 and z s o i l given that 0 θ i θ s therefore the possible values z s o i l are constrained if all the observations are to be fitted since z s o i l must ensure that i m a x z s o i l θ s θ i i t o t where i t o t corresponds to the total observed cumulative infiltration in some cases this constraint poses a challenge to achieve excellent fits however very good model fits are obtained in most cases despite this limitation see fig 4 and table 4 in conclusion the ability of the ch models to model water infiltration into soils is affected by the nature of their lower boundary conditions i e the zero flux condition no water leakage in reality the blocks of soil represented by these reservoirs are connected to the soil underneath in this regard the numerically generated data obtained by solving richards equation with a free drainage lower boundary may be a better to fit real field conditions simůnek et al 2009 the zero flux condition no water leakage at the base has a great impact on the capability of the ch models to describe water infiltration into infinite soil profiles for the three ch models no more than the total capacity of the reservoir can be infiltrated this limitation has an impact on the values of the soil parameter z s o i l and thus on the quality of fits for the ch3 model as demonstrated above in addition to that limitation the ch1 and ch2 suffer from a second limitation in relation to the link between hydraulic conductivity and saturation degree the infiltration of water increases the saturation degree and thus the value of the hydraulic conductivity particularly close to water saturation this drastically impacts the infiltration rates as demonstrated above fig 3 and in appendix a these features may be interesting to exploit for the modeling of water repellency which physically limits water infiltration over short time periods before subsequently increasing it over longer times once repellency is overcome 5 conclusions in this study alternative formulations of hydrological infiltration models have been elaborated tested and evaluated using a large data set comprising both hydrus 1d outputs and experimental data of infiltration rates and cumulative infiltrations aiming to improve the model framework developed by bonneau et al 2021 leading to the initial ch1 model we propose two alternatives the ch2 and ch3 models the results show that the best analytical models among the list of studied models are the ga followed by ch3 model the ch1 and ch2 models are not appropriate for the direct simulation of the water infiltration into soil those two models have similar features that prevent them from providing accurate prediction direct mode the ch1 model poorly predicts water infiltration in the direct mode but a better formulation of the equivalent hydraulic gradient i e q i gives the ch2 model better performance however the specific formulation of the equivalent hydraulic conductivity induces typical curve shapes that are inconsistent with the physics of water infiltration it also affects the quality of estimations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity inverse mode nevertheless these models could be considered as a good basis for future development to better simulate water repellence during water infiltration indeed both experimental data and modeling approaches predict dynamics similar to that captured reasonably well by the ch1 or the ch2 models with either increasing decreasing trends strong water repellence as already modelled by abou najm et al 2021 or decreasing increasing trends as observed experimentally for moderate water repellence beatty and smith 2013 the results indicated that the proposed ch3 model based on the reformulation of the ga model is higher performing in both direct and inverse simulations the ch3 model avoids the problems of non decreasing infiltration rates by equaling its equivalent hydraulic conductivity to the saturation hydraulic conductivity turning into a green ampt approach and offers a promising parametrization of the water pressure head at the wetting front h w f we thus consider that this choice with its explicit formulation is the best alternative for modeling water infiltration into soils however the equivalent hydraulic gradient should be improved given that the alignment of the ch3 model on numerically generated data still shows room for improvement the testing of the ch suite of models clearly demonstrates that the third option ch3 designed by analogy with the ga model seems to be the best option however it requires optimization of the way to input the initial conditions i e to rewrite the parameter h i in eq 17 or equivalently to parametrize the parameter h w f which will be the subject of future research the aim is to implement the enhanced version within a modeling framework dedicated to the modeling of bioretention systems in addition to that we intend to broaden the situations and physics addressed by our model in this study we focused mainly on water infiltration into homogeneous soils with single permeability behaviors and no water repellence however in the field more complex physics like air entrapment water repellency or preferential flow may affect water infiltration in real soils we will thus continue the adaptation of the ch suite to consider water repellent soils we also intend to extend our suite of models to the case of preferential flows and water infiltration into dual permeability soils lassabatere et al 2019 lassabatere et al 2014 among others credit authorship contribution statement asra asry conceptualization formal

1717,infiltration is a crucial process in various fields such as hydrology agriculture urban soils and particularly for sustainable urban drainage systems suds operation over the past century the physics of infiltration has been extensively studied by developing models that estimate the dynamics of infiltration in this study three physically based infiltration models ch1 ch2 and ch3 have been developed as part of the canoe hydrobox ch platform designed to simulate and evaluate the performance of suds the three models rely on similar approaches to the green ampt ga model by describing the water flux as the product of the equivalent hydraulic gradient and the equivalent hydraulic conductivity the models differ in their ways of defining the hydraulic gradient and conductivity from the hydric conditions soil parameters and geometric features the two first models ch1 and ch2 consider an increase in the hydraulic conductivity with infiltrated water amount whereas the last model ch3 considers only the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the hydraulic gradient the first model considers the difference between the surface water pressure head and the height of infiltrated water the other two models consider the difference between the surface water pressure head and the isostatic water pressure head at the surface in equilibrium with the height of infiltrated water these models were applied to simulate water infiltration processes into dry wet and intermediate wet soils we compared these results with the numerical solution of the richards equation using hydrus software the comparison allowed the assessment of the capability of ch models to satisfy the critical principles of soil water infiltration subsequently we used the three models to invert six real experimental infiltration data to test their capability to work in inverse mode the two models ch1 and ch2 produced specific time evolution of infiltration rates in disagreement with the physics of water infiltration under regular conditions e g no water repellence the third model ch3 performed the best for both direct and indirect modes and is therefore considered as the best candidate the ch3 model will be implemented in the new version of canoe hydrobox ch platform this study provides a basis for further research into hydrological models for suds and their hydraulic performance keywords urban hydrology infiltration model infiltration processes bioretention systems green ampt data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urbanization impacts the physical properties of urban soils resulting in changes in water movement and the capacity of soils to act as a sink for water transported pollution fletcher et al 2015 o loughlin et al 1996 as a result the hydrological cycle is significantly altered due to the reduction in the soil capacity to infiltrate water woltemade 2010 leading to changes in river and stream flow regimes marsalek et al 2008 miller and hess 2017 the increase in impervious surfaces increases surface runoff booth 1991 sustainable urban drainage systems suds are widely implemented for stormwater management to mitigate effects arising from the generation of runoff in urban areas bertrand krajewski et al 2000 liu et al 2012 suds aim to shift the water cycle back towards its natural cycle by reducing runoff volumes attenuating peak flows and improving water quality through various processes including infiltration filtration and biological water uptake fletcher et al 2015 suds include filter strips grassed swales bioretention facilities green roofs and permeable pavements chocat 2008 davis 2008 2005 some suds like infiltration basins are more infiltration oriented and aim to infiltrate water into a soil substrate and into underlying natural soil when the hydrogeological context allows for it ben slimene et al 2017 goutaland et al 2013 lassabatere et al 2010 others like swales play the combined roles of flow conveyance and storage but also involve infiltration fardel et al 2019 these systems may be implemented on the site s parent soil or constructed with a porous material with specific and controlled properties in these contexts water infiltration into the subsoil whether natural or artificial is one of the targets and must be understood properly the hydrological performance of suds relies in large part on the infiltration capacity of soils constitutive of suds which in turn is dependent on the soil hydraulic properties such as the water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves in addition to experimental conditions i e initial water content bockhorn et al 2017 rinderer and seibert 2012 zhu et al 2012 therefore a proper quantification and modeling of water infiltration in suds is of prime importance the models developed for water infiltration may be either empirical or theoretical including philip meyer and warrick brutsaert and haverkamp models angulo jaramillo et al 2016 marinoschi 2006 there is an increasing emphasis however on the development and use of physically based models carbone et al 2015 among these approaches the conceptual physically based green ampt model has been the subject of several investigations warrick and broadbridge 1992 and is widely used to model suds for instance the green ampt approach is incorporated in the widely used swmm software package among other options including the hortonian or the curve number infiltration models to simulate water infiltration roesner 2009 rossman 2010 richards equation has been solved numerically for decades to predict water infiltration processes in many contexts including the investigation on the hydraulic performances of suds tedoldi et al 2016 hydrus is one of the best known software modules for solving the richards equation allowing for many types of initial and boundary conditions and types of soils radcliffe and simunek 2018 the hydrus suite has been widely used in the literature for the description of the hydraulic behavior of various types of suds brunetti et al 2016 hilten et al 2008 li and babcock 2015 newcomer et al 2014 osman 2013 palla et al 2009 however hydrus requires knowledge of the entire unsaturated hydraulic properties of soils requiring the prior characterization of soils with hydraulic methods like the beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters best method angulo jaramillo et al 2016 bouarafa et al 2019 di prima et al 2020 kanso et al 2018 lassabatère et al 2006 such a requirement drastically increases the level of complexity of these models and requires a large amount of specific data effectively precluding their use by decision makers designers and practitioners therefore there is a need for easy to operate physically based models with lower calibration effort based on relatively easy data to collect and monitor e g water levels and flows the availability of parsimonious models with acceptable goodness of fit is essential to accurately predict the impact of the suds facilities in management of stormwater in current and future cities with this aim bonneau et al 2021 implemented a physically based simplified model for the prediction of water fluxes in bioretention systems named here ch1 where ch stands for canoe hydrobox hydrobox being the lid module integrated in the canoe software see chocat 2013 and montoya coronado et al 2022 this model was designed to avoid over parametrization and simulate hydraulic fluxes in bioretention systems after calibration of the model with two contrasting rainfall events representing a low and high values of rainfall intensity the model predicts the following variables water infiltration at the soil surface soil water storage vertical gravity driven infiltration in the filter media exfiltration and underdrain and outflow fluxes however the results from this study proved that some parts of the physics were not adequately represented and that improvement was still needed bonneau et al 2021 the authors related these inconsistencies to the inaccurate quantification of the infiltration component among others therefore the aim of this study is to improve the infiltration module implemented by bonneau et al 2021 regarding the physics of water infiltration into soils this module considers darcy s law to relate the infiltration rate to the equivalent hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity those being estimated from the physical and geometric features of the bioretention system to complement the ch1 model we propose two physically based models ch2 and ch3 to provide alternative definitions of the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity with the final aim being to improve both the prediction of water infiltration direct mode modeling and parameter estimation inverse mode modeling the three models ch1 ch2 and ch3 were assessed regarding their capability to accurately predict fluxes for the case of water infiltration into a soil profile which is the main component of the suds hydrological balance at the beginning of rainfall events in bioretention systems or in infiltration basins and swales we thus focus on the infiltration component and neglect all the other components considered by bonneau et al 2021 e g evapotranspiration underdrain etc these models were tested against both numerically generated data simulation of infiltration into an infinite soil profile with hydrus software for different synthetic soils and initial saturation degrees and real experimental data real infiltration runs performed in the field the models were assessed regarding their ability to fit the synthetic and real infiltration data comply with the physics governing water infiltration into soils and provide accurate estimates of hydraulic parameters e g saturated hydraulic conductivity when used in the inverse mode the final goal of this study is to provide an insight into the selection of the best infiltration module before its implementation into the broader numerical ch platform for the design and evaluation of suds including swales and infiltration basins along with bioretention systems 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 water infiltration into soils infiltration at the soil surface and water redistribution in the soil are governed by the richards equation eq 1c that combines darcy s law eq 1a with the mass conservation equation eq 1b 1a q k θ 1 h z 1b θ t q z 1c θ t z k θ 1 h z where q lt 1 is the water flux k θ lt 1 stands for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity h l for the water pressure head and θ l3 l 3 for the water content solving eq 1c requires knowledge of the hydraulic functions i e the water retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity several models were developed for these functions and a review can be found in angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the van genuchten 1980 model with the mualem condition is often considered for the description of the water retention curve the mualem 1976 model for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is also among the most frequently used models these models are as follows 2a θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 2b k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θ r l3 l 3 and θ s l3 l 3 stand for the residual and the saturated water contents α l 1 is the scale parameter for the water pressure head k s lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s e θ θ r θ s θ r is the saturation degree n m 1 1 n mualem s condition and l are hydraulic shape parameters solving eq 1 for given water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions allows the determination of flow variables leading to the type of results described in fig 1 a c for the case of water infiltration into a uniform profile with uniform initial water contents and water pressure heads and for a constant water pressure head h a imposed at the soil surface fig 1a c describes the typical characteristics of the variables involved in infiltrating water into homogeneous soils fig 1a and 1b represent respectively the water pressure head and water content profiles as a function of time each line corresponds to a specific time fig 1c shows the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration at the soil surface in the beginning the difference in water pressure head δ h h a h i between the surface and the soil applies to a very thick soil layer above the wetting front positioned at small depths z wf fig 1a the capillary part of the hydraulic gradient h z δ h z wf then takes extremely large values close to infinity with time the wetting front moves downwards thus increasing the depth of the wetting front z wf and then decreasing the capillary component of the hydraulic gradient given that the gravity part of the hydraulic gradient remains the same i e 1 the total hydraulic gradient follows the same decreasing trend for very long times when the wetting front reaches quasi infinite values if allowed to do so for example where the soil layer is deep enough z wf the capillary part of the hydraulic gradient tends towards zero h z δ h z wf 0 and consequently the hydraulic gradient tends towards unity meaning that the infiltration tends towards k s consequently the infiltration rate decreases from infinity to the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity at steady state fig 1c i e q z 0 t k s giving the cumulative infiltration i t its specific shape with a concave part for the transient state followed by a linear part for the steady state fig 1c these features result from the principles of the physics of water infiltration into homogeneous semi infinite soils angulo jaramillo et al 2016 lassabatere et al 2009 2 2 design of the proposed sets of infiltration models the canoe hydrobox platform is based on the reservoir approach assimilating the soil profile to a block of given depth z s o i l l and a given area at the surface a 1 m 2 l2 fig 1g l the water flux q t lt 1 is averaged at the scale of the block and related to an equivalent hydraulic gradient i e q ll 1 and equivalent hydraulic conductivity k e q lt 1 3 q t k e q i e q several assumptions must be made to define k e q and i e q and to relate the averaged infiltration rate q t to the cumulative infiltration at the surface i t l leading to the definition of a characteristic function q i the green and ampt 1911 model is also based on the same approach but with specific definitions of k e q and i e q the design of k e q and i e q and the characteristic function q i are described below for the proposed models ch1 2 and 3 for these models we assume that there are no fluxes at the base of the soil block 2 2 1 hydraulic conductivity k e q for the hydraulic conductivity k e q is either equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity k e q k s like for the green and ampt 1911 model or is equal to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k e q k s e k s needing the quantification of the saturation degree s e at the scale of the soil block in this study we consider the approach implemented by bonneau et al 2021 to estimate the profile averaged saturation degree s e e q these authors considered that the total volume of water present in the profile v w a l3 could be converted into an equivalent volume of water v w b l3 in the same profile with a homogeneous saturation degree s e e q fig 1h then at any time t the total water content θ l3 l 3 in the profile is computed as the sum of the initial water content and the contribution of infiltration from the surface see fig 1h 4 θ θ i v w a d d e d a z s o i l where θ i l3 l 3 corresponds to the initial water content assumed homogeneous over the entire soil depth and v w a d d e d l3 to the volume of water added to the soil block due to the water infiltration at the surface to go further v w a d d e d can be easily related to the cumulative infiltration i l in eq 4 considering that it corresponds to v w a d d e d divided by the infiltration surface i e i v w a d d e d a leading to 5 θ θ i i z s o i l and thus one obtains the following expression for the saturation degree s e e q 6 s e e q s e i i z s o i l θ s θ r where s e i represents the initial saturation degree therefore the equivalent saturation degree s e e q can be inserted into the hydraulic conductivity function as defined by the mualem 1976 model k s e eq 2b to compute the hydraulic conductivity k e q c h 1 lt 1 as a function of the cumulative infiltration i 7 k e q c h 1 i k s s e i i z s o i l θ s θ r l 1 1 s e i i z s o i l θ s θ r 1 m m 2 for the specific case of the saturation degree description with the eq 6 the subscript ch1 in k e q c h 1 i refers to the fact that this function was developed for the design of the ch1 model considering the case of no leakage at the base of the soil block the volume of water added to the soil block cannot exceed the volume of voids initially filled with air and thus available for the water entering in the soil block i e a z s o i l θ s θ i the maximum infiltration corresponds to i m a x z s o i l θ s θ i and no quantities should be computed for larger cumulative infiltration i i m a x corresponding to the saturation degrees s e 1 which is meaningless with regards to the principles of soil physics 2 2 2 hydraulic gradient ieq 2 2 2 1 green ampt ga model the green and ampt 1911 model considers the saturated region of the soil between the surface and the position of the wetting front z w f to compute the hydraulic gradient over this region fig 1d e at the surface the water pressure head imposed at the soil surface is positive h a 0 and the water content equals the saturated water content for infiltration experiments h a corresponds to the water height in the ring the ga model assumes stepwise functions for both water content and water pressure heads water content shifts between the initial and the saturated values of water content θ i and θ s respectively at the wetting front water pressure head shifts from the value at the wetting front h w f to the value imposed at the surface h a the difference in the water pressure head can be considered δ h h a h w f l and the equivalent hydraulic gradient i e q g a ll 1 can be computed from the gravity driven 1 and capillary driven gradient h z δ h z w f 8 i e q g a 1 δ h z w f the replacement of the position of the wetting front as a function of the cumulative infiltration z w f i δ θ mass conservation leads to the following final expression 9a i e q g a i 1 δ θ δ h i 9b i e q g a i 1 θ s θ i h a h w f i several approaches have already been proposed for the definition of h w f see kale and sahoo 2011 for a review including applications to stormwater control measures lee et al 2013 as a first approach we equate h w f to the initial water pressure head h w f h i this choice is discussed in results and discussion with regard to alternative options and the direct optimization of h w f is also proposed 2 2 2 2 ch1 model and related hydraulic gradient the ch1 model implemented by bonneau et al 2021 computes the hydraulic gradient between the surface and the lower depth of the soil column z s o i l the water pressure head gradient h z considers that the water pressure head is fixed at the surface at h a and that the water pressure head at the lower boundary is in equilibrium with the column of water above in other words the water in the profile is allowed to drain instantaneously until the lower limit at z z s o i l no leakage at the base of the reservoir and to form a saturated zone with a specific height h w imposing the lower water pressure head fig 1h these assumptions were considered for coarse materials like in the base of bioretention systems with water drainage and storage layers the depth of saturated soil is then computed from the total quantity of water in the profile v w l3 and the saturated water content θ s considering a stepwise distribution into the profile for water content θ z fig 1h 10 v w t a 0 z soil θ z t d z a 0 h w t θ s d z a h w t θ s eq 10 is an approximation since it considers that the water content above the saturated zone is negligible and that all the water present in the profile saturates the soils over the depth h w the depth h w l can then be easily derived from the volume of water v w 11 h w t v w t a θ s the volume v w is equal to the initial volume added with the volume of infiltrated water leading to 12 v w t a z s o i l θ i a i t 13 h w t v w t a θ s a z s o i l θ i a i t a θ s 14 h w t θ i θ s z s o i l i t θ s the equivalent hydraulic gradient i e q c h 1 t ll 1 can be computed by dividing the difference in water pressure head δ h h a h w l by the total distance z s o i l l fig 1 leading to 15 i e q c h 1 t 1 h a h w t z s o i l 16a i e q c h 1 t 1 h a z s o i l θ i θ s i t z s o i l θ s 16b i e q c h 1 i 1 h a z s o i l θ i θ s i z s o i l θ s again eq 16 are valid as long as there are no water leaks at the lower boundary of the soil block otherwise additional fluxes should be added to the expression of h w t 2 2 2 3 alternative hydraulic gradient for ch2 and ch3 the water pressure head gradient previously computed for the ch1 model may lead to h a z s o i l θ i θ s i z s o i l θ s 0 meaning a hydraulic gradient lower than unity i e q 1 see eq 16 this implies that the infiltration rate may be lower than the gravity driven infiltration which is meaningless with regards to the physics of water infiltration into quasi infinite soils two enhanced ch2 and ch3 models are developed as alternative ways to quantify the hydraulic gradient as previously assumed for ch1 the water initially present in the soil profile is still allowed to drain and create a saturated zone of a depth of h w i at time zero but the computation of the initial water pressure head at the surface and over the profile h i was modified in this new version h i l equates to the initial isostatic water pressure head and then relates to the initial water pressure head at the base of the soil block h w i l leading to 17 h i z s o i l h w i 18 h i z s o i l θ i θ s θ s 19 δ h h a h i 20 δ h h a z s o i l θ s θ i θ s to compute the hydraulic gradient we divide the difference of water pressure head δ h with the position of the wetting front as suggested by green and ampt 1911 instead of the soil block depth z s o i l this leads to the following expressions 21 i e q c h 2 3 t 1 h a z s o i l θ s θ i θ s z w f t 22a i e q c h 2 3 t 1 h a z s o i l θ s θ i θ s θ s θ i i t 22b i e q c h 2 3 i 1 h a z s o i l θ s θ i θ s θ s θ i i in eqs 22a and 22b the position of the wetting front z w f is replaced by its expression as a function of cumulative infiltration i e z w f t i t θ s θ i 2 2 3 summary of the set of models 2 2 3 1 ch1 model the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is taken as the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k e q c h 1 i as defined by eq 7 and the hydraulic gradient i e q c h 1 i as defined by eq 16 2 2 3 2 new ch2 model the ch2 model considers only the change in hydraulic gradient i e q c h 2 3 i as defined by eq 22 instead of i e q c h 1 i while the equivalent hydraulic conductivity remains defined by the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k e q c h 2 i k e q c h 1 i using eq 7 2 2 3 3 new ch3 model the hydraulic gradient relies on the alternative function i e q c h 2 3 i defined by eq 22 like the ch2 model whereas the equivalent hydraulic conductivity is fixed at the saturated hydraulic conductivity k e q c h 3 i k s this model can be seen as equivalent to the ga model for the specific case of h w f z s o i l θ s θ i θ s in other words the ch3 model corresponds to a version of the ga model parametrized as a function of the reservoir hydraulic and geometrical features i e z s o i l θ i and θ s once the options are selected for the equivalent hydraulic conductivity k e q and hydraulic gradient i e q all the models define the infiltration rate as the product of k e q and i e q leading to the function q i 3 material and methods the ch models were evaluated using two approaches in this study firstly the ch models were evaluated in direct mode and were used to model different scenarios of water infiltration 12 types of soils with three levels of initial saturation their numerical results were compared to those provided by the ga approach and those generated numerically with hydrus 1d numerical solution of richards equation then the ch models were tested in inverse mode therefore the ch models as well as the ga approach and hydrus 1d model were used to invert water infiltration data acquired with the single ring procedure angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the quality of fits and the estimates for hydraulic parameters were compared and discussed those steps allowed the assessment of the ch models under both direct and inverse modes 3 1 field experiments the experimental data involve six infiltration tests undertaken on vegetated soils with a large ring infiltrometer that is under development within the framework of the infiltron project https www infiltron org the ring 50 cm in diameter was directly inserted into the ground 5 cm insertion and a constant height of water between 5 and 10 cm was imposed in the ring corresponding to a water pressure head of approximately h a 0 1 m two big reservoirs located nearby maintain constant water level in the ring fig 2 the operators monitored the drop in water level in the reservoirs to measure the infiltration rates the cumulative infiltrations were then deduced by dividing the volume of infiltrated water by the ring surface these experiments were performed at two sites fig 2 in the campus of the entpe located in vaulx en velin lyon france more details on the characterization of the loamy soil may be found in previous works concialdi et al 2020 we also sampled the soil to obtain the value of the initial water content and the soil bulk density leading to the following derivations i entpe 1 site the initial averaged water content value was measured at 0 31 cm3 cm 3 the dry bulk density was measured at 1 24 g cm 3 corresponding to a porosity value of 0 53 cm3 cm 3 assuming the default value of the mineral density i e 2 65 g cm 3 ii entpe 2 site the initial averaged water content value was measured at 0 40 cm3 cm 3 the dry bulk density was measured at 1 28 g cm 3 which corresponds to a porosity value of 0 52 cm3 cm 3 under the above assumption given the large dimension of the ring i e 50 cm in diameter we consider that the lateral flux is negligible this flux being proportional to the inverse of the ring radius smettem et al 1994 and then expected to be negligible for our large ring consequently we consider that the water infiltration is mainly 1d instead of 3d and the data can be modeled by the proposed models that were designed for 1d infiltration into soils water ponding depths in the ring 10 cm are higher than those observed in other measurement methods such as beerkan experiments 1 cm see angulo jaramillo et al 2016 for a review such conditions result from the design of the prototype of infiltrometer developed for the infiltron project these conditions are expected to ensure full saturation of all the soil pores including the largest ones and to promote preferential flow e g lassabatere et al 2014 3 2 direct modeling with hydrus 1d we considered the numerically generated data as the reference since they are directly based on the numerical solving of richards equation eq 1 without any simplification this study modeled 1d vertical infiltration processes with hydrus 1d software šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the models were thoroughly tested using twelve common synthetic soils with diverse hydraulic characteristics from the carsel and parrish database carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 summarizes the corresponding hydraulic parameters as described by eqs 2 for water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves for all of the soils a numerical domain 2 5 m deep and a step discretization of 5 mm were used to calculate the water infiltration we used a 5 cm constant water pressure head at the soil surface and uniform initial water contents and water pressure heads with several values to mimic contrasting scenarios initially dry or wet soils the value of 5 cm for the water pressure head imposed at the surface was chosen as being intermediate between the observed water depth 10 cm in the large ring of the prototype developed for the infiltron project lassabatere et al 2020 and used in our study and regular values usually used for regular beerkan experiments 1 cm the lower boundary was designed as free drainage as usually considered for an unsaturated soil profile with small depths šimůnek 2006 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the time steps were managed with the hydrus 1d adaptive method considering a minimum time step fixed at values between 10 9 and 10 3 min depending on the soil and the difficulty of convergence the total time was designed to allow the numerical modeling of water infiltration until the attainment of the lower boundary of the numerical model more details regarding the numerical modeling may be found in previous studies bouarafa et al 2019 lassabatère et al 2006 3 3 inverse modeling of infiltration using hydrus 1d inverse modeling with hydrus has been used extensively to determine soil hydraulic characteristics hopmans and simunek 1999 köhne et al 2006 kool et al 1985 van dam et al 1994 we considered the water infiltration experiments detailed above for inverse modeling with hydrus for its fitting procedure the hydrus software considers an objective function defined as the sum of the square errors and minimizes this objective function by using the levenberg marquardt nonlinear optimization method simůnek et al 2009 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and the value of the scale parameter for water pressure head α were the sole soil hydraulic parameters to be optimized the number of optimized parameters was reduced to two in order to prevent non uniqueness and equifinality pollacco et al 2013 šimůnek and van genuchten 1997 the shape parameter n was fixed at the value of loamy soils n 1 56 since this value represents an average value among all types of soils the shape parameter m was then deduced considering that m 1 1 n the shape parameter l was fixed at its by default value l 0 5 lastly the residual water content was considered as zero and the saturated water content was set to the soil porosity 3 4 inverse modeling using ch and ga models the inverse modeling approach was used to fit the studied models including the ga model and the proposed ch models to the experimental data and to determine the related hydraulic parameters and the soil properties solving the inverse problem consists of the optimization of an objective function that corresponds to minimizing the difference between observed and simulated values hopmans et al 2002 in this study we considered the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse which is defined as follows 23 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively n is the total number of paired values x refers to the mean of the variable x the monte carlo optimization technique was used this technique consists of generating a random sample of 1 million parameter sets based on plausible value intervals computing the nse objective function for all sets and selecting the best fit i e the parameter set that maximizes the nse function eckhardt 1987 note that the maximization of the nse objective function corresponds to the minimization of the distance between the observed and the simulated data two scenarios are considered all the model parameters are listed in table 2 for the first scenario we considered the optimization of k s the other parameters being derived from field measures or fixed a priori to the values of a loam soil for ch1 and ch2 models the shape parameters n and l were fixed at the typical value of loam soils the remaining models making no use of these parameters for all the models the saturated water content θ s was deduced from the dry bulk density measured on the field the residual water content θ r was fixed at zero the initial water content θ i was measured in the field the water pressure head at surface h a was fixed at the water depth measured in the ring in addition to the hydraulic parameters and experimental conditions all the ch models have a specific parameter that corresponds to the depth of the soil profile z s o i l this last parameter must remain high enough to allow the storage in the soil profile of the total amount of infiltrated water we then selected a value of z s o i l 10 m lastly for the ga model the value of h w f h i was deduced from the initial saturation degree considering the water retention curve eq 2a with the value of hydraulic parameters of a loamy soil α 3 6 10 3 mm 1 and n 1 56 for the second scenario we considered that other parameters could vary apart from those fixed by the experimental conditions for ch1 and ch2 we considered that the hydraulic parameters n and hence m could be optimized for ch3 we allowed the initial water content θ i to be optimised to improve the fits for the ga model the value of h w f was also optimized lastly the parameter z s o i l was allowed to vary with the following condition z s o i l i t o t θ s θ i otherwise some observed cumulative infiltrations may not be modeled by the ch models which provide predictions only over the interval i 0 i m a x z s o i l θ s θ i all the details of model parametrization are provided in table 2 appendix b shows the results of fits when only the saturated hydraulic parameter is optimized it demonstrates the need to vary other parameters than k s 3 5 model assessment in this study the accuracy and robustness of the model predictions are evaluated using four criteria nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 23 normalized root mean square error nrmse

be downloaded online at https zenodo org record 7190966 lassabatere and asry 2022 4 results and discussion 4 1 ch models in direct mode in the direct mode ch predictions were compared to numerically generated data obtained with hydrus 1d numerically generated data are considered as the reference since they are obtained by the numerical solving of richards equation without any simplification the simulated data produced by ch1 do not fit well to the hydrus 1d synthetic infiltration rate curve fig 3a i the ch1 model predicts values of q t that are very low close to zero compared to the synthetic curves consequently this model is clearly biased with a bias around 95 100 in most cases table 3 pbias for qch1 model the other statistics of the ch1 model are very close to those corresponding to a zero cumulative infiltration table 3 q ch 1 versus i t 0 the ch2 model also provides much smaller values than the synthetic infiltration rates fig 3a i the ch2 model gets closer to the reference synthetic curves for the sandy soils in particular for the largest values of the initial saturation degrees fig 3b c or for the loam at the largest initial saturation degree fig 3f the large underestimation is confirmed by the very low values of the pbias for the ch2 models with values in the range of 90 100 for the silt soil table 3 the situation improves in particular for the sandy soil at the largest values of the initial saturation degree table 3 sand at s e i 0 5 or 0 9 however the ch2 model continues to underestimate the reference synthetic curve with pbias values in the range of 35 65 for the case of the sandy soil with an initial saturation degree of 0 9 the situation improves till reaching quite a good fit fig 3c the related values of nse becomes positive nse 0 52 and a small value for the nrmse nrmse 0 69 however this model ch2 presents a typical shape with a substantial increase at the end of the cumulative infiltration which does not comply to the physics of water infiltration into quasi infinite homogeneous wettable soils in addition it remains less accurate than the ga model the specificity of the shapes of the ch2 model has implications for potential applications for the modeling of water infiltration into water repellent soils at low values of initial saturation degrees the ch2 model predicts a zero infiltration rate increasing to a maximum value similar to the ch3 model prediction at i max fig 3a d g such a shape is opposite to the regular shape that decreases from infinity to the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity modeling by abou najm et al 2021 is of relevance here those authors modeled such a trend at the beginning of water infiltration when water repellence remains active and before water infiltration recovers its full potential abou najm et al 2021 fig 1 such a pattern is likely to occur where there is a particularly strong water repellency the second typical shape of ch2 involves a two step decreasing increasing pattern and represents weak water repellence as observed in a layered profile by beatty and smith 2013 fig 4 consequently if the ch2 model does not comply with the regular shapes of water infiltration governed by the regular physics richards equation this model could be considered for alternative applications like water infiltration into water repellent soils provided that further investigations are conducted to test its applicability for such applications the ch3 model and the ga models present a shape in compliance with the physics of water infiltration into soils with a decrease of the infiltration rate with the cumulative infiltration note that the ch3 model can be considered as a specific case of the ga model with a particularly parametrization of the parameter h wf which explains the similarity of shapes between the two models the two models present good alignments with the synthetic curves in many situations fig 3 however for other situations the ga model performs very poorly in particular for fine soils at low initial saturation degrees conversely the ch3 model never deviates too much from the reference synthetic data the comparison of the statistics of the goodness of fit illustrates the robustness of the ch3 model less variation between cases and the better alignments in many cases see table 3 the alignment of the ch3 model is particularly accurate for the cases of the silt and the sand at s e i 0 9 fig 3c i table 3 the poor performance of the ga model may be questioned the ga model is expected to perform better for large contrasts in water content between the initial and final states and thus for coarse soils kale and sahoo 2011 which may explain in part its poor performance in addition it may result from the choice of the value h w f h i previous studies have shown that the definition of the parameter h w f is quite difficult and depends on the type of soil and on initial conditions kale and sahoo 2011 rawls et al 1983 given the poor performance of the ga model in our cases we may conclude that setting the water pressure head at the wetting front h w f to the initial value h i is not a viable option another expression should be proposed to address this concern the ch3 model provides an attractive alternative parametrization of h w f indeed the model fits are improved in most cases and even if not always optimal such a parametrization appears as a promising solution to characterizing the pressure head at the wetting front 4 2 ch models in indirect mode 4 2 1 numerical inversion the numerical model hydrus 1d was fitted to the experimental data by optimizing the hydraulic parameters related to the hydraulic functions see material and method section the numerical inversion provided accurate fits for the six experiments see fig 4 curve 5 the values of the statistics of goodness of fit confirmed the accuracy for the fits in all cases with values of the nse between 0 67 and 0 89 nrmse between 0 32 and 0 56 pbias between 1 8 and 6 3 and coefficient of determination r 2 between 0 73 and 0 93 table 4 the optimized values for the hydraulic conductivity do not vary to a large extent and have an average of 183 mm h with a standard deviation of 162 mm h the optimized values of the scale parameter α have an average value of 0 203 mm 1 and a standard deviation of 0 256 mm 1 those values correspond to a soil between sand and loamy sand for the estimation of k s and to a loamy sand for the parameter α considering the soil databases defined by carsel and parrish 1988 these data point to a typical behavior of a coarse material with a high hydraulic conductivity and little water retention by capillarity high absolute value of α see di prima et al 2020 4 2 2 inversion using ch ga models the model s performance was evaluated with a high degree of freedom in terms of the number of calibration parameters to achieve this all parameters were permitted to vary except for those that can be reliably determined from field measurements such as water content and bulk density appendix b shows that the optimization of only k s is not enough to provide satisfying fits fig 5 versus fig 4 and satifactory values of the statistics of goodness of fit table 5 versus table 4 the ch1 model fails to fit experimental data particularly the maximum infiltration rate at the beginning of the experimental tests the infiltration rate curve predicted with ch1 shows a two step trend curve with a slight increase followed by a larger decrease fig 4c more typical of water infiltration rates impacted by water repellence abou najm et al 2021 the decrease remains very light and the ch1 model remains unable to properly capture the marked decrease of observations e g fig 4c consequently the statistics of goodness of fit are not satisfactory table 4 ch1 model the best indicator is the pbias that remains low below 2 8 however the model completely misses the observed falling trend resulting in low r 2 and nse values table 4 ch1 model the estimations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity are very far from the reference values provided by hydrus 1d with relative errors in the order of 103 104 table 4 er ks this result is logical indeed for a given value of saturated hydraulic conductivity the ch1 model predicts very low infiltration rates in comparison to the reference infiltration see fig 3 and analytical analysis in appendix a consequently the fit of ch1 model to observations requires to over increase the values of k s to align the model on the observations large overestimations of k s are then expected to be systematic when inverting with the ch1 model the ch2 model exhibits the typical shapes of the curves with a classical decrease in infiltration rate in the first part of the curve e g fig 4a i 100 mm followed by a final increase e g fig 4a i 100 mm this shape was already depicted in the previous section fig 3 and is analyzed in appendix a as stated above such a typical two step decreasing increasing trend may be more appropriate for modeling water infiltration into water repellent soils for some experimental data the ch2 model is close to the observations fig 4 entpe1 2 entpe2 2 and entpe2 3 for others these models underestimate the observed data fig 4 entpe1 1 entpe1 3 and entpe2 1 the results show that the statistics of goodness of fit with nse 0 7 nrmse 0 50 pbias 10 in absolute value and r 2 0 7 get closer to the statistics related to hydrus 1d table 4 the fits lead to large over estimations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s table 4 for the other datasets the fits are less accurate and the optimization procedure has resulted in z s o i l being equal to the lower threshold z s o i l i t o t θ s θ i table 4 underlined values of z s o i l sensitivity analysis proves that the fit would have been improved with lower values of z s o i l and fit to sub datasets of experimental data appendix a however in this study we wanted to fit the whole set of experimental data which implies applying the threshold z s o i l i t o t θ s θ i the model overestimated the saturated hydraulic conductivity but to a lesser extent than for the previous examples entpe1 2 entpe2 2 and entpe2 3 even the case of entpe1 3 led to a slight underestimation table 4 thus despite fits of lower quality the estimations of k s got closer to the targeted values and may be considered as satisfying in general the ch3 model gives at least the shapes of the curves with a classical decrease of infiltration rate with the cumulative infiltration in compliance with the physics of water infiltration into soils for the experiments entpe1 2 entpe2 2 and entpe2 3 the improvement provided accurate fits with a very satisfactory alignment of the model to the observations and resultant high values of nse low values of nrmse and pbias and high values of r 2 table 4 conversely the improvement was not enough for the other cases the values of parameters show that the optimized values of z s o i l remained close to their lower threshold z s o i l i t o t θ s θ i table 4 z s o i l column underlined values for these cases the model remained far below the observations for the 2 3 of the data thus revealing an inadequate concavity fig 4 regarding the quality of estimates the predictions of the saturated hydraulic conductivity are close to the reference values hydrus 1d with relative errors er ks below 25 in all cases this model is much better than the models ch1 and ch2 lastly the ga model performed well at all times provided that the parameter h w f was properly optimized the ga model provided very good fits for all the experiments fig 4 the values of the statistics of the goodness of fits were similar to those of the hydrus 1d model revealing accurate fits table 4 similarly the values of the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity were also similar with relative errors in the order of 5 in absolute value for most experiments and never higher than 20 our findings show that the ga approach is appropriate to model water infiltration in the contexts applied here provided that the parameter h w f is optimized the conclusion is that among the ch models the model ch3 is the best candidate with good fits and related estimates when its parameters z s o i l and θ i are optimized if one considers the use of the ch3 model for suds hydrological simulations z s o i l is equivalent to the total soil layer of the suds hence only two parameters have to be estimated the initial water content and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ch3 appears to be easy to calibrate only two parameters and to perform well for both direct and inverse simulations as stated above the ch3 model is based on a ga approach with a specific parametrization of the parameter h w f with h w f z s o i l θ s θ i θ s the consequences of such a parametrization require that h w f varies between 0 and z s o i l given that 0 θ i θ s therefore the possible values z s o i l are constrained if all the observations are to be fitted since z s o i l must ensure that i m a x z s o i l θ s θ i i t o t where i t o t corresponds to the total observed cumulative infiltration in some cases this constraint poses a challenge to achieve excellent fits however very good model fits are obtained in most cases despite this limitation see fig 4 and table 4 in conclusion the ability of the ch models to model water infiltration into soils is affected by the nature of their lower boundary conditions i e the zero flux condition no water leakage in reality the blocks of soil represented by these reservoirs are connected to the soil underneath in this regard the numerically generated data obtained by solving richards equation with a free drainage lower boundary may be a better to fit real field conditions simůnek et al 2009 the zero flux condition no water leakage at the base has a great impact on the capability of the ch models to describe water infiltration into infinite soil profiles for the three ch models no more than the total capacity of the reservoir can be infiltrated this limitation has an impact on the values of the soil parameter z s o i l and thus on the quality of fits for the ch3 model as demonstrated above in addition to that limitation the ch1 and ch2 suffer from a second limitation in relation to the link between hydraulic conductivity and saturation degree the infiltration of water increases the saturation degree and thus the value of the hydraulic conductivity particularly close to water saturation this drastically impacts the infiltration rates as demonstrated above fig 3 and in appendix a these features may be interesting to exploit for the modeling of water repellency which physically limits water infiltration over short time periods before subsequently increasing it over longer times once repellency is overcome 5 conclusions in this study alternative formulations of hydrological infiltration models have been elaborated tested and evaluated using a large data set comprising both hydrus 1d outputs and experimental data of infiltration rates and cumulative infiltrations aiming to improve the model framework developed by bonneau et al 2021 leading to the initial ch1 model we propose two alternatives the ch2 and ch3 models the results show that the best analytical models among the list of studied models are the ga followed by ch3 model the ch1 and ch2 models are not appropriate for the direct simulation of the water infiltration into soil those two models have similar features that prevent them from providing accurate prediction direct mode the ch1 model poorly predicts water infiltration in the direct mode but a better formulation of the equivalent hydraulic gradient i e q i gives the ch2 model better performance however the specific formulation of the equivalent hydraulic conductivity induces typical curve shapes that are inconsistent with the physics of water infiltration it also affects the quality of estimations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity inverse mode nevertheless these models could be considered as a good basis for future development to better simulate water repellence during water infiltration indeed both experimental data and modeling approaches predict dynamics similar to that captured reasonably well by the ch1 or the ch2 models with either increasing decreasing trends strong water repellence as already modelled by abou najm et al 2021 or decreasing increasing trends as observed experimentally for moderate water repellence beatty and smith 2013 the results indicated that the proposed ch3 model based on the reformulation of the ga model is higher performing in both direct and inverse simulations the ch3 model avoids the problems of non decreasing infiltration rates by equaling its equivalent hydraulic conductivity to the saturation hydraulic conductivity turning into a green ampt approach and offers a promising parametrization of the water pressure head at the wetting front h w f we thus consider that this choice with its explicit formulation is the best alternative for modeling water infiltration into soils however the equivalent hydraulic gradient should be improved given that the alignment of the ch3 model on numerically generated data still shows room for improvement the testing of the ch suite of models clearly demonstrates that the third option ch3 designed by analogy with the ga model seems to be the best option however it requires optimization of the way to input the initial conditions i e to rewrite the parameter h i in eq 17 or equivalently to parametrize the parameter h w f which will be the subject of future research the aim is to implement the enhanced version within a modeling framework dedicated to the modeling of bioretention systems in addition to that we intend to broaden the situations and physics addressed by our model in this study we focused mainly on water infiltration into homogeneous soils with single permeability behaviors and no water repellence however in the field more complex physics like air entrapment water repellency or preferential flow may affect water infiltration in real soils we will thus continue the adaptation of the ch suite to consider water repellent soils we also intend to extend our suite of models to the case of preferential flows and water infiltration into dual permeability soils lassabatere et al 2019 lassabatere et al 2014 among others credit authorship contribution statement asra asry conceptualization formal

1718,maintaining river health in a changing environment is an important way to improve the service value of the river basin ecosystem an ecological flow threshold process with multiple ecological constraints was proposed using the range of variability approach method and the improved intra annual spreading method when combined with the multi source dataset and the invest model a ecology function pattern driven and decision service framework was proposed the study found that the important ecological constraints of the ecological flow in the xiangjiang river basin changed after the hydrological change 1991 2019 high pulse occurrence times were delayed by 3 d while low pulse occurrence times and durations were advanced by 8 d and delayed by 10 d respectively temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration are all important factors influencing the dynamic characteristics of the basin s water yield services human activities and climate change have contributed nearly 19 more to the temporal and spatial differentiation characteristics of water yield in the basin than in the natural period additionally it was discovered that excessive rainfall can inhibit the impact of other variables on water yield within the basin furthermore the pivotal levels of significant meteorological factors that affect the water yield value of the basin were elucidated this research leads to a better knowledge of watershed hydrological health in changing environments and a scientific basis for local water resource management decisions and optimal utilization of ecosystem service values keywords ecosystem services ecological flow attribution analysis changing environment river health xiangjiang watershed data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction rivers complete the exchange of material nutrients and energy flows through the hydrological cycle and are one of the important connectors between the natural environment and human society gustafsson et al 2012 read et al 2014 in terms of natural functions and social and economic benefits conducting research on the hydrological situation of large river basins from the overall perspective of the river basin is an important way to accurately understand the safety of river basin ecosystems and the value of ecosystem services palmer ruhi 2019 deng et al 2021 however climate change and the intensification of human activities are driving the large rivers in major river basins to change their natural hydrological regimes and at the same time causing the gradual decline of ecosystem services ekka et al 2020 wu et al 2022 therefore maintaining the healthy development of rivers in the basin is an important guarantee for promoting the upward economic development of the basin in 1972 the united states environmental protection agency proposed the concept of river health the natural dynamic characteristics of a river determine its structural and functional integrity and natural flow is the master variable for maintaining the ecological health of the river poff et al 1997 poff et al 2010 under the condition of natural flow the organisms in the river can maintain their original life activities and the natural flow is also called ecological flow however with the deepening of research the viewpoint that the element of water yield service value of the basin should also be classified as river health has been proposed meyer 1997 lai zhang 2022 the water yield service value consists of two parts the first part is to provide human beings with sufficient production and domestic water and recreational and aesthetic values and the other part is the enhancement or inhibition of such things as the carbon cycle or vegetation growth through the hydrological cycle i e indirectly affecting the welfare that humans can or do obtain through trade offs and synergistic relationships with other ecosystem services norton et al 2022 bai et al 2023 li et al 2021 xiong et al 2022 changes in land use and land cover under the influence of human activities and temperature rise caused by industrial activities will affect the flow and water production of rivers which will have a negative impact on the ecological health of rivers kabo bah eslamian 2021 however currently there is a lack of a reasonable framework for the quantitative evaluation and decision making on the healthy development of basin rivers under changing environments consequently a significant theoretical framework is proposed that integrates basin river flow and its associated ecosystem service values this framework aims to facilitate the determination of ecological flows for river basins and make full use of ecosystem values it bears scientific significance for the management and optimization of water resources within river basin systems there are various methods for determining ecological flow including hydrological method hydraulic method habitat simulation method and comprehensive method tennant 1976 gippel stewardson 1998 bovee 1982 king louw 1998 the core idea behind these methods is to propose flow recommendations that maintain the ecological health of river channels starting from the perspective of safeguarding the minimum flow requirements of aquatic organisms however as research has deepened the natural flow regime which reflects the natural variability and fluctuation of hydrological processes has replaced the single form of the minimum ecological flow value and become a focal point for river managers to consider hillman douglas terkla 2012 among them by qualitatively and quantitatively describing the ecologically significant hydrological indicators the response results of the river ecosystem to the hydrological situation can be intuitively obtained zhu wang guo 2021 the indicators of hydrological alteration range of variability approach iha rva method is a method for quantitatively assessing the degree of change in hydrological regimes considering the range of runoff changes in rivers and lakes including the range of variability of flow water level and water temperature tian et al 2019 guo et al 2021 the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest model in terms of ecosystem service value is a rather developed ecosystem service model with spatial analysis functions some academics have employed the invest model to provide decision makers with favorable economic returns goldstein et al 2012 however current frameworks for assessing the health of watershed rivers and their ecosystem services are largely based on fuzzy mathematical methods meynell metzger stuart 2021 the main disadvantage of such frameworks is that they do not adequately consider the impact of hydrological characteristics of river channels on biota and their habitats yates et al 2019 established an ecosystem services assessment framework for river health indicators based on current pressure sources linked to benthic biological indicators however this framework also has clear limitations as it does not undertake evaluations from a watershed perspective lacks a quantitative analysis of the annual ecological hydrological situation of river channels and fails to quantitatively evaluate the driving forces of watershed ecosystem services and identifying the regional differentiation features of ecosystem services and its driving forces is also an important starting point for managers to make more informed decisions watershed models developed through invest model provide a basis for quantitative identification of ecosystem service drivers therefore this study proposed an ecology functional pattern driven and decision service framework which consists of three steps 1 propose ecological flow thresholds containing multiple ecological constraints based on the iha rva method and conduct corresponding river health assessment 2 obtain spatial and temporal dynamic evolution patterns of watershed water yield functions with the invest model and 3 explore quantitative attribution of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of drivers of watershed water production services the xiangjiang river xjr one of china s seven major yangtze river tributaries was chosen for the case study the xjr basin is the ecological and economic center of the dongting lake dtl wetlands as well as the primary support area for ecological security however since the construction of cascade reservoirs in the xjr section and the increase in human activities at the end of the 20th century the natural flow trend has been altered and a hydrological regime shift occurred in 1991 zhuo et al 2020 the shift has led to a simplification of the river s ecological system diversity and has had negative impacts on the local ecosystem in particular frequent droughts and floods have occurred in the xjr basin in recent years while the acceleration of urbanization has caused severe soil erosion and posed challenges to water security in the basin on the other hand in the dry season the xjr experiences water scarcity resulting in low water levels in the riverbed and increasingly serious ecological problems therefore selecting the xjr basin as a case for analysis is representative and significant the study results deepen our understanding of the water ecological security and the driving mechanism of ecosystem services in the river basin under the changing environment and also provide a scientific basis for the allocation and sustainable benefit of water resources in the river basin in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xjr basin 110 30 114 01 e 24 31 29 01 n has an average annual precipitation of 1 400 mm an average annual temperature of 17 6 c and a total basin area of 9 46 10 4 km 2 xjr is an important freshwater resource in hunan province fig 1 and it eventually flows into dtl the second largest freshwater lake in china the xjr basin has a developed water system and the overall pattern is asymmetrical dendritic the upper reaches of the xjr belong to the middle and low mountain landforms with steep peaks and steep mountains deep valleys and dense forests on both sides and the river course is straight the lower reaches of the river have hills and plain landforms on both sides the river course is meandering the terrain is flat and it is a typical river accumulation landform the replenishment of water in the river basins primarily relies on precipitation with peak flow occurrences typically observed from april to june the uneven terrain within the xjr basin accelerates the process of rainwater runoff resulting in rapid fluctuations in river water levels and flow rates thereby fully embodying the characteristics of mountainous and stream like rivers moreover the xjr basin serves as a significant agricultural region for commodity grain production and a concentrated area for modern agriculture in hunan province china as of 2018 the total population in the xjr basin reached 39 90 million people with an urbanization rate approaching 60 2 2 data preparation the 1959 2019 flow series in this study were obtained from the hunan water resources and hydropower survey design planning and research co ltd the remote sensing raster data in this study mainly include meteorological data temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration digital elevation model dem soil data land use land cover lulc data chen et al 2014 and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi these remote sensing raster data sources are shown in table 1 and their spatial resolution is 1 km 2 3 methods 2 3 1 integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs model the water yield module of the invest model is based on the budyko coupled water energy balance theory assumption zhang et al 2004 calculated by the pixels of the raster dataset and considering multiple related factors such as rainfall land use type soil depth evapotranspiration and vegetation at the pixel scale the corresponding water yield can be obtained fig 2 water yield includes surface runoff soil moisture litter interception and canopy interception without distinguishing between surface runoff subsurface flow and groundwater flow therefore the more water yield that is generated in a given area the greater the water supply services provided the basic formula of the water yield module is as follows 1 ae t ij p i 1 pe t ij p i 1 pe t ij p i ω 1 ω 2 y i j 1 ae t ij p i p i ω is the non physical parameter of natural climate soil properties y i j ae t ij and pe t i j are the annual average water yield annual actual evapotranspiration and annual potential evapotranspiration of grid i on land use type j respectively p i is grid the annual precipitation of i 2 3 2 appropriate ecological flow threshold method the iha rva method contains 33 indicators in five aspects monthly flow frequency occurrence time duration time and rate of change guo et al 2021 most studies have selected the 25 and 75 occurrence frequencies of the indicators in the iha as the rva threshold values for each indicator zheng et al 2020 li et al 2022b in this study we drew upon the iha indicator system and rva threshold method and took into account the actual ecological significance of each indicator as well as its potential positive impact on watershed ecosystem services tatiana et al 2021 okruszko et al 2011 sixteen indicators including the mean of 12 month median flow in natural period called monthly average flow the occurrence time and duration of high and low flow pulse are used as the index system for calculating suitable ecological flow table 2 the corresponding threshold value of each indicator is its demand range furthermore this study enhances the applicability of the intra annual spreading method in the xjr basin by calculating the minimum ecological flow mef that takes into account both flood and non flood periods the intra annual spreading method is based on natural runoff and ecohydrological processes to calculate the intra annual dynamic demand of runoff which can compensate for the deficiencies of the traditional hydrological method that uses mean values and runoff specific assurance rates as hydrological indicators to calculate ecological flows pan ruan xu 2013 the improved intra annual spreading method is as follows 3 q x 1 6 r 1 6 q x 4 q f 1 6 r 1 6 q f 5 q xmin 1 6 r 1 6 min q x 6 q fmin 1 6 r 1 6 m i n q f where q x and q f are the monthly average flow in the flood season and non flood season respectively in the natural flow period q x and q f are the average flow in the flood season and non flood season respectively q xmin and q fmin are the minimum flow in the multi year flood and non flood seasons respectively mean the specific process is to input the daily flow data of the xiangtan hydrological station during the natural period into the iha rva software calculate the monthly average flow and substitute it into equations 3 and 4 to obtain the ecological flow in flood season q x and non flood season q f the ratio of q xmin and q fmin to the flood and non flood annual average flow q x and q f respectively is taken as the mean ratio h k for the same period and the monthly average flow q i process is scaled in the same proportion to obtain the mef q e for each month of the river and lake which is the intra annual spreading algorithm of the mef 7 h 1 q x min q x h 2 q f min q f q e h k q i i 1 2 12 2 3 3 high and low flow pulse occurrence time and duration the occurrence of time and duration and the core role in maintaining the diversity of native biological biology it is one of the most influential regulators of the history of fish life and the most influential community structure fox magoulick 2019 the high and low flow pulses can be used to meet the needs of habitat structure nutrient exchange and life evolution of some species the formula for calculating the high and low flow pulses of rivers and lakes is 8 q h p 25 q i 9 q l p 75 q i where q h and q l are high and low flow p 25 q i and p 75 q i are daily traffic under the river and lakes under the guarantee rate of 25 and 75 respectively this study regarded the continuous 6 day daily average flow rate greater than the high flow rate as a high flow pulse event after the high flow pulse event ended the continuous 6 day less than low flow rate was regarded as a low flow pulse event in addition two identical pulse events that differ by less than or equal to 5 days can be considered to be affected by flow fluctuations for the same pulse event the thresholds for high and low flow pulse fluctuations are the 66 and 33 quantiles of the flow pulse sequence wang et al 2020 2 3 4 tennant method the tennant method evaluates the state of a river channel based on the percentage of runoff to the multi year average runoff during the natural period tennant 1976 the four major fish are the main fishery resources in the main stream of the xjr april to june is the peak fish spawning period and october to march is the general water use period to mitigate the influence of monthly and ten day variations in runoff on river health assessment outcomes comprehensive consideration was given to the diverse demands of aquatic organisms for flow in different periods of the xjr basin consequently the assessment threshold of the tennant method in the xjr basin was modified the specific assessment scope is shown in table 3 2 3 5 geographical detector geodetector i e geographical detector is a set of statistical methods to quantitatively reveal the driving force of spatial differentiation of each element wang xu 2017 if the spatial distribution of the independent variable is similar to that of the dependent variable then that independent variable has a significant influence on the dependent variable and the greater the similarity the greater the degree of influence wang hu 2012 geodetector help to identify key factors that affect the spatial heterogeneity of runoff in the catchment in this study the factor detector module fdm and the interaction detector module idm in the geographical detector are selected to study the spatial differentiation phenomenon of each driving factor on the water yield of the basin from different levels the fdm is used to detect the spatial differentiation characteristics of dependent variables and to clarify the contribution of different independent variable factors to the spatial differentiation of water yield the calculation formula is as follows 10 q 1 k 1 l m k σ k 2 m σ 2 1 d v t v 11 d v k 1 l m k σ k 2 t v m σ 2 where k represents water yield or the stratification status of influencing factors such as climate topography soil vegetation and land use strata and there are l layers in total the geographical detector requires that the input variables are all category data refer to wang et al 2012 according to the data discretization method and experience the slope data is divided into 6 grades according to 5 5 8 8 15 15 25 25 35 35 the breakpoint method is divided into 7 grades and other factors are divided into 9 grades according to the natural breakpoint method dv and tv represent the sum of variances in different layers and the total variance of the whole area respectively mk and m represent the number of units in the k layer and the whole area respectively σ k 2 and σ 2 are the variance of the water yield in the k layer and the whole area respectively the q value indicates that the independent variable explains 100 q of the spatial heterogeneity of water yield and the larger the value the stronger the water yield contribution to the area the idm is used to assess the contribution of two different independent variables xs when they act together to the spatial divergence of water yield the idm gives the strength and nature of the interaction of the two factors table 4 with indicating that the two factors intersect 3 results 3 1 the appropriate ecological flow threshold of the xiangjiang river the runoff sequence prior to 1991 in the xjr basin is considered as the natural flow sequence by analyzing the flow series data spanning from 1959 to 1990 it was determined that the mean value of the minimum flow during the flood season in the xjr was 707 33 m3 s with a corresponding ratio of 0 33 to the mean value during this period the average value of the minimum flow in the non flood season for many years is 321 m3 s and the average value ratio of the same period is 0 36 the calculation results are spread throughout the year and the monthly average flow ecological flow threshold the flow after change and the mef qe are shown in fig 3 according to our analysis the average flow in march is significantly higher than that in other non flood months indicating a high demand for flow in the xjr ecosystem during march the higher low flow can effectively supplement soil moisture on both sides of the river and reduce the frequency of anoxia promoting the recovery of the river basin ecosystem note rva75 and rva25 are the upper limit of ecological flow and the lower limit of ecological flow respectively 3 2 high and low flow pulse thresholds changes in flow are significant indicators of plant and animal development and reproduction in rivers and lakes fish for example begin spawning when spurred by high flow pulses and emergent plants on the river bank s shallows can obtain adequate water during flow pulses while low flow pulses prepare for high flow pulses the next year as a result determine the cyclical variation of flow throughout the year is advantageous to establish a suitable ecosystem by analyzing the flow data of xjr from 1959 to 2019 the duration and occurrence time of high flow pulses are obtained as shown in fig 4 high flow pulses mostly start in non flood seasons the average duration of high flow pulses remained unchanged for 84 d and the threshold changed from 66 d 92 d to 74 d 95 d there was still a significant linear positive correlation between high flow pulse duration and non flood season runoff p 4 75 10 4 r 0 61 that is the runoff in non flood seasons increased by 6 29 m3 s for each additional 1d after 1991 the average occurrence time of high flow pulses was delayed from the 71st day to the 74th day and the threshold changed from 50 d 84 d to 63 d 88 d p 4 1 10 2 r 0 38 that is the runoff in non flood season decreases by 3 59 m3 s for every 1d delay of occurrence time the occurrence of low flow pulses is shown in fig 5 low flow pulses mostly start in the flood season after 1991 the average duration of the low flow pulse changed from 74 d to 84 d and the threshold value changed from 44 d 107 d to 42 d 102 d there was still a significant linear negative correlation between the low flow pulse duration and the runoff during the flood season p 2 3 10 2 r 0 46 that is the runoff during the flood season decreases by 4 58 m3 s for each additional day the significant linear relationship between the occurrence time of low flow pulse and the runoff during flood season disappeared p 0 111 r 0 33 the occurrence time was advanced from the average 234 d to the 226 d and the threshold value changed from 213 d 269 d to 230 d 281 d in summary the occurrence time and duration of high and low flow pulses at the xiangtan station have been altered to varying degrees after the mutation the frequency of low flow pulses that did not occur during the natural period is higher due to the increase in water from the xjr gradually converting low flow into high flow resulting in the non occurrence of low flow pulses long term high flow pulses will reduce the availability of amphibian habitats and the lack of low flow pulses will not only be detrimental to aquatic organisms but will also affect bird feeding and the formation of floodplains 3 3 river health assessment the mef in the river is an important checkpoint to maintain the ecological health of the river and its importance is self evident the evaluation results of the mef of xjr are shown in table 5 the flow in march accounts for 45 42 of the average flow in the general water use period for many years the comprehensive state of the mef is fair which is in line with its establishment requirements the mef process in this study ensures that the xjr ecosystem does not collapse rapidly during the general water use period as well as maintaining a certain amount of water demand in the river during the peak spawning period to ensure that some organisms can maintain their survival and reproduction allowing for the next step of ecosystem restoration 3 4 spatial and temporal evolution pattern of water yield the model effect was determined by the actual water yield depth of each sub basin in 2010 and the correlation coefficient was 0 976 indicating that the simulation results can support the analysis of the spatial and temporal effects of water production in the xjr basin the annual water yield in the xjr basin has significant heterogeneity in time and space and the dynamic changes are obvious fig 6 prior to 1991 the water yield in the xjr basin had a good natural property of gradually increasing from upstream tributaries to downstream and from 2000 to 2010 the water yield appeared to be low in the west and high in the east with the upstream main stream as the source and the extreme difference value of the water yield depth maintained an increasing level in 2010 the lower limit of the water yield dropped even more in the upstream section of the main stream forming a poor value area in the leishui river in terms of spatial distribution the water yield pattern of the xjr in 2020 tends to evolve towards 1990 but compared with 1990 the high value of its water production depth increased by 285 7 mm and the low value decreased by 216 mm overall the western mountainous region and downstream plain of the xjr basin maintain a relatively highly water yield performance in both time and space this is because the downstream plain is mostly urban areas which have rapidly hardened the underlying surface with the continuous development of urbanization in china the highly water yield in the mountainous areas is mainly due to the large precipitation in the xjr basin resulting in a high value of overland flow due to super infiltration 3 5 attribution analysis according to the results of the fdm fig 7 the influence of rainfall on the xjr became significantly stronger following the abrupt change reaching a peak value of 66 9 in 2010 which coincided with the third occurrence of severe flooding in the xjr basin since 1998 simultaneously evapotranspiration reached its highest point in 2010 lulc and temperature are the key variables that impact water yield in the xjr basin whereas ndvi and slope have a minimal effect on water yield the magnitude of the influence suggests a certain synergistic effect with precipitation the watershed hydrological process has a complicated action mechanism under the changing environment the interaction of factors represented by is the direct driving force to change the spatial pattern of water production in the watershed fig 8 the dominance of lulc on water yield patterns in the basin is further proven following interaction with temperature rainfall and evapotranspiration between years the most influential interaction groups were lulc temperature 1990 lulc precipitation 2000 temperature precipitation 2010 and 2020 lulc et after the change the interaction group s contribution to the spatial variation of water yield remained between 73 48 and 77 76 which was 19 higher than the largest interaction group s contribution in 1990 during the natural period indicating that temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration have fundamentally promoted the change of the spatial pattern of water yield in the xjr basin in the last 30 years the two factor interaction type was further analyzed fig 9 although lulc temperature was the most explanatory interaction group in 1990 it belonged to bi nonlinear enhancement while the remaining factors belonged to nonlinear enhancement after change the number of interaction groups with nonlinear enhancement decreased and the number of interaction groups with bi nonlinear enhancement peaked in 2010 which may be related to the abundant precipitation and good vegetation growth in 2010 note enhance nonlinear q x1 x2 q x1 q x2 enhance bi nonlinear q x1 x2 max q x1 q x2 3 6 spatiotemporal heterogeneity of driving forces this study investigated the various driver forces contributing to water yield in the xjr basin over the last 30 years with the inclusion of temperature as a significant factor affecting the basin s water cycle temperature rainfall and evapotranspiration are the main driving forces that affect water yield in the basin in the past 30 years after interacting with lulc it is necessary to further analysis the relationship between the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of driving forces and water yield in the basin fig 10 there exist natural inflection points and breakpoints with statistical significance between any series without any artificial intervention and these inflection points can be used to divide the research object into groups with similar properties therefore natural breakpoints themselves are good boundaries for classification temperature classes 5 6 maintain synchronicity with high water yield values in 1990 followed by a gradual shrinkage of their spatial distribution range and a gradual recovery trend by 2020 which is consistent with the factor detection results and suggests that temperature control over water yield in the basin may increase in future scenarios the evolution pattern of rainfall and water yield in the basin retains a high degree of synchronization in terms of temporal and geographical heterogeneity rainfall grades 8 9 and grades 1 2 have the same frequency as high and low water yield values during the last 30 years showing that they are one of the important grades affecting water yield in the xjr basin the degree of effect of evapotranspiration on water yield in the basin has likewise significantly increased over the previous 30 years with the single factor contribution peaking in 2010 due to the basin s high precipitation but the interaction peaking in 2020 the area of evapotranspiration classes 2 6 significantly increased in 2020 thanks to the ecological restoration projects implemented in the xjr basin hu et al 2020 human activities have a significant impact on vegetation with reports indicating that human activity contributes to 60 19 of the trend in net primary productivity npp of vegetation while also controlling 32 84 of npp growth min et al 2022 the increase in vegetation cover promotes evapotranspiration within the watershed while weakening the production of runoff xu et al 2018 therefore human activities are indirectly enhancing their control over basin water yield through other means with the growth of human civilization and economy meteorological conditions in the xjr basin are continually changing and hydrological stability is being eroded as a result of climate change and human activities li et al 2021 xiao et al 2023 the restoration of watershed ecosystems and their future water allocation will benefit from a thorough knowledge of the processes that contribute to changes in ecosystem water yield patterns as well as an examination of trends in drivers at the geographical and temporal levels 4 discussion 4 1 rationality and applicability analysis of ecological flow in this study the iha rva method was used to calculate the ecological flow thresholds and the resulting appropriate ecological flow process is not a single flow value but the result of multiple hydrological conditions that are jointly constrained this includes the ecosystem demand for high and low flow pulses under suitable ecological flow conditions the flow pulse is closely related to the life rhythm information of river organisms which can quickly transmit effective information that is beneficial to the survival activities growth and reproduction of organisms to the organisms freitas et al 2015 however at this stage the original hydrological regimes of the xjr basin has been changed by the construction of the cascade reservoir and the soil and water conservation engineering therefore it is necessary to discuss the satisfaction of the suitable ecological flow after the hydrological sudden change a reasonable threshold of ecological flow should meet the requirements of occurrence time and duration in high flow periods and should not be higher than the upper limit of suitable ecological flow similarly in low flow periods the threshold of ecological flow should meet the requirements of occurrence time and duration and it should not be lower than the minimum ecological flow after the hydrological abrupt change 1991 2019 the flow of the xjr was within the threshold range most of the time fig 3 but in january 995 m3 s july 2046 m3 s and august 1335 m3 s the flow in september 1129 m3 s was higher than the upper limit of demand 113 m3 s 597 m3 s 139 m3 s 58 m3 s the flow rate in april 2623 m3 s was 45 m3 s lower than the lower limit of demand 2668 m3 s which could not meet the demand at the same time the years of high and low flow pulses with shorter and longer durations after mutation increased significantly that is the flow process showed monotonicity this is not conducive to the reproduction of drift spawning fish because for long or short duration pulses fish will affect spawning due to lack of sufficient reaction time and continuous fluctuation of incentives rolls 2021 for the xjr after the sudden change of hydrology the ecological flow and flow pulse simplification problems of rivers and lakes can be solved by the joint dispatch of upstream reservoirs 4 2 the advantage of the framework fishery as one of the five forms of agricultural industries relies significantly on hydrological conditions within the river channel that are conducive to the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms including fish these hydrological conditions are crucial for the development of the agricultural economy moreover water supply outside the river channel not only directly affects landscape vegetation but also has implications for the development of lakeside recreational industries and industrial water usage this study proposes a decision making service framework for the ecosystem services value based on river health this framework can not only give a scientific decision making basis for the restoration of river ecological health but it can also provide effective decision making directions for the positive growth of ecosystem service value in the river basin the excessive flow in july august for example is directly tied to the opening of flood gates upstream and the entrance of the rainy season in the yangtze river which results in the decrease or absence of the low flow pulse as a result recreating the low flow pulse in the xjr is a critical issue for present decision makers to overcome the geographical distribution of water yield in the xjr basin in 2020 is reasonably near to the natural period suggesting that the overall ecosystem water yield service value of the xjr basin has remained high at this time however there is a downward tendency in the growth of water yield services in some upstream locations based on changes in the driving forces within the framework and the actual growth of the area economy decision makers can build reasonable plans for the construction of follow up projects returning farmland to forest project this study add intra annual spreading for expansion since the traditional iha rva approach can only reflect the inter annual fluctuation of hydrology torabi haghighi kløve 2013 it successfully addresses the problems of difficult operation and management in the practice of water resources management as well as developing a comprehensive river health management assessment system using biological adaptability and ecological flow as the evaluation indicator the invest model as an internationally recognized ecosystem service value model has a lot of potential in south china yang et al 2019 by applying mathematical statistics the temporal and spatial patterns of watershed water yield services as well as the changes in their driving forces were examined and integrated into the framework aiming to provide a scientific basis for enhancing human social well being in the region in summary the suggested framework may readily assist in the building and healthy growth of river ecological flow in the basin as well as providing significant support for good economic development 4 3 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the sensitivity of a physical model s parameter identification and value changes can lead to different results therefore adjusting the model parameters is crucial to improve the accuracy of the model evaluation results in the invest model the seasonal constant z can be adjusted to produce more desirable results z can represent regional precipitation distribution and other hydrogeological characteristics and is related to the number of annual precipitation events the principle is that by adjusting the z value the value in equation 2 can be changed the selection of z value is uncertain and sensitivity analysis can be performed within the range of 1 to 30 the sensitivity of water yield decreases as the z value increases after adjusting the parameters it was found that the watershed water yield was close to the actual value when z was set to 7 the sensitivity indices of the other parameters in the water yield module decrease in the order of annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and vegetation transpiration coefficient hamel et al 2015 although the framework proposed in this study has been successfully applied to evaluate the health of river basins and further quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on ecosystem services in the basin longer time series of runoff data can help to reduce the uncertainty of ecological flow thresholds and their constraint results due to the complexity of the ecohydrological system meanwhile there are uncertainties in using the invest model to evaluate ecosystem services due to uncertainties in the ecological system model structure and input data the invest model distributes water use in agriculture industry and urban sectors to each pixel corresponding to its land cover type by averaging however different cities within a basin may have different economic development levels and different water use levels in agriculture industry and urban sectors hamel et al 2015 for example the downstream changsha metropolitan area in our study area is an important population and industrial center in the xjr basin this variability results in a slight overestimation of water yield moreover this study employed an annual scale model which has been widely used in assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes zhou et al 2015 daneshi et al 2021 aiding in guiding decisions for watershed land use adjustments and inter basin water transfer projects jiang et al 2021 however the interactions between human society and natural systems are highly nonlinear and demand differ across temporal and spatial scales therefore establishing models at the seasonal scale will be an important research direction for further enhancing human well being and ecosystem service values in the watershed 5 conclusion applying the iha rva threshold approach and the intra annual spreading method ecological flow thresholds for river health such as high and low flow thresholds and the occurrence times and duration ranges of flow pulses were established it promotes the development of an ecosystem that preserves the xjr s biodiversity and the health of plant communities on both banks of the river the tennant technique was used to assess the influence of the mef on river health and the total percentage for the year was 23 28 which fulfilled the mef s river habitat standards concurrently it was found that temperature rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are significant meteorological factors that impact the total water yield pattern of the xjr basin according to the idm the combined impacts of human activities and climate change contribute roughly 19 more to the geographical heterogeneity of water yield in the basin than the greatest value in the natural era excessive rainfall in the watershed will also reduce the influence of other factors on water output the interaction form is represented by nonlinear enhancement as bi nonlinear enhancement to clarify and refine the key magnitudes of the three major meteorological factors that affect water production in the basin is the focus of the next research credit authorship contribution statement hongxiang

1718,maintaining river health in a changing environment is an important way to improve the service value of the river basin ecosystem an ecological flow threshold process with multiple ecological constraints was proposed using the range of variability approach method and the improved intra annual spreading method when combined with the multi source dataset and the invest model a ecology function pattern driven and decision service framework was proposed the study found that the important ecological constraints of the ecological flow in the xiangjiang river basin changed after the hydrological change 1991 2019 high pulse occurrence times were delayed by 3 d while low pulse occurrence times and durations were advanced by 8 d and delayed by 10 d respectively temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration are all important factors influencing the dynamic characteristics of the basin s water yield services human activities and climate change have contributed nearly 19 more to the temporal and spatial differentiation characteristics of water yield in the basin than in the natural period additionally it was discovered that excessive rainfall can inhibit the impact of other variables on water yield within the basin furthermore the pivotal levels of significant meteorological factors that affect the water yield value of the basin were elucidated this research leads to a better knowledge of watershed hydrological health in changing environments and a scientific basis for local water resource management decisions and optimal utilization of ecosystem service values keywords ecosystem services ecological flow attribution analysis changing environment river health xiangjiang watershed data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction rivers complete the exchange of material nutrients and energy flows through the hydrological cycle and are one of the important connectors between the natural environment and human society gustafsson et al 2012 read et al 2014 in terms of natural functions and social and economic benefits conducting research on the hydrological situation of large river basins from the overall perspective of the river basin is an important way to accurately understand the safety of river basin ecosystems and the value of ecosystem services palmer ruhi 2019 deng et al 2021 however climate change and the intensification of human activities are driving the large rivers in major river basins to change their natural hydrological regimes and at the same time causing the gradual decline of ecosystem services ekka et al 2020 wu et al 2022 therefore maintaining the healthy development of rivers in the basin is an important guarantee for promoting the upward economic development of the basin in 1972 the united states environmental protection agency proposed the concept of river health the natural dynamic characteristics of a river determine its structural and functional integrity and natural flow is the master variable for maintaining the ecological health of the river poff et al 1997 poff et al 2010 under the condition of natural flow the organisms in the river can maintain their original life activities and the natural flow is also called ecological flow however with the deepening of research the viewpoint that the element of water yield service value of the basin should also be classified as river health has been proposed meyer 1997 lai zhang 2022 the water yield service value consists of two parts the first part is to provide human beings with sufficient production and domestic water and recreational and aesthetic values and the other part is the enhancement or inhibition of such things as the carbon cycle or vegetation growth through the hydrological cycle i e indirectly affecting the welfare that humans can or do obtain through trade offs and synergistic relationships with other ecosystem services norton et al 2022 bai et al 2023 li et al 2021 xiong et al 2022 changes in land use and land cover under the influence of human activities and temperature rise caused by industrial activities will affect the flow and water production of rivers which will have a negative impact on the ecological health of rivers kabo bah eslamian 2021 however currently there is a lack of a reasonable framework for the quantitative evaluation and decision making on the healthy development of basin rivers under changing environments consequently a significant theoretical framework is proposed that integrates basin river flow and its associated ecosystem service values this framework aims to facilitate the determination of ecological flows for river basins and make full use of ecosystem values it bears scientific significance for the management and optimization of water resources within river basin systems there are various methods for determining ecological flow including hydrological method hydraulic method habitat simulation method and comprehensive method tennant 1976 gippel stewardson 1998 bovee 1982 king louw 1998 the core idea behind these methods is to propose flow recommendations that maintain the ecological health of river channels starting from the perspective of safeguarding the minimum flow requirements of aquatic organisms however as research has deepened the natural flow regime which reflects the natural variability and fluctuation of hydrological processes has replaced the single form of the minimum ecological flow value and become a focal point for river managers to consider hillman douglas terkla 2012 among them by qualitatively and quantitatively describing the ecologically significant hydrological indicators the response results of the river ecosystem to the hydrological situation can be intuitively obtained zhu wang guo 2021 the indicators of hydrological alteration range of variability approach iha rva method is a method for quantitatively assessing the degree of change in hydrological regimes considering the range of runoff changes in rivers and lakes including the range of variability of flow water level and water temperature tian et al 2019 guo et al 2021 the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest model in terms of ecosystem service value is a rather developed ecosystem service model with spatial analysis functions some academics have employed the invest model to provide decision makers with favorable economic returns goldstein et al 2012 however current frameworks for assessing the health of watershed rivers and their ecosystem services are largely based on fuzzy mathematical methods meynell metzger stuart 2021 the main disadvantage of such frameworks is that they do not adequately consider the impact of hydrological characteristics of river channels on biota and their habitats yates et al 2019 established an ecosystem services assessment framework for river health indicators based on current pressure sources linked to benthic biological indicators however this framework also has clear limitations as it does not undertake evaluations from a watershed perspective lacks a quantitative analysis of the annual ecological hydrological situation of river channels and fails to quantitatively evaluate the driving forces of watershed ecosystem services and identifying the regional differentiation features of ecosystem services and its driving forces is also an important starting point for managers to make more informed decisions watershed models developed through invest model provide a basis for quantitative identification of ecosystem service drivers therefore this study proposed an ecology functional pattern driven and decision service framework which consists of three steps 1 propose ecological flow thresholds containing multiple ecological constraints based on the iha rva method and conduct corresponding river health assessment 2 obtain spatial and temporal dynamic evolution patterns of watershed water yield functions with the invest model and 3 explore quantitative attribution of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of drivers of watershed water production services the xiangjiang river xjr one of china s seven major yangtze river tributaries was chosen for the case study the xjr basin is the ecological and economic center of the dongting lake dtl wetlands as well as the primary support area for ecological security however since the construction of cascade reservoirs in the xjr section and the increase in human activities at the end of the 20th century the natural flow trend has been altered and a hydrological regime shift occurred in 1991 zhuo et al 2020 the shift has led to a simplification of the river s ecological system diversity and has had negative impacts on the local ecosystem in particular frequent droughts and floods have occurred in the xjr basin in recent years while the acceleration of urbanization has caused severe soil erosion and posed challenges to water security in the basin on the other hand in the dry season the xjr experiences water scarcity resulting in low water levels in the riverbed and increasingly serious ecological problems therefore selecting the xjr basin as a case for analysis is representative and significant the study results deepen our understanding of the water ecological security and the driving mechanism of ecosystem services in the river basin under the changing environment and also provide a scientific basis for the allocation and sustainable benefit of water resources in the river basin in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xjr basin 110 30 114 01 e 24 31 29 01 n has an average annual precipitation of 1 400 mm an average annual temperature of 17 6 c and a total basin area of 9 46 10 4 km 2 xjr is an important freshwater resource in hunan province fig 1 and it eventually flows into dtl the second largest freshwater lake in china the xjr basin has a developed water system and the overall pattern is asymmetrical dendritic the upper reaches of the xjr belong to the middle and low mountain landforms with steep peaks and steep mountains deep valleys and dense forests on both sides and the river course is straight the lower reaches of the river have hills and plain landforms on both sides the river course is meandering the terrain is flat and it is a typical river accumulation landform the replenishment of water in the river basins primarily relies on precipitation with peak flow occurrences typically observed from april to june the uneven terrain within the xjr basin accelerates the process of rainwater runoff resulting in rapid fluctuations in river water levels and flow rates thereby fully embodying the characteristics of mountainous and stream like rivers moreover the xjr basin serves as a significant agricultural region for commodity grain production and a concentrated area for modern agriculture in hunan province china as of 2018 the total population in the xjr basin reached 39 90 million people with an urbanization rate approaching 60 2 2 data preparation the 1959 2019 flow series in this study were obtained from the hunan water resources and hydropower survey design planning and research co ltd the remote sensing raster data in this study mainly include meteorological data temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration digital elevation model dem soil data land use land cover lulc data chen et al 2014 and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi these remote sensing raster data sources are shown in table 1 and their spatial resolution is 1 km 2 3 methods 2 3 1 integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs model the water yield module of the invest model is based on the budyko coupled water energy balance theory assumption zhang et al 2004 calculated by the pixels of the raster dataset and considering multiple related factors such as rainfall land use type soil depth evapotranspiration and vegetation at the pixel scale the corresponding water yield can be obtained fig 2 water yield includes surface runoff soil moisture litter interception and canopy interception without distinguishing between surface runoff subsurface flow and groundwater flow therefore the more water yield that is generated in a given area the greater the water supply services provided the basic formula of the water yield module is as follows 1 ae t ij p i 1 pe t ij p i 1 pe t ij p i ω 1 ω 2 y i j 1 ae t ij p i p i ω is the non physical parameter of natural climate soil properties y i j ae t ij and pe t i j are the annual average water yield annual actual evapotranspiration and annual potential evapotranspiration of grid i on land use type j respectively p i is grid the annual precipitation of i 2 3 2 appropriate ecological flow threshold method the iha rva method contains 33 indicators in five aspects monthly flow frequency occurrence time duration time and rate of change guo et al 2021 most studies have selected the 25 and 75 occurrence frequencies of the indicators in the iha as the rva threshold values for each indicator zheng et al 2020 li et al 2022b in this study we drew upon the iha indicator system and rva threshold method and took into account the actual ecological significance of each indicator as well as its potential positive impact on watershed ecosystem services tatiana et al 2021 okruszko et al 2011 sixteen indicators including the mean of 12 month median flow in natural period called monthly average flow the occurrence time and duration of high and low flow pulse are used as the index system for calculating suitable ecological flow table 2 the corresponding threshold value of each indicator is its demand range furthermore this study enhances the applicability of the intra annual spreading method in the xjr basin by calculating the minimum ecological flow mef that takes into account both flood and non flood periods the intra annual spreading method is based on natural runoff and ecohydrological processes to calculate the intra annual dynamic demand of runoff which can compensate for the deficiencies of the traditional hydrological method that uses mean values and runoff specific assurance rates as hydrological indicators to calculate ecological flows pan ruan xu 2013 the improved intra annual spreading method is as follows 3 q x 1 6 r 1 6 q x 4 q f 1 6 r 1 6 q f 5 q xmin 1 6 r 1 6 min q x 6 q fmin 1 6 r 1 6 m i n q f where q x and q f are the monthly average flow in the flood season and non flood season respectively in the natural flow period q x and q f are the average flow in the flood season and non flood season respectively q xmin and q fmin are the minimum flow in the multi year flood and non flood seasons respectively mean the specific process is to input the daily flow data of the xiangtan hydrological station during the natural period into the iha rva software calculate the monthly average flow and substitute it into equations 3 and 4 to obtain the ecological flow in flood season q x and non flood season q f the ratio of q xmin and q fmin to the flood and non flood annual average flow q x and q f respectively is taken as the mean ratio h k for the same period and the monthly average flow q i process is scaled in the same proportion to obtain the mef q e for each month of the river and lake which is the intra annual spreading algorithm of the mef 7 h 1 q x min q x h 2 q f min q f q e h k q i i 1 2 12 2 3 3 high and low flow pulse occurrence time and duration the occurrence of time and duration and the core role in maintaining the diversity of native biological biology it is one of the most influential regulators of the history of fish life and the most influential community structure fox magoulick 2019 the high and low flow pulses can be used to meet the needs of habitat structure nutrient exchange and life evolution of some species the formula for calculating the high and low flow pulses of rivers and lakes is 8 q h p 25 q i 9 q l p 75 q i where q h and q l are high and low flow p 25 q i and p 75 q i are daily traffic under the river and lakes under the guarantee rate of 25 and 75 respectively this study regarded the continuous 6 day daily average flow rate greater than the high flow rate as a high flow pulse event after the high flow pulse event ended the continuous 6 day less than low flow rate was regarded as a low flow pulse event in addition two identical pulse events that differ by less than or equal to 5 days can be considered to be affected by flow fluctuations for the same pulse event the thresholds for high and low flow pulse fluctuations are the 66 and 33 quantiles of the flow pulse sequence wang et al 2020 2 3 4 tennant method the tennant method evaluates the state of a river channel based on the percentage of runoff to the multi year average runoff during the natural period tennant 1976 the four major fish are the main fishery resources in the main stream of the xjr april to june is the peak fish spawning period and october to march is the general water use period to mitigate the influence of monthly and ten day variations in runoff on river health assessment outcomes comprehensive consideration was given to the diverse demands of aquatic organisms for flow in different periods of the xjr basin consequently the assessment threshold of the tennant method in the xjr basin was modified the specific assessment scope is shown in table 3 2 3 5 geographical detector geodetector i e geographical detector is a set of statistical methods to quantitatively reveal the driving force of spatial differentiation of each element wang xu 2017 if the spatial distribution of the independent variable is similar to that of the dependent variable then that independent variable has a significant influence on the dependent variable and the greater the similarity the greater the degree of influence wang hu 2012 geodetector help to identify key factors that affect the spatial heterogeneity of runoff in the catchment in this study the factor detector module fdm and the interaction detector module idm in the geographical detector are selected to study the spatial differentiation phenomenon of each driving factor on the water yield of the basin from different levels the fdm is used to detect the spatial differentiation characteristics of dependent variables and to clarify the contribution of different independent variable factors to the spatial differentiation of water yield the calculation formula is as follows 10 q 1 k 1 l m k σ k 2 m σ 2 1 d v t v 11 d v k 1 l m k σ k 2 t v m σ 2 where k represents water yield or the stratification status of influencing factors such as climate topography soil vegetation and land use strata and there are l layers in total the geographical detector requires that the input variables are all category data refer to wang et al 2012 according to the data discretization method and experience the slope data is divided into 6 grades according to 5 5 8 8 15 15 25 25 35 35 the breakpoint method is divided into 7 grades and other factors are divided into 9 grades according to the natural breakpoint method dv and tv represent the sum of variances in different layers and the total variance of the whole area respectively mk and m represent the number of units in the k layer and the whole area respectively σ k 2 and σ 2 are the variance of the water yield in the k layer and the whole area respectively the q value indicates that the independent variable explains 100 q of the spatial heterogeneity of water yield and the larger the value the stronger the water yield contribution to the area the idm is used to assess the contribution of two different independent variables xs when they act together to the spatial divergence of water yield the idm gives the strength and nature of the interaction of the two factors table 4 with indicating that the two factors intersect 3 results 3 1 the appropriate ecological flow threshold of the xiangjiang river the runoff sequence prior to 1991 in the xjr basin is considered as the natural flow sequence by analyzing the flow series data spanning from 1959 to 1990 it was determined that the mean value of the minimum flow during the flood season in the xjr was 707 33 m3 s with a corresponding ratio of 0 33 to the mean value during this period the average value of the minimum flow in the non flood season for many years is 321 m3 s and the average value ratio of the same period is 0 36 the calculation results are spread throughout the year and the monthly average flow ecological flow threshold the flow after change and the mef qe are shown in fig 3 according to our analysis the average flow in march is significantly higher than that in other non flood months indicating a high demand for flow in the xjr ecosystem during march the higher low flow can effectively supplement soil moisture on both sides of the river and reduce the frequency of anoxia promoting the recovery of the river basin ecosystem note rva75 and rva25 are the upper limit of ecological flow and the lower limit of ecological flow respectively 3 2 high and low flow pulse thresholds changes in flow are significant indicators of plant and animal development and reproduction in rivers and lakes fish for example begin spawning when spurred by high flow pulses and emergent plants on the river bank s shallows can obtain adequate water during flow pulses while low flow pulses prepare for high flow pulses the next year as a result determine the cyclical variation of flow throughout the year is advantageous to establish a suitable ecosystem by analyzing the flow data of xjr from 1959 to 2019 the duration and occurrence time of high flow pulses are obtained as shown in fig 4 high flow pulses mostly start in non flood seasons the average duration of high flow pulses remained unchanged for 84 d and the threshold changed from 66 d 92 d to 74 d 95 d there was still a significant linear positive correlation between high flow pulse duration and non flood season runoff p 4 75 10 4 r 0 61 that is the runoff in non flood seasons increased by 6 29 m3 s for each additional 1d after 1991 the average occurrence time of high flow pulses was delayed from the 71st day to the 74th day and the threshold changed from 50 d 84 d to 63 d 88 d p 4 1 10 2 r 0 38 that is the runoff in non flood season decreases by 3 59 m3 s for every 1d delay of occurrence time the occurrence of low flow pulses is shown in fig 5 low flow pulses mostly start in the flood season after 1991 the average duration of the low flow pulse changed from 74 d to 84 d and the threshold value changed from 44 d 107 d to 42 d 102 d there was still a significant linear negative correlation between the low flow pulse duration and the runoff during the flood season p 2 3 10 2 r 0 46 that is the runoff during the flood season decreases by 4 58 m3 s for each additional day the significant linear relationship between the occurrence time of low flow pulse and the runoff during flood season disappeared p 0 111 r 0 33 the occurrence time was advanced from the average 234 d to the 226 d and the threshold value changed from 213 d 269 d to 230 d 281 d in summary the occurrence time and duration of high and low flow pulses at the xiangtan station have been altered to varying degrees after the mutation the frequency of low flow pulses that did not occur during the natural period is higher due to the increase in water from the xjr gradually converting low flow into high flow resulting in the non occurrence of low flow pulses long term high flow pulses will reduce the availability of amphibian habitats and the lack of low flow pulses will not only be detrimental to aquatic organisms but will also affect bird feeding and the formation of floodplains 3 3 river health assessment the mef in the river is an important checkpoint to maintain the ecological health of the river and its importance is self evident the evaluation results of the mef of xjr are shown in table 5 the flow in march accounts for 45 42 of the average flow in the general water use period for many years the comprehensive state of the mef is fair which is in line with its establishment requirements the mef process in this study ensures that the xjr ecosystem does not collapse rapidly during the general water use period as well as maintaining a certain amount of water demand in the river during the peak spawning period to ensure that some organisms can maintain their survival and reproduction allowing for the next step of ecosystem restoration 3 4 spatial and temporal evolution pattern of water yield the model effect was determined by the actual water yield depth of each sub basin in 2010 and the correlation coefficient was 0 976 indicating that the simulation results can support the analysis of the spatial and temporal effects of water production in the xjr basin the annual water yield in the xjr basin has significant heterogeneity in time and space and the dynamic changes are obvious fig 6 prior to 1991 the water yield in the xjr basin had a good natural property of gradually increasing from upstream tributaries to downstream and from 2000 to 2010 the water yield appeared to be low in the west and high in the east with the upstream main stream as the source and the extreme difference value of the water yield depth maintained an increasing level in 2010 the lower limit of the water yield dropped even more in the upstream section of the main stream forming a poor value area in the leishui river in terms of spatial distribution the water yield pattern of the xjr in 2020 tends to evolve towards 1990 but compared with 1990 the high value of its water production depth increased by 285 7 mm and the low value decreased by 216 mm overall the western mountainous region and downstream plain of the xjr basin maintain a relatively highly water yield performance in both time and space this is because the downstream plain is mostly urban areas which have rapidly hardened the underlying surface with the continuous development of urbanization in china the highly water yield in the mountainous areas is mainly due to the large precipitation in the xjr basin resulting in a high value of overland flow due to super infiltration 3 5 attribution analysis according to the results of the fdm fig 7 the influence of rainfall on the xjr became significantly stronger following the abrupt change reaching a peak value of 66 9 in 2010 which coincided with the third occurrence of severe flooding in the xjr basin since 1998 simultaneously evapotranspiration reached its highest point in 2010 lulc and temperature are the key variables that impact water yield in the xjr basin whereas ndvi and slope have a minimal effect on water yield the magnitude of the influence suggests a certain synergistic effect with precipitation the watershed hydrological process has a complicated action mechanism under the changing environment the interaction of factors represented by is the direct driving force to change the spatial pattern of water production in the watershed fig 8 the dominance of lulc on water yield patterns in the basin is further proven following interaction with temperature rainfall and evapotranspiration between years the most influential interaction groups were lulc temperature 1990 lulc precipitation 2000 temperature precipitation 2010 and 2020 lulc et after the change the interaction group s contribution to the spatial variation of water yield remained between 73 48 and 77 76 which was 19 higher than the largest interaction group s contribution in 1990 during the natural period indicating that temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration have fundamentally promoted the change of the spatial pattern of water yield in the xjr basin in the last 30 years the two factor interaction type was further analyzed fig 9 although lulc temperature was the most explanatory interaction group in 1990 it belonged to bi nonlinear enhancement while the remaining factors belonged to nonlinear enhancement after change the number of interaction groups with nonlinear enhancement decreased and the number of interaction groups with bi nonlinear enhancement peaked in 2010 which may be related to the abundant precipitation and good vegetation growth in 2010 note enhance nonlinear q x1 x2 q x1 q x2 enhance bi nonlinear q x1 x2 max q x1 q x2 3 6 spatiotemporal heterogeneity of driving forces this study investigated the various driver forces contributing to water yield in the xjr basin over the last 30 years with the inclusion of temperature as a significant factor affecting the basin s water cycle temperature rainfall and evapotranspiration are the main driving forces that affect water yield in the basin in the past 30 years after interacting with lulc it is necessary to further analysis the relationship between the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of driving forces and water yield in the basin fig 10 there exist natural inflection points and breakpoints with statistical significance between any series without any artificial intervention and these inflection points can be used to divide the research object into groups with similar properties therefore natural breakpoints themselves are good boundaries for classification temperature classes 5 6 maintain synchronicity with high water yield values in 1990 followed by a gradual shrinkage of their spatial distribution range and a gradual recovery trend by 2020 which is consistent with the factor detection results and suggests that temperature control over water yield in the basin may increase in future scenarios the evolution pattern of rainfall and water yield in the basin retains a high degree of synchronization in terms of temporal and geographical heterogeneity rainfall grades 8 9 and grades 1 2 have the same frequency as high and low water yield values during the last 30 years showing that they are one of the important grades affecting water yield in the xjr basin the degree of effect of evapotranspiration on water yield in the basin has likewise significantly increased over the previous 30 years with the single factor contribution peaking in 2010 due to the basin s high precipitation but the interaction peaking in 2020 the area of evapotranspiration classes 2 6 significantly increased in 2020 thanks to the ecological restoration projects implemented in the xjr basin hu et al 2020 human activities have a significant impact on vegetation with reports indicating that human activity contributes to 60 19 of the trend in net primary productivity npp of vegetation while also controlling 32 84 of npp growth min et al 2022 the increase in vegetation cover promotes evapotranspiration within the watershed while weakening the production of runoff xu et al 2018 therefore human activities are indirectly enhancing their control over basin water yield through other means with the growth of human civilization and economy meteorological conditions in the xjr basin are continually changing and hydrological stability is being eroded as a result of climate change and human activities li et al 2021 xiao et al 2023 the restoration of watershed ecosystems and their future water allocation will benefit from a thorough knowledge of the processes that contribute to changes in ecosystem water yield patterns as well as an examination of trends in drivers at the geographical and temporal levels 4 discussion 4 1 rationality and applicability analysis of ecological flow in this study the iha rva method was used to calculate the ecological flow thresholds and the resulting appropriate ecological flow process is not a single flow value but the result of multiple hydrological conditions that are jointly constrained this includes the ecosystem demand for high and low flow pulses under suitable ecological flow conditions the flow pulse is closely related to the life rhythm information of river organisms which can quickly transmit effective information that is beneficial to the survival activities growth and reproduction of organisms to the organisms freitas et al 2015 however at this stage the original hydrological regimes of the xjr basin has been changed by the construction of the cascade reservoir and the soil and water conservation engineering therefore it is necessary to discuss the satisfaction of the suitable ecological flow after the hydrological sudden change a reasonable threshold of ecological flow should meet the requirements of occurrence time and duration in high flow periods and should not be higher than the upper limit of suitable ecological flow similarly in low flow periods the threshold of ecological flow should meet the requirements of occurrence time and duration and it should not be lower than the minimum ecological flow after the hydrological abrupt change 1991 2019 the flow of the xjr was within the threshold range most of the time fig 3 but in january 995 m3 s july 2046 m3 s and august 1335 m3 s the flow in september 1129 m3 s was higher than the upper limit of demand 113 m3 s 597 m3 s 139 m3 s 58 m3 s the flow rate in april 2623 m3 s was 45 m3 s lower than the lower limit of demand 2668 m3 s which could not meet the demand at the same time the years of high and low flow pulses with shorter and longer durations after mutation increased significantly that is the flow process showed monotonicity this is not conducive to the reproduction of drift spawning fish because for long or short duration pulses fish will affect spawning due to lack of sufficient reaction time and continuous fluctuation of incentives rolls 2021 for the xjr after the sudden change of hydrology the ecological flow and flow pulse simplification problems of rivers and lakes can be solved by the joint dispatch of upstream reservoirs 4 2 the advantage of the framework fishery as one of the five forms of agricultural industries relies significantly on hydrological conditions within the river channel that are conducive to the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms including fish these hydrological conditions are crucial for the development of the agricultural economy moreover water supply outside the river channel not only directly affects landscape vegetation but also has implications for the development of lakeside recreational industries and industrial water usage this study proposes a decision making service framework for the ecosystem services value based on river health this framework can not only give a scientific decision making basis for the restoration of river ecological health but it can also provide effective decision making directions for the positive growth of ecosystem service value in the river basin the excessive flow in july august for example is directly tied to the opening of flood gates upstream and the entrance of the rainy season in the yangtze river which results in the decrease or absence of the low flow pulse as a result recreating the low flow pulse in the xjr is a critical issue for present decision makers to overcome the geographical distribution of water yield in the xjr basin in 2020 is reasonably near to the natural period suggesting that the overall ecosystem water yield service value of the xjr basin has remained high at this time however there is a downward tendency in the growth of water yield services in some upstream locations based on changes in the driving forces within the framework and the actual growth of the area economy decision makers can build reasonable plans for the construction of follow up projects returning farmland to forest project this study add intra annual spreading for expansion since the traditional iha rva approach can only reflect the inter annual fluctuation of hydrology torabi haghighi kløve 2013 it successfully addresses the problems of difficult operation and management in the practice of water resources management as well as developing a comprehensive river health management assessment system using biological adaptability and ecological flow as the evaluation indicator the invest model as an internationally recognized ecosystem service value model has a lot of potential in south china yang et al 2019 by applying mathematical statistics the temporal and spatial patterns of watershed water yield services as well as the changes in their driving forces were examined and integrated into the framework aiming to provide a scientific basis for enhancing human social well being in the region in summary the suggested framework may readily assist in the building and healthy growth of river ecological flow in the basin as well as providing significant support for good economic development 4 3 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the sensitivity of a physical model s parameter identification and value changes can lead to different results therefore adjusting the model parameters is crucial to improve the accuracy of the model evaluation results in the invest model the seasonal constant z can be adjusted to produce more desirable results z can represent regional precipitation distribution and other hydrogeological characteristics and is related to the number of annual precipitation events the principle is that by adjusting the z value the value in equation 2 can be changed the selection of z value is uncertain and sensitivity analysis can be performed within the range of 1 to 30 the sensitivity of water yield decreases as the z value increases after adjusting the parameters it was found that the watershed water yield was close to the actual value when z was set to 7 the sensitivity indices of the other parameters in the water yield module decrease in the order of annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and vegetation transpiration coefficient hamel et al 2015 although the framework proposed in this study has been successfully applied to evaluate the health of river basins and further quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on ecosystem services in the basin longer time series of runoff data can help to reduce the uncertainty of ecological flow thresholds and their constraint results due to the complexity of the ecohydrological system meanwhile there are uncertainties in using the invest model to evaluate ecosystem services due to uncertainties in the ecological system model structure and input data the invest model distributes water use in agriculture industry and urban sectors to each pixel corresponding to its land cover type by averaging however different cities within a basin may have different economic development levels and different water use levels in agriculture industry and urban sectors hamel et al 2015 for example the downstream changsha metropolitan area in our study area is an important population and industrial center in the xjr basin this variability results in a slight overestimation of water yield moreover this study employed an annual scale model which has been widely used in assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes zhou et al 2015 daneshi et al 2021 aiding in guiding decisions for watershed land use adjustments and inter basin water transfer projects jiang et al 2021 however the interactions between human society and natural systems are highly nonlinear and demand differ across temporal and spatial scales therefore establishing models at the seasonal scale will be an important research direction for further enhancing human well being and ecosystem service values in the watershed 5 conclusion applying the iha rva threshold approach and the intra annual spreading method ecological flow thresholds for river health such as high and low flow thresholds and the occurrence times and duration ranges of flow pulses were established it promotes the development of an ecosystem that preserves the xjr s biodiversity and the health of plant communities on both banks of the river the tennant technique was used to assess the influence of the mef on river health and the total percentage for the year was 23 28 which fulfilled the mef s river habitat standards concurrently it was found that temperature rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are significant meteorological factors that impact the total water yield pattern of the xjr basin according to the idm the combined impacts of human activities and climate change contribute roughly 19 more to the geographical heterogeneity of water yield in the basin than the greatest value in the natural era excessive rainfall in the watershed will also reduce the influence of other factors on water output the interaction form is represented by nonlinear enhancement as bi nonlinear enhancement to clarify and refine the key magnitudes of the three major meteorological factors that affect water production in the basin is the focus of the next research credit authorship contribution statement hongxiang

1719,understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of pumping activities is crucial for effective water resource management however obtaining accurate pumping records is often challenging particularly in areas without efficient groundwater withdrawal permit systems in this study we propose a novel approach for identifying pumping activities and estimating their associated pumping rates across space and time our data driven approach integrates empirical orthogonal function eof and hilbert huang transform hht analyses on first differenced head data to extract high frequency head variations that are closely related to pumping activities the identified pumping associated head variations are used to estimate the on and off times of local pumping stations and their associated pumping rate time series we test our approach using a hypothetical aquifer with designed pumping and real precipitation time series our results show that the eof analysis is able to distinguish pumping locations where distinct temporal head variabilities are present hht analysis is then able to effectively remove noise from the eof identified pumping associated head variations compared to the designed pumping data our results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to produce accurate pumping estimates in terms of both spatial and temporal distribution and total amounts while our approach does have limitations such as delayed and boundary effects our results suggest that it can be an effective tool for pumping estimation in areas with relatively abundant head observations across space and time which is a common scenario in taiwan graphical abstract the figure of the graphical abstract illustrates the head decomposition procedure to extract pumping patterns and their

svd singular value decomposition 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most valuable water resources particularly in arid and semiarid areas for various uses of water with all taiwan receiving abundant rainfall annually groundwater still plays an important role in this country it is due to the regional rainfall climate on the island showing a large spatiotemporal variability between the dry and wet seasons that causes instability in the surface water supply chen and chen 2003 the essential characteristics of groundwater resources compared to other sources are their high stability and accessibility these often cause decentralized pumping activities and there are no appropriate rules and permits to regulate and control groundwater extraction in many areas molle and closas 2020 llamas and martínez santos 2005 thence the overexploitation of groundwater has become an issue worldwide and has caused worrying consequences such as land subsidence and sea intrusion furthermore due to the high cost and low management efficiency pumping rate measurement is often limited or scarce compared to pumping activities in general ross and martinez santos 2010 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 the lack of knowledge about groundwater withdrawal would increase uncertainty in estimating groundwater balances and the challenges for groundwater management a great deal of methods have been developed to estimate groundwater withdrawals that lack direct pumping measurements among them model based inverse modeling is one of the most widely used approaches lin et al 2013 shakoor et al 2018 although this approach can obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater extraction it requires estimation with multiple inputs including hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions and therefore the estimated results would contain significant uncertainties thus lumped hydrological models have been applied to estimate large scale groundwater extraction to reduce parameter uncertainties however these would neglect the variability on the local scale tsanis and apostolaki 2009 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 wada et al 2014 this estimation lies on water budget analyses and its uncertainty in pumping estimation can be affected by the propagation of uncertainties in determining other hydrological components for the water budget calculation moon et al 2004 in addition surrogate approaches have been used to identify the relationships between extraction rates and physical variables associated with pumping activities for example land use and weather data with their identified relationship can be applied to predict groundwater pumping keir et al 2019 among the potential surrogate variables the transformation of power demand into pumping amount can estimate the temporal variation of groundwater extraction at a specific pumping station hurr and litke 1990 chu et al 2020 however the power demand is measured with lower temporal resolution in many areas it would be challenging to characterize the time series of pumping rates another popular approach is to estimate the groundwater extraction rate from the temporal fluctuations of groundwater heads this approach uses groundwater characteristics that change in water volume in a groundwater system is proportional to its associated differences in head and can be estimated using a scaling factor i e storage coefficient typically designated as s due to its ease of use and relatively low cost properties this groundwater head fluctuation based method has been widely applied in pumping and recharge estimations leduc et al 1997 healy and cook 2002 moon et al 2004 maréchal et al 2006 system forcings driven by natural or anthropogenic processes may exert very different impacts on groundwater head variation e g pumping precipitation tidal wave or evapotranspiration these forcings should be especially concerned when using groundwater fluctuation to estimate recharge and extraction different forcings that influence groundwater can exhibit different frequencies and amplitudes and can be used to interpret complex variations of groundwater change thus spectral analysis has emerged to evaluate the frequency and amplitude of head time series shih and lin 2002 long and konrad 2020 generally groundwater head is a nonstationary variable its nonstationarity in the frequency domain has been used to explore the temporal patterns of the spectrum in groundwater variations and their relationships to other forcings through time frequency analysis methods such as the wavelet transform and hilbert huang transform hht johnson et al 2012 yu and lin 2015 nourani et al 2019 apart from the methods above unsupervised feature extractions are a powerful technique to reveal significant temporal or spatiotemporal features of head variations independent component analysis one of the unsupervised feature extraction methods has been widely used to identify the main stimuli patterns for groundwater variations liu et al 2015 hsiao et al 2017 tsai and hsiao 2020 furthermore empirical orthogonal function eof analysis sometimes called principal component analysis is frequently applied to identify the spatiotemporal features of groundwater fluctuation it is an effective method for extracting information from large data sets in spatiotemporal domains by decomposing the covariance kernel into sets of eigenfunctions moreover the eof analysis can reduce the dimension of a massive data set to a smaller dimension and accurately reconstruct the spatiotemporal variances of the original random fields hannachi et al 2007 therefore eof analysis has been increasingly applied to extract significant spatiotemporal signals from groundwater observations over space and time longuevergne et al 2007 yu and chu 2010 page et al 2012 yu and lin 2015 this study proposes a data driven approach framework for estimating groundwater extraction based on the observed spatiotemporal groundwater fluctuation the proposed approach integrates the eof and hht methods revealing key spatiotemporal variations and time frequency features of groundwater observations respectively also we validated our method by examining it in a synthetic test using modflow 2 methodology spatiotemporal changes in the groundwater head can result from different natural and anthropogenic processes that interact with the groundwater system such as recharge and withdrawal among these processes pumping activities can often introduce more rapid variations in heads on a relatively regular basis over time and in space this study estimated groundwater extraction by identifying pumping processes from groundwater fluctuations by transforming pumping associated groundwater fluctuations into pumping operation time series throughout the space our method mainly includes three steps 1 trend removal 2 eof analysis and 3 hht analysis 2 1 trend removal to remove the trend we applied the differencing approach to the time series of groundwater head observations to retrieve stationary patterns of fluctuations differencing approach is the widely used method for transforming original time series into their stationary counterparts ahn and salas 1997 the differenced series x s t is the change between consecutive data from the original series at spatial position s and time t groundwater head observations for the case of first order differencing are formulated as follows 1 x s t y s t y s t δ t where y s t denotes the original series of groundwater head and δ t is the observation interval x s t represents a first differenced series and can be considered to be a detrended series with respect to y s t and therefore it comprises the high frequency stationary part of the original process 2 2 empirical orthogonal function analysis the major spatiotemporal patterns of the differenced series x s t were revealed by the eof method which is used to extract significant high frequency spatiotemporal signals from groundwater observations eof method decomposes a continuous spatiotemporal random field x s t into the additive spatiotemporal multiplication form as follows pearson 1901 hotelling 1933 hannachi et al 2007 2 x s t k 1 m c k t u k s where m is the number of modes in orthogonal spatiotemporal random fields the modes are formulated as an optimal set of orthogonal spatial functions u k s called eofs and their associated expansion functions of time c k t called eof expansion coefficients ecs defined as the projection of x s t on u k s the leading eofs can usually explain a fair amount of observed variances of the original spatiotemporal data set the eof analysis is commonly performed using the singular value decomposition svd method hannachi et al 2007 a p n matrix of the first differenced spatiotemporal head series x s t situated at p locations and n instances can be decomposed as 3 x u λ a t where u r p m and a r n m are the semi unitary matrix i e a t a u t u i r with r min n p where i r r r r is the identity matrix this also known as compact svd in which λ r r r is square diagonal matrix with only non zero singular values in eq 3 the columns of u i e u k are essentially eofs as the spatial orthonormal basis of the spatiotemporal data matrix the diagonal matrix λ r r r contains the singular values λ 1 λ r of x satisfying λ 1 λ 2 λ r 0 on the basis of the formation of the singular value decomposition the projections of the k th eof can be estimated by λ k a k t and the spatiotemporal decomposition of eq 2 by the eof analysis can be rewritten as 4 x s t k 1 m λ k a k t u k s as mentioned above m must be less than or equal to r when analyzing uneven spatiotemporal sampled data the geometric relationship between the spatiotemporal data set should be taken into account to avoid excess variances at clustering data locations that can distort the eof results karl et al 1982 we performed a spatiotemporal estimation of groundwater heads using a geostatistical method i e the bayesian maximum entropy method before removing the trend removal and performing the eof analysis the bayesian maximum entropy method is an epistemic based geostatistical method which distinguishes general and specific knowledge of spatiotemporal processes and generates more informative spatiotemporal maps of variables of interest christakos 1990 2000 furthermore the eof results are rescaled and rotated using the varimax method to obtain more stable and explainable say physical meaningful spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater head variations the varimax method is the most well known and widely used rotation technique for multivariate analysis by which an orthogonal matrix is applied to eof rotation to simplify the eof structure pushing the loading coefficients of eofs to zeros or plus and minus kaiser 1958 for more details on the eof analysis the reader can refer to the research of hannachi et al 2007 yu and chu 2010 and yu and lin 2015 2 3 hilbert huang transform analysis different spatial scales can be observed in the significant spatial features of the transformed head variations based on the assumption that the dominant forcing for high frequency groundwater head variations is direct infiltration or pumping activities the spatial extent scale in each eof can be considered as the criterion to classify the two forcings direct infiltration and pumping can have relatively large and local spatial scales respectively although eof analysis can differentiate processes with distinct space time variation patterns in most cases the signals from multiple contributing factors can still be contained in the associated time series of ecs this study proposes a time series decomposition approach by using the hht method to differentiate between the pumping activities and the variations from other sources from the pumping like ecs i e ecs associated with relatively localized eofs the hht is a method for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary signals comprising empirical mode emd and hilbert spectral analysis hsa considering a time series z t emd decomposes z t into a sum of intrinsic mode functions imfs s j t and a residual r t as shown below 5 z t j 1 k s j t r t where the residual r t represents the trend of the time series s j t is a well defined hilbert spectrum and its complex form or analytic signal has the form of s j c t s j t i ℋ s j t a j t e i ω j t d t with the hilbert transform ℋ in which ω j t and a j t are the time frequency curve and the amplitude of the analytic signal s j c t respectively the imfs s j t have two properties one is that the numbers of extreme and zero crossings differ at most by unity another is that the average of the upper and lower envelopes defined by the local extrema must be zero at all times i e the function is symmetric concerning zero imfs are retrieved by a recursive sifting process using the empirical mode decomposition emd method huang et al 1998 emd estimates an imf by repeatedly removing the mean of the envelopes of local extrema from the original time series until the stopping criterion is met namely the difference of the estimated imfs in the consecutive sifting steps is negligible huang and wu 2008 imfs contain the separated oscillation modes of a head variation time series across different scales and each imf theoretically contains its specific oscillation mode of a time series in other words imfs consist of the main pumping temporal modes of identified pumping like ecs however imfs estimated by the emd approach can be noisy and can significantly distort the estimation of pumping activities the contaminated signals are considered for parts with distinct ω j t or and a j t across certain imfs of the ec using the following criteria 6 ω j t ω j t α σ ω j a j t ω j t a j t ω j t β σ a j ω j where the overbar represents the medians and σ denotes the standard deviation the constants α and β are introduced to determine the outliers of ω j t and a j t ω j t respectively this study adopts the values of 4 for α and β moreover we cut 400 h at early and late times but during the iteration of the detection of contaminated signals to avoid the inevitable effect of the boundary condition we even used the mirror extension method wang et al 2019 after each iteration round to keep the time series the same length in the proposed signal cleaning process using hht and noise identification two criterion in eq 6 are performed recursively until ω j t and a j t ω j t both satisfy the proposed criteria in each iteration the ec is removed at times when the contaminated signals existing in any of the imfs are contaminated and then reconstructed using a conventional time series interpolation method the pump induced head variations can have the characteristic that the local maximum and minimum of groundwater head variation are closely associated with the times of turning on and off the pumping stations respectively on the basis of denoised pumping like ecs c k t their associated spatiotemporal pumping rates can be estimated as follows 7 q k s t s s u k s c k t u c k t l t l t u t u t t l where q k s t is the estimate of the pumping rates in the space time domain associated with the k th eof feature c k t u and c k t l represent the local maxima and minima in k th pumping like ecs respectively as eq 7 indicates u k s c k t u c k t l represents the groundwater head drawdown from t u to t l resulting from the constant pumping rate q k s t between t u and t l according to eq 2 the spatiotemporal pumping rates across the study area can be reconstructed by considering all identified pump induced features across space and time that is q s t k 1 m q k s t with the m identified pumping activities wherein all pumping like ecs can have a different series of t u and t l 3 performance analysis on synthetic data 3 1 synthetic aquifer and head observations for the validation of the method we developed a two dimensional finite difference model for a homogeneous unconfined aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity of 0 3678 m h and a s of 0 01 which are modified from the aquifer properties of the choushui river alluvial fan taiwan using modflow software in addition the numerical model has been verified by comparing it with the theis solution with jacob s correction kruseman et al 1970 fig 1 shows the model setup for numerical simulation the hydraulic head was assumed to descend linearly from the right elevation of 24 5 m to the left elevation of 0 5 m the datum of aquifer bottom is situated at 100 m see fig 1 a the difference in head at the left and right boundaries caused a natural leftward flow driven by the hydraulic gradient each finite difference grid had a size of 500 500 m 2 furthermore the aquifer was described by 40 40 square elements this means that the aquifer is 20 km long and 20 km wide fig 1 b as fig 1 b illustrates the flow boundaries at y 0 and 20 km were subject to the no flow condition a special case of the neumann type condition that has zero value while the boundaries at x 0 and 20 km were specified as constant head condition a dirichlet type condition marked as black right and left pointing triangles we consider the pumping rates to be in the range of 0 to 75 m 3 hr with different pumping pattern and operating frequency the analysis period is chosen in the summer season which is usually rainy in taiwan during june to september we considered infiltration due to uniformly distributed precipitation on the surface of the aquifer the infiltration time series is modified from the usgs soil conservation service scs curve number procedure to a real rainfall time series observed at the zhu tang station from june 20 2016 to september 20 2016 in addition we included four intermittent pumping activities labeled w 1 w 2 w 3 and w 4 respectively located in the plane x y at the points 5 75 km 14 25 km 6 25 km 5 75 km 9 75 km 10 25 km and 14 25 km 8 75 km that influence the aquifer flow system fig 1 c shows that the infiltration process fig 1 d displays four sets of time series of pumping rate used in pumping wells the total simulation time is 8640 h 360 days for the numerical simulation 3 2 results fig 2 shows the results of a groundwater head simulation and b the related first differenced head at the four selected observation sites located at 6 25 km 6 25 km 5 25 km 14 75 km 9 75 km 10 25 km and 172 5 km 7 25 km labeled o 1 o 2 o 3 and o 4 respectively as shown the time series consists of the variations of multiple frequencies and amplitudes resulting from a variety of external forcings across space and time in which the major high frequency part of the head variation can be highly associated with the results of pumping and precipitation processes the high frequency variation can be more clearly identified from the first differenced process as shown in fig 2 b fig 3 shows the eof results from the analysis of first differenced head processes the significant part of each eof result has a different area with a distinct spatial extent this feature can be used as an indicator to distinguish between the head variations perturbed by pumping and precipitation processes in general the spatial extent of a precipitation event can generally be much larger than that of the groundwater withdrawal activities at a pumping station i e the eofs showing a darker area on the whole map like eof1 and eof10 as a result we consider the eof results with relatively spatially localized patterns to be more associated with pumping activities from eof2 to eof9 displaying the darker dots within the brighter areas fig 3 exhibits that the identified localized eofs are closely identical to the pumping locations based on the identified pumping related eofs their associated ecs in fig 4 are used to identify pumping activities the irregularly significant change in the amplitude variation implies that the identified pumping associated ecs can be contaminated by other hydrological processes i e precipitation as shown in fig 4 the pumping signals in pumping associated ecs are contaminated or even masked by precipitation associated variations fig 5 shows the time series of the ec6 the imf1 of ec6 from hht analysis and the imf1 associated time varying instantaneous amplitude and frequency series i e a 1 t and ω 1 t according to fig 5 c and d it shows a clear precipitation associated variation in the pumping related ec6 series in which the periods with contamination can have distinct amplitude and frequency variations furthermore the rises of frequency series correspond to the abrupt changes of ec series and the product of the frequency and amplitude series has a strong correlation with the precipitation series as shown in fig 5 e and f respectively therefore the outliers of frequency and frequency amplitude product provides an effective indicator about the temporal locations of contamination when the temporal variation significantly deviates from the regular process identified in the specific imf using the proposed denoise outlier detection criteria eq 6 the times with serious noises in ec6 can be identified for the further removal as indicated in fig 5 e and f after the proposed denoise procedure all pumping associated ecs can be retrieved as indicated in fig 6 because the eof analysis is applied on the first differenced processes a back transform is required to obtain the actual head variation resulting from the pumping activities at the identified pumping location in fig 7 it shows the identified first differenced ec5 and its associated head variation the pumping activities at the identified head variation can be retrieved in terms of time series of the average head change as shown in fig 7 c based on the estimation of the average head change the estimated rate in space time can be obtained by using eq 7 in fig 8 it shows the spatiotemporal pumping rate estimation across the entire study domain results show that our proposed approach can not only approximate the predetermined pumping location but also the temporal variation of pumping rates associated with each pumping location as shown the estimated pumping location is an area centered at the actual pre defined pumping location because the pumping activities can induce head variation at both the pumping location and its surrounding area table 1 shows the comparison between the pumping amount in each pre determined well and the total pumping amount estimation in its associated area results show that estimated pumping amounts are close to the pre determined pumping amounts with a total relative error of 6 6 4 discussions this study proposed a novel approach to estimate the space time pumping activities from head observations to our knowledge this study is the first data driven groundwater head analysis that not only identifies but also quantifies the important space time patterns of interest i e pumping rates furthermore the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of pumping locations making it useful for estimating pumping in areas where pumping data is absent although a variety of pattern recognition techniques have been applied in analyzing spatiotemporal groundwater head variations however most of the previous data driven approaches focused only on identifying the patterns of influential contributors without quantifying the identified patterns yu and chu 2010 2012 yu and lin 2015 lin et al 2015 hsiao et al 2016 tsai et al 2017 tsai and hsiao 2020 because there is no physical model used in the estimation our data driven pumping estimation can be considered as indirect measurements to be incorporated in the process of groundwater modeling especially in the areas with relatively abundant space time head observations and limited pumping measurements for example aquifers in taiwan time series of groundwater head observations can commonly exhibit trends with a variety of time scales such as multiyear and seasonal trends which can generally be associated with the large scale natural processes of the groundwater system e g recharge or discharge processes in other words the trends in time series can generally present greater spatiotemporal variation that can possibly mask the variability introduced from local activities such as pumping to identify pumping activities hidden in water fluctuations trend removal is essential before applying spatiotemporal pattern recognition methods in time series analysis differencing has been widely used to stabilize the mean of a time series by removing the changes of the head of a time series i e eliminating or reducing trend and seasonality the differencing is an effective approach to make time series stationary although higher order differencing can better stabilize a nonstationary time series this study found that first order differencing works sufficiently in our cases in real case applications it is useful to perform the proposed first differencing analysis for the data set during a prespecific period since pumping activities can commonly depend on spatiotemporal patterns of water demand that are associated with factors such as irrigation schedules and farming operation habits in other words first order differencing can generally be effective since groundwater fluctuation can be relatively stationary during a specific period with temporal lengths of about weeks to months depending on the characteristics of the water demand e g crop water demand patterns multiple significant pumping patterns can exhibit nearby a specific pumping location with eof analysis since pumping activity is completely derived from head variations observation wells closer to pumping locations can have a faster hydraulic response than those farther away from pumping stations it implies that the temporal variation of pumping rates at locations away from the pumping stations can have a time delay from the actual pumping activity although some of the pumping rates can have certain time shifts to their real counterpart because some part of flow requires more time to propagate from the observed locations to the pumping wells this study demonstrated that our approach can still possibly characterize the pumping rates at the identified pumping locations as shown in fig 2 two eofs can be identified at similar locations due to the delayed temporal patterns resulting from the head drawdown propagating from the pumping location in fig 8 the identified pumping areas are centered at the pre determined pumping locations similarly in the temporal estimation some delayed pumping rate estimations can also be observed despite the observed difference between the actual and identified space time pumping distribution fig 8 and table 1 show that our results can mostly retrieve the simulated pumping distribution across space and time pumping estimation directly from groundwater head drawdown can also be influenced by other factors as observed in this study the relative errors between the actual and estimated pumping amounts were caused not only by the delayed effect but also by the boundary conditions of the aquifer i e constant head and no flow conditions the constant head condition would continue to charge the water to the pumping well due to the tremendous water resources while the no flow condition would play the role of a barrier to block groundwater flowing toward the pumping wells thus in other words if the pumping well is adjacent to a stream or is installed in a leaky aquifer the majority of the pumped water would be recharged from other sources e g river water which may give rise to an underestimation of the pumping amounts due to the stream depletion if the pumping well is installed close to the no flow boundary the additional head drawdown can cause the overestimation of pumping amount by the proposed approach it implies that the knowledge of pumping locations and their surrounding environment is important for assessing the uncertainty of the estimation from the proposed method understanding the spatiotemporal variations in groundwater levels is essential for using the proposed method in pumping rate estimation in order to identify the changes in groundwater levels caused by pumping extraction the observation temporal frequency of groundwater levels needs to be higher than the frequency of pumping activities on the other hand the pumping locations can only be detected while the monitoring wells are located within their pumping impact radius which is associated with hydrogeological parameters and pumping duration if the pumping and monitoring wells are far apart estimates may be less accurate due to reduced sensitivity of groundwater levels to pumping perturbations the spatial and temporal resolutions of groundwater observations can affect the estimation quality of spatiotemporal groundwater level variation which is crucial to the performance of the proposed method for pumping rate estimation in cases where temporal high frequency data is only available recently in a short period the proposed method can be applied during periods with no rainfall or irrigation activity in this case eq 7 can be directly applied to estimate the time varying pumping rates based on the groundwater level changes solely caused by pumping the knowledge of hydrogeological parameters also plays an important role in space time pumping estimation the primary idea of this study is to retrieve the pumping activities with respect to the beginning of the groundwater head drawdown and recovery the proposed approach requires the storage coefficient s to transform the identified groundwater level change into the change in water amount in the aquifer due to the spatial heterogeneity the observations of hydrogeological parameters are commonly limited to estimate the spatial distribution of hydrogeological parameters in the case of storage coefficients they are commonly more scarce than hydraulic conductivities because their observations require multiple wells in regular pumping test techniques recent studies have shown that an advanced geostatistical method has been proposed to improve the estimation confidence in hydrogeological parameters with limited observations more studies will be required to assess the application of the advanced space time geostatistical or machine learning estimation method for parameter estimation in the groundwater system and its impact on pumping estimation 5 conclusions this study proposes a data driven approach to estimate spatiotemporal pumping rate distribution from groundwater head observations across space and time we applied our proposed approach to a synthetic groundwater level simulation with space time varying pumping activities and infiltration with actual precipitation the results show that eof analysis can effectively classify the space time patterns of high frequency head variations and hht analysis helps to retrieve the target pumping signals by differentiating the processes with distinct time frequency characteristics the integration of eof and hht analyses can reveal the pumping related signals from the first differenced head observations and their corresponding pumping rates this study shows that the proposed approach can provide informative groundwater withdrawal estimation with the knowledge of groundwater level variation although pumping estimation uncertainties can be introduced from factors including storage coefficient and groundwater level estimation the proposed approach suggests an efficient way in areas without effective groundwater withdrawal management however with systematic groundwater level monitoring and therefore the results can be valuable references to improve understanding of the groundwater system and groundwater management credit authorship

1719,understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of pumping activities is crucial for effective water resource management however obtaining accurate pumping records is often challenging particularly in areas without efficient groundwater withdrawal permit systems in this study we propose a novel approach for identifying pumping activities and estimating their associated pumping rates across space and time our data driven approach integrates empirical orthogonal function eof and hilbert huang transform hht analyses on first differenced head data to extract high frequency head variations that are closely related to pumping activities the identified pumping associated head variations are used to estimate the on and off times of local pumping stations and their associated pumping rate time series we test our approach using a hypothetical aquifer with designed pumping and real precipitation time series our results show that the eof analysis is able to distinguish pumping locations where distinct temporal head variabilities are present hht analysis is then able to effectively remove noise from the eof identified pumping associated head variations compared to the designed pumping data our results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to produce accurate pumping estimates in terms of both spatial and temporal distribution and total amounts while our approach does have limitations such as delayed and boundary effects our results suggest that it can be an effective tool for pumping estimation in areas with relatively abundant head observations across space and time which is a common scenario in taiwan graphical abstract the figure of the graphical abstract illustrates the head decomposition procedure to extract pumping patterns and their

svd singular value decomposition 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most valuable water resources particularly in arid and semiarid areas for various uses of water with all taiwan receiving abundant rainfall annually groundwater still plays an important role in this country it is due to the regional rainfall climate on the island showing a large spatiotemporal variability between the dry and wet seasons that causes instability in the surface water supply chen and chen 2003 the essential characteristics of groundwater resources compared to other sources are their high stability and accessibility these often cause decentralized pumping activities and there are no appropriate rules and permits to regulate and control groundwater extraction in many areas molle and closas 2020 llamas and martínez santos 2005 thence the overexploitation of groundwater has become an issue worldwide and has caused worrying consequences such as land subsidence and sea intrusion furthermore due to the high cost and low management efficiency pumping rate measurement is often limited or scarce compared to pumping activities in general ross and martinez santos 2010 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 the lack of knowledge about groundwater withdrawal would increase uncertainty in estimating groundwater balances and the challenges for groundwater management a great deal of methods have been developed to estimate groundwater withdrawals that lack direct pumping measurements among them model based inverse modeling is one of the most widely used approaches lin et al 2013 shakoor et al 2018 although this approach can obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater extraction it requires estimation with multiple inputs including hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions and therefore the estimated results would contain significant uncertainties thus lumped hydrological models have been applied to estimate large scale groundwater extraction to reduce parameter uncertainties however these would neglect the variability on the local scale tsanis and apostolaki 2009 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 wada et al 2014 this estimation lies on water budget analyses and its uncertainty in pumping estimation can be affected by the propagation of uncertainties in determining other hydrological components for the water budget calculation moon et al 2004 in addition surrogate approaches have been used to identify the relationships between extraction rates and physical variables associated with pumping activities for example land use and weather data with their identified relationship can be applied to predict groundwater pumping keir et al 2019 among the potential surrogate variables the transformation of power demand into pumping amount can estimate the temporal variation of groundwater extraction at a specific pumping station hurr and litke 1990 chu et al 2020 however the power demand is measured with lower temporal resolution in many areas it would be challenging to characterize the time series of pumping rates another popular approach is to estimate the groundwater extraction rate from the temporal fluctuations of groundwater heads this approach uses groundwater characteristics that change in water volume in a groundwater system is proportional to its associated differences in head and can be estimated using a scaling factor i e storage coefficient typically designated as s due to its ease of use and relatively low cost properties this groundwater head fluctuation based method has been widely applied in pumping and recharge estimations leduc et al 1997 healy and cook 2002 moon et al 2004 maréchal et al 2006 system forcings driven by natural or anthropogenic processes may exert very different impacts on groundwater head variation e g pumping precipitation tidal wave or evapotranspiration these forcings should be especially concerned when using groundwater fluctuation to estimate recharge and extraction different forcings that influence groundwater can exhibit different frequencies and amplitudes and can be used to interpret complex variations of groundwater change thus spectral analysis has emerged to evaluate the frequency and amplitude of head time series shih and lin 2002 long and konrad 2020 generally groundwater head is a nonstationary variable its nonstationarity in the frequency domain has been used to explore the temporal patterns of the spectrum in groundwater variations and their relationships to other forcings through time frequency analysis methods such as the wavelet transform and hilbert huang transform hht johnson et al 2012 yu and lin 2015 nourani et al 2019 apart from the methods above unsupervised feature extractions are a powerful technique to reveal significant temporal or spatiotemporal features of head variations independent component analysis one of the unsupervised feature extraction methods has been widely used to identify the main stimuli patterns for groundwater variations liu et al 2015 hsiao et al 2017 tsai and hsiao 2020 furthermore empirical orthogonal function eof analysis sometimes called principal component analysis is frequently applied to identify the spatiotemporal features of groundwater fluctuation it is an effective method for extracting information from large data sets in spatiotemporal domains by decomposing the covariance kernel into sets of eigenfunctions moreover the eof analysis can reduce the dimension of a massive data set to a smaller dimension and accurately reconstruct the spatiotemporal variances of the original random fields hannachi et al 2007 therefore eof analysis has been increasingly applied to extract significant spatiotemporal signals from groundwater observations over space and time longuevergne et al 2007 yu and chu 2010 page et al 2012 yu and lin 2015 this study proposes a data driven approach framework for estimating groundwater extraction based on the observed spatiotemporal groundwater fluctuation the proposed approach integrates the eof and hht methods revealing key spatiotemporal variations and time frequency features of groundwater observations respectively also we validated our method by examining it in a synthetic test using modflow 2 methodology spatiotemporal changes in the groundwater head can result from different natural and anthropogenic processes that interact with the groundwater system such as recharge and withdrawal among these processes pumping activities can often introduce more rapid variations in heads on a relatively regular basis over time and in space this study estimated groundwater extraction by identifying pumping processes from groundwater fluctuations by transforming pumping associated groundwater fluctuations into pumping operation time series throughout the space our method mainly includes three steps 1 trend removal 2 eof analysis and 3 hht analysis 2 1 trend removal to remove the trend we applied the differencing approach to the time series of groundwater head observations to retrieve stationary patterns of fluctuations differencing approach is the widely used method for transforming original time series into their stationary counterparts ahn and salas 1997 the differenced series x s t is the change between consecutive data from the original series at spatial position s and time t groundwater head observations for the case of first order differencing are formulated as follows 1 x s t y s t y s t δ t where y s t denotes the original series of groundwater head and δ t is the observation interval x s t represents a first differenced series and can be considered to be a detrended series with respect to y s t and therefore it comprises the high frequency stationary part of the original process 2 2 empirical orthogonal function analysis the major spatiotemporal patterns of the differenced series x s t were revealed by the eof method which is used to extract significant high frequency spatiotemporal signals from groundwater observations eof method decomposes a continuous spatiotemporal random field x s t into the additive spatiotemporal multiplication form as follows pearson 1901 hotelling 1933 hannachi et al 2007 2 x s t k 1 m c k t u k s where m is the number of modes in orthogonal spatiotemporal random fields the modes are formulated as an optimal set of orthogonal spatial functions u k s called eofs and their associated expansion functions of time c k t called eof expansion coefficients ecs defined as the projection of x s t on u k s the leading eofs can usually explain a fair amount of observed variances of the original spatiotemporal data set the eof analysis is commonly performed using the singular value decomposition svd method hannachi et al 2007 a p n matrix of the first differenced spatiotemporal head series x s t situated at p locations and n instances can be decomposed as 3 x u λ a t where u r p m and a r n m are the semi unitary matrix i e a t a u t u i r with r min n p where i r r r r is the identity matrix this also known as compact svd in which λ r r r is square diagonal matrix with only non zero singular values in eq 3 the columns of u i e u k are essentially eofs as the spatial orthonormal basis of the spatiotemporal data matrix the diagonal matrix λ r r r contains the singular values λ 1 λ r of x satisfying λ 1 λ 2 λ r 0 on the basis of the formation of the singular value decomposition the projections of the k th eof can be estimated by λ k a k t and the spatiotemporal decomposition of eq 2 by the eof analysis can be rewritten as 4 x s t k 1 m λ k a k t u k s as mentioned above m must be less than or equal to r when analyzing uneven spatiotemporal sampled data the geometric relationship between the spatiotemporal data set should be taken into account to avoid excess variances at clustering data locations that can distort the eof results karl et al 1982 we performed a spatiotemporal estimation of groundwater heads using a geostatistical method i e the bayesian maximum entropy method before removing the trend removal and performing the eof analysis the bayesian maximum entropy method is an epistemic based geostatistical method which distinguishes general and specific knowledge of spatiotemporal processes and generates more informative spatiotemporal maps of variables of interest christakos 1990 2000 furthermore the eof results are rescaled and rotated using the varimax method to obtain more stable and explainable say physical meaningful spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater head variations the varimax method is the most well known and widely used rotation technique for multivariate analysis by which an orthogonal matrix is applied to eof rotation to simplify the eof structure pushing the loading coefficients of eofs to zeros or plus and minus kaiser 1958 for more details on the eof analysis the reader can refer to the research of hannachi et al 2007 yu and chu 2010 and yu and lin 2015 2 3 hilbert huang transform analysis different spatial scales can be observed in the significant spatial features of the transformed head variations based on the assumption that the dominant forcing for high frequency groundwater head variations is direct infiltration or pumping activities the spatial extent scale in each eof can be considered as the criterion to classify the two forcings direct infiltration and pumping can have relatively large and local spatial scales respectively although eof analysis can differentiate processes with distinct space time variation patterns in most cases the signals from multiple contributing factors can still be contained in the associated time series of ecs this study proposes a time series decomposition approach by using the hht method to differentiate between the pumping activities and the variations from other sources from the pumping like ecs i e ecs associated with relatively localized eofs the hht is a method for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary signals comprising empirical mode emd and hilbert spectral analysis hsa considering a time series z t emd decomposes z t into a sum of intrinsic mode functions imfs s j t and a residual r t as shown below 5 z t j 1 k s j t r t where the residual r t represents the trend of the time series s j t is a well defined hilbert spectrum and its complex form or analytic signal has the form of s j c t s j t i ℋ s j t a j t e i ω j t d t with the hilbert transform ℋ in which ω j t and a j t are the time frequency curve and the amplitude of the analytic signal s j c t respectively the imfs s j t have two properties one is that the numbers of extreme and zero crossings differ at most by unity another is that the average of the upper and lower envelopes defined by the local extrema must be zero at all times i e the function is symmetric concerning zero imfs are retrieved by a recursive sifting process using the empirical mode decomposition emd method huang et al 1998 emd estimates an imf by repeatedly removing the mean of the envelopes of local extrema from the original time series until the stopping criterion is met namely the difference of the estimated imfs in the consecutive sifting steps is negligible huang and wu 2008 imfs contain the separated oscillation modes of a head variation time series across different scales and each imf theoretically contains its specific oscillation mode of a time series in other words imfs consist of the main pumping temporal modes of identified pumping like ecs however imfs estimated by the emd approach can be noisy and can significantly distort the estimation of pumping activities the contaminated signals are considered for parts with distinct ω j t or and a j t across certain imfs of the ec using the following criteria 6 ω j t ω j t α σ ω j a j t ω j t a j t ω j t β σ a j ω j where the overbar represents the medians and σ denotes the standard deviation the constants α and β are introduced to determine the outliers of ω j t and a j t ω j t respectively this study adopts the values of 4 for α and β moreover we cut 400 h at early and late times but during the iteration of the detection of contaminated signals to avoid the inevitable effect of the boundary condition we even used the mirror extension method wang et al 2019 after each iteration round to keep the time series the same length in the proposed signal cleaning process using hht and noise identification two criterion in eq 6 are performed recursively until ω j t and a j t ω j t both satisfy the proposed criteria in each iteration the ec is removed at times when the contaminated signals existing in any of the imfs are contaminated and then reconstructed using a conventional time series interpolation method the pump induced head variations can have the characteristic that the local maximum and minimum of groundwater head variation are closely associated with the times of turning on and off the pumping stations respectively on the basis of denoised pumping like ecs c k t their associated spatiotemporal pumping rates can be estimated as follows 7 q k s t s s u k s c k t u c k t l t l t u t u t t l where q k s t is the estimate of the pumping rates in the space time domain associated with the k th eof feature c k t u and c k t l represent the local maxima and minima in k th pumping like ecs respectively as eq 7 indicates u k s c k t u c k t l represents the groundwater head drawdown from t u to t l resulting from the constant pumping rate q k s t between t u and t l according to eq 2 the spatiotemporal pumping rates across the study area can be reconstructed by considering all identified pump induced features across space and time that is q s t k 1 m q k s t with the m identified pumping activities wherein all pumping like ecs can have a different series of t u and t l 3 performance analysis on synthetic data 3 1 synthetic aquifer and head observations for the validation of the method we developed a two dimensional finite difference model for a homogeneous unconfined aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity of 0 3678 m h and a s of 0 01 which are modified from the aquifer properties of the choushui river alluvial fan taiwan using modflow software in addition the numerical model has been verified by comparing it with the theis solution with jacob s correction kruseman et al 1970 fig 1 shows the model setup for numerical simulation the hydraulic head was assumed to descend linearly from the right elevation of 24 5 m to the left elevation of 0 5 m the datum of aquifer bottom is situated at 100 m see fig 1 a the difference in head at the left and right boundaries caused a natural leftward flow driven by the hydraulic gradient each finite difference grid had a size of 500 500 m 2 furthermore the aquifer was described by 40 40 square elements this means that the aquifer is 20 km long and 20 km wide fig 1 b as fig 1 b illustrates the flow boundaries at y 0 and 20 km were subject to the no flow condition a special case of the neumann type condition that has zero value while the boundaries at x 0 and 20 km were specified as constant head condition a dirichlet type condition marked as black right and left pointing triangles we consider the pumping rates to be in the range of 0 to 75 m 3 hr with different pumping pattern and operating frequency the analysis period is chosen in the summer season which is usually rainy in taiwan during june to september we considered infiltration due to uniformly distributed precipitation on the surface of the aquifer the infiltration time series is modified from the usgs soil conservation service scs curve number procedure to a real rainfall time series observed at the zhu tang station from june 20 2016 to september 20 2016 in addition we included four intermittent pumping activities labeled w 1 w 2 w 3 and w 4 respectively located in the plane x y at the points 5 75 km 14 25 km 6 25 km 5 75 km 9 75 km 10 25 km and 14 25 km 8 75 km that influence the aquifer flow system fig 1 c shows that the infiltration process fig 1 d displays four sets of time series of pumping rate used in pumping wells the total simulation time is 8640 h 360 days for the numerical simulation 3 2 results fig 2 shows the results of a groundwater head simulation and b the related first differenced head at the four selected observation sites located at 6 25 km 6 25 km 5 25 km 14 75 km 9 75 km 10 25 km and 172 5 km 7 25 km labeled o 1 o 2 o 3 and o 4 respectively as shown the time series consists of the variations of multiple frequencies and amplitudes resulting from a variety of external forcings across space and time in which the major high frequency part of the head variation can be highly associated with the results of pumping and precipitation processes the high frequency variation can be more clearly identified from the first differenced process as shown in fig 2 b fig 3 shows the eof results from the analysis of first differenced head processes the significant part of each eof result has a different area with a distinct spatial extent this feature can be used as an indicator to distinguish between the head variations perturbed by pumping and precipitation processes in general the spatial extent of a precipitation event can generally be much larger than that of the groundwater withdrawal activities at a pumping station i e the eofs showing a darker area on the whole map like eof1 and eof10 as a result we consider the eof results with relatively spatially localized patterns to be more associated with pumping activities from eof2 to eof9 displaying the darker dots within the brighter areas fig 3 exhibits that the identified localized eofs are closely identical to the pumping locations based on the identified pumping related eofs their associated ecs in fig 4 are used to identify pumping activities the irregularly significant change in the amplitude variation implies that the identified pumping associated ecs can be contaminated by other hydrological processes i e precipitation as shown in fig 4 the pumping signals in pumping associated ecs are contaminated or even masked by precipitation associated variations fig 5 shows the time series of the ec6 the imf1 of ec6 from hht analysis and the imf1 associated time varying instantaneous amplitude and frequency series i e a 1 t and ω 1 t according to fig 5 c and d it shows a clear precipitation associated variation in the pumping related ec6 series in which the periods with contamination can have distinct amplitude and frequency variations furthermore the rises of frequency series correspond to the abrupt changes of ec series and the product of the frequency and amplitude series has a strong correlation with the precipitation series as shown in fig 5 e and f respectively therefore the outliers of frequency and frequency amplitude product provides an effective indicator about the temporal locations of contamination when the temporal variation significantly deviates from the regular process identified in the specific imf using the proposed denoise outlier detection criteria eq 6 the times with serious noises in ec6 can be identified for the further removal as indicated in fig 5 e and f after the proposed denoise procedure all pumping associated ecs can be retrieved as indicated in fig 6 because the eof analysis is applied on the first differenced processes a back transform is required to obtain the actual head variation resulting from the pumping activities at the identified pumping location in fig 7 it shows the identified first differenced ec5 and its associated head variation the pumping activities at the identified head variation can be retrieved in terms of time series of the average head change as shown in fig 7 c based on the estimation of the average head change the estimated rate in space time can be obtained by using eq 7 in fig 8 it shows the spatiotemporal pumping rate estimation across the entire study domain results show that our proposed approach can not only approximate the predetermined pumping location but also the temporal variation of pumping rates associated with each pumping location as shown the estimated pumping location is an area centered at the actual pre defined pumping location because the pumping activities can induce head variation at both the pumping location and its surrounding area table 1 shows the comparison between the pumping amount in each pre determined well and the total pumping amount estimation in its associated area results show that estimated pumping amounts are close to the pre determined pumping amounts with a total relative error of 6 6 4 discussions this study proposed a novel approach to estimate the space time pumping activities from head observations to our knowledge this study is the first data driven groundwater head analysis that not only identifies but also quantifies the important space time patterns of interest i e pumping rates furthermore the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of pumping locations making it useful for estimating pumping in areas where pumping data is absent although a variety of pattern recognition techniques have been applied in analyzing spatiotemporal groundwater head variations however most of the previous data driven approaches focused only on identifying the patterns of influential contributors without quantifying the identified patterns yu and chu 2010 2012 yu and lin 2015 lin et al 2015 hsiao et al 2016 tsai et al 2017 tsai and hsiao 2020 because there is no physical model used in the estimation our data driven pumping estimation can be considered as indirect measurements to be incorporated in the process of groundwater modeling especially in the areas with relatively abundant space time head observations and limited pumping measurements for example aquifers in taiwan time series of groundwater head observations can commonly exhibit trends with a variety of time scales such as multiyear and seasonal trends which can generally be associated with the large scale natural processes of the groundwater system e g recharge or discharge processes in other words the trends in time series can generally present greater spatiotemporal variation that can possibly mask the variability introduced from local activities such as pumping to identify pumping activities hidden in water fluctuations trend removal is essential before applying spatiotemporal pattern recognition methods in time series analysis differencing has been widely used to stabilize the mean of a time series by removing the changes of the head of a time series i e eliminating or reducing trend and seasonality the differencing is an effective approach to make time series stationary although higher order differencing can better stabilize a nonstationary time series this study found that first order differencing works sufficiently in our cases in real case applications it is useful to perform the proposed first differencing analysis for the data set during a prespecific period since pumping activities can commonly depend on spatiotemporal patterns of water demand that are associated with factors such as irrigation schedules and farming operation habits in other words first order differencing can generally be effective since groundwater fluctuation can be relatively stationary during a specific period with temporal lengths of about weeks to months depending on the characteristics of the water demand e g crop water demand patterns multiple significant pumping patterns can exhibit nearby a specific pumping location with eof analysis since pumping activity is completely derived from head variations observation wells closer to pumping locations can have a faster hydraulic response than those farther away from pumping stations it implies that the temporal variation of pumping rates at locations away from the pumping stations can have a time delay from the actual pumping activity although some of the pumping rates can have certain time shifts to their real counterpart because some part of flow requires more time to propagate from the observed locations to the pumping wells this study demonstrated that our approach can still possibly characterize the pumping rates at the identified pumping locations as shown in fig 2 two eofs can be identified at similar locations due to the delayed temporal patterns resulting from the head drawdown propagating from the pumping location in fig 8 the identified pumping areas are centered at the pre determined pumping locations similarly in the temporal estimation some delayed pumping rate estimations can also be observed despite the observed difference between the actual and identified space time pumping distribution fig 8 and table 1 show that our results can mostly retrieve the simulated pumping distribution across space and time pumping estimation directly from groundwater head drawdown can also be influenced by other factors as observed in this study the relative errors between the actual and estimated pumping amounts were caused not only by the delayed effect but also by the boundary conditions of the aquifer i e constant head and no flow conditions the constant head condition would continue to charge the water to the pumping well due to the tremendous water resources while the no flow condition would play the role of a barrier to block groundwater flowing toward the pumping wells thus in other words if the pumping well is adjacent to a stream or is installed in a leaky aquifer the majority of the pumped water would be recharged from other sources e g river water which may give rise to an underestimation of the pumping amounts due to the stream depletion if the pumping well is installed close to the no flow boundary the additional head drawdown can cause the overestimation of pumping amount by the proposed approach it implies that the knowledge of pumping locations and their surrounding environment is important for assessing the uncertainty of the estimation from the proposed method understanding the spatiotemporal variations in groundwater levels is essential for using the proposed method in pumping rate estimation in order to identify the changes in groundwater levels caused by pumping extraction the observation temporal frequency of groundwater levels needs to be higher than the frequency of pumping activities on the other hand the pumping locations can only be detected while the monitoring wells are located within their pumping impact radius which is associated with hydrogeological parameters and pumping duration if the pumping and monitoring wells are far apart estimates may be less accurate due to reduced sensitivity of groundwater levels to pumping perturbations the spatial and temporal resolutions of groundwater observations can affect the estimation quality of spatiotemporal groundwater level variation which is crucial to the performance of the proposed method for pumping rate estimation in cases where temporal high frequency data is only available recently in a short period the proposed method can be applied during periods with no rainfall or irrigation activity in this case eq 7 can be directly applied to estimate the time varying pumping rates based on the groundwater level changes solely caused by pumping the knowledge of hydrogeological parameters also plays an important role in space time pumping estimation the primary idea of this study is to retrieve the pumping activities with respect to the beginning of the groundwater head drawdown and recovery the proposed approach requires the storage coefficient s to transform the identified groundwater level change into the change in water amount in the aquifer due to the spatial heterogeneity the observations of hydrogeological parameters are commonly limited to estimate the spatial distribution of hydrogeological parameters in the case of storage coefficients they are commonly more scarce than hydraulic conductivities because their observations require multiple wells in regular pumping test techniques recent studies have shown that an advanced geostatistical method has been proposed to improve the estimation confidence in hydrogeological parameters with limited observations more studies will be required to assess the application of the advanced space time geostatistical or machine learning estimation method for parameter estimation in the groundwater system and its impact on pumping estimation 5 conclusions this study proposes a data driven approach to estimate spatiotemporal pumping rate distribution from groundwater head observations across space and time we applied our proposed approach to a synthetic groundwater level simulation with space time varying pumping activities and infiltration with actual precipitation the results show that eof analysis can effectively classify the space time patterns of high frequency head variations and hht analysis helps to retrieve the target pumping signals by differentiating the processes with distinct time frequency characteristics the integration of eof and hht analyses can reveal the pumping related signals from the first differenced head observations and their corresponding pumping rates this study shows that the proposed approach can provide informative groundwater withdrawal estimation with the knowledge of groundwater level variation although pumping estimation uncertainties can be introduced from factors including storage coefficient and groundwater level estimation the proposed approach suggests an efficient way in areas without effective groundwater withdrawal management however with systematic groundwater level monitoring and therefore the results can be valuable references to improve understanding of the groundwater system and groundwater management credit authorship
