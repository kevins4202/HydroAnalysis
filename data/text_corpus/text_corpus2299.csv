11495,potential yield of a crop is limited by the factor which most restricts its productivity in dryland cropping systems this factor is often the available soil water nitrogen fertiliser is also a high cost input in crop production systems conservation of these resources is essential to increase agricultural productivity and profitability a field experiment and computer simulation modelling were conducted for the dryland farming system of south eastern australia to investigate the effect of summer fallow management on growth and yield of canola brassica napus l a factorial experiment with two residual nitrogen levels and three residual soil water conditions was conducted soil water content and crop growth were monitored at harvest canola grain yield and above ground biomass were measured the biophysical model apsim was used to analyse the effect of seasonal variation on crop yield by simulating canola grain yield at different residual water and nitrogen levels the field experiment and simulation modelling indicated that in seasons with high in crop rainfall high residual soil water does not increase crop yield however residual nitrogen increases crop yield if in crop rainfall is high irrespective of the in crop rainfall controlling summer weeds increases crop yield due to residual mineral n and or residual soil water keywords apsim australia canola residual soil nitrogen residual soil water summer fallow weed 1 introduction water and nitrogen fertiliser are two of the most important inputs that need to be available in sufficient quantities for a crop to reach its potential yield high yield is obtained when both factors are not limited moore and hunt 2012 crop yield and the resulting return for these inputs is uncertain when rainfall variability is high as is often the case in the dryland rainfed farming system angus 2001 several studies have shown that fallow period management such as weed control aimed at reducing transpiration and n uptake and stubble retention to reduce evaporation and runoff increase soil water storage and nitrogen for the following season crop residual water from the summer fallow period is particularly important in regions where winter crop production often depends on the amount of residual soil moisture angus et al 1980 in the region where the experiment in this study was conducted zeleke 2017 showed that summer weed control increased residual soil water and residual soil nitrogen by 64 mm and 60 kg ha 1 respectively lilley and kirkegaard 2007 used simulation modelling to show that control of summer weeds would increase subsequent wheat yield by 6 20 weed control enables soil water storage in the deeper soil profile which can be accessed when the crop water demand and yield response to water is high moore and hunt 2012 while residual soil water at shallow depths using stubble cover enables early sowing of long season cultivars kirkegaard and hunt 2010 the conversion of stored soil water into grain yield depends on the amount and distribution of rainfall during the crop growing season in studies conducted in this region kirkegaard et al 2007b generated a range of starting soil water contents and observed that any additional stored soil water was converted to 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 29 kg ha 1 mm 1 depending on the season however from these studies it was not clear whether the increase in yield was due to conserved water or conserved nitrogen or both the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of residual soil water and residual nitrogen on canola brassica napus l yield in south eastern nsw a transition zone from the summer dominant rainfall northern regions to the winter dominant rainfall southern regions of australia using field experimentation and simulation modelling 2 materials and method 2 1 field experiment a field experiment to evaluate the effect of summer fallow management on soil water and nitrogen conservation and crop yield was conducted at wagga wagga nsw australia in the 2015 16 summer fallow period and 2016 winter cropping season there were 24 experimental plots 5 m long and 1 8 m wide with 0 5 m wide access path between the plots between the experimental plots there are buffer plots of the same size and treated similarly to the adjacent experimental plots the experimental plots were fitted with drip irrigation system neutron probe access tubes were installed in each plot for soil water content measurement neutron probe calibrated at the site was used to monitor soil moisture at 0 15 0 30 0 45 0 60 0 90 1 20 m depths separate calibration was used for the top 30 cm depth the soil of the experimental site is a sandy clay loam red kandosol with its hydrologic characteristics as shown in table 1 apsoil 2013 the monthly rainfall monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature is presented in fig 1 there was 52 more annual rainfall and 87 more in season may november rainfall in 2016 compared to the long term average the 2015 2016 summer fallow period treatments weed no weed and stubble no stubble created different residual water and residual nitrogen levels at the end of the fallow period zeleke 2017 these residual water and nitrogen levels helped to formulate the treatments of this study the three sowing time residual soil water contents in 0 1 2 m soil depth 0 214 low 0 251 medium and 0 279 high cm3 cm 3 and the two residual nitrogen levels in 0 0 6 m soil depth 39 kg n ha 1 low and 98 kg n ha 1 high respectively canola cv monty l was sown on 28 april 2016 and harvested on 7 november 2016 the sowing rate was for a target plant population of 80 plants m 2 each plot had six rows of canola at 25 cm spacing in order to investigate the contribution of residual water residual nitrogen and their interaction on crop yield a factorial experiment was conducted with residual nitrogen as the main plot and residual soil water content as sub plot with three replications all the experimental plots received nitrogen fertiliser at the time of sowing 46 kg n ha 1 and two months after sowing 46 kg n ha 1 the crop green canopy cover was measured at about monthly interval using a handheld device greenseeker ntech industries inc ukiah ca usa which measures normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ndvi is an accurate estimation of vegetation fraction gitelson 2013 as a result ndvi was used as a proxy for green canopy cover water requirement of canola has already been determined at this site zeleke and wade 2011 during the growing season above ground dry matter was measured by destructive sampling of five plants per plot from the buffer plots treated similarly to the adjacent experimental plots at harvest the above ground dry matter and grain yield was measured from one meter length of the internal four rows of each plot statistical analysis was done using the r program r development core team 2016 2 2 simulation the effect of residual soil water and residual nitrogen on canola yield under different seasonal climatic conditions was simulated using apsim a dynamic daily time step biophysical model that links biophysical crop soil climate and management modules to simulate agricultural systems holzworth et al 2014 the modules are crop growth development and yield modules soil n and organic matter dynamics module soil water dynamics module and stubble management module apsim has been extensively evaluated and applied in diverse cropping systems of australia and other countries holzworth et al 2014 apsim has been tested in the study area for canola yield and soil water prediction zeleke et al 2014b in this study apsim was used to simulate canola grain yield under different residual soil water and residual nitrogen conditions as per the values obtained in the experimental two initial soil nitrogen levels were used for the simulation one for the condition where nitrogen is depleted by the weed during the fallow period nl and the other for conditions where weed was controlled during the fallow period resulting in higher nitrogen level in the soil nh this was factored with three residual soil water conditions low ml medium mm and high mh

as urea n 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water dynamics the evolution of soil water content during the 2016 winter crop growing season is shown in fig 2 the three residual starting soil water content levels on 28 04 2016 low medium and high the basis of the three initial water content treatments are indicated by red line in figs 2a 2b and 2c respectively fig 3 shows that although the three treatments started with distinct soil water content levels after about two months the difference disappeared with no statistically significant difference this was due to the high amount of rainfall in the subsequent months after the crop was sown despite different starting soil water contents the soil water content at harvest 7 11 2016 was similar for all the three treatments fig 2a shows that in the low residual water content scenario the soil water content profile at sowing was significantly different from the final water content profile at harvest however for the high residual water content scenario there was no significant difference between the soil water content profile at sowing and at harvest fig 2c 3 2 crop growth fig 4 a shows that the treatments with high residual soil water had lower green canopy cover compared to the treatments with low and medium residual water contents the treatment with low residual nitrogen had lower green canopy cover compared to the treatment with high residual nitrogen fig 4b higher residual nitrogen improved canopy growth while higher initial water decreased canopy growth the latter can be due to leaching of nitrogen beyond the root zone which affected crop growth the 2016 winter crop growing season experienced a relatively high amount of rainfall 87 higher than the long term average under this condition nutrient not soil moisture becomes the limiting factor for crop growth the above ground dry matter during the crop growing season for different combinations of residual soil water and residual nitrogen treatments is shown in fig 5 in this particular season high residual n and low residual soil water content resulted in higher dry matter compared to the low residual n and low residual soil water content treatments 3 3 crop harvest parameters statistical analysis of the effect of residual soil water and residual nitrogen on canola grain yield and above ground dry matter biomass at harvest is shown in table 2 for this particular season for a given residual nitrogen level there was no significant effect of residual soil water on grain yield above ground dry matter and harvest index however residual soil nitrogen had significant effect on these harvest parameters the interaction effect of residual nitrogen and residual soil water was also significant with the yield being higher at lower residual water content and higher residual nitrogen levels this shows that as the amount of soil water increases residual nitrogen utilisation increases nitrogen fertiliser applied to crops sown to a soil where summer weed is controlled and residual soil water is high results in higher crop yield to maximise the benefits of soil water conserved during the summer fallow period high nitrogen level needs to be applied during the crop growing season to make use of the residual nitrogen as well high water supply rainfall is required this indicates that there is resource co limitation for crop production in the region sadras et al 2012 in the treatments with high residual nitrogen there was a decrease in canola yield as the residual water content increased in this particular season the highest residual soil water did not result in the highest canola grain yield even when there was high residual nitrogen rather the highest grain yield was obtained in the treatments with the highest amount of residual nitrogen and the lowest residual soil water this is due to the soil profile being full at the time of sowing and leaching of the added nitrogen at the early growth stages following high amount of rainfall as can be seen in fig 1a in the months after the canola was sown there were large rainfall events in may 99 mm vs 44 mm long term average and in june 97 mm vs 51 mm long term average the in season rainfall may november 2016 was 624 mm compared to the long term average of 334 mm high amount of rainfall during early may and the subsequent winter period might have leached the nitrogen from the crop rooting zone summer fallow management such as complete weed control can result in full soil profile water content if this is followed by high in season rainfall like the one in 2016 it can result in deep drainage and leaching of nutrients beyond the crop root zone moore and hunt 2012 lópez bellido et al 2005 reported that nitrogen fertiliser application at sowing results in poor fertiliser use efficiency as the crops are not yet able to uptake the nutrient therefore summer fallow management using weed control should consider not only crop production but also unintended outcomes such as nutrient leaching if in season rainfall is high the water saved by weed control and stubble retention is only partly beneficially used for crop evapotranspiration as much of it is lost as deep drainage zeleke et al 2014a the effect of residual soil water on crop yield depends on soil type and the amount and distribution of rainfall during the crop growing season high rainfall early in the crop growing season when the crop water demand is very low often exceeds the water holding capacity of soils with good drainage characteristics cooper et al 1983 these type of soils quickly fill up resulting in much of the rainfall being lost as deep drainage below the root zone and so does not contribute to crop productivity moeller et al 2009 asseng et al 2001 under these conditions the residual soil water has only limited effect on crop yield for soils with high water holding capacity and seasons with low in season rainfall the soil is less likely to be refilled by the in season winter rainfall this increases the contribution of residual soil water on crop yield moeller et al 2009 in this study due to residual nitrogen canola grain yield increased by 0 97 t ha 1 52 however there was 0 40 t ha 1 15 yield decrease due to high residual soil water birchip cropping group 2000 reported that effective control of summer weeds resulted in 70 mm of residual soil water and 33 kg ha 1 of residual soil nitrogen which could be converted into wheat yield increase of 1 5 t ha 1 in central nsw mcmaster et al 2015 showed that good summer weed control increased canola yield by 1 0 t ha 1 due to increased stored water 85 mm and mineral nitrogen 69 kg n ha 1 at sowing after complete summer fallow weed control moore and hunt 2012 reported average simulated wheat yield increases from 1 5 to 1 9 t ha 1 at hopetoun victoria and from 2 8 to 3 6 t ha 1 at temora nsw as a result of fallow weed control in the mallee region of victoria hunt et al 2013 reported that good summer weed control increased residual soil water by 45 mm and residual mineral n by 45 kg ha 1 these resulted in 0 6 t ha 1 and 1 4 t ha 1 yield increase for canola and wheat respectively however in these studies the effect of residual nitrogen was not explicitly investigated unlike practices such as stubble cover that conserve only water control of summer fallow weeds increase both soil water and n zeleke 2017 which results in reliable yield response and financial return the increase in yield due to summer fallow management depends on the amount and distribution of in season rainfall and subsoil constraints sadras 2003 lilley and kirkegaard 2007 growing season conditions e g rainfall determined the crop response to the residual soil water and nitrogen yield response per unit of stored residual soil water is higher in seasons with below median rainfall moeller et al 2009 it is expected that water stored in the deeper soil profile can be accessed during the critical crop growth stages such as anthesis and grain filling kirkegaard et al 2007a however sadras et al 2012 did not find any significant effect of sowing time soil water on harvest index and partitioning of water use before and after anthesis 3 4 simulation of the effect of residual water and residual nitrogen on canola yield canola grain yield was simulated using low and high residual soil water content scenarios similar to the ones observed in the field experiment the difference between these two yield values was plotted against in crop rainfall fig 6 as shown by high yield difference at low in crop rainfall values residual soil water has significant effect on canola yield only in the relatively dry seasons when the in crop rainfall values get higher than 300 mm the effect of residual soil water on canola yield becomes insignificant the difference even falls below zero indicating that high residual soil water followed by high in crop rainfall can have detrimental effect on crop yield this was also observed in the experimental result during the 2016 winter cropping season where there was 0 4 t ha 1 decrease in yield due to high stored water followed by high in season rainfall this shows that whether residual soil water due to summer fallow management results in increased yield depends on the amount of rainfall during the following crop growing season soil moisture conservation using summer weed control has the greatest potential benefit where the growing season rainfall is low and unreliable however summer weed control has also been reported to enhance early sowing opportunities in some seasons which could increase canola grain yield by a further 21 31 zeleke et al 2014b in summer dominant rainfall regions where winter crop growing season rainfall is low and unreliable and where there is high water holding capacity soils such as vertosols there can be a significant increase in crop yield as a result of residual soil water dalal et al 1997 this is especially the case when the residual soil water constitutes a significant proportion of the total seasonal crop water use in this situation the residual soil water is a good indicator of the potential yield and the nitrogen fertiliser requirement moeller et al 2009 however this scenario of predicting yield potential and managing nitrogen fertiliser based on residual soil water works only when and where the in seasonal rainfall is low and soils with a high water holding capacity when the in season rainfall is high and the soil is of low water holding capacity the effect of residual soil water is limited the effect of residual soil nitrogen on canola yield expressed as the difference between the yield at low residual nitrogen and at high residual nitrogen plotted against in crop rainfall is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the higher the residual nitrogen the higher the grain yield in years with low rainfall high residual nitrogen did not increase yield the higher the amount of the in crop rainfall the higher the yield benefit from residual nitrogen the yield increases as the rainfall increases since the crop will be able to use this additional n efficiently however at high rainfall amounts 500 mm the yield started to decrease which can be attributed to leaching this indicates that in dryland farming system to utilise the residual nitrogen high soil moisture rainfall is required the simulation modelling results indicate that in seasons with high rainfall such as the 2016 residual mineral nitrogen determines the crop yield response osten et al 2006 haskins and mcmaster 2010 in drought years crop yield is determined by residual soil water and in normal seasons the crop yield is determined by both residual soil water and n in what is referred to as resource co limitation sadras et al 2012 verburg et al 2012 in a modelling study in western australia moeller et al 2009 analysed the interactions between residual soil water type of soil climate and soil nitrogen in agreement with the finding in this study they concluded that additional yield per unit of plant available water at sowing was generally higher in drier seasons in a modelling study using apsim hunt et al 2013 reported 40 mm of residual soil water increased yield by 0 4 t ha 1 yield most of the increase was observed to be in drier seasons the residual n of 40 kg n ha 1 increased yield only in relatively wet seasons the importance of residual water for winter crop production may increase in the future due to climate change in south eastern australia saha et al 2014 showed that summer rainfall is likely to increase while rainfall in the other seasons likely to decrease as a result the contribution of residual soil water to the crop water demand will increase to take adaptation measures knowledge of the amount of residual soil water the amount and distribution of in season rainfall and the soil water holding characteristics may increasingly become more important 4 conclusion the benefits of summer fallow stored soil water for subsequent crop yield depends on crop growing conditions particularly the amount and distribution of rainfall during the growing season summer fallow has the greatest potential benefit when the growing season rainfall is low and unreliable the contribution of summer rainfall to increased crop yield can be significant only in drier crop growing seasons this benefit declines with the increase in seasonal rainfall considering only water availability summer weed control may not be economical in every year or situation e g in a very wet cropping season however irrespective of the amount of rainfall during the crop growing season summer fallow management using weed control is beneficial since weed control increases mineral n large yield increases due to summer weed control can be achieved in both dry and wet growing season conditions in dry seasons due to high residual water and in wet seasons due to high residual nitrogen this indicates that fallow management using complete weed control is beneficial as it increases soil water and nitrogen irrespective of the condition in the subsequent growing season the co limitation of yield by water and n indicates that the increase in crop yield resulting from summer fallow weed control is reliable acknowledgment the author was graham centre research fellow when conducting this

lower green canopy cover compared to the treatments with low and medium residual water contents the treatment with low residual nitrogen had lower green canopy cover compared to the treatment with

which affected crop growth the 2016 winter crop growing season experienced a relatively high amount of rainfall 87 higher than the long term average under this condition nutrient not soil moisture becomes the limiting factor for crop growth the above ground dry matter during the crop growing season for different combinations of residual soil water and residual nitrogen treatments is shown in fig 5 in this particular season high residual n and low residual soil water content resulted in higher dry matter compared to the low residual n and low residual soil water content treatments 3 3 crop harvest parameters statistical analysis of the effect of residual soil water and residual nitrogen on canola grain yield and above ground dry matter biomass at harvest is shown in table 2 for this particular season for a given residual nitrogen level there was no significant effect of residual soil water on grain yield above ground dry matter and harvest index however residual soil nitrogen had significant effect on these harvest parameters the interaction effect of residual nitrogen and residual soil water was also significant with the yield being higher at lower residual water content and higher residual nitrogen levels this shows that as the amount of soil water increases residual nitrogen utilisation increases nitrogen fertiliser applied to crops sown to a soil where summer weed is controlled and residual soil water is high results in higher crop yield to maximise the benefits of soil water conserved during the summer fallow period high nitrogen level needs to be applied during the crop growing season to make use of the residual nitrogen as well high water supply rainfall is required this indicates that there is resource co limitation for crop production in the region sadras et al 2012 in the treatments with high residual nitrogen there was a decrease in canola yield as the residual water content increased in this particular season the highest residual soil water did not result in the highest canola grain yield even when there was high residual nitrogen rather the highest grain yield was obtained in the treatments with the highest amount of residual nitrogen and the lowest residual soil water this is due to the soil profile being full at the time of sowing and leaching of the added nitrogen at the early growth stages following high amount of rainfall as can be seen in fig 1a in the months after the canola was sown there were large rainfall events in may 99 mm vs 44 mm long term average and in june 97 mm vs 51 mm long term average the in season rainfall may november 2016 was 624 mm compared to the long term average of 334 mm high amount of rainfall during early may and the subsequent winter period might have leached the nitrogen from the crop rooting zone summer fallow management such as complete weed control can result in full soil profile water content if this is followed by high in season rainfall like the one in 2016 it can result in deep drainage and leaching of nutrients beyond the crop root zone moore and hunt 2012 lópez bellido et al 2005 reported that nitrogen fertiliser application at sowing results in poor fertiliser use efficiency as the crops are not yet able to uptake the nutrient therefore summer fallow management using weed control should consider not only crop production but also unintended outcomes such as

drainage zeleke et al 2014a the effect of residual soil water on crop yield depends on soil type and the amount and distribution of rainfall during the crop growing season high rainfall early in the crop growing season when the crop water demand is very low often exceeds the water holding capacity of soils with good drainage characteristics cooper et al 1983 these type of soils quickly fill up

residual soil water has only limited effect on crop yield for soils with high water holding capacity and seasons with low in season rainfall the soil is less likely to be refilled by the in season

studies the effect of residual nitrogen was not explicitly investigated unlike practices such as stubble cover that conserve only water control of summer fallow weeds increase both soil water and n

constraints sadras 2003 lilley and kirkegaard 2007 growing season conditions e g rainfall determined the crop response to the residual soil water and nitrogen yield response per unit of stored residual soil water is higher in seasons with below median rainfall moeller et al 2009 it is expected that water stored in the deeper soil profile can be accessed during the critical crop growth stages such as anthesis and grain filling kirkegaard et al 2007a however sadras et al 2012 did not find any significant effect of sowing time soil water on harvest index and partitioning of water use before and after anthesis 3 4 simulation of the effect of residual water and residual nitrogen on canola yield canola grain yield was simulated using low and high residual soil water content scenarios similar to the ones observed in the field experiment the difference between these two yield values was plotted against in crop rainfall fig 6 as shown by high yield difference at low in crop rainfall values residual soil water has significant effect on canola yield only in the relatively dry seasons when the in crop rainfall values get higher than 300 mm the effect of residual soil water on canola yield becomes insignificant the difference even falls below zero indicating that high residual soil water followed by high in crop rainfall can have detrimental effect on crop yield this was also observed in the experimental result during the 2016 winter cropping season where there was 0 4 t ha 1 decrease in yield due to high stored water followed by high in season rainfall this shows that whether residual soil water due to summer fallow management results in increased yield depends on the amount of rainfall during the following crop growing season soil moisture conservation using summer weed control has the greatest potential benefit where the growing season rainfall is low and unreliable however summer weed control has also been reported to enhance early sowing opportunities in some seasons which could increase canola grain yield by a further 21 31 zeleke et al 2014b in summer dominant rainfall regions where winter crop growing season rainfall is low and unreliable and where there is high water holding capacity soils such as vertosols there can be a significant increase in crop yield as a result of residual soil water dalal et al 1997 this is especially the case when the residual soil water constitutes a significant proportion of the total seasonal crop water use in this situation the residual soil water is a good indicator of the potential yield and the nitrogen fertiliser requirement moeller et al 2009 however this scenario of predicting yield potential and managing nitrogen fertiliser based on residual soil water works only when and where the in seasonal rainfall is low and soils with a high water holding capacity when the in season rainfall is high and the soil is of low water holding capacity the effect of residual soil water is limited the effect of residual soil nitrogen on canola yield expressed as the difference between the yield at low residual nitrogen and at high residual nitrogen plotted against in crop rainfall is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the higher the residual nitrogen the higher the grain yield in years with low rainfall high residual nitrogen did not increase yield the higher the amount of the in crop rainfall the higher the yield benefit from residual nitrogen the yield increases as the rainfall increases since the crop will be able to use this additional n efficiently however at high rainfall amounts 500 mm the yield started to decrease which can be attributed to leaching this indicates that in dryland farming system to utilise the residual nitrogen high soil moisture rainfall is required the simulation modelling results indicate that in seasons with high rainfall such as the 2016 residual mineral nitrogen determines the crop yield response osten et al 2006 haskins and mcmaster 2010 in drought years crop yield is determined by residual soil water and in normal seasons the crop yield is determined by both residual soil water and n in what is referred to as resource co limitation sadras et al 2012 verburg et al 2012 in a modelling study in western australia moeller et al 2009 analysed the interactions between residual soil water type of soil climate and soil nitrogen in agreement with the finding in this study they concluded that additional yield per unit of plant available water at sowing was generally higher in drier seasons in a modelling study using apsim hunt et al 2013 reported 40 mm of residual soil water increased yield by 0 4 t ha 1 yield most of the increase was observed to be in drier seasons the residual n of 40 kg n ha 1 increased yield only in relatively wet seasons the importance of residual water for winter crop production may increase in the future due to climate change in south eastern australia saha et al 2014 showed that summer rainfall is likely to increase while rainfall in the other seasons likely to decrease as a result the contribution of residual soil water to the crop water demand will increase to take adaptation measures knowledge of the amount of residual soil water the amount and distribution of in season rainfall and the soil water holding characteristics may increasingly become more important 4 conclusion the benefits of summer fallow stored soil water for subsequent crop yield depends on crop growing conditions particularly the amount and distribution of rainfall during the growing season summer fallow has the greatest potential benefit when the growing season rainfall is low and unreliable the contribution of summer rainfall to increased crop yield can be significant only in drier crop growing seasons this benefit declines with the increase in seasonal rainfall considering only water availability summer weed control may not be economical in every year or situation e g in a very wet cropping season however irrespective of the amount of rainfall during the crop growing season summer fallow management using weed control is beneficial since weed control increases mineral n large yield increases due to summer weed control can be achieved in both dry and wet growing season conditions in dry seasons due to high residual water and in wet seasons due to high residual nitrogen this indicates that fallow management using complete weed control is beneficial as it increases soil water and nitrogen irrespective of the condition in the subsequent growing season the co limitation of yield by water and n indicates that the increase in crop yield resulting from summer fallow weed control is reliable acknowledgment the author was graham centre research fellow when conducting this

11496,knowledge of the dominant water sources and their relative contributions to streams in time is important for understanding the underlying hydrological processes as well as managing the quantity and quality of water resources in many subtropical regions the complexity of mixed agricultural land and water use in combination with lack of data further inhibits such understanding of the dominant catchment scale runoff generation processes this study provides new insights into the time variable interactions of natural and anthropogenic influences on the catchment response through integrated hydrometric and multi tracer stable water isotopes mg2 na si4 cl and electricity conductivity analyses the combined diagnostic tools of mixing models dtmm and end member mixing analysis emma were successfully used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability in key water sources of a subtropical catchment in china this study site is characterized by rain fed uplands and irrigated water paddy fields the emma results for one year of data showed that irrigation water rainwater and ground water were the three main sources which contributed to 64 19 and 17 of the streamflow on average respectively however temporal patterns in rainfall and irrigation practices did cause significant variability in these relative contributions overall we found that routine agricultural practices to optimize crop growth especially during paddy growth periods was a more important factor than hydro meteorological conditions in controlling the regime and properties of water sources the relatively simple but successful application of emma and dtmm in a complex environment demonstrates that it is a valuable approach for understanding water sources and hydrologic processes concerning agricultural or mixed land use catchments keywords agricultural catchment end member mixing model critical zone observatory water sources 1 introduction information about the sources and flow pathways that generate streamflow is essential for understanding hydrologic and biogeochemical processes especially in cultivated catchments this further relates to characterizing contaminant transport of non point source agricultural pollution jin et al 1999 birkel et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 mixing models using isotopic and chemical tracers as a hydrograph separation technique have been widely and successfully used to trace streamflow sources and flow paths at the catchment scale they have provided new insights into hydrological processes with respect to time variable water sources and dominant flow pathways in catchment hydrology e g liu et al 2008 2013 munyaneza et al 2012 these hydrograph separation techniques assume conservative mixing and require specific definitions of the endmembers however considerable uncertainties remain due to the spatial and temporal variability in end member chemistry composition soulsby et al 2003 schmieder et al 2016 in agricultural catchments this is further complicated by human activities durand and torres 1996 soulsby et al 2003 for example soil tillage and the application of fertilizers and pesticides can remove the chemical gradients in catchment soils which in turn affect the original chemical properties of different hydrological sources as such most of the chemical or isotopic hydrograph separation studies have been carried out in semi natural eco systems these include forested catchments scholl et al 2015 klaus et al 2015 mountain regions hugenschmidt et al 2014 rahman et al 2015 and other semi natural ecosystems such as in arctic river basins blaen et al 2014 and glaciated regions wu et al 2016 wilson et al 2016 relatively few of these studies concern agricultural or mixed landuse catchments exner kittridge et al 2016 tweed et al 2016 yet in order to minimize agricultural pollution and manage water resources efficiently knowledge on the sources and pathways of water that contributes to the stream is of crucial importance in non irrigated agricultural catchments precipitation ground water and riparian zone water are generally assumed to be the major contributors to stream flow generation hyer et al 2001 however where rain fed and irrigated fields co exist understanding the relative contribution of irrigation water with respect to the other potential sources in agricultural catchments is required unal et al 2004 in particular for subtropical rural irrigated environments a lack of data has contributed to a limited understanding of the time variable contributions of rainwater and irrigation water to streamflow generation for example in subtropical china paddy field irrigation is common yet the influence of different irrigation phases to streamflow generation is poorly understood previous studies focused only on specific storm events when the migration of substances is most active hugenschmidt et al 2014 farrick and branfireun 2015 however such specific focus studies are known to bias the physical interpretation of contributing end members james and roulet 2006 a study on streamflow generation in a 19 8 ha agricultural catchment previously showed significant differences in hydrologic flow paths and sources between non stormflow periods and stormflow periods pionke and dewalle 1994 i dewalle and pionke 1994 ii at the seasonal to annual timescale the geochemical character of particular water sources can vary significantly due to different pathways providing distinct opportunities for interaction of the water with soil and bedrock yang et al 2009 in addition fractal behavior may occur across time scales and affect long term observations of streamflow chemistry kirchner et al 2000 hence it is essential to understand the validity and applicability mixing models in different environments here we aimed to gain new insights into the spatiotemporal variability of streamflow generation in a mixed subtropical agricultural catchment we focused on a region within the poyang lake drainage area in subtropical china where common agricultural areas typically consist of small patches of uplands mixed with paddy fields streamflow is composed of overland flow irrigation water and soil water zhang et al 2011 but the temporal variability in the relative contributions is largely unknown the specific objectives of this study were a to explore the chemical characteristics of the key potential water sources of streamflow including rainfall irrigation water and ground water and b to quantify their relative contribution to streamflow under different hydrological conditions throughout the year 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this work was carried out in the sunjia experimental research catchment 50 5 ha located in the headwater region of poyang lake near yingtan jiangxi province in south eastern china fig 1 the humid subtropical climate is characterized by hot summers up to 40 c and mild winters 5 1 c the mean annual temperature is 17 8 c mean annual potential evapotranspiration is 1200 mm while mean annual precipitation totals 1800 mm of which half occurs between march and june the catchment elevation ranges from 34 to 55 m and slopes are around 5 to 8 the geology in the study region consists of cretaceous sandstone and deeply weathered quaternary red clay clay mineralogy is dominated by kaolinite with some hydro mica and vermiculite as a result of the weathering of feldspar and other silicate minerals this weathering may cause higher cationic concentrations e g ca2 mg2 in ground water than in rainwater and irrigation water desilicating and ferrallitic weathering in this subtropical environment is liable to remove si4 resulting in si depleted minerals soils in this region are red soils which are derived from the cretaceous sandstone and quaternary red clay and are classified as ultisols based on the usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2010 these soils are strongly acidic with ph h2o varying from 4 5 to 6 0 they are also rich in sesquioxides with an iron oxides content of about 20 60 g kg 1 in the soils the dominant agricultural land uses during the observation period were rain fed upland peanut arachis hypogaea 39 and double rice oriza sativa in the terraced irrigated paddy fields 25 other land uses in the upland areas included mandarin orange citrus reticulate tree 6 an agroforestry system consisting of peanut intercropped with mandarin orange citrus reticulate tree 8 grape vitis vinifera orchard 10 and other forested land 6 the remaining land 6 was occupied by ponds and residential use irrigation water to supply the paddy fields originates from the luxi river it enters the catchment through two inlet weirs channels fig 1 stream flow exhibits strong seasonality reflecting patterns in both precipitation and irrigation practices high flow coincide with the irrigation period and the rainy season while ephemeral drying up occurs after irrigation stopped in october during the dry season tang et al 2007 2008 2 2 field monitoring and sample collection we collected hydrometric data and water samples for chemical analyses between january and december 2015 rainfall was recorded by an automatic tipping bucket resolution 0 5 mm connected to an event data logger onset computer corporation usa installed near the foot of the peanut hillslope fig 1 rainfall samples were collected 24 times during the study year just before times which coincided with stream water sampling all water samples were stored in the refrigerator prior to analysis four weirs were installed to measure irrigation inflows no 1 and no 2 and stream outflows no 3 and no 4 within the sunjia catchment fig 1 two different types of weirs a rectangular and sharp crested weirs were installed at the inlet no 1 and at the other stream flow stations no 2 no 3 and no 4 respectively the no 3 weir was installed at the outlet of the irrigation channel to another catchment water level was measured with a hobo data logger onset computer corporation usa and recorded at 30 min intervals the recorded water levels were then converted to flow by adopting theoretical rating equations for the specific weirs for the sharp crested weirs at no 2 no 3 and no 4 this also involved additional gauging data the total irrigation flow into the catchment was calculated as the sum of inflow at no 1 and no 2 weirs minus the irrigation outflow at no 3 weir there was no additional water source for the irrigation channel between the weirs at sites no 1 and no 3 the weir at no 4 was located at the primary outflow channel of the catchment shallow ground water samples were collected monthly from three wells across the catchment see fig 1 wells 1 and 2 were used by local farmers for drinking water and used for water sampling only at observation well 3 ground water table was also monitored by a hobo water level data logger at 30 min intervals onset computer corporation usa irrigation water at the inlet stream water at the outlet and spring water that seeps from the soil at the foot of the hillslope fig 1 were collected every fortnight 2 3 laboratory sample analysis the rainfall irrigation spring well and stream water samples were analyzed for major cations ca2 mg2 na si4 and anions cl so4 2 using a dionex ics1100 ion chromatograph ic analytical precision 1σ standard deviation for all ions was less than 1 and the detection limit was less than 0 1 mg l 1 electricity conductivity ec and the ph of water samples were also measured δd and δ18o analyses were conducted by a liquid water isotope analyzer model 908 0008 los gatos research inc and results were expressed relative to vsmow in permil following eq 1 1 δ r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where the r values represent the ratio of d to h or 18o to 16o atoms for the sample and the vsmow standard the precision of the δd and δ18o measurements was 0 2 and 0 1 respectively 2 4 end member mixing analysis emma and diagnostic tools of mixing models dtmm the tracer based emma in combination with the dtmm was used to determine the contributions of endmembers to streamflow dtmm developed by hooper 2003 is used to identify conservative tracers and determine the number of the endmembers based on streamflow chemistry the diagnostic tools examine the appropriate rank of the streamflow chemistry data through a principal component analysis pca and determine the data dimensions in a euclidean u space according to hooper 2003 conservative mixing of end members with distinct chemical signatures is a linear process while solute correlations are controlled by chemical equilibria that are represented by higher order polynomials the number of u space dimensions for the linear expressions of conservative solutes is one less than the number of end members needed for the mixing emma was then applied to dtmm determined conservative tracers and identified endmembers and to quantify their contributions to streamflow pca was performed again to extract eigenvectors by using a correlation matrix of conservative tracers that were determined using dtmm the pca scores were used to solve for endmember contributions a procedure mathematically the same as using two tracers for a three component mixing model liu et al 2013 in addition the eligibility of end members was evaluated using distance between original chemical compositions and u space orthogonal projections of end members following eqs 2 and 3 2 d i b i b i 3 b i b i v t v v t 1 v where di means the euclidean distance of end member b for tracer i between the original composition bi and u space projection bi bi was calculated by using eq 3 based on the eigenvector v which was extracted from the conservative tracers in this study the distance was expressed as percentage by dividing distance by the original chemical composition the shorter the distance the better fit of an end member to emma liu et al 2008 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatological conditions the study site received 2432 mm of rainfall during the 2015 study year this was significantly above the annual mean of 1795 mm as calculated from 46 years of climatology data from the yingtan weather station 1954 1999 the highest monthly rainfall was recorded in june 569 mm followed by may 391 mm while the lowest was recorded in january 46 mm approximately 55 of the 2015 annual rainfall occurred between march and june wet period fig 2 the annual potential evapotranspiration was 1251 mm in 2015 close to the annual mean of 1229 mm the mean daily ground water table level fluctuated between 3 46 and 0 91 m below the surface fig 2 shows that the ground water level responded quickly to precipitation except for the rainfall event on 6 august which could be related to soil dryness during the wet season delays in ground water level responses were less than 24 h since the timing of maximum rainfall intensity for example following the largest storm event 101 4 mm june 18 this delay was 16 h the total irrigation water that entered the sunjia catchment was 4625 mm which accounted for 65 of the total catchment input irrigation was rather continuous from mid march to mid october while the other part of the year showed an intermittent irrigation pattern fig 2 this is consistent with the timing of the rice plant growing season and tillage practices the irrigation water flow was noticeable higher than streamflow during late april this period was dry and coincided with rice planting hence most irrigation water contributed to the paddy fields instead of streamflow nevertheless most of the time the temporal dynamics in streamflow at the catchment outlet closely resembled the irrigation water fluxes fig 2 the annual total stream outflow was 5141 mm approximately twice the annual rainfall this resulted in a clear masking effect over catchment rainfall runoff relations in sunjia fig 2b however during the wet season and during larger events in the dry season the response in streamflow appeared to be mainly controlled by precipitation dynamics fig 2b the highest flows were recorded during may and june 3 2 water isotope dynamics δ18o in rainfall varied between 11 81 and 1 07 5 70 weighted mean it was most enriched between january and july and more depleted in the latter half of year fig 3 the streamflow δ18o signature varied from 6 66 to 4 88 mean 5 89 following the pattern in rainfall exhibited a more or less stable level of 5 45 from january to may which then depleted from 5 21 to 6 48 in june and sat around a mean of 6 25 from july to december fig 4 shows that the lmwl r2 0 97 for 2015 lies close to the gmwl with a similar slope 8 1 the lel constructed from biweekly stream samples r2 0 93 has a slightly higher slope 9 0 which indicates that there was no strong evaporative enrichment of stream water the temporal dynamics of δ18o in irrigation water closely followed those in streamflow fig 3 however from august to december the mean δ18o of irrigation water was more depleted than that of stream water 6 18 vs 5 89 respectively there was spatial variability in the ground water δ18o signatures fig 3 in time these differences were consistent and all of well data plotted near to the lmwl so that none exhibited strong evaporative fractionation effects fig 4 the mean spring δ18o 5 83 and the mean ground water at w1 5 88 were also very similar to the mean rainfall value 5 86 which suggests that rainfall might be the main source for ground water recharge 3 3 patterns in water chemistry when evaluating the full dataset water chemistry was significantly different p 0 05 among the different water sources within the agricultural catchment table 1 overall concentrations of all chemical components in rainwater were lowest apart from so4 2 this reflects the acidic nature of the precipitation is further revealed by its relatively low ph 5 10 apart from cl and mg2 ionic concentrations of stream water were lower than those of irrigation water table 1 fig 5 the ionic concentrations in ground water were higher than in stream water except for si4 and so4 2 table 1 fig 5 the mean ionic concentrations in ground water wells varied significantly in space for example na was 0 62 mg l 1 in the ground water w3 and 6 48 mg l 1 in the ground water w2 table 1 the annual variation of ionic concentrations in stream water was evidently associated with the patterns of irrigation water while the variability of ionic concentrations in ground water was relatively stable in time fig 5 higher flows were associated with lower concentrations and vice versa fig 5 3 4 hydrograph separation by three endmember mixing model a three endmember hydrograph separation was conducted using emma before this dtmm was used to identify conservative tracers and to determine the number of water sources the distributions of residuals between measured and projected values over the measured ionic concentrations in 1 d and 2 d fig 6 indicated that levels of mg2 na si4 cl and ec r2 0 2 and p 0 03 in the stream water were mainly the result of conservatively mixing of at least three endmembers tracers were considered acceptable to use for hydrograph separation if streamflow samples were bounded by potential water sources as shown in fig 7 a exploring a total of 15 mixing diagrams combining paired conservative tracers of ec mg2 na si4 cl and δ18o we found that all of these tracers except δ18o could be used for hydrograph separation even though traditionally considered a conservative tracer mixing diagrams of δ18o with chemical tracers could not be well defined with potential end members e g fig 7b this might reflect the effects caused by evaporative enrichment of water standing in paddy fields for prolonged times as such the ec mg2 na si4 and cl were used as tracers to develop the emma model most streamflow samples plotted within the triangle between irrigation water rainwater and ground water as water sources on u space fig 8 the first two pca components explained 82 of the total variance of the streamflow data suggesting that three end members appeared to be acceptable in this small agricultural catchment according to liu et al 2004 2008 endmembers with a spatial distance between original compositions and u space orthogonal projections of less than 50 60 for all tracers would be acceptable for emma this excludes rainfall which exhibits relatively low ionic concentrations the first two endmembers were rainwater and irrigation water table 2 the ground water samples from w1and w2 as well as the mean of all three wells ground water m were all appropriate as the third endmember to emma assuming that the different sources of ground water are interconnected at the small scale of our research area ground water m was chosen as the third endmember to quantify the contribution of three water sources in addition to the five tracer emma model na and cl were used to develop an additional two tracer emma model for the quantification of the three end member contributions these two were chosen as they showed the highest p values for the residual distributions the end member contributions were different for the five tracer versus two tracer emma models fig 9 according to the five tracer emma model irrigation water rainwater and ground water m contributed 64 19 and 17 on average respectively in comparison to 53 21 and 26 for the two tracer model however the temporal pattern of end member contributions was nearly identical for the two model results r2 0 79 0 91 consistent with temporal rainfall patterns the relative contribution from rainwater was greater during the wet season 38 from may 10 to june 30 and the latter part of the dry season when irrigation ceased 41 from nov 13 to jan 23 after the wet season the seasonal drought occurred hence the relative contribution from rainwater rapidly decreased between events the ground water contribution increased and was proportionally higher during the dry than the wet season out of the three endmembers the contribution of irrigation water was largest it showed an opposite temporal pattern to rainfall with a relatively low proportion in the wet season and a contribution of more than 90 of total discharge from august to october the hydrometric and chemical data at the catchment outlet suggest four phases in the sources of runoff generation which can be characterized by patterns in rainfall and irrigation practices fig 9 table 3 they are briefly described below 3 4 1 phase i 1st jan 19th feb during this phase hillslope croplands and paddy fields were fallow irrigation water was intermittently led into the catchment but not all of this contributed to streamflow rainfall was also low 2 7 of annual rainfall but ground water levels remained relative stable 3 40 m below the surface discharge was low but compared to other times of the year the proportion of ground water was relatively high this was evident from the high ionic concentrations in stream water fig 5 resulting from the release of solutes from the ground water 3 4 2 phase ii 20th feb 30th jun this phase represents the rainy season with 1466 mm rainfall and a strong increase in streamflow the contribution of rainfall to streamflow increased 23 irrigation water totals were significantly greater than streamflow in april because it was mainly used for paddy field puddling during early rice growth high proportional rainfall and irrigation water contributions then diluted solute concentrations in the stream 3 4 3 phase iii 1st jul 7th oct this phase is characterized as the dry season due to low rainfall but high air temperature irrigation waterwas high to meet the demand for late rice growth it also contributed to most of streamflow 81 the ground water table dropped and its contribution to streamflow decreased 11 nevertheless solutes concentrations in the stream increased mainly because of the lack of dilution via rainfall 3 4 4 phase iv 8th oct 31st dec similar to phase i streamflow responded to irrigation and rainfall inputs irrigation water fluctuated randomly and stopped completely on 10thdec after the rice harvest all irrigation water directly flowed through channel to catchment outlet after rice harvest ground water levels rose to increases in rainfall resulting in an increasing contribution to steamflow rainfall contribution increased up to 31 due as a result of smaller irrigation water contributions 3 5 evaluation of emma based hydrograph separation the two tracer and five tracer emma predicted streamflow geochemical properties were compared against the field data in fig 10 the goodness of prediction was evaluated by comparing regression lines to the 1 1 line y x the two tracer model predicted the concentrations of mg2 na si4 and cl quite well with slopes 0 87 1 and r2 from 0 51 to 0 99 however the predictions of ec and ca2 were poor with r2 of only 0 29 and 0 08 respectively therefore the two tracer model was not considered successful in contrast the five tracer model was reasonably successful with slopes ranging from 0 96 to 1 18 and r2 from 0 56 to 0 93 respectively ca2 did not behave completely conservatively fig 6 with slope 1 18 and r2 of 0 40 the re creation of streamflow chemistry enhanced the confidence of the results of emma and the associated hydrograph separation 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of emma results we used dtmm and emma analyses for hydrograph separation in a mixed agricultural catchment with rain fed hillslopes 39 and irrigated paddy fields 25 streamflow sources were separated into irrigation water rainwater and ground water of which the first was most dominant ground water contributed to 17 of the annual total streamflow with a peak of 30 in the dry period this is much lower than previously reported for other environments for instance in a 66 ha austrian agricultural headwater catchment with deep fractured siltstone developing exner kittridge et al 2016 suggested that ground water contributed up to 39 to stream water for snow rain transition forested catchments liu et al 2013 even reported ground water relative contributions greater than 60 which formed by rapid infiltration of snowmelt and rainwater to soil bedrock interface through preferential pathways our results showed that spring water which represents subsurface lateral flow from the hillslopes was not a significant contributor nevertheless for specific storm events that may not have been captured during the routine monitoring of this study zhang et al 2011 previously reported that subsurface lateral flow contributed 5 7 7 3 to streamflow for the same study catchment the identification of end members for the sunjia agricultural catchment and the numerical solutions for emma were quantitatively evaluated by recreating streamflow chemistry using the results of relative contributions of five tracer emma and ionic concentrations of end members fig 10 following liu et al 2004 most tracers were simulated well the relatively poor simulation of ca2 could be related to artificial lime applications in an attempt to reduce the acidity of the red soils hence ca2 may not be considered a conservative tracer in the catchment fig 6 4 2 does emma with dtmm aid in understanding water sources in subtropical mixed agricultural catchments to our knowledge this study represents one of the first that reported estimates of stream water sources using dtmm and emma in a subtropical mixed agricultural catchment we were able to identify the key sources and the temporal variability in their contribution to streamflow as such we gained new insights into the dominant hydrological processes throughout different times of the year in a complex agricultural system however the mixing model which we used to separate the relative contributions of the different potential endmembers is simply based on two water and geochemical tracer mass balance equations ladouche et al 2001 barthold et al 2011 furthermore it depends on two strong assumptions including that tracers are conservative and that the number of end members is known however which tracers are appropriate and conservative as well as the number of endmembers are commonly unknown a priori subjectively determining the number of end members and conservative tracers is imprudent to construct the mixing models here the conservative tracers and the number of endmembers were therefore identified using dtmm and emma however to further improve the identification of stream end members and our understanding of the dominant hydrological processes in catchment a more comprehensive field hydrometric monitoring strategy would be needed with a finer scale temporal and spatial resolution isotopes of δd and δ18o are considered to be among the best conservative tracer available for hydrograph separation lyon et al 2009 jefferson et al 2015 however they presented quite different results from the geochemical tracers this can be related to high evaporation rates in our study area in addition to δd and δ18o the most commonly applied tracers in hydrograph separation studies are geochemical tracers such as ec si4 ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 and others iwagami et al 2010 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 2013 yet geochemical tracers in some regions may not behave conservatively due to interactions with mineral material and constituents on their route to the stream for these reasons rice and hornberger 1998 for example found large differences in estimated component amounts when for a range of different tracers they also agreed with nolan and hill 1990 who indicated that different tracers may cause great bias if they were chosen subjectively due to the heterogeneity among catchment and the complexity of hydraulic processes in our catchment ca2 and so4 2 were found to not to behave conservative this is different for other areas for example in seasonally snow covered forested catchments liu et al 2008 hence additional validation with more conventional tracers is usually needed and during a range of hydrologic and climatic conditions pellerin et al 2008 dtmm as applied here is an ideal tool to objectively choose the conservative tracers and determine the number of end members using emma analyses in conjunction with dtmm to separate water sources and flow pathways is a common practice frisbee et al 2011 liu et al 2013 yevenes and mannaerts 2012 however emma is not always suitable for catchments where rainfall contribution to streamflow is important because rainwater chemistry can be highly variable in our agricultural catchment the stream water concentrations were often several orders of magnitude higher than rainwater concentrations hence variations of rainwater chemistry would not have significantly affected the results of the mixing model durand and torres 1996 on the contrary for our agricultural study catchment the chemistry of irrigation and ground water was found to be highly variable both in time and space table 1 fig 5 this may be related to the mixed land uses slope cropland and paddy areas but mainly to fertilizer and pesticide additions throughout the year nevertheless the variations of potential end members have been known during the whole period which conforms to the assumptions of emma in addition to routine agricultural activities uncontrolled irrigation practices add complexity to understanding of regional dominant hydrological process because irrigation and drainage of paddy terrace fields are strongly interlinked it was complicated to estimate the amount of irrigation water which directly contributed to streamflow we found that the streamflow chemistry was close to irrigation water and therefore markedly different from non irrigation catchments frisbee et al 2011 however we also demonstrated that this did not influence the application of dtmm and emma our study therefore indicated the potential utility in applying dtmm and emma in mixed agricultural catchments such as those in subtropical china 4 3 uncertainties in hydrograph separation high spatial and temporal variability in chemical composition of tracers and endmembers can contribute to significant uncertainty in hydrograph separation schmieder et al 2016 as such the specific tracers used in the emma can play a critical role in the results of the hydrograph separation barthold et al 2011 for example δ18o was used as a tracer in many studies zhao et al 2013 but we found it to be not suitable in our catchment fig 7b which could be a consequence of high evaporation rates in the paddy fields in addition ca2 was detected as not conservative because it is a component of that lime which is usually applied to acidic soils another source of uncertainty in hydrograph separation studies is the number of tracers used we found a noticeable difference between hydrograph separations based on two vs five tracers fig 9 comparisons between simulated and observed streamflow chemistry indicated that the five tracer emma was better than the two tracer one fig 10 the optimum number of tracers can vary between catchments though for example liu et al 2008 indicated that a five tracer model was not more successful for than a two component hydrograph separation in a forested catchment nevertheless in emma models the choice of endmembers results in a bias here we found that ground water from either w1 or w2 could both be identified as the third endmember according to the mixing diagram fig 8 and spatial distances table 2 however when we set the ground water sampled from either w1 or w2 as the third endmember the difference between their contributions to streamflow reached up to 6 their temporal patterns were nearly identical though this result is inconsistent with liu et al 2008 who observed that the spatial variation in ground water flow did not cause a significant error in emma because the chemical composition in ground water flow showed a significant difference from other water source another source of uncertainty could include the temporal variability of solute concentrations in irrigation water an emma test was performed by the temporal specific chemical compositions in irrigation water instead of their mean as mentioned above however the emma results data not shown here from using constant vs varying values for irrigation water were almost identical with r2 0 87 n 24 p 0 001 between these two approaches differences in contributions of irrigation water and ground water to streamflow were less than 1 this can be explained by the overall large differences between the chemical compositions of irrigation water on the one hand and those of rainwater and ground water on the other table 1 5 conclusions for complex agricultural catchments with rain fed uplands and leveled irrigated paddy fields in subtropical china we showed that streamflow is predominantly controlled by irrigation practices even when irrigated paddy fields represent only a small proportion of the total drainage area we applied emma mixing analyses using a range of geochemical tracers of source and stream water in addition to irrigation watrer being the dominant source we found that rainwater and ground water were the two other major contributors to streamflow the relative contributions of each source varied significantly with temporal patterns in irrigation practices and rainfall results suggested that irrigation flow contributed near to or more than 90 of streamflow during the dry autumn when second season paddy is in process of drying for harvest this was significantly lower in june less than 40 when streamflow and rainfall were high and ground water levels were shallow temporal variation in the geochemistry of irrigation did not cause a significant bias in the emma analyses results but the spatial variation of ground water geochemistry did even though the approach was relatively simple the successful application of emma combined with dtmm suggests that the coupled approach is an effective tool to gain insights into the origin of stream water in highly complex

11496,knowledge of the dominant water sources and their relative contributions to streams in time is important for understanding the underlying hydrological processes as well as managing the quantity and quality of water resources in many subtropical regions the complexity of mixed agricultural land and water use in combination with lack of data further inhibits such understanding of the dominant catchment scale runoff generation processes this study provides new insights into the time variable interactions of natural and anthropogenic influences on the catchment response through integrated hydrometric and multi tracer stable water isotopes mg2 na si4 cl and electricity conductivity analyses the combined diagnostic tools of mixing models dtmm and end member mixing analysis emma were successfully used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability in key water sources of a subtropical catchment in china this study site is characterized by rain fed uplands and irrigated water paddy fields the emma results for one year of data showed that irrigation water rainwater and ground water were the three main sources which contributed to 64 19 and 17 of the streamflow on average respectively however temporal patterns in rainfall and irrigation practices did cause significant variability in these relative contributions overall we found that routine agricultural practices to optimize crop growth especially during paddy growth periods was a more important factor than hydro meteorological conditions in controlling the regime and properties of water sources the relatively simple but successful application of emma and dtmm in a complex environment demonstrates that it is a valuable approach for understanding water sources and hydrologic processes concerning agricultural or mixed land use catchments keywords agricultural catchment end member mixing model critical zone observatory water sources 1 introduction information about the sources and flow pathways that generate streamflow is essential for understanding hydrologic and biogeochemical processes especially in cultivated catchments this further relates to characterizing contaminant transport of non point source agricultural pollution jin et al 1999 birkel et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 mixing models using isotopic and chemical tracers as a hydrograph separation technique have been widely and successfully used to trace streamflow sources and flow paths at the catchment scale they have provided new insights into hydrological processes with respect to time variable water sources and dominant flow pathways in catchment hydrology e g liu et al 2008 2013 munyaneza et al 2012 these hydrograph separation techniques assume conservative mixing and require specific definitions of the endmembers however considerable uncertainties remain due to the spatial and temporal variability in end member chemistry composition soulsby et al 2003 schmieder et al 2016 in agricultural catchments this is further complicated by human activities durand and torres 1996 soulsby et al 2003 for example soil tillage and the application of fertilizers and pesticides can remove the chemical gradients in catchment soils which in turn affect the original chemical properties of different hydrological sources as such most of the chemical or isotopic hydrograph separation studies have been carried out in semi natural eco systems these include forested catchments scholl et al 2015 klaus et al 2015 mountain regions hugenschmidt et al 2014 rahman et al 2015 and other semi natural ecosystems such as in arctic river basins blaen et al 2014 and glaciated regions wu et al 2016 wilson et al 2016 relatively few of these studies concern agricultural or mixed landuse catchments exner kittridge et al 2016 tweed et al 2016 yet in order to minimize agricultural pollution and manage water resources efficiently knowledge on the sources and pathways of water that contributes to the stream is of crucial importance in non irrigated agricultural catchments precipitation ground water and riparian zone water are generally assumed to be the major contributors to stream flow generation hyer et al 2001 however where rain fed and irrigated fields co exist understanding the relative contribution of irrigation water with respect to the other potential sources in agricultural catchments is required unal et al 2004 in particular for subtropical rural irrigated environments a lack of data has contributed to a limited understanding of the time variable contributions of rainwater and irrigation water to streamflow generation for example in subtropical china paddy field irrigation is common yet the influence of different irrigation phases to streamflow generation is poorly understood previous studies focused only on specific storm events when the migration of substances is most active hugenschmidt et al 2014 farrick and branfireun 2015 however such specific focus studies are known to bias the physical interpretation of contributing end members james and roulet 2006 a study on streamflow generation in a 19 8 ha agricultural catchment previously showed significant differences in hydrologic flow paths and sources between non stormflow periods and stormflow periods pionke and dewalle 1994 i dewalle and pionke 1994 ii at the seasonal to annual timescale the geochemical character of particular water sources can vary significantly due to different pathways providing distinct opportunities for interaction of the water with soil and bedrock yang et al 2009 in addition fractal behavior may occur across time scales and affect long term observations of streamflow chemistry kirchner et al 2000 hence it is essential to understand the validity and applicability mixing models in different environments here we aimed to gain new insights into the spatiotemporal variability of streamflow generation in a mixed subtropical agricultural catchment we focused on a region within the poyang lake drainage area in subtropical china where common agricultural areas typically consist of small patches of uplands mixed with paddy fields streamflow is composed of overland flow irrigation water and soil water zhang et al 2011 but the temporal variability in the relative contributions is largely unknown the specific objectives of this study were a to explore the chemical characteristics of the key potential water sources of streamflow including rainfall irrigation water and ground water and b to quantify their relative contribution to streamflow under different hydrological conditions throughout the year 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this work was carried out in the sunjia experimental research catchment 50 5 ha located in the headwater region of poyang lake near yingtan jiangxi province in south eastern china fig 1 the humid subtropical climate is characterized by hot summers up to 40 c and mild winters 5 1 c the mean annual temperature is 17 8 c mean annual potential evapotranspiration is 1200 mm while mean annual precipitation totals 1800 mm of which half occurs between march and june the catchment elevation ranges from 34 to 55 m and slopes are around 5 to 8 the geology in the study region consists of cretaceous sandstone and deeply weathered quaternary red clay clay mineralogy is dominated by kaolinite with some hydro mica and vermiculite as a result of the weathering of feldspar and other silicate minerals this weathering may cause higher cationic concentrations e g ca2 mg2 in ground water than in rainwater and irrigation water desilicating and ferrallitic weathering in this subtropical environment is liable to remove si4 resulting in si depleted minerals soils in this region are red soils which are derived from the cretaceous sandstone and quaternary red clay and are classified as ultisols based on the usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2010 these soils are strongly acidic with ph h2o varying from 4 5 to 6 0 they are also rich in sesquioxides with an iron oxides content of about 20 60 g kg 1 in the soils the dominant agricultural land uses during the observation period were rain fed upland peanut arachis hypogaea 39 and double rice oriza sativa in the terraced irrigated paddy fields 25 other land uses in the upland areas included mandarin orange citrus reticulate tree 6 an agroforestry system consisting of peanut intercropped with mandarin orange citrus reticulate tree 8 grape vitis vinifera orchard 10 and other forested land 6 the remaining land 6 was occupied by ponds and residential use irrigation water to supply the paddy fields originates from the luxi river it enters the catchment through two inlet weirs channels fig 1 stream flow exhibits strong seasonality reflecting patterns in both precipitation and irrigation practices high flow coincide with the irrigation period and the rainy season while ephemeral drying up occurs after irrigation stopped in october during the dry season tang et al 2007 2008 2 2 field monitoring and sample collection we collected hydrometric data and water samples for chemical analyses between january and december 2015 rainfall was recorded by an automatic tipping bucket resolution 0 5 mm connected to an event data logger onset computer corporation usa installed near the foot of the peanut hillslope fig 1 rainfall samples were collected 24 times during the study year just before times which coincided with stream water sampling all water samples were stored in the refrigerator prior to analysis four weirs were installed to measure irrigation inflows no 1 and no 2 and stream outflows no 3 and no 4 within the sunjia catchment fig 1 two different types of weirs a rectangular and sharp crested weirs were installed at the inlet no 1 and at the other stream flow stations no 2 no 3 and no 4 respectively the no 3 weir was installed at the outlet of the irrigation channel to another catchment water level was measured with a hobo data logger onset computer corporation usa and recorded at 30 min intervals the recorded water levels were then converted to flow by adopting theoretical rating equations for the specific weirs for the sharp crested weirs at no 2 no 3 and no 4 this also involved additional gauging data the total irrigation flow into the catchment was calculated as the sum of inflow at no 1 and no 2 weirs minus the irrigation outflow at no 3 weir there was no additional water source for the irrigation channel between the weirs at sites no 1 and no 3 the weir at no 4 was located at the primary outflow channel of the catchment shallow ground water samples were collected monthly from three wells across the catchment see fig 1 wells 1 and 2 were used by local farmers for drinking water and used for water sampling only at observation well 3 ground water table was also monitored by a hobo water level data logger at 30 min intervals onset computer corporation usa irrigation water at the inlet stream water at the outlet and spring water that seeps from the soil at the foot of the hillslope fig 1 were collected every fortnight 2 3 laboratory sample analysis the rainfall irrigation spring well and stream water samples were analyzed for major cations ca2 mg2 na si4 and anions cl so4 2 using a dionex ics1100 ion chromatograph ic analytical precision 1σ standard deviation for all ions was less than 1 and the detection limit was less than 0 1 mg l 1 electricity conductivity ec and the ph of water samples were also measured δd and δ18o analyses were conducted by a liquid water isotope analyzer model 908 0008 los gatos research inc and results were expressed relative to vsmow in permil following eq 1 1 δ r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where the r values represent the ratio of d to h or 18o to 16o atoms for the sample and the vsmow standard the precision of the δd and δ18o measurements was 0 2 and 0 1 respectively 2 4 end member mixing analysis emma and diagnostic tools of mixing models dtmm the tracer based emma in combination with the dtmm was used to determine the contributions of endmembers to streamflow dtmm developed by hooper 2003 is used to identify conservative tracers and determine the number of the endmembers based on streamflow chemistry the diagnostic tools examine the appropriate rank of the streamflow chemistry data through a principal component analysis pca and determine the data dimensions in a euclidean u space according to hooper 2003 conservative mixing of end members with distinct chemical signatures is a linear process while solute correlations are controlled by chemical equilibria that are represented by higher order polynomials the number of u space dimensions for the linear expressions of conservative solutes is one less than the number of end members needed for the mixing emma was then applied to dtmm determined conservative tracers and identified endmembers and to quantify their contributions to streamflow pca was performed again to extract eigenvectors by using a correlation matrix of conservative tracers that were determined using dtmm the pca scores were used to solve for endmember contributions a procedure mathematically the same as using two tracers for a three component mixing model liu et al 2013 in addition the eligibility of end members was evaluated using distance between original chemical compositions and u space orthogonal projections of end members following eqs 2 and 3 2 d i b i b i 3 b i b i v t v v t 1 v where di means the euclidean distance of end member b for tracer i between the original composition bi and u space projection bi bi was calculated by using eq 3 based on the eigenvector v which was extracted from the conservative tracers in this study the distance was expressed as percentage by dividing distance by the original chemical composition the shorter the distance the better fit of an end member to emma liu et al 2008 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatological conditions the study site received 2432 mm of rainfall during the 2015 study year this was significantly above the annual mean of 1795 mm as calculated from 46 years of climatology data from the yingtan weather station 1954 1999 the highest monthly rainfall was recorded in june 569 mm followed by may 391 mm while the lowest was recorded in january 46 mm approximately 55 of the 2015 annual rainfall occurred between march and june wet period fig 2 the annual potential evapotranspiration was 1251 mm in 2015 close to the annual mean of 1229 mm the mean daily ground water table level fluctuated between 3 46 and 0 91 m below the surface fig 2 shows that the ground water level responded quickly to precipitation except for the rainfall event on 6 august which could be related to soil dryness during the wet season delays in ground water level responses were less than 24 h since the timing of maximum rainfall intensity for example following the largest storm event 101 4 mm june 18 this delay was 16 h the total irrigation water that entered the sunjia catchment was 4625 mm which accounted for 65 of the total catchment input irrigation was rather continuous from mid march to mid october while the other part of the year showed an intermittent irrigation pattern fig 2 this is consistent with the timing of the rice plant growing season and tillage practices the irrigation water flow was noticeable higher than streamflow during late april this period was dry and coincided with rice planting hence most irrigation water contributed to the paddy fields instead of streamflow nevertheless most of the time the temporal dynamics in streamflow at the catchment outlet closely resembled the irrigation water fluxes fig 2 the annual total stream outflow was 5141 mm approximately twice the annual rainfall this resulted in a clear masking effect over catchment rainfall runoff relations in sunjia fig 2b however during the wet season and during larger events in the dry season the response in streamflow appeared to be mainly controlled by precipitation dynamics fig 2b the highest flows were recorded during may and june 3 2 water isotope dynamics δ18o in rainfall varied between 11 81 and 1 07 5 70 weighted mean it was most enriched between january and july and more depleted in the latter half of year fig 3 the streamflow δ18o signature varied from 6 66 to 4 88 mean 5 89 following the pattern in rainfall exhibited a more or less stable level of 5 45 from january to may which then depleted from 5 21 to 6 48 in june and sat around a mean of 6 25 from july to december fig 4 shows that the lmwl r2 0 97 for 2015 lies close to the gmwl with a similar slope 8 1 the lel constructed from biweekly stream samples r2 0 93 has a slightly higher slope 9 0 which indicates that there was no strong evaporative enrichment of stream water the temporal dynamics of δ18o in irrigation water closely followed those in streamflow fig 3 however from august to december the mean δ18o of irrigation water was more depleted than that of stream water 6 18 vs 5 89 respectively there was spatial variability in the ground water δ18o signatures fig 3 in time these differences were consistent and all of well data plotted near to the lmwl so that none exhibited strong evaporative fractionation effects fig 4 the mean spring δ18o 5 83 and the mean ground water at w1 5 88 were also very similar to the mean rainfall value 5 86 which suggests that rainfall might be the main source for ground water recharge 3 3 patterns in water chemistry when evaluating the full dataset water chemistry was significantly different p 0 05 among the different water sources within the agricultural catchment table 1 overall concentrations of all chemical components in rainwater were lowest apart from so4 2 this reflects the acidic nature of the precipitation is further revealed by its relatively low ph 5 10 apart from cl and mg2 ionic concentrations of stream water were lower than those of irrigation water table 1 fig 5 the ionic concentrations in ground water were higher than in stream water except for si4 and so4 2 table 1 fig 5 the mean ionic concentrations in ground water wells varied significantly in space for example na was 0 62 mg l 1 in the ground water w3 and 6 48 mg l 1 in the ground water w2 table 1 the annual variation of ionic concentrations in stream water was evidently associated with the patterns of irrigation water while the variability of ionic concentrations in ground water was relatively stable in time fig 5 higher flows were associated with lower concentrations and vice versa fig 5 3 4 hydrograph separation by three endmember mixing model a three endmember hydrograph separation was conducted using emma before this dtmm was used to identify conservative tracers and to determine the number of water sources the distributions of residuals between measured and projected values over the measured ionic concentrations in 1 d and 2 d fig 6 indicated that levels of mg2 na si4 cl and ec r2 0 2 and p 0 03 in the stream water were mainly the result of conservatively mixing of at least three endmembers tracers were considered acceptable to use for hydrograph separation if streamflow samples were bounded by potential water sources as shown in fig 7 a exploring a total of 15 mixing diagrams combining paired conservative tracers of ec mg2 na si4 cl and δ18o we found that all of these tracers except δ18o could be used for hydrograph separation even though traditionally considered a conservative tracer mixing diagrams of δ18o with chemical tracers could not be well defined with potential end members e g fig 7b this might reflect the effects caused by evaporative enrichment of water standing in paddy fields for prolonged times as such the ec mg2 na si4 and cl were used as tracers to develop the emma model most streamflow samples plotted within the triangle between irrigation water rainwater and ground water as water sources on u space fig 8 the first two pca components explained 82 of the total variance of the streamflow data suggesting that three end members appeared to be acceptable in this small agricultural catchment according to liu et al 2004 2008 endmembers with a spatial distance between original compositions and u space orthogonal projections of less than 50 60 for all tracers would be acceptable for emma this excludes rainfall which exhibits relatively low ionic concentrations the first two endmembers were rainwater and irrigation water table 2 the ground water samples from w1and w2 as well as the mean of all three wells ground water m were all appropriate as the third endmember to emma assuming that the different sources of ground water are interconnected at the small scale of our research area ground water m was chosen as the third endmember to quantify the contribution of three water sources in addition to the five tracer emma model na and cl were used to develop an additional two tracer emma model for the quantification of the three end member contributions these two were chosen as they showed the highest p values for the residual distributions the end member contributions were different for the five tracer versus two tracer emma models fig 9 according to the five tracer emma model irrigation water rainwater and ground water m contributed 64 19 and 17 on average respectively in comparison to 53 21 and 26 for the two tracer model however the temporal pattern of end member contributions was nearly identical for the two model results r2 0 79 0 91 consistent with temporal rainfall patterns the relative contribution from rainwater was greater during the wet season 38 from may 10 to june 30 and the latter part of the dry season when irrigation ceased 41 from nov 13 to jan 23 after the wet season the seasonal drought occurred hence the relative contribution from rainwater rapidly decreased between events the ground water contribution increased and was proportionally higher during the dry than the wet season out of the three endmembers the contribution of irrigation water was largest it showed an opposite temporal pattern to rainfall with a relatively low proportion in the wet season and a contribution of more than 90 of total discharge from august to october the hydrometric and chemical data at the catchment outlet suggest four phases in the sources of runoff generation which can be characterized by patterns in rainfall and irrigation practices fig 9 table 3 they are briefly described below 3 4 1 phase i 1st jan 19th feb during this phase hillslope croplands and paddy fields were fallow irrigation water was intermittently led into the catchment but not all of this contributed to streamflow rainfall was also low 2 7 of annual rainfall but ground water levels remained relative stable 3 40 m below the surface discharge was low but compared to other times of the year the proportion of ground water was relatively high this was evident from the high ionic concentrations in stream water fig 5 resulting from the release of solutes from the ground water 3 4 2 phase ii 20th feb 30th jun this phase represents the rainy season with 1466 mm rainfall and a strong increase in streamflow the contribution of rainfall to streamflow increased 23 irrigation water totals were significantly greater than streamflow in april because it was mainly used for paddy field puddling during early rice growth high proportional rainfall and irrigation water contributions then diluted solute concentrations in the stream 3 4 3 phase iii 1st jul 7th oct this phase is characterized as the dry season due to low rainfall but high air temperature irrigation waterwas high to meet the demand for late rice growth it also contributed to most of streamflow 81 the ground water table dropped and its contribution to streamflow decreased 11 nevertheless solutes concentrations in the stream increased mainly because of the lack of dilution via rainfall 3 4 4 phase iv 8th oct 31st dec similar to phase i streamflow responded to irrigation and rainfall inputs irrigation water fluctuated randomly and stopped completely on 10thdec after the rice harvest all irrigation water directly flowed through channel to catchment outlet after rice harvest ground water levels rose to increases in rainfall resulting in an increasing contribution to steamflow rainfall contribution increased up to 31 due as a result of smaller irrigation water contributions 3 5 evaluation of emma based hydrograph separation the two tracer and five tracer emma predicted streamflow geochemical properties were compared against the field data in fig 10 the goodness of prediction was evaluated by comparing regression lines to the 1 1 line y x the two tracer model predicted the concentrations of mg2 na si4 and cl quite well with slopes 0 87 1 and r2 from 0 51 to 0 99 however the predictions of ec and ca2 were poor with r2 of only 0 29 and 0 08 respectively therefore the two tracer model was not considered successful in contrast the five tracer model was reasonably successful with slopes ranging from 0 96 to 1 18 and r2 from 0 56 to 0 93 respectively ca2 did not behave completely conservatively fig 6 with slope 1 18 and r2 of 0 40 the re creation of streamflow chemistry enhanced the confidence of the results of emma and the associated hydrograph separation 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of emma results we used dtmm and emma analyses for hydrograph separation in a mixed agricultural catchment with rain fed hillslopes 39 and irrigated paddy fields 25 streamflow sources were separated into irrigation water rainwater and ground water of which the first was most dominant ground water contributed to 17 of the annual total streamflow with a peak of 30 in the dry period this is much lower than previously reported for other environments for instance in a 66 ha austrian agricultural headwater catchment with deep fractured siltstone developing exner kittridge et al 2016 suggested that ground water contributed up to 39 to stream water for snow rain transition forested catchments liu et al 2013 even reported ground water relative contributions greater than 60 which formed by rapid infiltration of snowmelt and rainwater to soil bedrock interface through preferential pathways our results showed that spring water which represents subsurface lateral flow from the hillslopes was not a significant contributor nevertheless for specific storm events that may not have been captured during the routine monitoring of this study zhang et al 2011 previously reported that subsurface lateral flow contributed 5 7 7 3 to streamflow for the same study catchment the identification of end members for the sunjia agricultural catchment and the numerical solutions for emma were quantitatively evaluated by recreating streamflow chemistry using the results of relative contributions of five tracer emma and ionic concentrations of end members fig 10 following liu et al 2004 most tracers were simulated well the relatively poor simulation of ca2 could be related to artificial lime applications in an attempt to reduce the acidity of the red soils hence ca2 may not be considered a conservative tracer in the catchment fig 6 4 2 does emma with dtmm aid in understanding water sources in subtropical mixed agricultural catchments to our knowledge this study represents one of the first that reported estimates of stream water sources using dtmm and emma in a subtropical mixed agricultural catchment we were able to identify the key sources and the temporal variability in their contribution to streamflow as such we gained new insights into the dominant hydrological processes throughout different times of the year in a complex agricultural system however the mixing model which we used to separate the relative contributions of the different potential endmembers is simply based on two water and geochemical tracer mass balance equations ladouche et al 2001 barthold et al 2011 furthermore it depends on two strong assumptions including that tracers are conservative and that the number of end members is known however which tracers are appropriate and conservative as well as the number of endmembers are commonly unknown a priori subjectively determining the number of end members and conservative tracers is imprudent to construct the mixing models here the conservative tracers and the number of endmembers were therefore identified using dtmm and emma however to further improve the identification of stream end members and our understanding of the dominant hydrological processes in catchment a more comprehensive field hydrometric monitoring strategy would be needed with a finer scale temporal and spatial resolution isotopes of δd and δ18o are considered to be among the best conservative tracer available for hydrograph separation lyon et al 2009 jefferson et al 2015 however they presented quite different results from the geochemical tracers this can be related to high evaporation rates in our study area in addition to δd and δ18o the most commonly applied tracers in hydrograph separation studies are geochemical tracers such as ec si4 ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 and others iwagami et al 2010 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 2013 yet geochemical tracers in some regions may not behave conservatively due to interactions with mineral material and constituents on their route to the stream for these reasons rice and hornberger 1998 for example found large differences in estimated component amounts when for a range of different tracers they also agreed with nolan and hill 1990 who indicated that different tracers may cause great bias if they were chosen subjectively due to the heterogeneity among catchment and the complexity of hydraulic processes in our catchment ca2 and so4 2 were found to not to behave conservative this is different for other areas for example in seasonally snow covered forested catchments liu et al 2008 hence additional validation with more conventional tracers is usually needed and during a range of hydrologic and climatic conditions pellerin et al 2008 dtmm as applied here is an ideal tool to objectively choose the conservative tracers and determine the number of end members using emma analyses in conjunction with dtmm to separate water sources and flow pathways is a common practice frisbee et al 2011 liu et al 2013 yevenes and mannaerts 2012 however emma is not always suitable for catchments where rainfall contribution to streamflow is important because rainwater chemistry can be highly variable in our agricultural catchment the stream water concentrations were often several orders of magnitude higher than rainwater concentrations hence variations of rainwater chemistry would not have significantly affected the results of the mixing model durand and torres 1996 on the contrary for our agricultural study catchment the chemistry of irrigation and ground water was found to be highly variable both in time and space table 1 fig 5 this may be related to the mixed land uses slope cropland and paddy areas but mainly to fertilizer and pesticide additions throughout the year nevertheless the variations of potential end members have been known during the whole period which conforms to the assumptions of emma in addition to routine agricultural activities uncontrolled irrigation practices add complexity to understanding of regional dominant hydrological process because irrigation and drainage of paddy terrace fields are strongly interlinked it was complicated to estimate the amount of irrigation water which directly contributed to streamflow we found that the streamflow chemistry was close to irrigation water and therefore markedly different from non irrigation catchments frisbee et al 2011 however we also demonstrated that this did not influence the application of dtmm and emma our study therefore indicated the potential utility in applying dtmm and emma in mixed agricultural catchments such as those in subtropical china 4 3 uncertainties in hydrograph separation high spatial and temporal variability in chemical composition of tracers and endmembers can contribute to significant uncertainty in hydrograph separation schmieder et al 2016 as such the specific tracers used in the emma can play a critical role in the results of the hydrograph separation barthold et al 2011 for example δ18o was used as a tracer in many studies zhao et al 2013 but we found it to be not suitable in our catchment fig 7b which could be a consequence of high evaporation rates in the paddy fields in addition ca2 was detected as not conservative because it is a component of that lime which is usually applied to acidic soils another source of uncertainty in hydrograph separation studies is the number of tracers used we found a noticeable difference between hydrograph separations based on two vs five tracers fig 9 comparisons between simulated and observed streamflow chemistry indicated that the five tracer emma was better than the two tracer one fig 10 the optimum number of tracers can vary between catchments though for example liu et al 2008 indicated that a five tracer model was not more successful for than a two component hydrograph separation in a forested catchment nevertheless in emma models the choice of endmembers results in a bias here we found that ground water from either w1 or w2 could both be identified as the third endmember according to the mixing diagram fig 8 and spatial distances table 2 however when we set the ground water sampled from either w1 or w2 as the third endmember the difference between their contributions to streamflow reached up to 6 their temporal patterns were nearly identical though this result is inconsistent with liu et al 2008 who observed that the spatial variation in ground water flow did not cause a significant error in emma because the chemical composition in ground water flow showed a significant difference from other water source another source of uncertainty could include the temporal variability of solute concentrations in irrigation water an emma test was performed by the temporal specific chemical compositions in irrigation water instead of their mean as mentioned above however the emma results data not shown here from using constant vs varying values for irrigation water were almost identical with r2 0 87 n 24 p 0 001 between these two approaches differences in contributions of irrigation water and ground water to streamflow were less than 1 this can be explained by the overall large differences between the chemical compositions of irrigation water on the one hand and those of rainwater and ground water on the other table 1 5 conclusions for complex agricultural catchments with rain fed uplands and leveled irrigated paddy fields in subtropical china we showed that streamflow is predominantly controlled by irrigation practices even when irrigated paddy fields represent only a small proportion of the total drainage area we applied emma mixing analyses using a range of geochemical tracers of source and stream water in addition to irrigation watrer being the dominant source we found that rainwater and ground water were the two other major contributors to streamflow the relative contributions of each source varied significantly with temporal patterns in irrigation practices and rainfall results suggested that irrigation flow contributed near to or more than 90 of streamflow during the dry autumn when second season paddy is in process of drying for harvest this was significantly lower in june less than 40 when streamflow and rainfall were high and ground water levels were shallow temporal variation in the geochemistry of irrigation did not cause a significant bias in the emma analyses results but the spatial variation of ground water geochemistry did even though the approach was relatively simple the successful application of emma combined with dtmm suggests that the coupled approach is an effective tool to gain insights into the origin of stream water in highly complex

11497,continuous irrigation ci is a newly developed irrigation technique that utilizes semipermeable membrane to release water into the plant root zone slowly and continuously in order to investigate the effects of ci on plant gas exchange and water use efficiency wue compared to conventional intermittent irrigation ii under different soil water conditions a field experiment was conducted on tomato plants during two growing seasons in the arid region of northwestern china gas exchange parameters were measured during fruit enlargement stage which showed that the net photosynthesis rate of tomato leaf was similar between ci and ii while the stomatal conductance was significantly higher under ci for most measurements resulting in significantly lower intrinsic wue under ci compared to ii however the non stomatal limitations and lower vapor pressure deficit leaf to air caused significantly lower transpiration rate under ci leading to slightly higher instantaneous wue compared to ii consequently the total water consumption was reduced by ci moreover ci also had significantly greater yield than ii and therefore ci improved wue at both leaf and yield levels compared to ii ci can be

al 2013 xue et al 2013a zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 or numerical simulation xue et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 showed that volume and flow rate of irrigation water under ci are proportional to the water head between inside and outside of the irrigation tapes compared to conventional drip irrigation methods soil moisture distribution is more uniform within the wetting body under ci moreover the ratio of length to width of the wetting body is close to one thus water movement is mainly driven by water head and soil suction but not by gravity the different soil wetting pattern under ci can

1996 sebastian et al 2016 when plants uptake extra water due to the increase in soil water content swc after precipitation or irrigation events plant leaf transpiration rate tr is elevated under ci there is less fluctuation in soil moisture due to the continuous low flow rate released by the spm this means that the water logging that commonly occurs under ii can be avoided many studies have found that ci using spm increased crop yield saved irrigation water and increased wue compared to intermittent irrigation ii he et al 2012 li et al 2007 tang et al 2014 xue et al 2013b zhang et al 2013 xue et al 2013b measured diurnal variations of leaf pn tr and gs under ci and ii with similar irrigation volume during the vegetative growth stage of tomato plants in a greenhouse and found higher wue at leaf level under ci however the mechanisms for the increased wue under ci still remain unclear therefore the aim of this study is to investigate whether ci improves wue at leaf level by increasing stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis rate pn while decreasing tr and whether it also improves the wue at yield level by reducing plant water consumption and increasing the yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and plant conditions a field experiment was conducted at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university from april to september 2014 and 2015 the experimental station is located in wuwei city gansu province of northwestern china with typical inland arid desert climate 37 52 n 102 51 e at an altitude of 1851 m the precipitation is approximately 164 mm yr with pan evaporation of 2000 mm yr mean sunshine duration of 3000 h mean annual temperature of 8 8 c and a frost free period of over 150 d the groundwater table is below 30 m the soil texture was sandy loam with organic matter content of 0 68 0 80 field water capacity of 0 294 cm3 cm3 measured with the method by wilcox 1965 wilting point of 0 100 cm3 cm3 and bulk density of 1 46 1 61 g cm3 a typical local variety of processing tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill shijihongguan was used in the experiment the effective precipitation during the two growing seasons were 117 2 mm and 86 40 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively the cumulative reference evapotranspiration et0 during the two growing seasons were 409 49 mm and 486 80 mm respectively before transplanting the soil was plowed by a rotary cultivator to a depth of 40 cm and fertilizers were uniformly spread throughout the soil within this layer the quantity of n p and k were 186 7 169 0 and 103 8 kg ha in the form of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate urea and potassium phosphate tomato plants were transplanted into the field with plastic film mulch at the fifth leaf stage on 11th may 2014 and 5th may 2015 after transplanting all treatments were irrigated sufficiently for plant growth the plant density was six plants per m2 for all the field plots all the other field managements such as weed control and pesticide were same to the local managements 2 2 experimental treatments treatments included two irrigation methods ci and ii irrigation water for ci was stored in a tank with a diameter of 1 0 m and a volume of 0 8 m3 per plot the tank had a scale to record water level variation which was converted to daily irrigation volume there were two irrigation volume treatments under ci controlled by a relatively low water head of 130 240 cm and a relatively high water head of 210 320 cm abbreviated as c1 and c2 in 2014 cl and ch in 2015 respectively under ii plants were irrigated periodically when ci treatments refilled their tanks with exact the same volume of irrigation water giving i1 and i2 in 2014 and il irrigated every 5 8 d on average and ih irrigated every 4 1 d on average in 2014 average irrigation water heads of ci treatments are shown in table 3 for ci irrigation tapes with semipermeable membrane shenzhen moistube irrigation co ltd china were used while conventional subsurface drip irrigation sdi tapes dayu irrigation co ltd china were used in ii treatments the parameters of the two irrigation tapes are shown in table 2 since the flow rate of ci is proportional to water head the flow rate was controlled by water head the spm is made into tape shaped lateral providing uniform linear source irrigation by microporous inner layer with a density of micropores higher than 105 cm2 and a diameter ranging from 10 nm to 900 nm schematic of experimental plots are depicted in fig 2 there were three replicates per treatment each separated by impermeable membrane buried vertically to a depth of 1 0 m each plot had 6 rows of tomato row spacing and interplant spacings were 0 50 m and 0 35 m respectively with a spm tape or sdi tape underneath each line the plot areas were 36 25 m2 and 49 50 m2 in 2014 and 2015 respectively 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 climate data soil water content reference evapotranspiration and crop water consumption in both growing seasons climate data were recorded every 15 mins by a weather station weather hawk campbell scientific usa located in the experimental site et0 was estimated by penman monteith equation allen 2012 volumetric soil water content swc was measured using a diviner 2000 probe sentek pty ltd australia in each field plot the measurement was taken with 10 cm interval to 100 cm depth fao 56 allen 2012 suggests kc of tomato plants without any stress is around 1 05 therefore kc was determined for each treatment and showed that in 2015 ch and ih were under sufficient irrigation while cl and il insufficient in 2014 i2 was relatively sufficiently irrigated while the rest of the treatments were insufficient to different extent table 3 actual crop water consumption within the growing seasons was estimated by soil water balance method 1 e t p i d s where et is the actual crop water consumption mm p is effective precipitation mm defined as precipitation above 5 mm within a single rain event calculated as actual precipitation deducted by 5 mm i is the depth of applied irrigation water mm d is deep percolation or drainage below the root zone mm and s is soil water depletion the swc at and below 60 cm deep remained relatively stable indicating no deep percolation during the experimental period 2 3 2 gas exchange parameters in 2015 leaf gas exchange parameters including pn tr gs intercellular co2 concentration ci and leaf to air vapor pressure deficit vpdl of tomato plants were measured by a portable photosynthesis measurement system model li 6400xt li cor corporation usa five leaves in each replicate plot were measured between 10 30 am and 12 30 pm for 6 d in a row at fruit enlargement stage 63 68 days after treatment dat during which period il was irrigated once at 7 30 9 30 pm on 64 dat and ih was irrigated twice at 7 30 9 30 pm on 64 and 68 dat stomatal limitation ls is defined as follows miao et al 2015 2 l s 1 c i c a where ca stands for air co2 concentration 2 3 3 yield and water use efficiency tomatoes were harvested from 7th to 21st august in 2014 and from 1st august to 2nd september in 2015 each fruit was weighed by an electronic balance with a precision of 0 01 g the commercial fruit weights tomato weight 60 g per m2 were converted into yield since the wuewp is wueet divided by et0 it is crop harvestable yield divided by a ratio of et to et0 hereafter term the ratio relative et mathematically the same as kc which is abbreviated as etr 2 4 data analysis data were analyzed by independent samples t test and general linear model using spss version 20 0 spss inc usa at a significance level of 5 correlation and regression analysis including linear fitting and piecewise linear fitting were performed using origin version 2016 originlab corporation usa 3 results 3 1 irrigation volume and daily water consumption the average daily water consumption throughout the whole growing season was significantly affected by irrigation methods and volumes in 2015 general linear model table 4 the water consumption in ci was 6 73 7 51 lower than those in ii treatments in 2014 and 4 05 6 46 lower in 2015 plants under c1 and cl consumed 33 89 and 15 24 less water compared to plants under c2 and ch respectively as for ii i1 and il had 34 46 and 13 27 lower water consumption than i2 and ih respectively 3 2 gas exchange with the same amount of irrigation volume pn was similar between il and cl or between ih and ch treatments on average tr was significantly higher under il than cl ls was significantly higher under il than cl and similarly it was also significantly higher in ih than ch vpdl under cl was significantly lower compared to il and ch the averaged swc were significantly lower under cl and il than il and ih respectively fig 3 the gs was significantly and negatively correlated with vpdl fig 4 with higher correlation coefficients under ii indicating stronger stomatal adjusting effects from the vpdl under ii tr was significantly correlated with vpdl only under ci fig 5 and was significantly correlated with gs only under ii fig 6 which indicates stomatal limitation 3 3 yield and water use efficiency in 2015 under intermittent irrigation with mild water deficit il the average fruit weight number of fruits per plant and fruit yield were 9 3 14 0 and 21 0 significantly lower compared to cl and were 18 0 24 8 and 24 7 significantly lower compared to ih table 4 nevertheless they were not significantly affected between cl and ch however in 2014 there was no significant difference between c1 and i1 or c2 and i2 whereas the fruit yield were significantly higher under c2 and i2 than c1 and i1 respectively this suggests with water defict to some certain extent ci could not bring advantages on tomato yield over ii anymore higher wueins but lower wuein at leaf level were found under ci in 2015 fig 7 under ci with mild water deficit cl the wueins was 21 6 and 12 7 higher than under ch and il respectively while wueins under il was 8 2 higher compared to ih the wuei and wueet at yield level under cl were 36 0 and 12 3 higher than under ch and they were 26 3 and 33 5 higher than under il general linear model using spss showed tomato yield and number of fruit per plant were significantly affected by irrigation volume in both years wueet and average fruit weight were significantly affected by irrigation method in 2015 under ci both tomato yield and wueet had significant quadratic relationships with etr in both growing seasons fig 8 it is noteworthy that the etr where the maximum yield and wuewp reached were close for ii there were no apparent relationships between yield wuewp and etr 4 discussion the averaged swc in the root zone was similar between ci and ii however in 2015 the fluctuation of swc within an irrigation cycle of ii differed between ci and ii where the average differences of swc under cl and ch were 36 8 and 26 5 lower than il and ih respectively data not shown meaning a relatively stable soil water supply under ci compared to ii the different soil wetting patterns resulted in decreased leaf tr and thus lower water consumption ii caused fluctuations of soil moisture after irrigation events and this improved tomato leaf tr comparative studies have demonstrated that soil water deficit causes a reduction of gs farquhar et al 1989 lanari et al 2014 rawson et al 1977 schulze 1986 even in the absence of leaf water deficit holbrook et al 2002 kaiser 1987 leading to a decrease in tr however pn will be more strongly affected by the reduced gs under water deficit as pn can be influenced not only by the reduction of gs directly but also by the reduced ci which is due to the increase of leaf temperature aroused by low tr bierhuizen et al 1969 boyer 1970 farquhar et al 1989 lanari et al 2014 in this study under ci the gs and ci were higher but tr was lower and pn was not significantly different from that in ii treatments indicating that there were some other factors rather than soil water deficit causing the lower tr in the ci treatments the ci ca of c3 plant is normally 0 7 when without any stress farquhar et al 1989 correspondingly the ls of tomato leaf without stress should be 0 3 at the fruit enlargement stage in 2015 the average leaf ls under il and ih were 0 31 suggesting that water stress and stomatal limitation might have occurred under ii affecting leaf photosynthesis while the ls under cl and ch were 0 26 and 0 28 respectively indicating that the water stress and stomatal limitation under ci might not exist since the sensitivity of gs to vpdl usually increases with water stress rawson et al 1977 and the linear correlation between gs and vpdl under ii was stronger fig 4 it is deductible that ii was more evident to have developed water stress in this study tr was not correlated with gs under ci while it had a significant positive linear correlation with gs when gs 0 52 fig 4 suggesting that gs was a dominate factor regulating tr under ii but not under ci these results demonstrated again that the lower tr under ci was caused by non stomatal limitation factors such as low mesophyll conductivity farquhar et al 1982 li et al 2013 medrano et al 2002 tomas et al 2014a low leaf water content warren 2008 or environmental factors affecting vpdl bunce 1997 when available soil water is sufficient the process of water moving into plants is mainly limited by root conductance north and nobel 1996 under water deficit plant root senses water deficit and produces abscisic acid aba as a drought signal which decreases leaf gs and increases root conductance thompson et al 2007 to regulate plant growth cornic and massacci 1996 davies and zhang 1991 as discussed above ii treatments caused water deficit and the root to shoot chemical signals could have contributed to the reduced gs and thus lower tr vpdl is one of the driving forces for water movement from leaf stomata to the air meinzer and grantz 1990 and affects leaf tr gilbert et al 2011 oren et al 1999 it is known that tr usually increases with increasing vpdl until a certain level then it starts to decrease due to the lowering gs at high vpdl bunce 1997 in this study the vpdl was generally lower under ci correspondingly the tr was mainly in the increasing stage whereas under ii treatments the tr reached the decreasing stage when vpdl 3 12 together with the significantly lower gs compared to ci caused by the stomatal limitation therefore the lower tr under ci could also be attributed to the lower vpdl compared to ii the number of fruits and fruit size of tomato are affected by water stress during different growing stages nangare et al 2016 when water stress exists throughout the entire growing season or the reproductive growth period fruit setting and ripening stages the yield can be significantly decreased due to the drop in fruit weight and number of fruits chen et al 2014 patanè et al 2011 qiu et al 2013 yang et al 2012 in this study the water stress under ii with mild water deficit in 2015 decreased the fruit weight significantly compared to that under ci as the fruit weight was significantly lower under il than cl the number of marketable fruits was significantly lower in il than in ih resulting in the significantly lowest marketable yield among all the treatments tomato yield under ci was significantly higher compared to ii which is in accordance with xue et al 2013b as the water deficit became stronger in 2014 both ci and ii reduced marketable yield therefore the yield improvement under ci can be realized before severe water stress is induced in 2015 the gs was significnatly higher in ci nonetheless this had not caused redundant transpiration as shown by the lower tr due to the non stomatal limitations and lower vpdl compared to ii the total water consumption was reduced while the wueet is substantially increased under ci compared to ii this result is in accordance with yang et al 2008 on the contrary the fluctuations of swc under ii treatments caused high water uptake and thus led to redundant transpiration consequently ci had slightly higher wueins and significantly lower wuein compared to ii treatments previous studies showed that the wuein is always higher when plants are under water stress than well watered in grapevines tomas et al 2014b suggesting the significantly higher wuein under ii treatments was resulted from water stress 5 conclusion tomato plants used less water from soil storage under ci so that it is consequently more sustainable for irrigation agriculture with the same irrigation volume water stress of tomato was observed under ii but not ci under ci the tomato leaf gs was increased while tr was decreased by lower vpdl compared to ii the pn was unaffected consequently ci increased the yield wueins at leaf level wuei wueet and wuewp at yield level of tomato plants compared to conventional ii treatments therefore ci utilizing semipermeable membrane is recommended as an efficient irrigation method on processing tomato for high wue without compromising the yield in arid and semiarid regions acknowledgements we are grateful for the research grants from the national natural

linear model table 4 the water consumption in ci was 6 73 7 51 lower than those in ii treatments in 2014 and 4 05 6 46 lower in 2015 plants under c1 and cl consumed 33 89 and 15 24 less water compared to plants under c2 and ch respectively as for ii i1 and il had 34 46 and 13 27 lower water consumption than i2 and ih respectively 3 2 gas exchange with the same amount of irrigation volume pn was similar between il and cl or between ih and ch treatments on average tr was significantly higher under il than cl ls was significantly higher under il than cl and similarly it was also significantly higher in ih than ch vpdl under cl was significantly lower compared to il and ch the averaged swc were significantly lower under cl and il than il and ih respectively fig 3 the gs was significantly and negatively correlated with vpdl fig 4 with higher correlation coefficients under ii indicating stronger stomatal adjusting effects from the vpdl under ii tr was significantly correlated with vpdl only under ci fig 5 and was significantly correlated with gs only under ii fig 6 which indicates stomatal limitation 3 3 yield and water use efficiency in 2015 under intermittent irrigation with mild water deficit il the average fruit weight number of fruits per plant and fruit yield were 9 3 14 0 and 21 0 significantly lower compared to cl and were 18 0 24 8 and 24 7 significantly lower compared to ih table 4 nevertheless they were not significantly affected between cl and ch however in 2014 there was no significant difference between c1 and i1 or c2 and i2 whereas the fruit yield were significantly higher under c2 and i2 than c1 and i1 respectively this suggests with water defict to some certain extent ci could not bring advantages on tomato yield over ii anymore higher wueins but lower wuein at leaf level were found under ci in 2015 fig 7 under ci with mild water deficit cl the wueins was 21 6 and 12 7 higher than under ch and il respectively while wueins under il was 8 2 higher compared to ih the wuei and wueet at yield level under cl were 36 0 and 12 3 higher than under ch and they were 26 3 and 33 5 higher than under il general linear model using spss showed tomato yield and number of fruit per plant were significantly affected by irrigation volume in both years wueet and average fruit weight were significantly affected by irrigation method in 2015 under ci both tomato yield and wueet had significant quadratic relationships with etr in both growing seasons fig 8 it is noteworthy that the etr where the maximum yield and wuewp reached were close for ii there were no apparent relationships between yield wuewp and etr 4 discussion the averaged swc in the root zone was similar between ci and ii however in 2015 the fluctuation of swc within an irrigation cycle of ii differed between ci and ii where the average differences of swc under cl and ch were 36 8 and 26 5 lower than il and ih respectively data not shown meaning a relatively stable soil water supply under ci compared to ii the different soil wetting patterns resulted in decreased leaf tr and thus lower water consumption ii caused fluctuations of soil moisture after irrigation events and this improved tomato leaf tr comparative studies have demonstrated that soil water deficit causes a reduction of gs farquhar et al 1989 lanari et al 2014 rawson et al 1977 schulze 1986 even in the absence of leaf water deficit holbrook et al 2002 kaiser 1987 leading to a decrease in tr however pn will be more strongly affected by the reduced gs under water deficit as pn can be influenced not only by the reduction of gs directly but also by the reduced ci which is due to the increase of leaf temperature aroused by low tr bierhuizen et al 1969 boyer 1970 farquhar et al 1989 lanari et al 2014 in this study under ci the gs and ci were higher but tr was lower and pn was not significantly different from that in ii treatments indicating that there were some other factors rather than soil water deficit causing the lower tr in the ci treatments the ci ca of c3 plant is normally 0 7 when without any stress farquhar et al 1989 correspondingly the ls of tomato leaf without stress should be 0 3 at the fruit enlargement stage in 2015 the average leaf ls under il and ih were 0 31 suggesting that water stress and stomatal limitation might have occurred under ii affecting leaf photosynthesis while the ls under cl and ch were 0 26 and 0 28 respectively indicating that the water stress and stomatal limitation under ci might not exist since the sensitivity of gs to vpdl usually increases with water stress rawson et al 1977 and the linear correlation between gs and vpdl under ii was stronger fig 4 it is deductible that ii was more evident to have developed water stress in this study tr was not correlated with gs under ci while it had a significant positive linear correlation with gs when gs 0 52 fig 4 suggesting that gs was a dominate factor regulating tr under ii but not under ci these results demonstrated again that the lower tr under ci was caused by non stomatal limitation factors such as low mesophyll conductivity farquhar et al 1982 li et al 2013 medrano et al 2002 tomas et al 2014a low leaf water content warren 2008 or environmental factors affecting vpdl bunce 1997 when available soil water is sufficient the process of water moving into plants is mainly limited by root conductance north and nobel 1996 under water deficit plant root senses water deficit and produces abscisic acid aba as a drought signal which decreases leaf gs and increases root conductance thompson et al 2007 to regulate plant growth cornic and massacci 1996 davies and zhang 1991 as discussed above ii treatments caused water deficit and the root to shoot chemical signals could have contributed to the reduced gs and thus lower tr vpdl is one of the driving forces for water movement from leaf stomata to the air meinzer and grantz 1990 and affects leaf tr gilbert et al 2011 oren et al 1999 it is known that tr usually increases with increasing vpdl until a certain level then it starts to decrease due to the lowering gs at high vpdl bunce 1997 in this study the vpdl was generally lower under ci correspondingly the tr was mainly in the increasing stage whereas under ii treatments the tr reached the decreasing stage when vpdl 3 12 together with the significantly lower gs compared to ci caused by the stomatal limitation therefore the lower tr under ci could also be attributed to the lower vpdl compared to ii the number of fruits and fruit size of tomato are affected by water stress during different growing stages nangare et al 2016 when water stress exists throughout the entire growing season or the reproductive growth period fruit setting and ripening stages the yield can be significantly decreased due to the drop in fruit weight and number of fruits chen et al 2014 patanè et al 2011 qiu et al 2013 yang et al 2012 in this study the water stress under ii with mild water deficit in 2015 decreased the fruit weight significantly compared to that under ci as the fruit weight was significantly lower under il than cl the number of marketable fruits was significantly lower in il than in ih resulting in the significantly lowest marketable yield among all the treatments tomato yield under ci was significantly higher compared to ii which is in accordance with xue et al 2013b as the water deficit became stronger in 2014 both ci and ii reduced marketable yield therefore the yield improvement under ci can be realized before severe water stress is induced in 2015 the gs was significnatly higher in ci nonetheless this had not caused redundant transpiration as shown by the lower tr due to the non stomatal limitations and lower vpdl compared to ii the total water consumption was reduced while the wueet is substantially increased under ci compared to ii this result is in accordance with yang et al 2008 on the contrary the fluctuations of swc under ii treatments caused high water uptake and thus led to redundant transpiration consequently ci had slightly higher wueins and significantly lower wuein compared to ii treatments previous studies showed that the wuein is always higher when plants are under water stress than well watered in grapevines tomas et al 2014b suggesting the significantly higher wuein under ii treatments was resulted from water stress 5 conclusion tomato plants used less water from soil storage under ci so that it is consequently more sustainable for irrigation agriculture with the same irrigation volume water stress of tomato was observed under ii but not ci under ci the tomato leaf gs was increased while tr was decreased by lower vpdl compared to ii the pn was unaffected consequently ci increased the yield wueins at leaf level wuei wueet and wuewp at yield level of tomato plants compared to conventional ii treatments therefore ci utilizing semipermeable membrane is recommended as an efficient irrigation method on processing tomato for high wue without compromising the yield in arid and semiarid regions acknowledgements we are grateful for the research grants from the national natural

11498,a crop model is a powerful tool for developing an irrigation schedule and simulating crop yield in this study both an aquacrop model using recommended default parameters and a parameterized aquacrop model were used to simulate the growth of maize for seed production under plastic film mulch the model variables that were parameterized include canopy cover cc aboveground biomass yield y and soil water content swc data from field experiments which included 23 irrigation treatments on four varieties of maize for seed production were collected in an arid region of northwest china from 2012 to 2015 the results from both the default aquacrop model and the parameterized model were compared with the field data the parameterized model performed much better than the default model overall it predicted cc well for most irrigation treatments with determination coefficient r2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse of 0 818 and 19 3 respectively however the model was rather sensitive to water stress during the vegetative stage and insensitive to water stress during the senescence stage resulting in underestimation and overestimation of cc during these stages as for biomass accumulation process r2 and nrmse were 0 929 and 19 1 for all treatments respectively the parameterized model estimated biomass accurately in the early and middle stages of growth but generally overestimated biomass at the mature stage giving a slightly decreased accuracy of final biomass b simulation the parameterized aquacrop model simulated b and y values with errors of less than 5 of measured values for 4 and 7 treatments out of 23 treatments respectively there were of less than 15 for 12 and 13 treatments out of 23 of less than 30 for 19 and 16 treatments out of 23 and greater than 30 for 4 and 7 treatments out of 23 respectively the model gave reasonable estimates of swc with r2 and nrmse of 0 736 and 15 2 respectively but tended to overestimate it for most irrigation treatments simulation of the variation of wp in the growth period and the differences of hi under different water stress conditions might be improved in the aquacrop model keywords aquacrop model water stress water productivity yield forecast crop growth model 1 introduction maize for seed production is different from maize grown for other purposes such as silage or cereal it has a smaller leaf area less biomass lower yield and consists of separate male and female plants the tassel of the female parent is removed before flowering and the ear of the female parent receives the pollen of the male parent to produce the final hybrid seed yield hexi corridor in northwest china is an important area for maize for seed production where the planting area is 100 000 ha which accounts for 39 3 of total area of this crop in china 255 000 ha the yield of maize for seed production is 580 000 tons which accounts for 42 6 of the total yield of this crop in china in 2013 wang et al 2013a hexi corridor is located in a typical arid climate zone with annual rainfall 200 mm there is a serious shortage of water and agriculture depends heavily on irrigation du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 due to the scarcity of water the crop often suffers water stress and its yield decreases an understanding of the effects of different degrees of water stress on maize for seed production is very important for optimal irrigation management and crop production field experiments are often time consuming and costly so crop models can greatly help to improve crop management rötter et al 2012 mabhaudhi et al 2014 modelling crop growth can provide a powerful tool for evaluating the effects of environmental factors on crops steduto et al 2009 rötter et al 2015 there are many widely used crop models such as wofost diepen et al 1989 epic sharpley and williams 1990 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 dssat jones et al 2003 apsim keating et al 2003 and waves kang et al 2003 however these models are complex they require many parameters that are often difficult to quantify and can be time consuming to obtain to overcome these obstacles fao developed the aquacrop model to be accurate simple robust and easy to use steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 the model is now used worldwide and it is an important tool for managing and forecasting crop production it has been successfully used to simulate the development of many crops maize hsiao et al 2009 stricevic et al 2011 abedinpour et al 2012 nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 paredes et al 2014 wheat andarzian et al 2011 mkhabela and bullock 2012 wang et al 2013b iqbal et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 cotton garcia vila et al 2009 linker et al 2016 rice maniruzzaman et al 2015 sunflowers todorovic et al 2009 stricevic et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010a quinoa geerts et al 2009 teff araya et al 2010b taro mabhaudhi et al 2014 and others however heng et al 2009 and katerji et al 2013 showed that although aquacrop can accurately estimate the canopy coverage biomass and yield of maize under full irrigation and mild water stress conditions the accuracy of the simulation is poor when there are severe water deficit conditions especially when the water deficit occurs in the senescence period it has been shown that aquacrop can accurately simulate change in soil water content under full irrigation conditions but generally overestimates soil water content for deficit irrigation applications especially for cotton farahani et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 have suggested that aquacrop should be further validated for different soils crops and climates worldwide to give good simulation results for crop characteristics such as biomass and yield the parameters of an aquacrop model must be calibrated there is no literature concerning the parameterization of an aquacrop model for maize that is grown as a seed crop and it is not clear that the default parameters for other maize crops can be used unaltered for such a model especially with deficit irrigation in addition there has been little research into the use of aquacrop in the inland arid climate of northwest china thus the objective of this study is to parameterize an aquacrop model on maize for seed production in an arid region of northwest china under both full irrigation and deficit irrigation so that the model provides accurate yield forecasts under different irrigation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and its description field experiments were conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture

every experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design and each treatment had three replicates the maize for seed production was sown alternating one row of male plants with five rows of female plants under plastic film mulch with plant spacing of 0 25 m and row spacing of 0 4 m nitrogen n phosphorus p2o5 and potassium k2o fertilizers were applied at 500 kg ha 1 240 kg ha 1 and 50 kg ha 1 respectively according to average long term fertilization data in each of the four years except for irrigation other farming management measures were similar for all treatments each plot field had an area of 86 8 m2 12 4 m 7 m during the five one year experiments the plots were separated by ridges 0 3 m wide and 0 5 m high and 1 m wide strips were left around the inside of each plot for protection uniform border irrigation was adopted as the irrigation method irrigation pipelines were buried in the ridges for each plot the main pipes were equipped with a water meter to measure the irrigation amount and a water outlet was installed at the head the irrigation time and depth data for each treatment are shown in table 1 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data were continuously measured during the experimental period by a standard automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp usa located near the experimental field the data were taken every 5 s and 15 min averages were recorded by a data logger the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation minimum relative humidity precipitation and et0 for each growing season are shown in fig 1 2 3 2 canopy cover canopy cover cc was derived from the leaf area index lai by the following empirical equation given by hsiao et al 2009 1 c c 1 005 1 exp 0 6 l a i 1 2 nine female plants from each treatment group were randomly chosen to measure the green leaf length and maximum leaf width every 7 d to 10 d over the growing period leaf area was calculated by summing leaf length maximum leaf width and multiplying by a factor of 0 7 this value was derived by linear regression through the origin between the calculated and actual values r 2 0 998 the actual values were measured by an am300 leaf area meter adc bioscientific ltd uk the leaf area index lai was taken to be leaf area per unit of area 2 3 3 soil water content gravimetric soil water content was measured at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm and 100 cm with two replicates in each plot the mean soil water content in the soil profile was taken to be the average of the soil water content measurements in the 0 100 cm layer the initial values of soil water content for each plot before sowing were measured each year soil water content was also measured before and after each irrigation for all the treatments from 2013 to 2015 2 3 4 biomass yield and harvest index nine female plants from each treatment were harvested at ground level every 10 d to 20 d to measure the aboveground biomass all the harvested plants were oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then dried at 70 c to obtain the constant dry weight at the end of each growth period sixty female plants were randomly selected from each treatment and harvested for seed yield grains were first oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then dried to constant mass at 70 c the final seed yield was normalized on the basis of 13 moisture content for comparison between treatments the harvest index was defined as yield divided by final biomass 2 4 description of the aquacrop model yield y is estimated from the final biomass and the harvest index in aquacrop steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 the equation is 2 y f h i h i 0 b where

steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 2 5 parameterization of the aquacrop model aquacrop has no pre determined parameters for maize for seed production although it has default parameters for maize since the objective of this study was to obtain a set of conservative parameters for maize for seed production the approach to parameterizing the model was the same as that of hsiao et al 2009 in which different values of the assumed conservative parameters were used iteratively to minimize the error between the simulated and measured data since the varieties of maize for seed production were different between experiments we could not use the common method of calibrating the model with one or two years of observed data and then validating the model with data observed in subsequent years all the observed data from 2012 to 2015 were used in the parameterization following the approach used by hsiao et al 2009 the advantage of this approach is that the obtained parameter values were specifically applicable to maize for seed production and could be used for the different varieties the disadvantage is that there might have been a systematic error for a specific variety for model simplicity and ease of usability the phenology of maize for seed production was set to the same value for every year we followed the process of parameterization given by vanuytrecht et al 2014 first we calibrated canopy cover second we calibrated biomass and third we calibrated yield 2 6 statistical analysis to validate the performance of the model we used the following five statistical indicators hsiao et al 2009 pereira et al 2015 11 r 2 i 1 n m i m s i s i 1 n m i m 2 0 5 i 1 n s i s 2 0 5 2 12 r m s e i 1 n m i s i 2 n 0 5 13 n r m s e 100 m i 1 n m i s i 2 n 0 5 14 e f 1 i 1 n s

the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient d is willmott s index of agreement si is the simulated value mi is the observed measured value s is the mean of the simulated values and m is the mean of the observed values r2 ranges from 0 to 1 higher values indicate less error variance and normally values greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 the agreement between the simulated and observed values is good when rmse is close to zero the simulation is considered excellent when nrmse 10 good if nrmse is in the range 10 20 acceptable if nrmse is in the range 20 30 and poor if nrmse 30 jamieson et al 1991 ef can range from negative infinity to 1 ef 1 indicates a perfect fit ef 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the average of the observed data and ef 0 indicates that the mean of the observations gives a better prediction than the model willmott s d ranges between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating a perfect agreement between the simulation and observation 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameterization of the aquacrop model we obtained a set of conservative model parameters from comparisons between simulated and observed values and the use of trial and error to adjust parameter values we used observations from all experimental treatments over all years the parameters appear to be valid for most of the irrigation treatments table 2 normalized water productivity wp is one of the most important parameters in the aquacrop model and was considered to be constant for a particular crop species steduto et al 2009 daily t was not available in this study so daily et was used in computing wp as was done in other studies such as hsiao et al 2009 farahani et al 2009 and araya et al 2010b linear regression between biomass and the sum of the normalized ratios of actual evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration up to the time of each biomass measurement over the 4 years is presented in fig 2 the calculated wp was 20 9 g m 2 with r2 0 902 it was lower than the default value 30 g m 2 to 35 g m 2 given for c4 plants in the fao aquacrop model and this result shows that maize for seed production differs from other crop maize 3 2 performance of the models 3 2 1 canopy cover cc as shown in fig 3 the cc values estimated by aquacrop using calibrated parameters were closer to the observed values than the cc values obtained when using the default parameters the aquacrop model using default parameters overestimated cc during the development stage and underestimated it during the senescence stage this was because the default canopy growth coefficient cgc and the canopy decline coefficient cdc were greater than the observed values in each year table 2 especially cdc paredes et al 2014 also showed that the accuracy of the cc estimation for maize given by the parameterized aquacrop model is greater than when using the default parameters the goodness of fit indicators relative to the estimation of cc using the calibrated parameters are given in table 3 the results show that r2 rmse nrmse ef and d for all irrigation treatments were 0 818 12 9 19 3 0 811 and 0 947 respectively these results show that the parameterized aquacrop model estimated cc with an acceptable accuracy for all irrigation treatments from 2012 to 2015 however when examining the different irrigation treatments r2 rmse nrmse ef and d ranged from 0 514 to 0 985 3 7 to 26 3 5 8 to 41 8 0 456 0 982 and 0 778 0 996 respectively which suggests that errors still exist in the estimation of cc for different irrigation treatments in 2012 estimated cc began to decrease earlier than observed cc for all treatments fig 3a f in 2013 the model underestimated cc in the middle stage for w2 and w3 but overestimated cc for w1 which shows that the model underestimated cc in the middle stage under severe water stress for the whole growth period fig 3g i in 2014 the model slightly underestimated cc in the development stage for all treatments fig 3j p moreover the model significantly overestimated cc in the senescence stage for iv3 and iv2 fig 3n o which shows that the model was not sensitive to water stress in the senescence stage in 2015 the model significantly overestimated cc over the water stress period for iv3 iv2 and iv1 fig 3r t v which suggests that the model does not accurately simulate cc when water stress at the senescence stage led to the accelerated decrease in cc which was similar to iv3 and iv2 in 2014 the model underestimated cc during the water stress period for ir3 ir2 and ir1 fig 3s u w which suggests that the model was too sensitive to water stress in the vegetative growth stage katerji et al 2013 showed that in a mediterranean climate an aquacrop model accurately estimated the cc of maize with full irrigation overestimated cc in the middle stage if there was moderate water stress and that the estimated values did not match the observed values when there was severe water stress as the estimated cc decreased rapidly to zero about 60 days after planting however in our study the estimated cc did not decrease rapidly to zero because cc was related to the specific duration and degree of water stress our study also showed that for the water stress treatments over the whole growth period the model underestimated cc during the middle stage and overestimated it during the late stage this result is similar to the results of andarzian et al 2011 and toumi et al 2016 who studied wheat species we found that the simulation of cc was rather sensitive to water stress during the vegetative stage which resulted in the underestimation of cc we also found that the model cannot simulate water stress during senescence period which resulted in cc overestimation these findings all together indicate that the model simulation of the response of cc to water stress during different growth stages can be improved paredes et al 2014 also found that the simulation of cc for maize could be improved it was insensitive to water stress over the whole growing season but too sensitive to water stress during the vegetative stage heng et al 2009 also suggested that the simulation of cc for maize under severe water stress conditions needed to be improved 3 2 2 biomass accumulation the results of simulated biomass accumulation by both the default and the parameterized aquacrop models are given in fig 4 the figure shows that the estimation of biomass accumulation by the parameterized model was more accurate i e closer to observed values than that given when using default parameters when using the default parameters the model greatly overestimated biomass accumulation during the whole growth period this was mainly because the default wp 33 7 g m 2 was greater than the annual observed values during 2012 2015 24 6 g m 2 18 1 g m 2 21 7 g m 2 and 26 1 g m 2 respectively the simulation showed a rapid increase in biomass accumulation that was not consistent with our observations in this study paredes et al 2014 also found that an aquacrop model with calibrated parameters simulates biomass accumulation in maize better than when the default parameters are used the goodness of fit indicators for the estimation of biomass accumulation using the calibrated parameters are given in table 4 results show that r2 rmse nrmse ef and d for all irrigation treatments were 0 929 1 972 t ha 1 19 1 0 903 and 0 977 respectively indicating that the parameterized model estimates biomass accumulation with an acceptable accuracy under different soil water stress conditions however for different irrigation treatments r2 rmse nrmse ef and d ranged from 0 925 to 0 999 0 802 t ha 1 to 3 597 t ha 1 6 6 to 52 0 0 527 0 988 and 0 914 0 997 respectively suggesting that there are still errors in the estimated values in 2012 when compared with the control treatment ck the parameterized model overestimated biomass accumulation for growth stages jd and hd fig 4a c d with rmse values of 3 597 t ha 1 and 3 460 t ha 1 and nrmse values of 31 7 and 30 2 table 4 respectively these results show that the model performed poorly for deficit irrigation at the jointing and heading stages in 2013 and 2014 the estimated and observed values of biomass were close only in the early and middle growth stages but after that the estimated values did not match the observed values because the estimated biomass values continued to increase and the observed values tended to be constant fig 4g p in 2015 the parameterized model estimated the final biomass for ck well but it underestimated the biomass from 100 days to 130 days after sowing fig 4q andarzian et al 2011 used aquacrop to model wheat growth under hot and dry weather conditions in southern iran they showed that the model can estimate wheat biomass accumulation well for full and deficit irrigation treatments but slightly overestimates biomass accumulation hsiao et al 2009 parameterized and validated an aquacrop model for maize and found that rmse ranged from 0 58 t ha 1 to 6 18 t ha 1 and that d ranged from 0 915 to 0 999 this finding was similar to our results where rmse ranges from 0 802 t ha 1 to 3 597 t ha 1 and d ranges from 0 914 to 0 997 our study also shows that the parameterized model can generally simulate biomass well for the early and middle stages but overestimates it at the late stage this occurs because the calculation of biomass in an aquacrop model section 2 4 equation 3 uses the same value of wp during the whole growth period we found that wp varied over different growth stages fig 2 for example wp at the late stage decreased significantly if the model were to use different wp values for different growth stages then biomass accumulation would be estimated more accurately especially in the late stage hsiao et al 2009 also found that for maize wp changes according to growth period they showed a sharp increase in wp at the beginning of the growth period followed by a steady gradual rate of change and then ending with a decrease for one to several data points sampled near the end of the crop life cycle this behavior is similar to what we found hsiao et al 2009 also did not consider a change of wp in their aquacrop model and only used the stable middle portion the time period from cc 70 to 25 lai senescence to derive wp by fitting a linear equation they also found errors in the estimation of biomass accumulation especially in the mature stage which again is similar to our results however hsiao et al 2009 thought that the biomass was underestimated because either wp or kctr x was too small katerji et al 2013 studied maize in a mediterranean climate and found that the aquacrop model can generally estimate biomass accurately in the first half of the growth stage with full irrigation treatment but that the model overestimates biomass significantly in the last half of the period again this result is similar to our findings 3 2 3 water content of the soil profile fig 5 shows the soil water content swc of the profile 0 to100 cm estimated by the default and parameterized models for the growing seasons in the period 2013 2015 the parameterized simulations provided results that were closer to observed values than the default simulations paredes et al 2014 also found differences when simulating swc using the default parameters for maize the goodness of fit indicators for swc are given in table 5 the parameterized model gave good estimates of swc under all irrigation treatments with r2 rmse nrmse ef and d of 0 736 33 1 mm 15 2 0 364 and 0 854 respectively table 5 for different treatments r2 rmse nrmse ef and d ranged from 0 594 to 0 932 15 6 mm to 56 0 mm 7 0 to 34 1 2 372 to 0 883 and 0 574 0 971 respectively these values indicate that there is an error in the parameterized model calculation of swc in 2013 the model estimated swc well for the early and middle stages but overestimated swc for the late stage fig 5a c in 2014 the model overestimated swc during the whole growth period for all the treatments fig 5d j in 2015 the parameterized model overestimated swc in stage ir1 but gave good estimates of swc for all other treatments fig 5k q hsiao et al 2009 found that the rate of decrease for estimated swc is slightly less than that for observed swc and that swc is overestimated by 80 mm by the end of the season we observed a similar phenomenon in this study such as for treatments ck and iv2 in 2014 and iv1 in 2015 moreover previous studies have shown that the aquacrop model can simulate the variation in swc but that it overestimates swc during the growth period farahani et al 2009 hussein et al 2011 zeleke et al 2011 paredes et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 a finding that is similar to our results however araya et al 2010b and iqbal et al 2014 found that the aquacrop model generally estimates a lower swc than is observed which might be related to differences in soil textures 3 2 4 final biomass harvest index and yield the estimated values of final biomass b harvest index hi and yield y from the different irrigation treatments over the period 2012 2015 were compared with the observed values as shown in table 6 the difference between the observed value and the estimated value is given as a percentage of the observed value as shown in table 6 among 23 treatments the difference between the estimated and observed values of b was 5 for 4 treatments 15 for 12 treatments 30 for 19 treatments and 30 for 4 treatments these results show that the parameterized aquacrop model generally estimated b well but that there are errors in the calculation possible reasons for the errors are a one fixed value of wp was used for all varieties of maize for seed production leading to systematic errors for every specific cultivar for example the actual wp 18 1 g m 2 in 2013 was smaller than the fixed value 20 9 g m 2 resulting in overestimation of b for all treatments in this year and b the aquacrop model uses a single wp value over the whole growth period but we observed that the wp of maize for seed production varied over the different growth stages hsiao et al 2009 parameterized the aquacrop model for maize in a mediterranean climate and found that among 13 treatments the difference between the estimated and observed biomass is 5 for 5 treatments and 10 for 8 treatments and that the greatest difference is 22 these results are better than our results on maize for seed production in an inland arid climate it is worth noting that wp of different cultivars varied from 30 3 g m 2 to 33 2 g m 2 in hsiao et al 2009 but that it varies from 18 1 g m 2 to 26 1 g m 2 in our study which accounts for the larger errors in estimates of b that we obtained when the estimated value of hi is compared with the observed value the difference between the values was 5 for 6 treatments 15 for 17 treatments 30 for 20 treatments and 30 for 3 treatments table 6 the reasons for the errors are a the reference harvest index hi0 of the varieties of maize for seed production was fixed to the same value for all simulations and b in the aquacrop model hi is not sensitive to water stress observed hi was in the range 40 2 16 5 with a difference of 23 7 for all irrigation treatments while estimated hi was in the range 33 0 31 9 with a difference of only 1 1 araya et al 2010a validated an aquacrop model for barley and found that the large difference between estimated and observed values of y might have been due to using a single hi value 20 in the model they observed that hi for the cultivars under good conditions varies from 24 to 14 during the experimental period a similar result was found by nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 who observed that hi of maize varied from 22 to 42 whereas the aquacrop model used a constant default value of 48 it has also been reported that the model similarly overestimated y for some varieties of barley and underestimated y for other varieties because of different observed values of hi0 among varieties abrha et al 2012 hsiao et al 2009 suggested that hi is inaccurately estimated under water stress conditions in late stages of crop growth farahani et al 2009 parameterized the aquacrop model for cotton under full and deficit irrigation and showed that the model do not accurately simulate the effect of water stress on hi thus causing errors in the estimation of y accurate simulation of the response of y to water is important for agricultural production especially in an arid region where agriculture depends heavily on irrigation we found that for y among 23 treatments the differences between the observed and estimated values were 5 for 7 treatments 15 for 13 treatments 30 for 16 treatments and 30 for 7 treatments table 6 these results show that the parameterized aquacrop model was somewhat accurate but that it contained errors the errors in estimated values of y resulted from the errors in estimations of b and hi under different water stress conditions as water stress increased the estimate of y gradually became less accurate severe water stress in 2013 resulted in poor model performance heng et al 2009 found that the aquacrop model produces good estimates of y for no water stress and mild water stress treatments but not for severe water stress treatments especially during the senescence period katerji et al 2013 modelled maize growth using aquacrop and found that the model gives inaccurate estimates of y for severe water stress treatments due to inaccurate estimates of cc during the growing season these findings are similar to those in our study which resulted from poor estimations of wp and hi the parameterized model generally simulated crop growth process better than the final b and y however aquacrop is intended to model crop growth in its entirety not simply the outcomes inaccuracies in final b and y are due to variation in normalized water productivity wp during the different growth stages and differences in the harvest index hi under different water stress conditions which are not accurately modelled the calculation formulas in aquacrop must be improved since parameter adjustment that would result in accurate predictions of b and y may distort other aspects of the model although the parameterized model produces some inaccurate estimates of cc b y and swc it has the following advantages a it is simple and needs fewer calibrated parameters than other crop models b using the same parameters for different varieties of maize makes the model more widely applicable c the model can accommodate diverse and complicated irrigation treatments which increases the viability of the model with respect to water stress conditions d crop phenology is the same for all applications which maintains the simplicity of the model on the other hand the use of the same soil parameters for all irrigation treatments in the parameterized model can result in errors the climate may also affect the simulation from 2012 2015 measured precipitation ranged from 68 mm to 236 mm and et0 ranged from 525 mm to 667 mm however overall the conservative parameters used in this study gave acceptably accurate results and we conclude that the parameterized aquacrop model can be used to simulate full and deficit irrigated maize for seed production under plastic film mulch in an arid region of northwest china as well as in regions with similar landscape and climate 4 conclusions we calibrated the default parameters of the aquacrop model in order use it as a parameterized model to simulate the growth of maize grown for seed production we used a large amount of experimental data gathered in the period 2012 2015 for parameterization our results show that the parameterized model was more accurate than the default model the following conclusions were drawn the parameterized model did not accurately predict canopy cover when there was severe water stress the model was sensitive to water stress during the vegetative stage but underestimated canopy cover the model was not sensitive to water stress during senescence and overestimated canopy cover the parameterized model accurately estimated biomass in early and middle growth stages but overestimated biomass in the maturing stage thus diminishing the overall accuracy of biomass estimation the calculation of harvest index was not sensitive to severe water stress which led to error in the estimate of yield the model accurately simulated variations in the trend of soil water content but in general it overestimated soil water content future studies can be performed to increase the simulation accuracy for b and y and thus the discrepancies between the simulated and measured values could be substantially reduced for example simulation of the variation of wp in the growth period and the differences of hi under different water stress conditions might be improved in the aquacrop model four cultivars were used in this study the influence of the particular cultivar in the parameter estimation was not the focus of this study but will be part of our future studies in addition it will be interesting to identify any correlation between water stress and crop yield in the future the parameterized aquacrop model can also be used to optimize the deficit irrigation schedule and to simulate the impact of future climate change on agricultural production and to model potential countermeasures acknowledgements we are extremely grateful to the

11498,a crop model is a powerful tool for developing an irrigation schedule and simulating crop yield in this study both an aquacrop model using recommended default parameters and a parameterized aquacrop model were used to simulate the growth of maize for seed production under plastic film mulch the model variables that were parameterized include canopy cover cc aboveground biomass yield y and soil water content swc data from field experiments which included 23 irrigation treatments on four varieties of maize for seed production were collected in an arid region of northwest china from 2012 to 2015 the results from both the default aquacrop model and the parameterized model were compared with the field data the parameterized model performed much better than the default model overall it predicted cc well for most irrigation treatments with determination coefficient r2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse of 0 818 and 19 3 respectively however the model was rather sensitive to water stress during the vegetative stage and insensitive to water stress during the senescence stage resulting in underestimation and overestimation of cc during these stages as for biomass accumulation process r2 and nrmse were 0 929 and 19 1 for all treatments respectively the parameterized model estimated biomass accurately in the early and middle stages of growth but generally overestimated biomass at the mature stage giving a slightly decreased accuracy of final biomass b simulation the parameterized aquacrop model simulated b and y values with errors of less than 5 of measured values for 4 and 7 treatments out of 23 treatments respectively there were of less than 15 for 12 and 13 treatments out of 23 of less than 30 for 19 and 16 treatments out of 23 and greater than 30 for 4 and 7 treatments out of 23 respectively the model gave reasonable estimates of swc with r2 and nrmse of 0 736 and 15 2 respectively but tended to overestimate it for most irrigation treatments simulation of the variation of wp in the growth period and the differences of hi under different water stress conditions might be improved in the aquacrop model keywords aquacrop model water stress water productivity yield forecast crop growth model 1 introduction maize for seed production is different from maize grown for other purposes such as silage or cereal it has a smaller leaf area less biomass lower yield and consists of separate male and female plants the tassel of the female parent is removed before flowering and the ear of the female parent receives the pollen of the male parent to produce the final hybrid seed yield hexi corridor in northwest china is an important area for maize for seed production where the planting area is 100 000 ha which accounts for 39 3 of total area of this crop in china 255 000 ha the yield of maize for seed production is 580 000 tons which accounts for 42 6 of the total yield of this crop in china in 2013 wang et al 2013a hexi corridor is located in a typical arid climate zone with annual rainfall 200 mm there is a serious shortage of water and agriculture depends heavily on irrigation du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 due to the scarcity of water the crop often suffers water stress and its yield decreases an understanding of the effects of different degrees of water stress on maize for seed production is very important for optimal irrigation management and crop production field experiments are often time consuming and costly so crop models can greatly help to improve crop management rötter et al 2012 mabhaudhi et al 2014 modelling crop growth can provide a powerful tool for evaluating the effects of environmental factors on crops steduto et al 2009 rötter et al 2015 there are many widely used crop models such as wofost diepen et al 1989 epic sharpley and williams 1990 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 dssat jones et al 2003 apsim keating et al 2003 and waves kang et al 2003 however these models are complex they require many parameters that are often difficult to quantify and can be time consuming to obtain to overcome these obstacles fao developed the aquacrop model to be accurate simple robust and easy to use steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 the model is now used worldwide and it is an important tool for managing and forecasting crop production it has been successfully used to simulate the development of many crops maize hsiao et al 2009 stricevic et al 2011 abedinpour et al 2012 nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 paredes et al 2014 wheat andarzian et al 2011 mkhabela and bullock 2012 wang et al 2013b iqbal et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 cotton garcia vila et al 2009 linker et al 2016 rice maniruzzaman et al 2015 sunflowers todorovic et al 2009 stricevic et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010a quinoa geerts et al 2009 teff araya et al 2010b taro mabhaudhi et al 2014 and others however heng et al 2009 and katerji et al 2013 showed that although aquacrop can accurately estimate the canopy coverage biomass and yield of maize under full irrigation and mild water stress conditions the accuracy of the simulation is poor when there are severe water deficit conditions especially when the water deficit occurs in the senescence period it has been shown that aquacrop can accurately simulate change in soil water content under full irrigation conditions but generally overestimates soil water content for deficit irrigation applications especially for cotton farahani et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 have suggested that aquacrop should be further validated for different soils crops and climates worldwide to give good simulation results for crop characteristics such as biomass and yield the parameters of an aquacrop model must be calibrated there is no literature concerning the parameterization of an aquacrop model for maize that is grown as a seed crop and it is not clear that the default parameters for other maize crops can be used unaltered for such a model especially with deficit irrigation in addition there has been little research into the use of aquacrop in the inland arid climate of northwest china thus the objective of this study is to parameterize an aquacrop model on maize for seed production in an arid region of northwest china under both full irrigation and deficit irrigation so that the model provides accurate yield forecasts under different irrigation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and its description field experiments were conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology part of the china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e elevation 1581 m from 2012 to 2015 the experimental site is located in an arid inland climate zone with abundant light and heat but with a water scarcity li et al 2015 the soil has a light sandy loam texture with mean soil dry bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 mean saturated water

every experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design and each treatment had three replicates the maize for seed production was sown alternating one row of male plants with five rows of female plants under plastic film mulch with plant spacing of 0 25 m and row spacing of 0 4 m nitrogen n phosphorus p2o5 and potassium k2o fertilizers were applied at 500 kg ha 1 240 kg ha 1 and 50 kg ha 1 respectively according to average long term fertilization data in each of the four years except for irrigation other farming management measures were similar for all treatments each plot field had an area of 86 8 m2 12 4 m 7 m during the five one year experiments the plots were separated by ridges 0 3 m wide and 0 5 m high and 1 m wide strips were left around the inside of each plot for protection uniform border irrigation was adopted as the irrigation method irrigation pipelines were buried in the ridges for each plot the main pipes were equipped with a water meter to measure the irrigation amount and a water outlet was installed at the head the irrigation time and depth data for each treatment are shown in table 1 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data were continuously measured during the experimental period by a standard automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp usa located near the experimental field the data were taken every 5 s and 15 min averages were recorded by a data logger the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation minimum relative humidity precipitation and et0 for each growing season are shown in fig 1 2 3 2 canopy cover canopy cover cc was derived from the leaf area index lai by the following empirical equation given by hsiao et al 2009 1 c c 1 005 1 exp 0 6 l a i 1 2 nine female plants from each treatment group were randomly chosen to measure the green leaf length and maximum leaf width every 7 d to 10 d over the growing period leaf area was calculated by summing leaf length maximum leaf width and multiplying by a factor of 0 7 this value was derived by linear regression through the origin between the calculated and actual values r 2 0 998 the actual values were measured by an am300 leaf area meter adc bioscientific ltd uk the leaf area index lai was taken to be leaf area per unit of area 2 3 3 soil water content gravimetric soil water content was measured at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm and 100 cm with two replicates in each plot the mean soil water content in the soil profile was taken to be the average of the soil water content measurements in the 0 100 cm layer the initial values of soil water content for each plot before sowing were measured each year soil water content was also measured before and after each irrigation for all the treatments from 2013 to 2015 2 3 4 biomass yield and harvest index nine female plants from each treatment were harvested at ground level every 10 d to 20 d to measure the aboveground biomass all the harvested plants were oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then dried at 70 c to obtain the constant dry weight at the end of each growth period sixty female plants were randomly selected from each treatment and harvested for seed yield grains were first oven dried at 105 c for 30 min and then dried to constant mass at 70 c the final seed yield was normalized on the basis of 13 moisture content for comparison between treatments the harvest index was defined as yield divided by final biomass 2 4 description of the aquacrop model yield y is estimated from the final biomass and the harvest index in aquacrop steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 the equation is 2 y f h i h i 0 b where

steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 2 5 parameterization of the aquacrop model aquacrop has no pre determined parameters for maize for seed production although it has default parameters for maize since the objective of this study was to obtain a set of conservative parameters for maize for seed production the approach to parameterizing the model was the same as that of hsiao et al 2009 in which different values of the assumed conservative parameters were used iteratively to minimize the error between the simulated and measured data since the varieties of maize for seed production were different between experiments we could not use the common method of calibrating the model with one or two years of observed data and then validating the model with data observed in subsequent years all the observed data from 2012 to 2015 were used in the parameterization following the approach used by hsiao et al 2009 the advantage of this approach is that the obtained parameter values were specifically applicable to maize for seed production and could be used for the different varieties the disadvantage is that there might have been a systematic error for a specific variety for model simplicity and ease of usability the phenology of maize for seed production was set to the same value for every year we followed the process of parameterization given by vanuytrecht et al 2014 first we calibrated canopy cover second we calibrated biomass and third we calibrated yield 2 6 statistical analysis to validate the performance of the model we used the following five statistical indicators hsiao et al 2009 pereira et al 2015 11 r 2 i 1 n m i m s i s i 1 n m i m 2 0 5 i 1 n s i s 2 0 5 2 12 r m s e i 1 n m i s i 2 n 0 5 13 n r m s e 100 m i 1 n m i s i 2 n 0 5 14 e f 1 i 1 n s

simulated and observed values is good when rmse is close to zero the simulation is considered excellent when nrmse 10 good if nrmse is in the range 10 20 acceptable if nrmse is in the range 20 30 and poor if nrmse 30 jamieson et al 1991 ef can range from negative infinity to 1 ef 1 indicates a perfect fit ef 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the average of the observed data and ef 0 indicates that the mean of the observations gives a better prediction than the model willmott s d ranges between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating a perfect agreement between the simulation and observation 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameterization of the aquacrop model we obtained a set of conservative model parameters from comparisons between simulated and observed values and the use of trial and error to adjust parameter values we used observations from all experimental treatments over all years the parameters appear to be valid for most of the irrigation treatments table 2 normalized water productivity wp is one of the most important parameters in the aquacrop model and was considered to be constant for a particular crop species steduto et al 2009 daily t was not available in this study so daily et was used in computing wp as was done in other studies such as hsiao et al 2009 farahani et al 2009 and araya et al 2010b linear regression between biomass and the sum of the normalized ratios of actual evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration up to the time of each biomass measurement over the 4 years is presented in fig 2 the calculated wp was 20 9 g m 2 with r2 0 902 it was lower than the default value 30 g m 2 to 35 g m 2 given for c4 plants in the fao aquacrop model and this result shows that maize for seed production differs from other crop maize 3 2 performance of the models 3 2 1 canopy cover cc as shown in fig 3 the cc values estimated by aquacrop using calibrated parameters were closer to the observed values than the cc values obtained when using the default parameters the aquacrop model using default parameters overestimated cc during the development stage and underestimated it during the senescence stage this was because the default canopy growth coefficient cgc and the canopy decline coefficient cdc were greater than the observed values in each year table 2 especially cdc paredes et al 2014 also showed that the accuracy of the cc estimation for maize given by the parameterized aquacrop model is greater than when using the default parameters the goodness of fit indicators relative to the estimation of cc using the calibrated parameters are given in table 3 the results show that r2 rmse nrmse ef and d for all irrigation treatments were 0 818 12 9 19 3 0 811 and 0 947 respectively these results show that the parameterized aquacrop model estimated cc with an acceptable accuracy for all irrigation treatments from 2012 to 2015 however when examining the different irrigation treatments r2 rmse nrmse ef and d ranged from 0 514 to 0 985 3 7 to 26 3 5 8 to 41 8 0 456 0 982 and 0 778 0 996 respectively which suggests that errors still exist in the estimation of cc for different irrigation treatments in 2012 estimated cc began to decrease earlier than observed cc for all treatments fig 3a f in 2013 the model underestimated cc in the middle stage for w2 and w3 but overestimated cc for w1 which shows that the model underestimated cc in the middle stage under severe water stress for the whole growth period fig 3g i in 2014 the model slightly underestimated cc in the development stage for all treatments fig 3j p moreover the model significantly overestimated cc in the senescence stage for iv3 and iv2 fig 3n o which shows that the model was not sensitive to water stress in the senescence stage in 2015 the model significantly overestimated cc over the water stress period for iv3 iv2 and iv1 fig 3r t v which suggests that the model does not accurately simulate cc when water stress at the senescence stage led to the accelerated decrease in cc which was similar to iv3 and iv2 in 2014 the model underestimated cc during the water stress period for ir3 ir2 and ir1 fig 3s u w which suggests that the model was too sensitive to water stress in the vegetative growth stage katerji et al 2013 showed that in a mediterranean climate an aquacrop model accurately estimated the cc of maize with full irrigation overestimated cc in the middle stage if there was moderate water stress and that the estimated values did not match the observed values when there was severe water stress as the estimated cc decreased rapidly to zero about 60 days after planting however in our study the estimated cc did not decrease rapidly to zero because cc was related to the specific duration and degree of water stress our study also showed that for the water stress treatments over the whole growth period the model underestimated cc during the middle stage and overestimated it during the late stage this result is similar to the results of andarzian et al 2011 and toumi et al 2016 who studied wheat species we found that the simulation of cc was rather sensitive to water stress during the vegetative stage which resulted in the underestimation of cc we also found that the model cannot simulate water stress during senescence period which resulted in cc overestimation these findings all together indicate that the model simulation of the response of cc to water stress during different growth stages can be improved paredes et al 2014 also found that the simulation of cc for maize could be improved it was insensitive to water stress over the whole growing season but too sensitive to water stress during the vegetative stage heng et al 2009 also suggested that the simulation of cc for maize under severe water stress conditions needed to be improved 3 2 2 biomass accumulation the results of simulated biomass accumulation by both the default and the parameterized aquacrop models are given in fig 4 the figure shows that the estimation of biomass accumulation by the parameterized model was more accurate i e closer to observed values than that given when using default parameters when using the default parameters the model greatly overestimated biomass accumulation during the whole growth period this was mainly because the default wp 33 7 g m 2 was greater than the annual observed values during 2012 2015 24 6 g m 2 18 1 g m 2 21 7 g m 2 and 26 1 g m 2 respectively the simulation showed a rapid increase in biomass accumulation that was not consistent with our observations in this study paredes et al 2014 also found that an aquacrop model with calibrated parameters simulates biomass accumulation in maize better than when the default parameters are used the goodness of fit indicators for the estimation of biomass accumulation using the calibrated parameters are given in table 4 results show that r2 rmse nrmse ef and d for all irrigation treatments were 0 929 1 972 t ha 1 19 1 0 903 and 0 977 respectively indicating that the parameterized model estimates biomass accumulation with an acceptable accuracy under different soil water stress conditions however for different irrigation treatments r2 rmse nrmse ef and d ranged from 0 925 to 0 999 0 802 t ha 1 to 3 597 t ha 1 6 6 to 52 0 0 527 0 988 and 0 914 0 997 respectively suggesting that there are still errors in the estimated values in 2012 when compared with the control treatment ck the parameterized model overestimated biomass accumulation for growth stages jd and hd fig 4a c d with rmse values of 3 597 t ha 1 and 3 460 t ha 1 and nrmse values of 31 7 and 30 2 table 4 respectively these results show that the model performed poorly for deficit irrigation at the jointing and heading stages in 2013 and 2014 the estimated and observed values of biomass were close only in the early and middle growth stages but after that the estimated values did not match the observed values because the estimated biomass values continued to increase and the observed values tended to be constant fig 4g p in 2015 the parameterized model estimated the final biomass for ck well but it underestimated the biomass from 100 days to 130 days after sowing fig 4q andarzian et al 2011 used aquacrop to model wheat growth under hot and dry weather conditions in southern iran they showed that the model can estimate wheat biomass accumulation well for full and deficit irrigation treatments but slightly overestimates biomass accumulation hsiao et al 2009 parameterized and validated an aquacrop model for maize and found that rmse ranged from 0 58 t ha 1 to 6 18 t ha 1 and that d ranged from 0 915 to 0 999 this finding was similar to our results where rmse ranges from 0 802 t ha 1 to 3 597 t ha 1 and d ranges from 0 914 to 0 997 our study also shows that the parameterized model can generally simulate biomass well for the early and middle stages but overestimates it at the late stage this occurs because the calculation of biomass in an aquacrop model section 2 4 equation 3 uses the same value of wp during the whole growth period we found that wp varied over different growth stages fig 2 for example wp at the late stage decreased significantly if the model were to use different wp values for different growth stages then biomass accumulation would be estimated more accurately especially in the late stage hsiao et al 2009 also found that for maize wp changes according to growth period they showed a sharp increase in wp at the beginning of the growth period followed by a steady gradual rate of change and then ending with a decrease for one to several data points sampled near the end of the crop life cycle this behavior is similar to what we found hsiao et al 2009 also did not consider a change of wp in their aquacrop model and only used the stable middle portion the time period from cc 70 to 25 lai senescence to derive wp by fitting a linear equation they also found errors in the estimation of biomass accumulation especially in the mature stage which again is similar to our results however hsiao et al 2009 thought that the biomass was underestimated because either wp or kctr x was too small katerji et al 2013 studied maize in a mediterranean climate and found that the aquacrop model can generally estimate biomass accurately in the first half of the growth stage with full irrigation treatment but that the model overestimates biomass significantly in the last half of the period again this result is similar to our findings 3 2 3 water content of the soil profile fig 5 shows the soil water content swc of the profile 0 to100 cm estimated by the default and parameterized models for the growing seasons in the period 2013 2015 the parameterized simulations provided results that were closer to observed values than the default simulations paredes et al 2014 also found differences when simulating swc using the default parameters for maize the goodness of fit indicators for swc are given in table 5 the parameterized model gave good estimates of swc under all irrigation treatments with r2 rmse nrmse ef and d of 0 736 33 1 mm 15 2 0 364 and 0 854 respectively table 5 for different treatments r2 rmse nrmse ef and d ranged from 0 594 to 0 932 15 6 mm to 56 0 mm 7 0 to 34 1 2 372 to 0 883 and 0 574 0 971 respectively these values indicate that there is an error in the parameterized model calculation of swc in 2013 the model estimated swc well for the early and middle stages but overestimated swc for the late stage fig 5a c in 2014 the model overestimated swc during the whole growth period for all the treatments fig 5d j in 2015 the parameterized model overestimated swc in stage ir1 but gave good estimates of swc for all other treatments fig 5k q hsiao et al 2009 found that the rate of decrease for estimated swc is slightly less than that for observed swc and that swc is overestimated by 80 mm by the end of the season we observed a similar phenomenon in this study such as for treatments ck and iv2 in 2014 and iv1 in 2015 moreover previous studies have shown that the aquacrop model can simulate the variation in swc but that it overestimates swc during the growth period farahani et al 2009 hussein et al 2011 zeleke et al 2011 paredes et al 2014 toumi et al 2016 a finding that is similar to our results however araya et al 2010b and iqbal et al 2014 found that the aquacrop model generally estimates a lower swc than is observed which might be related to differences in soil textures 3 2 4 final biomass harvest index and yield the estimated values of final biomass b harvest index hi and yield y from the different irrigation treatments over the period 2012 2015 were compared with the observed values as shown in table 6 the difference between the observed value and the estimated value is given as a percentage of the observed value as shown in table 6 among 23 treatments the difference between the estimated and observed values of b was 5 for 4 treatments 15 for 12 treatments 30 for 19 treatments and 30 for 4 treatments these results show that the parameterized aquacrop model generally estimated b well but that there are errors in the calculation possible reasons for the errors are a one fixed value of wp was used for all varieties of maize for seed production leading to systematic errors for every specific cultivar for example the actual wp 18 1 g m 2 in 2013 was smaller than the fixed value 20 9 g m 2 resulting in overestimation of b for all treatments in this year and b the aquacrop model uses a single wp value over the whole growth period but we observed that the wp of maize for seed production varied over the different growth stages hsiao et al 2009 parameterized the aquacrop model for maize in a mediterranean climate and found that among 13 treatments the difference between the estimated and observed biomass is 5 for 5 treatments and 10 for 8 treatments and that the greatest difference is 22 these results are better than our results on maize for seed production in an inland arid climate it is worth noting that wp of different cultivars varied from 30 3 g m 2 to 33 2 g m 2 in hsiao et al 2009 but that it varies from 18 1 g m 2 to 26 1 g m 2 in our study which accounts for the larger errors in estimates of b that we obtained when the estimated value of hi is compared with the observed value the difference between the values was 5 for 6 treatments 15 for 17 treatments 30 for 20 treatments and 30 for 3 treatments table 6 the reasons for the errors are a the reference harvest index hi0 of the varieties of maize for seed production was fixed to the same value for all simulations and b in the aquacrop model hi is not sensitive to water stress observed hi was in the range 40 2 16 5 with a difference of 23 7 for all irrigation treatments while estimated hi was in the range 33 0 31 9 with a difference of only 1 1 araya et al 2010a validated an aquacrop model for barley and found that the large difference between estimated and observed values of y might have been due to using a single hi value 20 in the model they observed that hi for the cultivars under good conditions varies from 24 to 14 during the experimental period a similar result was found by nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 who observed that hi of maize varied from 22 to 42 whereas the aquacrop model used a constant default value of 48 it has also been reported that the model similarly overestimated y for some varieties of barley and underestimated y for other varieties because of different observed values of hi0 among varieties abrha et al 2012 hsiao et al 2009 suggested that hi is inaccurately estimated under water stress conditions in late stages of crop growth farahani et al 2009 parameterized the aquacrop model for cotton under full and deficit irrigation and showed that the model do not accurately simulate the effect of water stress on hi thus causing errors in the estimation of y accurate simulation of the response of y to water is important for agricultural production especially in an arid region where agriculture depends heavily on irrigation we found that for y among 23 treatments the differences between the observed and estimated values were 5 for 7 treatments 15 for 13 treatments 30 for 16 treatments and 30 for 7 treatments table 6 these results show that the parameterized aquacrop model was somewhat accurate but that it contained errors the errors in estimated values of y resulted from the errors in estimations of b and hi under different water stress conditions as water stress increased the estimate of y gradually became less accurate severe water stress in 2013 resulted in poor model performance heng et al 2009 found that the aquacrop model produces good estimates of y for no water stress and mild water stress treatments but not for severe water stress treatments especially during the senescence period katerji et al 2013 modelled maize growth using aquacrop and found that the model gives inaccurate estimates of y for severe water stress treatments due to inaccurate estimates of cc during the growing season these findings are similar to those in our study which resulted from poor estimations of wp and hi the parameterized model generally simulated crop growth process better than the final b and y however aquacrop is intended to model crop growth in its entirety not simply the outcomes inaccuracies in final b and y are due to variation in normalized water productivity wp during the different growth stages and differences in the harvest index hi under different water stress conditions which are not accurately modelled the calculation formulas in aquacrop must be improved since parameter adjustment that would result in accurate predictions of b and y may distort other aspects of the model although the parameterized model produces some inaccurate estimates of cc b y and swc it has the following advantages a it is simple and needs fewer calibrated parameters than other crop models b using the same parameters for different varieties of maize makes the model more widely applicable c the model can accommodate diverse and complicated irrigation treatments which increases the viability of the model with respect to water stress conditions d crop phenology is the same for all applications which maintains the simplicity of the model on the other hand the use of the same soil parameters for all irrigation treatments in the parameterized model can result in errors the climate may also affect the simulation from 2012 2015 measured precipitation ranged from 68 mm to 236 mm and et0 ranged from 525 mm to 667 mm however overall the conservative parameters used in this study gave acceptably accurate results and we conclude that the parameterized aquacrop model can be used to simulate full and deficit irrigated maize for seed production under plastic film mulch in an arid region of northwest china as well as in regions with similar landscape and climate 4 conclusions we calibrated the default parameters of the aquacrop model in order use it as a parameterized model to simulate the growth of maize grown for seed production we used a large amount of experimental data gathered in the period 2012 2015 for parameterization our results show that the parameterized model was more accurate than the default model the following conclusions were drawn the parameterized model did not accurately predict canopy cover when there was severe water stress the model was sensitive to water stress during the vegetative stage but underestimated canopy cover the model was not sensitive to water stress during senescence and overestimated canopy cover the parameterized model accurately estimated biomass in early and middle growth stages but overestimated biomass in the maturing stage thus diminishing the overall accuracy of biomass estimation the calculation of harvest index was not sensitive to severe water stress which led to error in the estimate of yield the model accurately simulated variations in the trend of soil water content but in general it overestimated soil water content future studies can be performed to increase the simulation accuracy for b and y and thus the discrepancies between the simulated and measured values could be substantially reduced for example simulation of the variation of wp in the growth period and the differences of hi under different water stress conditions might be improved in the aquacrop model four cultivars were used in this study the influence of the particular cultivar in the parameter estimation was not the focus of this study but will be part of our future studies in addition it will be interesting to identify any correlation between water stress and crop yield in the future the parameterized aquacrop model can also be used to optimize the deficit irrigation schedule and to simulate the impact of future climate change on agricultural production and to model potential countermeasures acknowledgements we are extremely grateful to the

have incentivized growers to adopt more water efficient alternatives to traditional furrow or flood irrigation in arid and semi arid agroecosystems subsurface drip irrigation ssd can be managed to increase irrigation water productivity iwp li et al 2016 sadras 2009 by delivering frequent small volumes of irrigation water to subsurface soils containing maximum crop root length density which increases yields decreases evaporative losses ayars et al 1999 and reduces weed density and water usage sutton et al 2006 use of ssd also decreases emissions of greenhouse gases such as n2o aguilera et al 2013 ayars et al 2015 kallenbach et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 highlighting the potential of drip irrigation as a climate smart practice for both climate change adaptation and mitigation however trade offs often emerge between maximizing short term production and ensuring sustainable long term production and unintended consequences of ssd for microbial processes and soil health remain to be explored soil biological and physicochemical parameters are closely linked to soil moisture austin et al 2004 and are consequently predicted to respond to irrigation system dependent heterogeneity including a more concentrated wetting zone and milder wet dry cycles under drip irrigation ssd delivers water and dissolved nutrients to a wetting bulb that affects a relatively small soil volume while displacing salts only to its periphery whether the transition to drip irrigation incurs negative tradeoffs for soil health at the field scale including microbial communities and associated processes remains unclear downstream impacts on mineralization dynamics and soil carbon sequestration potential are also uncertain even in the short term choice of irrigation system could have far reaching impacts on soil resource availability and crop yields wet dry cycles and interactions among water nitrogen and salinity can affect microbial community structure fierer et al 2003 holland et al 2013 and biogeochemical cycling burger et al 2005 fierer and schimel 2002 but remain poorly studied in the context of drastic and widespread shifts in irrigation technology ayars et al 2015 microbial processes such as c and n cycling could be enhanced in the wetting zone of micro irrigation systems where soil moisture root derived carbon and nutrients co occur kuzyakov and blagodatskaya 2015 smart et al 2011 an understanding of how drip irrigation affects temporal and spatial distribution of c and n cycling is especially critical in organically managed systems which must meet crop nutrient requirements through mineralization of soil organic inputs pang and letey 2000 mineralization of soil organic matter e g cover crop residues compost or manures must coincide with the timing of maximum n demand to avoid yield lags and penalties relative to systems receiving inorganic fertilizer but little attention has been paid to potential differences in mineralization dynamics between ssd and furrow irrigated fi systems soil salinity can be an additional management concern particularly in semi arid or arid climates concentrations of salinity throughout the soil profile differ between ssd and fi systems berrada et al 2006 choudhary et al 2010 salts dissolved in irrigation water are transported from buried drip lines to the surface through mass flow in response to evapotranspiration and can accumulate there as well as at the periphery of the wetting bulb hanson and bendixen 1995 accumulation of salts in the root zone could limit yields if salts are not sufficiently leached and may exacerbate the negative effects of wet dry cycles on soil microorganisms rath et al 2017 given the fundamental role of microbial communities in soil aggregation and som formation six et al 2004 2006 potential tradeoffs could extend to long term soil health and c sequestration c sequestration is affected by physical protection through aggregation and mineral binding and biochemical stabilization through microbial activity kallenbach et al 2016 both of which may be affected by variation in soil moisture repeated and severe wet dry cycles under furrow irrigation could cause the breakdown of macroaggregates during the first few cycles and alter c distribution across aggregates denef et al 2001 as compared to more consistently moist drip irrigated soils alternatively insufficient moisture outside the wetting zone in drip treatments could inhibit microbial activity and som cycling and therefore reduce aggregation the relative importance of these mechanisms and the magnitude of irrigation system dependent effects will determine whether short term productivity gains occur at the cost of reduced c sequestration and soil building mechanisms regulating cropping system productivity in the longer term processing tomato production in california is increasingly reliant on drip irrigation ayars et al 2015 highlighting the need for more integrated assessment of benefits and potential tradeoffs and interacting soil and crop properties in irrigated agroecosystems soil health is key to the sustainability of irrigated tomato cropping systems in general and particularly crucial to organic production given its greater reliance on soil organic matter doran 2002 highlighting the necessity of assessing impacts beyond the scale of a single growing season the goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of conversion of an organic field to ssd using a systems approach integrating diverse agronomic soil and microbiological parameters and to test whether potential tradeoffs can be mitigated through ssd configuration installing two driplines spaced slightly apart could expand the lateral wetting zone compared to a single dripline and minimize the negative tradeoffs potentially resulting from localized soil moisture objectives included the assessment of shifts in i irrigation system dependent spatiotemporal variation

differences in lateral spacing of driplines the shape of the wetting zone did not differ significantly between ddi and sdi such that soil moisture was not significantly different at any location

activity fda was higher in the center of the bed in ssd treatments and decreased towards the furrows fig 4a a contrasting pattern was observed in fi beds in which fda was lower in the middle of the bed than at intermediate distances although activity was still lowest at the shoulder of the bed fig 4a bg activity was relatively evenly distributed in ssd beds but fi beds showed a sharp gradient in activity with a peak in the center of the bed and low activity near the furrow fig 4b nag activity was spatially heterogeneous but the pattern was similar across treatments fig 4c 3 5 soil aggregation

contained in macroaggregates in fi as compared to only 17 in sdi the percentage of c in microaggregates was similar between treatments but 53 of soil c was found in the silt and clay fraction in sdi as compared to 29 in fi 4 discussion we characterized irrigation system dependent variation in soil moisture and n distribution microbial processes impacts on accumulation of salts and indicators of long term effects on soil aggregation and c sequestration assessing how agroecosystem functions may be affected by conversion to ssd is especially relevant for organic systems which face a unique set of challenges for weed management and crop nutrition we confirmed well known benefits of ssd for water conservation and weed suppression but also provided preliminary evidence of tradeoffs with potential impacts on long term system functions fig 6 first our results show a trend towards yield lags in the second year following conversion to ssd which is consistent with anecdotal observation from organic growers in california and is perceived as a major impediment to adoption though not statistically significant p 0 0511 this trend highlights the difficulty of maintaining integrated fertility management strategies in ssd systems and the need for more research addressing how to effectively meet dynamic crop nutrient demands in these systems as expected the distribution of soil resources was affected by irrigation treatment but linkages with yields and productivity remain unclear given our poor understanding of root distribution as affected by irrigation management schmidt and gaudin 2017 tomato root development appears to be surprisingly sparse and independent of n concentrations under furrow irrigation jackson and bloom 1990 but highly responsive to the location of fertigation lines under ssd zotarelli et al 2009 variation in dominant nitrogen species would likely affect yields only if substantial differences between irrigation treatments occur in the depletion zone around roots in the future direct comparisons of root distribution under different irrigation treatments at different phenological stages would help clarify how shifts in resource heterogeneity may affect crop productivity the distributions of water nitrate and salinity differed among irrigation treatments with most of the significant differences occurring in the center of the bed at the 40 60 cm depth table 2 supplementary fig 1 higher gwc lower nitrate but not ammonium and lower salinity at this location may indicate displacement of mobile species by excess irrigation water in the fi treatment salinity concentrations although slightly higher in ssd treatments remained relatively low the maximum soil ec values measured were well below the threshold value of 2 5 ds m 1 at which tomato yields are negatively impacted by salinity cahn 2017 patterns of microbial and enzyme activity which are critical drivers of productivity in organic systems were highly heterogeneous and not easily explained by a single abiotic factor fig 4 microbial activity and potential activity of bg tended to be higher at the shoulder of the bed in sdi and ddi activity patterns could potentially correspond to temporal variation in the biochemical structure of c compounds as mineralization occurs as c cycling enzyme activity increases when complex organic compounds predominate allison and vitousek 2005 this hypothesis would indicate a greater prevalence of complex som under ssd perhaps because less intense wet dry cycles favor microbial processing and condensation reactions over wetting induced mineralization further analysis of som structural composition and mineralization dynamics could clarify the potential implications of a transition to ssd for c cycling enzymes treatment effects on aggregate size and c distribution suggest that irrigation management decisions have long term ramifications for soil structure and c sequestration fi had larger soil aggregates in the upper 10 cm of the soil a greater proportion of c in macroaggregates and a lower proportion of c in the unprotected silt and clay fraction than sdi or ddi soc near the surface may thus be less vulnerable to mineralization under furrow irrigation despite more frequent wet dry cycles an initial decrease in macroaggregate fraction followed by stabilization has been observed with repeated wet dry cycles denef et al 2001 consistent with the maintenance of macroaggregates in fi the proportion of c contained in microaggregates was consistent across irrigation treatments indicating that soc stored in this highly protected fraction six et al 2002 is independent of management over the timeframe observed here a decline in macroaggregates under ssd could nonetheless reduce the rate of microaggregate formation decreasing the system s ability to store soc in turn these shifts in soil aggregation may alter water dynamics in agroecosystems and the potential for groundwater recharge by maintaining sufficient porosity to allow infiltration and percolation of winter precipitation and protect som which improves water retention dorado et al 2003 franzluebbers 2002 while the reduced wetting volume of ssd increases short term iwp as measured by crop per unit of irrigation water applied overall system water use efficiency must take into account alterations in microbial activity and processes that affect soil structure soc and regulation by agroecosystem scale plant soil water relations yields were not significantly different between ddi and sdi treatments in either year closer lateral spacing of driplines increases the uniformity of soil moisture when the maximum horizontal infiltration distance is limited e g to 30 cm zhou et al 2017 but this did not appear to affect rhizosphere processes contributing to yield whether soil moisture is indeed more evenly distributed in the rhizosphere under ddi should be assessed using advanced imaging techniques neutron radiography or tomography have been effectively utilized for direct visualization of water distribution at a higher spatial resolution in studies under controlled conditions e g carminati et al 2010 moradi et al 2011 and future extension of these technologies to the field environment would greatly aid understanding of rhizosphere processes although a detailed economic analysis is beyond the scope presented here a slight and non significant yield increase under ddi would likely not compensate for the increased investment and maintenance costs of doubling the length of dripline 5 conclusions the present study took place in the two years following ssd installation in an organic management system effects of irrigation treatment were apparent not only on short term metrics such as iwp and weed density but also on soil biological and physicochemical parameters connected to biogeochemical cycling such shifts in agroecosystem properties in only two years highlight the potential for dramatic effects over an extended timeframe and at a large spatial scale given the rapidly increasing surface area under ssd current discussion of ssd implementation strongly influenced by the ongoing drought in california has focused primarily on increased iwp but findings of the present study call for a broader perspective that includes long term implications for different nutrient management systems unexpected tradeoffs should be incorporated into the discourse to avoid sacrificing future soil health and soil health building processes for present yield benefits conflicts of interest none

11499,subsurface drip ssd irrigation is becoming increasingly prevalent in drought prone irrigated agroecosystems thanks to greater yields and irrigation water productivity iwp and decreased weed

have incentivized growers to adopt more water efficient alternatives to traditional furrow or flood irrigation in arid and semi arid agroecosystems subsurface drip irrigation ssd can be managed to increase irrigation water productivity iwp li et al 2016 sadras 2009 by delivering frequent small volumes of irrigation water to subsurface soils containing maximum crop root length density which increases yields decreases evaporative losses ayars et al 1999 and reduces weed density and water usage sutton et al 2006 use of ssd also decreases emissions of greenhouse gases such as n2o aguilera et al 2013 ayars et al 2015 kallenbach et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 highlighting the potential of drip irrigation as a climate smart practice for both climate change adaptation and mitigation however trade offs often emerge between maximizing short term production and ensuring sustainable long term production and unintended consequences of ssd for microbial processes and soil health remain to be explored soil biological and physicochemical parameters are closely linked to soil moisture austin et al 2004 and are consequently predicted to respond to irrigation system dependent heterogeneity including a more concentrated wetting zone and milder wet dry cycles under drip irrigation ssd delivers water and dissolved nutrients to a wetting bulb that affects a relatively small soil volume while displacing salts only to its periphery whether the transition to drip irrigation incurs negative tradeoffs for soil health at the field scale including microbial communities and associated processes remains unclear downstream impacts on mineralization dynamics and soil carbon sequestration potential are also uncertain even in the short term choice of irrigation system could have far reaching impacts on soil resource availability and crop yields wet dry cycles and interactions among water nitrogen and salinity can affect microbial community structure fierer et al 2003 holland et al 2013 and biogeochemical cycling burger et al 2005 fierer and schimel 2002 but remain poorly studied in the context of drastic and widespread shifts in irrigation technology ayars et al 2015 microbial processes such as c and n cycling could be enhanced in the wetting zone of micro irrigation systems where soil moisture root derived carbon and nutrients co occur kuzyakov and blagodatskaya 2015 smart et al 2011 an understanding of how drip irrigation affects temporal and spatial distribution of c and n cycling is especially critical in organically managed systems which must meet crop nutrient requirements through mineralization of soil organic inputs pang and letey 2000 mineralization of soil organic matter e g cover crop residues compost or manures must coincide with the timing of maximum n demand to avoid yield lags and penalties relative to systems receiving inorganic fertilizer but little attention has been paid to potential differences in mineralization dynamics between ssd and furrow irrigated fi systems soil salinity can be an additional management concern particularly in semi arid or arid climates concentrations of salinity throughout the soil profile differ between ssd and fi systems berrada et al 2006 choudhary et al 2010 salts dissolved in irrigation water are transported from buried drip lines to the surface through mass flow in response to evapotranspiration and can accumulate there as well as at the periphery of the wetting bulb hanson and bendixen 1995 accumulation of salts in the root zone could limit yields if salts are not sufficiently leached and may exacerbate the negative effects of wet dry cycles on soil microorganisms rath et al 2017 given the fundamental role of microbial communities in soil aggregation and som formation six et al 2004 2006 potential tradeoffs could extend to long term soil health and c sequestration c sequestration is affected by physical protection through aggregation and mineral binding and biochemical stabilization through microbial activity kallenbach et al 2016 both of which may be affected by variation in soil moisture repeated and severe wet dry cycles under furrow irrigation could cause the breakdown of macroaggregates during the first few cycles and alter c distribution across aggregates denef et al 2001 as compared to more consistently moist drip irrigated soils alternatively insufficient moisture outside the wetting zone in drip treatments could inhibit microbial activity and som cycling and therefore reduce aggregation the relative importance of these mechanisms and the magnitude of irrigation system dependent effects will determine whether short term productivity gains occur at the cost of reduced c sequestration and soil building mechanisms regulating cropping system productivity in the longer term processing tomato production in california is increasingly reliant on drip irrigation ayars et al 2015 highlighting the need for more integrated assessment of benefits and potential tradeoffs and interacting soil and crop properties in irrigated agroecosystems soil health is key to the sustainability of irrigated tomato cropping systems in general and particularly crucial to organic production given its greater reliance on soil organic matter doran 2002 highlighting the necessity of assessing impacts beyond the scale of a single growing season the goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of conversion of an organic field to ssd using a systems approach integrating diverse agronomic soil and microbiological parameters and to test whether potential tradeoffs can be mitigated through ssd configuration installing two driplines spaced slightly apart could expand the lateral wetting zone compared to a single dripline and minimize the negative tradeoffs potentially resulting from localized soil moisture objectives included the assessment of shifts in i irrigation system dependent spatiotemporal variation in resource availability ii resulting effects on mineralization dynamics and yields and iii preliminary indicators of impacts on soil health and c sequestration in an organic tomato production system

fertigation lines under ssd zotarelli et al 2009 variation in dominant nitrogen species would likely affect yields only if substantial differences between irrigation treatments occur in the depletion zone around roots in the future direct comparisons of root distribution under different irrigation treatments at different phenological stages would help clarify how shifts in resource heterogeneity may affect crop productivity the distributions of water nitrate and salinity differed among irrigation treatments with most of the significant differences occurring in the center of the bed at the 40 60 cm depth table 2 supplementary fig 1 higher gwc lower nitrate but not ammonium and lower salinity at this location may indicate displacement of mobile species by excess irrigation water in the fi treatment salinity concentrations although slightly higher in ssd treatments remained relatively low the maximum soil ec values measured were well below the threshold value of 2 5 ds m 1 at which tomato yields are negatively impacted by salinity cahn 2017 patterns of microbial and enzyme activity which are critical drivers of productivity in organic systems were highly heterogeneous and not easily explained by a single abiotic factor fig 4 microbial activity and potential activity of bg tended to be higher at the shoulder of the bed in sdi and ddi activity patterns could potentially correspond to temporal variation in the biochemical structure of c compounds as mineralization occurs as c cycling enzyme activity increases when complex organic compounds predominate allison and vitousek 2005 this hypothesis would indicate a greater prevalence of complex som under ssd perhaps because less intense wet dry cycles favor microbial processing and condensation reactions over wetting induced mineralization further analysis of som structural composition and mineralization dynamics could clarify the potential implications of a transition to ssd for c cycling enzymes treatment effects on aggregate size and c distribution suggest that irrigation management decisions have long term ramifications for soil structure and c sequestration fi had larger soil aggregates in the upper 10 cm of the soil a greater proportion of c in macroaggregates and a lower proportion of c in the unprotected silt and clay fraction than sdi or ddi soc near the surface may thus be less vulnerable to mineralization under furrow irrigation despite more frequent wet dry cycles an initial decrease in macroaggregate fraction followed by stabilization has been observed with repeated wet dry cycles denef et al 2001 consistent with the maintenance of macroaggregates in fi the proportion of c contained in microaggregates was consistent across irrigation treatments indicating that soc stored in this highly protected fraction six et al 2002 is independent of management over the timeframe observed here a decline in macroaggregates under ssd could nonetheless reduce the rate of microaggregate formation decreasing the system s ability to store soc in turn these shifts in soil aggregation may alter water dynamics in agroecosystems and the potential for groundwater recharge by maintaining sufficient porosity to allow infiltration and percolation of winter precipitation and protect som which improves water retention dorado et al 2003 franzluebbers 2002 while the reduced wetting volume of ssd increases short term iwp as measured by crop per unit of irrigation water applied overall system water use efficiency must take into account alterations in microbial activity and processes that affect soil structure soc and regulation by agroecosystem scale plant soil water relations yields were not significantly different between ddi and sdi treatments in either year closer lateral spacing of driplines increases the uniformity of soil moisture when the maximum horizontal infiltration distance is limited e g to 30 cm zhou et al 2017 but this did not appear to affect rhizosphere processes contributing to yield whether soil moisture is indeed more evenly distributed in the rhizosphere under ddi should be assessed using advanced imaging techniques neutron radiography or tomography have been effectively utilized for direct visualization of water distribution at a higher spatial resolution in studies under controlled conditions e g carminati et al 2010 moradi et al 2011 and future extension of these technologies to the field environment would greatly aid understanding of rhizosphere processes although a detailed economic analysis is beyond the scope presented here a slight and non significant yield increase under ddi would likely not compensate for the increased investment and maintenance costs of doubling the length of dripline 5 conclusions the present study took place in the two years following ssd installation in an organic management system effects of irrigation treatment were apparent not only on short term metrics such as iwp and weed density but also on soil biological and physicochemical parameters connected to biogeochemical cycling such shifts in agroecosystem properties in only two years highlight the potential for dramatic effects over an extended timeframe and at a large spatial scale given the rapidly increasing surface area under ssd current discussion of ssd implementation strongly influenced by the ongoing drought in california has focused primarily on increased iwp but findings of the present study call for a broader perspective that includes long term implications for different nutrient management systems unexpected tradeoffs should be incorporated into the discourse to avoid sacrificing future soil health and soil health building processes for present yield benefits conflicts of interest none
