14890,for public health consideration it is important to ensure the wastewater discharged from wastewater treatment plant is within the regulatory limits this problem can be effectively solved by improving the accuracy and rapid characterization of water quality parameters and odor concentration of wastewater in this paper we proposed a novel solution to realize the precisive analysis of water quality parameters and odor concentration of wastewater by the electronic nose device the main work of this paper was divided into three steps 1 recognizing wastewater samples qualitatively from different sampling points 2 analyzing the correlation between electronic nose response signals and water quality parameters and odor concentration and 3 predicting the odor concentration and water quality parameters quantitatively combined with different feature extraction methods support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis were applied as classifiers to recognize samples at different sampling points which reported the best recognition rate of 98 83 partial least squares regression was applied to complete the second step and r2 was reaching 0 992 as for the third step ridge regression was used to predict water quality parameters and odor concentration with the rmse less than 0 9476 thus electronic noses can be applied to determine water quality parameters and odor concentrations in the effluent discharged from wastewater plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plants electronic nose water quality parameters odor concentration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater discharge exceeding the regulatory limits of wastewater treatment plants wwtp is an important source of environmental pollution every year a great quantity of harmful pollutants present in wastewater is discharged into rivers inducing water quality deterioration and potential risks to human health and ecosystems liang et al 2020 saber et al 2020 moreover the malodorous emitted from wastewater will impact the surrounding air yang et al 2019 several diseases are caused by air and water pollution for example air pollution can induce cardiovascular and asthmatic diseases and water pollution may cause skin infections cancer and other diseases leading to millions of deaths around the world every year chen et al 2019 rumana et al 2014 widiana et al 2019 in this sense it is necessary to strengthen the real time detection of wastewater in different phases of wwtp generally the wastewater quality of wwtp is determined by the concentration level of various indicators related to pollutants including chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen an total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp mustafa and hayder 2021 these indicators include basic information on wastewater quality they help determine whether the wastewater meets discharge requirements or not schellenberg et al 2020 common methods such as the dichromate method espa 2017 nessler s reagent spectrophotometry espa 2009 alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method espa 2012 and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method espa 1989 are respectively used for the determination of these indicators in wastewater as for the measurement of odor concentration dynamic olfactometry is the more applied methodology cen 2003 the measurement results of these methods have high accuracy and small relative error however the disadvantages of high cost complex pretreatment and long analysis time strictly limit the possibility of in situ detection applications in particular the dichromate method espa 2017 also requires the use of highly toxic reagents which is dangerous thus the traditional detection methods are not suitable for in situ and rapid characterization of wastewater in wwtp it is necessary to mention that headspace gas hg may help to determine pollution indicators of wastewater it has been reported that cod an and tn in wastewater can be determined by detecting hg fang et al 2010 guz et al 2015 although no report that the tp content could be measured by detecting the hg relevant research showed that tp in wastewater will be converted into phosphine gas ph3 yu et al 2022 according to henry s law and gas equilibrium mechanism the ph3 content in the headspace gas is related to the tp concentration thus it may be an interesting attempt to measure these indicators by detecting the hg choosing an appropriate gas odor detection equipment is the first task for odor measurements an electronic nose e nose is a new type of detection equipment its working mode is similar to the mammal olfactory system persaud and dodd 1982 the device is mainly composed of a sensor array simulating olfactory cells and machine learning algorithms simulating the working mode of the brain gu et al 2020 compared with other gas odor measurement equipment there are some features in the e nose these concomitantly support gas and odor analysis as well as temperature humidity and other variables allow continuous monitoring of environmental odor and also doing both qualitative and quantitative analysis blanco rodriguez et al 2018 for continuous odor monitoring can be used to estimate odor concentration in real time to prevent it from exceeding regulatory limits a related difficulty of e noses is that the sensor array is non specific and they can generate signals for multiple volatile substances the odor released from wwtp is usually composed of multi volatile substances thus the e nose is appropriate for comprehensively characterizing the odor of wastewater and deeply mining the information about the operation of wwtp contained in the odor moufid et al 2022 in fact the e nose has been successfully applied in several assessments various e noses have also been applied to wastewater odor assessment moufid et al 2022 proposed an e nose system with six sensors and combined it with gas chromatography mass spectrometry to identify different wastewater samples the e nose presented by pilat rozek et al 2023 was able to discriminate odor samples from five different sampling points gao et al 2022 represented qualitative differences between raw sludge and sludge cake samples through sensors profiles features in radar plots while zarra et al 2022 obtained an intensity response of a metal oxide semiconductor sensor array then the normalized resistance values of these input signals were used to predict different sampling point samples and odor concentrations cangialosi et al 2021 implemented classification models through a deep neural network and random forest and lagod et al 2019 used pca to cluster samples collected at the different phases of the wwtp another application was presented by burgues et al 2021 2022 which mounted an e nose on the drone to realize dynamic monitoring of the odor concentration however due to the slightly different weather conditions the prediction accuracy of this application was lower than that of dynamic olfactory measurement despite the advantages and potential of e nose the analysis of wastewater using this device has not been fully explored for instance to characterize the water quality parameters including cod tn an and tp of wastewater inside a wwtp in a comprehensive way in particular no one has tried to measure the content of tp in wastewater by e nose this kind of assessment could be useful to avoid wastewater discharge exceeding regulatory limits consequently a localized control action could be executed to restore the correct operation of the process affected or even to adjust some plant functionalities for proactive purposes this study presents the application of an e nose for qualitative and quantitative wastewater analysis from a wwtp samples from different phases in a wwtp were analyzed the data collected by the e nose was processed by support vector machine svm and linear discriminant analysis lda to discriminate different sampling point samples the chinese standard methods were also used to measure the water quality parameters and odor concentration of samples a correlation between e nose response and the samples water quality parameters or odor concentration was analyzed by partial least squares pls and then ridge regression was used to evaluate the prediction ability of the e nose for these indicators 2 materials and methods the research was performed in a three stage procedure sample collecting measuring and data analysis in the first stage odor and wastewater samples from a wwtp were collected in sampling bottles and sent to the laboratory in the second stage each sample was measured by the e nose and by the chinese standard methods finally obtained data were analyzed to get the experimental results 2 1 samples collecting the wastewater and odor sampling were conducted on a wwtp in changchun city jilin province in china the sampling points in this study refer only to the water treatment line with coarse and fine screen chamber biochemical tank secondary sedimentation tank advanced wastewater treatment and chlorination tank nothing is related to the sludge treatment line fig 1 for treatment wastewater proceeds through coarse screens and fine screens for the removal of suspended substances to avoid damaging the mechanical equipment of the subsequent process coarse screens and fine screens are typical bar screens with 20 mm and 6 mm openings between the bars respectively next wastewater moves into a biochemical tank the biochemical tank adopts a combined process of anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o in this process nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria are mainly used to decompose pollutants in wastewater the wastewater treated by the biochemical tank contains more sludge so it is necessary to separate sludge from water in the secondary sedimentation tank radial ф40m the separated sludge will be transported to a special sludge treatment room and the wastewater will be treated in the next step advanced wastewater treatment is to further improve the quality of wastewater in this process the tiny particles are flocculated into large colloids by adding polyaluminum chloride pac and then the colloid in the water is filtered by clarification finally the wastewater can be safely discharged after being disinfected by chlorine in the chlorination tank from the above introduction it is clear that the phases that have a great impact on the reduction of pollution indicators in wastewater are mainly the last four phases thus the inlet wastewater and the wastewater treated by the last four phases would be sampled for the analysis of water quality parameters for odor analysis odor samples were mainly collected in the screen chamber because the odor concentration is the largest there for wastewater samples these sampling points were located on the wastewater channel inlet channel p1 outlet channel of the biochemical tank p3 outlet channel of the secondary sedimentation tank p4 filter tank outlet channel p5 and outlet channel p6 sampling method put a 3 l sampler organic glass at the sampling point and then the wastewater flowed into the sampler when the sampler was filled with wastewater samples took out the sampler and transferred the wastewater in the sampler into a 500 ml sampling bottle plastic through a rubber tube the sample in the sampling bottle would be sent to the laboratory immediately and the test would be completed within 24 h for odor samples the sampling point was in the screen chamber p2 sampling method active sampling method in the laboratory used a vacuum pump to exhaust the gas in the 10 l sampling bottle glass until the pressure in the bottle was 10 5 pa the vacuum pump was connected to the sampling bottle by a polyethylene pipe in the screen chamber opened the stopper of the sampling bottle filled the sample odor into the sampling bottle to normal pressure closed the stopper and immediately transported it to the laboratory for testing at this stage three types of samples were sampled odor samples for quantitative analysis 200 wastewater samples for qualitative analysis 5 sampling points 40 number of samples per sampling point and 35 wastewater samples for quantitative analysis 5 sampling points 7 sampling batches the time interval of each sampling batch was 5 days it should be noted that the odor samples were diluted to 15 concentrations 15 samples according to the odor dilution method in the standard method espa 1993 the injectors were used to dilute the odor sample 2 2 analysis of wastewater quality parameters and odor concentration 2 2 1 cod analysis method the cod measurements were performed by using a cod automatic digestion reflux instrument khcod 100 china according to the chinese standard hj828 2017 espa 2017 this method is mainly to add a known amount of potassium dichromate solution to the wastewater sample and then calculate the cod concentration by the amount of potassium dichromate consumed the cod concentrations were quantified in milligram per liter mg l 2 2 2 an analysis method the an concentration was measured by using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uvs tu 1810 china according to the chinese standard hj535 2009 espa 2009 the an in wastewater will react with nessler s reagent to form reddish brown complex and the absorbance of the complex is proportional to the content of an the uvs was applied to measure the absorbance at the wavelength of 420 nm the an concentration was quantified in milligram per liter mg l 2 2 3 tn analysis method the tn measurements were performed by using an uvs according to the chinese standard hj636 2012 espa 2012 this method mainly used alkaline potassium persulfate solution to convert the nitrogen of nitrogen compounds in wastewater into nitrate and then the uvs was applied to measure the absorbance at the wavelength of 220 nm and 275 nm respectively the corrected absorbance was equal to the absorbance at the wavelength of 220 nm minus twice the absorbance at 275 nm the corrected absorbance is proportional to the content of total nitrogen the tn concentration was quantified in milligram per liter mg l 2 2 4 tp analysis method the tp measurements were performed by using an uvs according to the chinese standard gb11893 1989 espa 1989 adding potassium persulfate to wastewater sample will oxidize the phosphorus in the wastewater to orthophosphate which will react with ammonium molybdate to form blue complex measuring the absorbance at the wavelength of 700 nm by the uvs the tp concentration was quantified in milligram per liter mg l 2 2 5 odor concentration analysis method the odor concentration measurement was performed according to the chinese standard gb t14675 1993 espa 1993 this method was mainly to dilute the odor concentration by gradient configuration through air compressor ol750a china air purification device and injectors the diluted samples were sniffed by six experts the odor concentration is determined by the individual olfactory threshold and average olfactory threshold of six experts the odor concentration detected by this method is no unit the repeatability standard deviation is 2 4 compared with the european standard en 13725 cen 2003 the measurement results of these two methods are consistent and the former has faster sampling speed and use smaller instrument xu and liu 2010 2 3 experimental device and process the experiments of this study were conducted in a self developed e nose system for odor sample and headspace gas analysis the e nose system was composed of hardware system and software system the hardware system included a fluid transportation line a transformer a mos sensor array and a data acquisition instrument fig 2 the software system was composed of different feature extraction methods lda svm pls and ridge regression algorithms 2 3 1 hardware system when selecting the gas sensors thirty two mos sensors were applied in e nose table 1 to maximize the acquisition of odor information during the detection process although the main detection objects of some gas sensors in table 1 are quite similar due to the non specific characteristics of gas sensors these gas sensors may produce different responses for some volatile substances thus the application of these sensors is necessary to use these sensors for gas detection a simple conditioning circuit recommended by the manufacturer was used fig 3 the input of the circuit was 5 v power supply voltage converted by the transformer the detection gasses induce chemical changes on the sensing material surface which causes variations in the output voltage v of these sensors the output voltage values from the thirty two sensors were sampled with a data acquisition instrument art china the instrument is coupled via usb with a data acquisition program art china this program was running on the computer to command the acquisition process after the data was collected the data will be automatically stored in the set path the fluid transportation line is mainly composed by a gas sensors chamber silicone tubing and an air pump this block allows establishing a four stage measurement sequence baseline passing clean air rising transient passing sample odor steady state maintaining sample odor inside the gas sensors chamber and recovery transient passing clean air again affected by the data acquisition instrument this device only collected the sensor voltage values in the rising transient and steady state stages as the output and the time used in these two stages was called the sampling time when the steady state stage is over the device will immediately output the collected data based on the above hardware system we had completed the odor information collection of samples indoor temperature 18 22 the volume of each wastewater sample was 100 ml and was sealed into a 300 ml conical flask before testing the wastewater samples need to be stand for 15 min to generate headspace gas while the odor samples could be directly connected to the e nose pipeline for testing the working process of the e nose hardware system was mainly divided into two steps 1 the air pump was used to transport the gas in the odor collecting bag or headspace gas into the gas sensors chamber so that the sensor array reacted with the odor sample the flow rate of the air pump is 300 ml min and the ventilation time of the odor sample is 60 s in the ventilation period the sensor voltage was read by the data acquisition instrument and was saved in the computer the sampling frequency and sampling time of the data acquisition instrument were set to 100 hz and 60 s respectively 100 hz means that the output voltage value of the sensor is recorded every 0 01 s 2 before the next measurement clean air was used to purge the gas sensors chamber for 15 min to ensure that the mos sensor response curves return to the baseline location the clean air obtained by an air purification device activated carbon was used to clean the chamber and balance the air pressure of the conical flask during the sampling process when the sample data collection was completed 250 sample data would be obtained each sample data set was a matrix of 6000 100 sampling frequency 60 sampling time rows and 32 number of sensors columns among them 50 samples applied for quantitative analysis were conducted to 4 repeated experiments the data collected by repeated experiments were regard as one sample data 2 3 2 software system 2 3 2 1 data pre processing after sample data acquisition a data pre processing stage was performed this is a basic stage in the e nose because the sensors outputs can contain redundant information blanco rodriguez et al 2018 by this procedure the redundant information from sensor array were removed data pre processing mainly involves feature extraction and normalization for this application five feature extraction methods were applied transient state feature extraction methods fourier transform ft the response signals are used for fourier transform and the transform coefficients are applied as the feature values no unit polynomial curve fitting pcf the sensor response signal is fitted into a polynomial function and the fitting coefficient is taken as the feature value no unit steady state feature extraction methods integral value iv calculating the area below the sensor response curve unit vs max selecting the maximum voltage value vmax from e nose response signal unit v mean calculating the average voltage value for e nose response signal unit v the data processed by the feature extraction methods needs to be normalized before sample analysis the normalization method is shown in eq 1 1 x n o r m x k x m e a n x s t a n where x k is the input data x m e a n is the mean of data series x s t a n is the standard deviation of data series 2 3 2 2 samples analysis quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to characterize water quality parameters and odor concentration of wastewater from a wwtp the trend of the sensors responses across the different treatment phases in the wwtp was associated with the compounds emitted thus the vmax from each sensor response signal was presented in radar chart the vmax value in radar chart was the calculate average from qualitative analysis wastewater samples at each sampling point by this procedure it is possible to represent in a simple way the collection of the wastewater samples at different sampling points due to the non selectivity response of the mos sensors a qualitative analysis by lda and svm was computed to discriminate wastewater collected from different sampling point lda and svm are classical machine learning methods and have been widely used in the field of e nose han et al 2022 zou et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 for lda the basic idea is to minimize the within class variance and maximize the between class variance this problem can be transformed into the solution of objective eq 2 max u t s b u 2 s t u t s w u 1 where s b is the between class scatter matrix s ω is the within class scatter matrix u is the unit vector the expression eq 3 of lda can be obtained by solving eq 2 3 z i w t x i where z i is the projected sample w is the projection matrix x i is the sample feature for svm the process of training model can be regarded as the process of obtaining the decision function eq 5 by solving eq 4 4 min

coefficient used to balance the relaxation variable and the classification boundary 5 f x s i g n i 1 n α i y i k x i x b where k stands for the kernel function of svm radial basis kernel function was used in this paper the features normalized extracted by five feature extraction methods were used as the input parameters to the lda and svm models before qualitative analysis the tenfold cross validation method was used to divide dataset that is 90 of the dataset was used for training and 10 of that was used for testing the classification experiment was repeated 10 times finally the recognition accuracy eq 6 was applied as the evaluation standard of the model in lda the wilks lambda value λ eq 7 was used to evaluate the degree of separation of different sampling point samples 6 recognition accuracy t p t n t p t n f p f n 7 λ s w g s w g s b g where tp is the number of true positives tn is the number of true positives fp is the number of false positives fn is the number of false negatives s w g is the within group variance matrix s b g is the between groups variance matrix regarding quantitative analysis the partial least squares regression pls and ridge regression rr were applied pls is a linear multivariate method that relates two groups of data by looking for a set of regression coefficients pls can obtain the regression coefficient by solving the objective function eq 8 rr is developed on the basis of pls compared with pls there is an additional penalty term on the rr objective function eq 9 both pls and rr are aimed to connect the two groups of data in the way of eq 10 8 a r g m i n w x w y 2 9 a r g m i n w x w y 2 λ w 2 10 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a n x n b where w stands for the coefficient matrix x stands for the independent variable matrix y

for the constant term in this paper averages of vmax normalized from the four repetitions of each sensor and the odor concentration or water quality parameters values obtained by the chinese standard methods were the data applied as the input parameters to the pls and rr models in the pls models these data were applied to establish regression curves to observe the correlation between the e nose response and the water quality parameters and odor concentration the correlation was evaluated by correlation coefficient r square r2 eq 11 and root mean square error rmse eq 12 li et al 2021 pesaran and smith 1994 the prediction ability of e nose to water quality parameters and odor concentration was evaluated by rr models combining with fivefold cross validation 80 of the dataset was used for training 20 of that was used for testing and the experiment was repeated 5 times the evaluation standard was the rmse 11 r 2 1 i 1 n y i p r e y i t r u 2 i 1 n y i t r u y t r u 2 12 r m s e i 1 n y

matlab 2018b the mathworks inc usa the wastewater characterization method is shown in fig 4 3 results 3 1 odor fingerprints the odor fingerprints of wastewater samples at different sampling points were shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a can be perceived different shapes which represent wastewater samples according to their original sampling points in the wwtp the presence of sensor signals vmax without significant changes affected the performance of the odor fingerprint thus to clearly observe whether there was pattern variation among different samples the vmax with significant changes in different samples were used to draw a new odor fingerprint fig 5 b indeed a clear pattern variation among the samples was displayed different vmax from sensor responses was found among different sampling points for example the s12 sensor showed different vmax values between the untreated wastewater p1 and the other wastewater samples it suggests a greater presence of methane and or carbon monoxide in comparison to the other sampling sites from fig 5 b can also be observed that higher sensors reactions were obtained in p3 p4 and p6 sensors that stood out were s2 s8 and s9 this response might be linked to the volatile compounds in wastewater ammonia is a relatively common gas in p3 in addition to some solvent vapors as for the p4 sample hydrogen sulfide and a small amount of aldehyde gas may be produced the wastewater needs to be disinfected with chlorine before discharge so there was chlorine in the p6 sample methane or carbon monoxide may exist in all wastewater samples because the response value of the s12 sensor was large these two gasses are common in wwtp daelman et al 2012 although methane and carbon monoxide are non odorous the mos sensor can still detect them the presence of these non odorous gaseous compounds can help qualitative identification and will not have adverse effects on quantitative identification compared with other sensors the s12 sensor had the largest response value vmax for all samples which indicates that this sensor may be more suitable for characterizing the changing trend of gas compound concentration in the wastewater treatment process blanco rodriguez et al 2018 the vmax value of s12 alternates between decreasing and increasing as the processing phase progresses fig 5 b which may be related to the treatment process the untreated wastewater p1 contained the most pollutants and the vmax value was the highest after treatment in the biochemical tank the pollutants in the wastewater p3 were decomposed and the response signal decreased when detecting the p4 sample the vmax value rose again which may be caused by the sludge in the secondary sedimentation tank the advanced wastewater treatment removed some pollutants that was difficult to remove so this sensor signal decreased for detecting p5 sample for the discharged wastewater p6 the vmax value of this sensor raised again which was caused by chlorine dissolved in the wastewater during the process of chlorine disinfection from the above analysis it can be seen that the odor fingerprint contained wastewater sample information for qualitative and quantitative analysis but it is still difficult to accurately predict new samples only by the odor fingerprint for this purpose machine learning was used to construct qualitative and quantitative prediction models it should be emphasized here that the odor fingerprint drawn with 6 sensors was only for the convenience of observing the change of sensor signals the subsequent qualitative and quantitative analysis data were collected from the 32 sensors 3 2 qualitative identification of wastewater samples using lda and svm in fig 6 a lda and svm models could correctly recognize the wastewater samples from different sampling points with overall recognition accuracies of 94 67 to 98 33 lda and 95 33 to 98 83 svm for the e nose signal in addition the wilks lambda values λ of the lda models based on different feature extraction methods were all less than 0 0005 indicating that the different sampling point samples could achieve good separation in these models compared with the transient feature extraction method the steady state feature extraction method may be more suitable for e nose data mining as the testing set recognition rate of the latter method was higher than that of the previous method compared with the lda classification result the recognition result of svm was better even though the different feature extraction methods had different recognition rates the recognition rates were above 94 67 in particular the recognition rate of lda and svm models based on mean feature extraction method can reach 98 33 and 98 83 this result shows that the five sampling points wastewater samples can be recognized by the lda and svm models in other words the e nose can be used to determine wastewater source in wwtp the svm model based on the mean feature extraction method has a higher recognition rate compared to other models however this does not mean that other models are useless thus to clearly observe the classification result of samples the recognition results based on the three models of mean svm mean lda and ft svm were represented in the confusion matrix fig 6 b c and d p1 and p4 samples were incorrectly identified as p5 and p1 samples respectively as shown in fig 6 b the result shows that when the mean svm model is used for sample recognition the error recognition may be occurring when the recognition results are p5 the true result may be p1 or p1 the true result may be p4 for the mean lda model p1 samples may be identified as p1 p5 or p6 samples while p4 samples may be identified as p3 or p4 samples fig 6 c based on the different recognition results of p1 and p4 samples by the mean lda model this model is suitable for eliminating the possible misjudgment of the mean svm model when the recognition result is p1 in the same way it can be concluded that the ft svm model fig 6 d is suitable for eliminating the possible misjudgment of the mean svm model when the recognition result is p5 based on the above analysis results a two step qualitative identification method for wastewater samples in the wwtp was proposed which applied mean svm as the main classification model and mean lda and ft svm as auxiliary classification models fig 7 this method can improve the recognition accuracy for different wastewater samples 3 3 quantitative prediction of wastewater by pls and rr 3 3 1 the correlation analysis between e nose response signals and water quality parameters and odor concentration in fig 8 the r2 values for odor concentration and water quality parameters models ranged from 0 9920 to 0 9983 which showed that there is a good linear relationship between the e nose response signals and cod an tn tp and odor concentration as for rmse the range was 0 0745 to 15 5895 indicating that from the regression model prediction results are expected an error range around the true value due to the value of rmse being less than 2 33 of the measurement range it is considered suitable for this application however the rmse values of these pollution indicators accounted for 8 46 31 18 of the regulatory limits range espa 2002 indicating that the precision of the regression curves fitted at this time cannot meet the requirements of accurate prediction the inappropriate rmse value of the regression curve may be caused by the improper selection of measurement range thus to prevent misjudgment of samples near the regulatory limit samples with pollution indicators content less than the sum of the regulatory limit and rmse were used to construct the regression curves for the second time when there is no sample with pollution indicator content equal to the sum of regulatory limit and rmse the measurement range should be slightly broadened odor concentration 11 32 no unit cod 73 mg l tn 17 56 mg l an 5 83 mg l tp 0 59 mg l the fitting results of the second regression curves were shown in fig 9 in fig 9 r2 was greater than 0 9989 and the range of rmse was 0 0029 0 1349 the results showed that the regression curves of the second fitting had a better linear relationship than the first fitting and the rmse value was less than 0 90 of the regulatory limits range thus it may be considered suitable for the accurate prediction of water quality parameters and odor concentration by fitting the regression curves twice the relationship between the cod an tn tp and odor concentration and e nose response signals can be explained the fitting results in this paper were good which may be caused by two reasons 1 the e nose system equipped with more sensors was able to obtain more odor information of wastewater 2 the samples for water quality parameter and odor concentration prediction had more concentration gradients which can be better used for regression fitting the regression curves constructed by the pls method used were able to make a linear relationship between the e nose response signals and cod an tn tp and odor concentration it may be possible to predict the odor concentration and water quality parameters emitted from the wastewater treatment process in the wwtp by the e nose 3 3 2 the evaluation of the prediction ability of e nose to pollution indicators in section 3 3 1 the pls method was used to analyze the correlation between e nose response signals and the cod an tn tp and odor concentration and good results were obtained however the prediction ability of the e nose had not been evaluated and this part will be discussed in this section in fig 10 the rmse range of odor concentration and water quality parameters was 0 2881 to 0 9476 the rmse ratios of all pollution indicators to the measurement ranges were not greater than 0 056 the result showed that the e nose combined with the rr method could be applied as a detection tool for these pollution indicators compared with the regulatory limit value espa 2002 it was found that the rmse value of tp was slightly higher than the regulatory limit value of the indicator the result showed that the constructed model was not suitable for determining whether the tp indicator of the wastewater sample meets the discharge standard the main reasons for this result may be the following two points 1 most of the tp content in the wastewater samples used in the training model was greater than the regulatory limit value 2 the number of samples in the training model was small although the e nose could not accurately predict tp content at this time it can still be used as a preliminary evaluation device for tp content due to its short detection time and simple operation except for tp the rmse values of other indicators were far less than the regulatory limit value thus the e nose can accurately predict these pollution indicators 4 discussion compared with the reports of the early e nose used for wastewater odor detection blanco rodriguez et al 2018 gao et al 2022 fang et al 2010 guz et al 2015 the experimental results of this study support their conclusions that the e nose can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the odor and water quality parameters of wastewater from a wwtp the innovation of this study will be discussed from both qualitative and quantitative analysis in terms of qualitative analysis the novelty of this paper was mainly focused on the following two aspects 1 the qualitative analysis of this study was for the convenience of finding the fault phase in time when the detected water quality parameters change in the future thus most sample points were the outlet channel of each treatment phase which is different from other reports moufid et al 2022 2 on the basis of different classification models this study proposed a two step qualitative identification method to further improve the recognition ability of the e nose as for quantitative analysis in this study the prediction results of water quality parameters by e nose were compared with the regulatory limits to show that the e nose has great application potential in this field which was not reported in other papers fang et al 2010 guz et al 2015 in addition when fitting the regression curve this study thinks that for a certain detection indicator it is better to build two regression curves for the prediction of this indicator one for evaluating the approximate range of this indicator and the other for accurate prediction no one had tried to use e nose to detect tp content in wastewater from a wwtp the experimental results of this study showed that the e nose can be used to detect this indicator the phosphide in wastewater will be lost in the form of phosphine gas ph3 yu et al 2022 according to henry s law the content of ph3 in the headspace gas is proportional to the tp content in the wastewater under certain conditions thus this study speculates that ph3 gas could be used as a medium for e nose to detect tp content this is also what we need to do in the future although the application of e nose in this area has great potential there are still some challenges before application first of all further samples need to be collected to establish a good prediction model especially for tp indicator secondly how to reduce the impact of temperature and humidity changes needs to be considered before application finally conduct field tests to evaluate the prediction ability of the e nose in the field 5 conclusions this paper proposed to use e nose to measure the water quality parameters and odor concentration of wastewater in wwtp with simple structure and the ability to detect multiple pollution indicators at one time the tool served as a powerful tool for rapid measurement of these pollution indicators of wastewater and enjoys high practical significance and engineering value the main conclusions are as follows 1 the odor fingerprint can be used to conduct a preliminary assessment of the gaseous mixture of the wwtp in a simple way which will help to estimate the compounds discharged from specific phase in the wwtp 2 to perform lda and svm qualitative analyses of different sampling point wastewater these tools allowed to identify different wastewater samples in addition a two step qualitative identification method was proposed which can further improve the accuracy of the e nose basically these assessments would help to identify which phase possible fails in wwtp 3 the focus of this study was to accurately cod an tn tp and odor concentration by e nose except tp other indicators can be accurately predicted although the e nose cannot be used as an accurate prediction tool for tp content it can be used as a preliminary evaluation tool the results showed that the e nose is suitable as a real time monitoring tool for water quality parameters and odor concentration 4 when constructing regression curves we suggested to construct two regression curves one for evaluating the approximate range of this indicator and the other for accurate prediction this method plays a great role in improving the prediction accuracy declaration of

14890,for public health consideration it is important to ensure the wastewater discharged from wastewater treatment plant is within the regulatory limits this problem can be effectively solved by improving the accuracy and rapid characterization of water quality parameters and odor concentration of wastewater in this paper we proposed a novel solution to realize the precisive analysis of water quality parameters and odor concentration of wastewater by the electronic nose device the main work of this paper was divided into three steps 1 recognizing wastewater samples qualitatively from different sampling points 2 analyzing the correlation between electronic nose response signals and water quality parameters and odor concentration and 3 predicting the odor concentration and water quality parameters quantitatively combined with different feature extraction methods support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis were applied as classifiers to recognize samples at different sampling points which reported the best recognition rate of 98 83 partial least squares regression was applied to complete the second step and r2 was reaching 0 992 as for the third step ridge regression was used to predict water quality parameters and odor concentration with the rmse less than 0 9476 thus electronic noses can be applied to determine water quality parameters and odor concentrations in the effluent discharged from wastewater plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plants electronic nose water quality parameters odor concentration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater discharge exceeding the regulatory limits of wastewater treatment plants wwtp is an important source of environmental pollution every year a great quantity of harmful pollutants present in wastewater is discharged into rivers inducing water quality deterioration and potential risks to human health and ecosystems liang et al 2020 saber et al 2020 moreover the malodorous emitted from wastewater will impact the surrounding air yang et al 2019 several diseases are caused by air and water pollution for example air pollution can induce cardiovascular and asthmatic diseases and water pollution may cause skin infections cancer and other diseases leading to millions of deaths around the world every year chen et al 2019 rumana et al 2014 widiana et al 2019 in this sense it is necessary to strengthen the real time detection of wastewater in different phases of wwtp generally the wastewater quality of wwtp is determined by the concentration level of various indicators related to pollutants including chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen an total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp mustafa and hayder 2021 these indicators include basic information on wastewater quality they help determine whether the wastewater meets discharge requirements or not schellenberg et al 2020 common methods such as the dichromate method espa 2017 nessler s reagent spectrophotometry espa 2009 alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method espa 2012 and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method espa 1989 are respectively used for the determination of these indicators in wastewater as for the measurement of odor concentration dynamic olfactometry is the more applied methodology cen 2003 the measurement results of these methods have high accuracy and small relative error however the disadvantages of high cost complex pretreatment and long analysis time strictly limit the possibility of in situ detection applications in particular the dichromate method espa 2017 also requires the use of highly toxic reagents which is dangerous thus the traditional detection methods are not suitable for in situ and rapid characterization of wastewater in wwtp it is necessary to mention that headspace gas hg may help to determine pollution indicators of wastewater it has been reported that cod an and tn in wastewater can be determined by detecting hg fang et al 2010 guz et al 2015 although no report that the tp content could be measured by detecting the hg relevant research showed that tp in wastewater will be converted into phosphine gas ph3 yu et al 2022 according to henry s law and gas equilibrium mechanism the ph3 content in the headspace gas is related to the tp concentration thus it may be an interesting attempt to measure these indicators by detecting the hg choosing an appropriate gas odor detection equipment is the first task for odor measurements an electronic nose e nose is a new type of detection equipment its working mode is similar to the mammal olfactory system persaud and dodd 1982 the device is mainly composed of a sensor array simulating olfactory cells and machine learning algorithms simulating the working mode of the brain gu et al 2020 compared with other gas odor measurement equipment there are some features in the e nose these concomitantly support gas and odor analysis as well as temperature humidity and other variables allow continuous monitoring of environmental odor and also doing both qualitative and quantitative analysis blanco rodriguez et al 2018 for continuous odor monitoring can be used to estimate odor concentration in real time to prevent it from exceeding regulatory limits a related difficulty of e noses is that the sensor array is non specific and they can generate signals for multiple volatile substances the odor released from wwtp is usually composed of multi volatile substances thus the e nose is appropriate for comprehensively characterizing the odor of wastewater and deeply mining the information about the operation of wwtp contained in the odor moufid et al 2022 in fact the e nose has been successfully applied in several assessments various e noses have also been applied to wastewater odor assessment moufid et al 2022 proposed an e nose system with six sensors and combined it with gas chromatography mass spectrometry to identify different wastewater samples the e nose presented by pilat rozek et al 2023 was able to discriminate odor samples from five different sampling points gao et al 2022 represented qualitative differences between raw sludge and sludge cake samples through sensors profiles features in radar plots while zarra et al 2022 obtained an intensity response of a metal oxide semiconductor sensor array then the normalized resistance values of these input signals were used to predict different sampling point samples and odor concentrations cangialosi et al 2021 implemented classification models through a deep neural network and random forest and lagod et al 2019 used pca to cluster samples collected at the different phases of the wwtp another application was presented by burgues et al 2021 2022 which mounted an e nose on the drone to realize dynamic monitoring of the odor concentration however due to the slightly different weather conditions the prediction accuracy of this application was lower than that of dynamic olfactory measurement despite the advantages and potential of e nose the analysis of wastewater using this device has not been fully explored for instance to characterize the water quality parameters including cod tn an and tp of wastewater inside a wwtp in a comprehensive way in particular no one has tried to measure the content of tp in wastewater by e nose this kind of assessment could be useful to avoid wastewater discharge exceeding regulatory limits consequently a localized control action could be executed to restore the correct operation of the process affected or even to adjust some plant functionalities for proactive purposes this study presents the application of an e nose for qualitative and quantitative wastewater analysis from a wwtp samples from different phases in a wwtp were analyzed the data collected by the e nose was processed by support vector machine svm and linear discriminant analysis lda to discriminate different sampling point samples the chinese standard methods were also used to measure the water quality parameters and odor concentration of samples a correlation between e nose response and the samples water quality parameters or odor concentration was analyzed by partial least squares pls and then ridge regression was used to evaluate the prediction ability of the e nose for these indicators 2 materials and methods the research was performed in a three stage procedure sample collecting measuring and data analysis in the first stage odor and wastewater samples from a wwtp were collected in sampling bottles and sent to the laboratory in the second stage each sample was measured by the e nose and by the chinese standard methods finally obtained data were analyzed to get the experimental results 2 1 samples collecting the wastewater and odor sampling were conducted on a wwtp in changchun city jilin province in china the sampling points in this study refer only to the water treatment line with coarse and fine screen chamber biochemical tank secondary sedimentation tank advanced wastewater treatment and chlorination tank nothing is related to the sludge treatment line fig 1 for treatment wastewater proceeds through coarse screens and fine screens for the removal of suspended substances to avoid damaging the mechanical equipment of the subsequent process coarse screens and fine screens are typical bar screens with 20 mm and 6 mm openings between the bars respectively next wastewater moves into a biochemical tank the biochemical tank adopts a combined process of anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o in this process nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria are mainly used to decompose pollutants in wastewater the wastewater treated by the biochemical tank contains more sludge so it is necessary to separate sludge from water in the secondary sedimentation tank radial ф40m the separated sludge will be transported to a special sludge treatment room and the wastewater will be treated in the next step advanced wastewater treatment is to further improve the quality of wastewater in this process the tiny particles are flocculated into large colloids by adding polyaluminum chloride pac and then the colloid in the water is filtered by clarification finally the wastewater can be safely discharged after being disinfected by chlorine in the chlorination tank from the above introduction it is clear that the phases that have a great impact on the reduction of pollution indicators in wastewater are mainly the last four phases thus the inlet wastewater and the wastewater treated by the last four phases would be sampled for the analysis of water quality parameters for odor analysis odor samples were mainly collected in the screen chamber because the odor concentration is the largest there for wastewater samples these sampling points were located on the wastewater channel inlet channel p1 outlet channel of the biochemical tank p3 outlet channel of the secondary sedimentation tank p4 filter tank outlet channel p5 and outlet channel p6 sampling method put a 3 l sampler organic glass at the sampling point and then the wastewater flowed into the sampler when the sampler was filled with wastewater samples took out the sampler and transferred the wastewater in the sampler into a 500 ml sampling bottle plastic through a rubber tube the sample in the sampling bottle would be sent to the laboratory immediately and the test would be completed within 24 h for odor samples the sampling point was in the screen chamber p2 sampling method active sampling method in the laboratory used a vacuum pump to exhaust the gas in the 10 l sampling bottle glass until the pressure in the bottle was 10 5 pa the vacuum pump was connected to the sampling bottle by a polyethylene pipe in the screen chamber opened the stopper of the sampling bottle filled the sample odor into the sampling bottle to normal pressure closed the stopper and immediately transported it to the laboratory for testing at this stage three types of samples were sampled odor samples for quantitative analysis 200 wastewater samples for qualitative analysis 5 sampling points 40 number of samples per sampling point and 35 wastewater samples for quantitative analysis 5 sampling points 7 sampling batches the time interval of each sampling batch was 5 days it should be noted that the odor samples were diluted to 15 concentrations 15 samples according to the odor dilution method in the standard method espa 1993 the injectors were used to dilute the odor sample 2 2 analysis of wastewater quality parameters and odor concentration 2 2 1 cod analysis method the cod measurements were performed by using a cod automatic digestion reflux instrument khcod 100 china according to the chinese standard hj828 2017 espa 2017 this method is mainly to add a known amount of potassium dichromate solution to the wastewater sample and then calculate the cod concentration by the amount of potassium dichromate consumed the cod concentrations were quantified in milligram per liter mg l 2 2 2 an analysis method the an concentration was measured by using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uvs tu 1810 china according to the chinese standard hj535 2009 espa 2009 the an in wastewater will react with nessler s reagent to form reddish brown complex and the absorbance of the complex is proportional to the content of an the uvs was applied to measure the absorbance at the wavelength of 420 nm the an concentration was quantified in milligram per liter mg l 2 2 3 tn analysis method the tn measurements were performed by using an uvs according to the chinese standard hj636 2012 espa 2012 this method mainly used alkaline potassium persulfate solution to convert the nitrogen of nitrogen compounds in wastewater into nitrate and then the uvs was applied to measure the absorbance at the wavelength of 220 nm and 275 nm respectively the corrected absorbance was equal to the absorbance at the wavelength of 220 nm minus twice the absorbance at 275 nm the corrected absorbance is proportional to the content of total nitrogen the tn concentration was quantified in milligram per liter mg l 2 2 4 tp analysis method the tp measurements were performed by using an uvs according to the chinese standard gb11893 1989 espa 1989 adding potassium persulfate to wastewater sample will oxidize the phosphorus in the wastewater to orthophosphate which will react with ammonium molybdate to form blue complex measuring the absorbance at the wavelength of 700 nm by the uvs the tp concentration was quantified in milligram per liter mg l 2 2 5 odor concentration analysis method the odor concentration measurement was performed according to the chinese standard gb t14675 1993 espa 1993 this method was mainly to dilute the odor concentration by gradient configuration through air compressor ol750a china air purification device and injectors the diluted samples were sniffed by six experts the odor concentration is determined by the individual olfactory threshold and average olfactory threshold of six experts the odor concentration detected by this method is no unit the repeatability standard deviation is 2 4 compared with the european standard en 13725 cen 2003 the measurement results of these two methods are consistent and the former has faster sampling speed and use smaller instrument xu and liu 2010 2 3 experimental device and process the experiments of this study were conducted in a self developed e nose system for odor sample and headspace gas analysis the e nose system was composed of hardware system and software system the hardware system included a fluid transportation line a transformer a mos sensor array and a data acquisition instrument fig 2 the software system was composed of different feature extraction methods lda svm pls and ridge regression algorithms 2 3 1 hardware system when selecting the gas sensors thirty two mos sensors were applied in e nose table 1 to maximize the acquisition of odor information during the detection process although the main detection objects of some gas sensors in table 1 are quite similar due to the non specific characteristics of gas sensors these gas sensors may produce different responses for some volatile substances thus the application of these sensors is necessary to use these sensors for gas detection a simple conditioning circuit recommended by the manufacturer was used fig 3 the input of the circuit was 5 v power supply voltage converted by the transformer the detection gasses induce chemical changes on the sensing material surface which causes variations in the output voltage v of these sensors the output voltage values from the thirty two sensors were sampled with a data acquisition instrument art china the instrument is coupled via usb with a data acquisition program art china this program was running on the computer to command the acquisition process after the data was collected the data will be automatically stored in the set path the fluid transportation line is mainly composed by a gas sensors chamber silicone tubing and an air pump this block allows establishing a four stage measurement sequence baseline passing clean air rising transient passing sample odor steady state maintaining sample odor inside the gas sensors chamber and recovery transient passing clean air again affected by the data acquisition instrument this device only collected the sensor voltage values in the rising transient and steady state stages as the output and the time used in these two stages was called the sampling time when the steady state stage is over the device will immediately output the collected data based on the above hardware system we had completed the odor information collection of samples indoor temperature 18 22 the volume of each wastewater sample was 100 ml and was sealed into a 300 ml conical flask before testing the wastewater samples need to be stand for 15 min to generate headspace gas while the odor samples could be directly connected to the e nose pipeline for testing the working process of the e nose hardware system was mainly divided into two steps 1 the air pump was used to transport the gas in the odor collecting bag or headspace gas into the gas sensors chamber so that the sensor array reacted with the odor sample the flow rate of the air pump is 300 ml min and the ventilation time of the odor sample is 60 s in the ventilation period the sensor voltage was read by the data acquisition instrument and was saved in the computer the sampling frequency and sampling time of the data acquisition instrument were set to 100 hz and 60 s respectively 100 hz means that the output voltage value of the sensor is recorded every 0 01 s 2 before the next measurement clean air was used to purge the gas sensors chamber for 15 min to ensure that the mos sensor response curves return to the baseline location the clean air obtained by an air purification device activated carbon was used to clean the chamber and balance the air pressure of the conical flask during the sampling process when the sample data collection was completed 250 sample data would be obtained each sample data set was a matrix of 6000 100 sampling frequency 60 sampling time rows and 32 number of sensors columns among them 50 samples applied for quantitative analysis were conducted to 4 repeated experiments the data collected by repeated experiments were regard as one sample data 2 3 2 software system 2 3 2 1 data pre processing after sample data acquisition a data pre processing stage was performed this is a basic stage in the e nose because the sensors outputs can contain redundant information blanco rodriguez et al 2018 by this procedure the redundant information from sensor array were removed data pre processing mainly involves feature extraction and normalization for this application five feature extraction methods were applied transient state feature extraction methods fourier transform ft the response signals are used for fourier transform and the transform coefficients are applied as the feature values no unit polynomial curve fitting pcf the sensor response signal is fitted into a polynomial function and the fitting coefficient is taken as the feature value no unit steady state feature extraction methods integral value iv calculating the area below the sensor response curve unit vs max selecting the maximum voltage value vmax from e nose response signal unit v mean calculating the average voltage value for e nose response signal unit v the data processed by the feature extraction methods needs to be normalized before sample analysis the normalization method is shown in eq 1 1 x n o r m x k x m e a n x s t a n where x k is the input data x m e a n is the mean of data series x s t a n is the standard deviation of data series 2 3 2 2 samples analysis quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to characterize water quality parameters and odor concentration of wastewater from a wwtp the trend of the sensors responses across the different treatment phases in the wwtp was associated with the compounds emitted thus the vmax from each sensor response signal was presented in radar chart the vmax value in radar chart was the calculate average from qualitative analysis wastewater samples at each sampling point by this procedure it is possible to represent in a simple way the collection of the wastewater samples at different sampling points due to the non selectivity response of the mos sensors a qualitative analysis by lda and svm was computed to discriminate wastewater collected from different sampling point lda and svm are classical machine learning methods and have been widely used in the field of e nose han et al 2022 zou et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 for lda the basic idea is to minimize the within class variance and maximize the between class variance this problem can be transformed into the solution of objective eq 2 max u t s b u 2 s t u t s w u 1 where s b is the between class scatter matrix s ω is the within class scatter matrix u is the unit vector the expression eq 3 of lda can be obtained by solving eq 2 3 z i w t x i where z i is the projected sample w is the projection matrix x i is the sample feature for svm the process of training model can be regarded as the process of obtaining the decision function eq 5 by solving eq 4 4 min

used in this paper the features normalized extracted by five feature extraction methods were used as the input parameters to the lda and svm models before qualitative analysis the tenfold cross validation method was used to divide dataset that is 90 of the dataset was used for training and 10 of that was used for testing the classification experiment was repeated 10 times finally the recognition accuracy eq 6 was applied as the evaluation standard of the model in lda the wilks lambda value λ eq 7 was used to evaluate the degree of separation of different sampling point samples 6 recognition accuracy t p t n t p t n f p f n 7 λ s w g s w g s b g where tp is the number of true positives tn is the number of true positives fp is the number of false positives fn is the number of false negatives s w g is the within group variance matrix s b g is the between groups variance matrix regarding quantitative analysis the partial least squares regression pls and ridge regression rr were applied pls is a linear multivariate method that relates two groups of data by looking for a set of regression coefficients pls can obtain the regression coefficient by solving the objective function eq 8 rr is developed on the basis of pls compared with pls there is an additional penalty term on the rr objective function eq 9 both pls and rr are aimed to connect the two groups of data in the way of eq 10 8 a r g m i n w x w y 2 9 a r g m i n w x w y 2 λ w 2 10 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a n x n b where w stands for the coefficient matrix x stands for the independent variable matrix y

for the constant term in this paper averages of vmax normalized from the four repetitions of each sensor and the odor concentration or water quality parameters values obtained by the chinese standard methods were the data applied as the input parameters to the pls and rr models in the pls models these data were applied to establish regression curves to observe the correlation between the e nose response and the water quality parameters and odor concentration the correlation was evaluated by correlation coefficient r square r2 eq 11 and root mean square error rmse eq 12 li et al 2021 pesaran and smith 1994 the prediction ability of e nose to water quality parameters and odor concentration was evaluated by rr models combining with fivefold cross validation 80 of the dataset was used for training 20 of that was used for testing and the experiment was repeated 5 times the evaluation standard was the rmse 11 r 2 1 i 1 n y i p r e y i t r u 2 i 1 n y i t r u y t r u 2 12 r m s e i 1 n y

matlab 2018b the mathworks inc usa the wastewater characterization method is shown in fig 4 3 results 3 1 odor fingerprints the odor fingerprints of wastewater samples at different sampling points were shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a can be perceived different shapes which represent wastewater samples according to their original sampling points in the wwtp the presence of sensor signals vmax without significant changes affected the performance of the odor fingerprint thus to clearly observe whether there was pattern variation among different samples the vmax with significant changes in different samples were used to draw a new odor fingerprint fig 5 b indeed a clear pattern variation among the samples was displayed different vmax from sensor responses was found among different sampling points for example the s12 sensor showed different vmax values between the untreated wastewater p1 and the other wastewater samples it suggests a greater presence of methane and or carbon monoxide in comparison to the other sampling sites from fig 5 b can also be observed that higher sensors reactions were obtained in p3 p4 and p6 sensors that stood out were s2 s8 and s9 this response might be linked to the volatile compounds in wastewater ammonia is a relatively common gas in p3 in addition to some solvent vapors as for the p4 sample hydrogen sulfide and a small amount of aldehyde gas may be produced the wastewater needs to be disinfected with chlorine before discharge so there was chlorine in the p6 sample methane or carbon monoxide may exist in all wastewater samples because the response value of the s12 sensor was large these two gasses are common in wwtp daelman et al 2012 although methane and carbon monoxide are non odorous the mos sensor can still detect them the presence of these non odorous gaseous compounds can help qualitative identification and will not have adverse effects on quantitative identification compared with other sensors the s12 sensor had the largest response value vmax for all samples which indicates that this sensor may be more suitable for characterizing the changing trend of gas compound concentration in the wastewater treatment process blanco rodriguez et al 2018 the vmax value of s12 alternates between decreasing and increasing as the processing phase progresses fig 5 b which may be related to the treatment process the untreated wastewater p1 contained the most pollutants and the vmax value was the highest after treatment in the biochemical tank the pollutants in the wastewater p3 were decomposed and the response signal decreased when detecting the p4 sample the vmax value rose again which may be caused by the sludge in the secondary sedimentation tank the advanced wastewater treatment removed some pollutants that was difficult to remove so this sensor signal decreased for detecting p5 sample for the discharged wastewater p6 the vmax value of this sensor raised again which was caused by chlorine dissolved in the wastewater during the process of chlorine disinfection from the above analysis it can be seen that the odor fingerprint contained wastewater sample information for qualitative and quantitative analysis but it is still difficult to accurately predict new samples only by the odor fingerprint for this purpose machine learning was used to construct qualitative and quantitative prediction models it should be emphasized here that the odor fingerprint drawn with 6 sensors was only for the convenience of observing the change of sensor signals the subsequent qualitative and quantitative analysis data were collected from the 32 sensors 3 2 qualitative identification of wastewater samples using lda and svm in fig 6 a lda and svm models could correctly recognize the wastewater samples from different sampling points with overall recognition accuracies of 94 67 to 98 33 lda and 95 33 to 98 83 svm for the e nose signal in addition the wilks lambda values λ of the lda models based on different feature extraction methods were all less than 0 0005 indicating that the different sampling point samples could achieve good separation in these models compared with the transient feature extraction method the steady state feature extraction method may be more suitable for e nose data mining as the testing set recognition rate of the latter method was higher than that of the previous method compared with the lda classification result the recognition result of svm was better even though the different feature extraction methods had different recognition rates the recognition rates were above 94 67 in particular the recognition rate of lda and svm models based on mean feature extraction method can reach 98 33 and 98 83 this result shows that the five sampling points wastewater samples can be recognized by the lda and svm models in other words the e nose can be used to determine wastewater source in wwtp the svm model based on the mean feature extraction method has a higher recognition rate compared to other models however this does not mean that other models are useless thus to clearly observe the classification result of samples the recognition results based on the three models of mean svm mean lda and ft svm were represented in the confusion matrix fig 6 b c and d p1 and p4 samples were incorrectly identified as p5 and p1 samples respectively as shown in fig 6 b the result shows that when the mean svm model is used for sample recognition the error recognition may be occurring when the recognition results are p5 the true result may be p1 or p1 the true result may be p4 for the mean lda model p1 samples may be identified as p1 p5 or p6 samples while p4 samples may be identified as p3 or p4 samples fig 6 c based on the different recognition results of p1 and p4 samples by the mean lda model this model is suitable for eliminating the possible misjudgment of the mean svm model when the recognition result is p1 in the same way it can be concluded that the ft svm model fig 6 d is suitable for eliminating the possible misjudgment of the mean svm model when the recognition result is p5 based on the above analysis results a two step qualitative identification method for wastewater samples in the wwtp was proposed which applied mean svm as the main classification model and mean lda and ft svm as auxiliary classification models fig 7 this method can improve the recognition accuracy for different wastewater samples 3 3 quantitative prediction of wastewater by pls and rr 3 3 1 the correlation analysis between e nose response signals and water quality parameters and odor concentration in fig 8 the r2 values for odor concentration and water quality parameters models ranged from 0 9920 to 0 9983 which showed that there is a good linear relationship between the e nose response signals and cod an tn tp and odor concentration as for rmse the range was 0 0745 to 15 5895 indicating that from the regression model prediction results are expected an error range around the true value due to the value of rmse being less than 2 33 of the measurement range it is considered suitable for this application however the rmse values of these pollution indicators accounted for 8 46 31 18 of the regulatory limits range espa 2002 indicating that the precision of the regression curves fitted at this time cannot meet the requirements of accurate prediction the inappropriate rmse value of the regression curve may be caused by the improper selection of measurement range thus to prevent misjudgment of samples near the regulatory limit samples with pollution indicators content less than the sum of the regulatory limit and rmse were used to construct the regression curves for the second time when there is no sample with pollution indicator content equal to the sum of regulatory limit and rmse the measurement range should be slightly broadened odor concentration 11 32 no unit cod 73 mg l tn 17 56 mg l an 5 83 mg l tp 0 59 mg l the fitting results of the second regression curves were shown in fig 9 in fig 9 r2 was greater than 0 9989 and the range of rmse was 0 0029 0 1349 the results showed that the regression curves of the second fitting had a better linear relationship than the first fitting and the rmse value was less than 0 90 of the regulatory limits range thus it may be considered suitable for the accurate prediction of water quality parameters and odor concentration by fitting the regression curves twice the relationship between the cod an tn tp and odor concentration and e nose response signals can be explained the fitting results in this paper were good which may be caused by two reasons 1 the e nose system equipped with more sensors was able to obtain more odor information of wastewater 2 the samples for water quality parameter and odor concentration prediction had more concentration gradients which can be better used for regression fitting the regression curves constructed by the pls method used were able to make a linear relationship between the e nose response signals and cod an tn tp and odor concentration it may be possible to predict the odor concentration and water quality parameters emitted from the wastewater treatment process in the wwtp by the e nose 3 3 2 the evaluation of the prediction ability of e nose to pollution indicators in section 3 3 1 the pls method was used to analyze the correlation between e nose response signals and the cod an tn tp and odor concentration and good results were obtained however the prediction ability of the e nose had not been evaluated and this part will be discussed in this section in fig 10 the rmse range of odor concentration and water quality parameters was 0 2881 to 0 9476 the rmse ratios of all pollution indicators to the measurement ranges were not greater than 0 056 the result showed that the e nose combined with the rr method could be applied as a detection tool for these pollution indicators compared with the regulatory limit value espa 2002 it was found that the rmse value of tp was slightly higher than the regulatory limit value of the indicator the result showed that the constructed model was not suitable for determining whether the tp indicator of the wastewater sample meets the discharge standard the main reasons for this result may be the following two points 1 most of the tp content in the wastewater samples used in the training model was greater than the regulatory limit value 2 the number of samples in the training model was small although the e nose could not accurately predict tp content at this time it can still be used as a preliminary evaluation device for tp content due to its short detection time and simple operation except for tp the rmse values of other indicators were far less than the regulatory limit value thus the e nose can accurately predict these pollution indicators 4 discussion compared with the reports of the early e nose used for wastewater odor detection blanco rodriguez et al 2018 gao et al 2022 fang et al 2010 guz et al 2015 the experimental results of this study support their conclusions that the e nose can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the odor and water quality parameters of wastewater from a wwtp the innovation of this study will be discussed from both qualitative and quantitative analysis in terms of qualitative analysis the novelty of this paper was mainly focused on the following two aspects 1 the qualitative analysis of this study was for the convenience of finding the fault phase in time when the detected water quality parameters change in the future thus most sample points were the outlet channel of each treatment phase which is different from other reports moufid et al 2022 2 on the basis of different classification models this study proposed a two step qualitative identification method to further improve the recognition ability of the e nose as for quantitative analysis in this study the prediction results of water quality parameters by e nose were compared with the regulatory limits to show that the e nose has great application potential in this field which was not reported in other papers fang et al 2010 guz et al 2015 in addition when fitting the regression curve this study thinks that for a certain detection indicator it is better to build two regression curves for the prediction of this indicator one for evaluating the approximate range of this indicator and the other for accurate prediction no one had tried to use e nose to detect tp content in wastewater from a wwtp the experimental results of this study showed that the e nose can be used to detect this indicator the phosphide in wastewater will be lost in the form of phosphine gas ph3 yu et al 2022 according to henry s law the content of ph3 in the headspace gas is proportional to the tp content in the wastewater under certain conditions thus this study speculates that ph3 gas could be used as a medium for e nose to detect tp content this is also what we need to do in the future although the application of e nose in this area has great potential there are still some challenges before application first of all further samples need to be collected to establish a good prediction model especially for tp indicator secondly how to reduce the impact of temperature and humidity changes needs to be considered before application finally conduct field tests to evaluate the prediction ability of the e nose in the field 5 conclusions this paper proposed to use e nose to measure the water quality parameters and odor concentration of wastewater in wwtp with simple structure and the ability to detect multiple pollution indicators at one time the tool served as a powerful tool for rapid measurement of these pollution indicators of wastewater and enjoys high practical significance and engineering value the main conclusions are as follows 1 the odor fingerprint can be used to conduct a preliminary assessment of the gaseous mixture of the wwtp in a simple way which will help to estimate the compounds discharged from specific phase in the wwtp 2 to perform lda and svm qualitative analyses of different sampling point wastewater these tools allowed to identify different wastewater samples in addition a two step qualitative identification method was proposed which can further improve the accuracy of the e nose basically these assessments would help to identify which phase possible fails in wwtp 3 the focus of this study was to accurately cod an tn tp and odor concentration by e nose except tp other indicators can be accurately predicted although the e nose cannot be used as an accurate prediction tool for tp content it can be used as a preliminary evaluation tool the results showed that the e nose is suitable as a real time monitoring tool for water quality parameters and odor concentration 4 when constructing regression curves we suggested to construct two regression curves one for evaluating the approximate range of this indicator and the other for accurate prediction this method plays a great role in improving the prediction accuracy declaration of

14891,four different machine learning algorithms including decision tree dt random forest rf multivariable linear regression mlr support vector regressions svr and gaussian process regressions gpr were applied to predict the performance of a multi media filter operating as a function of raw water quality and plant operating variables the models were trained using data collected over a seven year period covering water quality and operating variables including true colour turbidity plant flow and chemical dose for chlorine kmno4 fecl3 and cationic polymer polydadmac the machine learning algorithms have shown that the best prediction is at a 1 day time lag between input variables and unit filter run volume ufrv furthermore the rf algorithm with grid search using the input metrics mentioned above with a 1 day time lag has provided the highest reliability in predicting ufrv with a rmse and r2 of 31 58 and 0 98 respectively similarly rf with grid search has shown the shortest training time prediction accuracy and forecasting events using a roc auc curve analysis auc over 0 8 in extreme wet weather events therefore random forest with grid search and a 1 day time lag is an effective and robust machine learning algorithm that can predict the filter performance to aid water treatment operators in their decision makings by providing real time warning of the potential

frequent heavy rain events can affect water catchments and their performance due to the increased concentrations of suspended materials natural organic matter nom and inorganic substances in source waters khan et al 2017 ritson et al 2014 it has been shown that the water treatment plant s production rate can decrease by 40 due to having weaker flocculants because of higher nom in the feedwater after heavy rainfall loganathan et al 2020 these impose additional burdens on water treatment plants requiring additional maintenance chemical use and waste production khan et al 2015 hence the use of a reliable forecasting model for filter performance can not only help in controlling the performance of the water treatment plant but also in predicting the production efficiency depending on the influent water quality filter performance can be expressed in terms of daily water production filter run time unit filter run volume ufrv effluent turbidity and pressure head loss of these ufrv defined as the volume of water filtered through a unit surface area is a useful way of normalising performance for daily water production and run time which depending on the loading rate can range from 200 m 3 m 2 to 400 m 3 m 2 a w w association 2011 understanding changes in ufrv as a function of feedwater quality and plant operating variables such as coagulant dose provides an effective and robust way to combine large data sets into useful information on plant performance and potentially provide real time warning of problems such as turbidity breakthroughs from the filters given the complexity nonlinearity and numerous variables in the filtration models developing data driven artificial intelligence ai models have been applied for water quality monitoring as they improve the prediction capability for accurately assessing water quality parameters liao and sun 2010 li et al 2017 singh et al 2011 grbić et al 2013 decision tree dt algorithms involve real time water quality monitoring from multivariate data collected from different sensors shakhari and banerjee 2019 lu and ma 2020 this identifies high quality ground water zones jeihouni et al 2020 flood modelling mosavi et al 2018 and algal growth prediction jung et al 2009 it was reported that an improved dt learning method could forecast and evaluate the water quality of chao lake in hong kong and can assess the trophic status of poyang lake in china liao and sun 2010 li et al 2017 furthermore the predictive performance of dt models can be considerably improved by aggregating many independent individual trees known as random forests rf l breiman 2001 the random forest algorithm employs the bootstrap aggregation process to combine a set of dts where each tree is constructed using the best split for each node among a subset of randomly chosen predictors rf averages noisy but unbiased models to reduce the prediction variance to mitigate the dt algorithm s poor performance rf provides a multivariate nonparametric and nonlinear regression where the final prediction in regression is made by averaging each tree s prediction l breiman 2001 hu et al 2017 training rf models are less computationally expensive compared to other machine learning algorithms ziegler and könig 2014 as they are straightforward to use athey et al 2019 and can handle highly correlated predictor variables ziegler and könig 2014 other advantages of the rf algorithm are reducing variance and consistency while not increasing the bias of the predictions genuer 2012 biau et al 2008 recently a holistic review of the implementation of the rf algorithm in water resource applications has shown the effectiveness of these models for prediction and inference purposes in water resources tyralis et al 2019 other promising machine learning techniques are the support vector regression svr and gaussian process regression gpr especially in environmental studies from soil moisture prediction gill et al 2006 to rapid detection of organic contamination events in the water distribution systems yu et al 2018 and coagulant dosage prediction in water treatment plants zhang et al 2013 these algorithms essentially benefit from the kernel trick which efficiently maps the data into a high dimensional feature space using a nonlinear function singh et al 2011 despite the good predictive performance svr and gpr algorithms are sensitive to the choice of hyper parameters i e parameters that cannot be inferred during the model s training hence selecting proper kernel functions and hyper parameters is crucial in applying svr and gpr algorithms to deliver correct results mantovani et al 2015 samuelsson et al 2017 in general the main hyper parameter selection techniques are gradient based approaches chapelle et al 2002 such as 1 grid search gs where the search space of parameters is split into groups of possible parameters to be tested uniformly ortiz garcía et al 2009 and 2 random search rs where possible values for parameters are randomly picked which exhibited more efficient in high dimensional search spaces mantovani et al 2015 bergstra and bengio 2012 in a previous study we compared different machine learning algorithms i e multivariable linear regression mlr svr and gpr with different kernel functions to quantify variations in nom in the raw water reservoir as a function of climatological and water quality factors moradi et al 2020 four independent variables 1 precipitation 2 temperature 3 leaf area index and 4 turbidity were selected to develop and train each machine learning model it was found that model accuracy was very sensitive to the time lag function which is used to average climate observations prior to pairing with doc observations the svr model with a quadratic kernel function and a 12 day time lag function provided the highest reliability in predicting the doc observations with a rmse and r2 of 1 9 and 0 71 respectively in this study we extend the machine learning approach to predict filter performance in terms of ufrv in a treatment plant operation on the same drinking water reservoir the main objective of this paper is to employ different machine learning algorithms including multivariable linear regression decision tree algorithm random forests support vector regression and gaussian process regression to predict the filter performance in a water filtration plant in terms of influent water quality conditions random search and grid search procedures are used to tune the hyper parameters of the different kernel functions embedded in svr and gpr to predict filter performance the results of regression and classification models were discussed in terms of error rates and classification precision 2 methodology 2 1 dataset the data were extracted from the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system of the nepean water filtration plant wfp located in south sydney australia the nepean wfp treats surface water from the nepean reservoir by pre oxidation chlorine and kmno4 coagulation and flocculation two step filtration processes are used roughing filtration and dual media gravity dmg filtration followed by final chlorine disinfection dmg filters at nepean wfp consist of two types of tightly packed filtering materials a layer of anthracite coal media depth 600mm and layers of fine sand media depth 300mm and gravel media depth 75mm the plant uses ferric chloride fecl3 as the primary coagulant and polydadmac as a secondary coagulant mohiuddin et al 2020 the data consisted of long timescale measurements of physicochemical water quality parameters that include and are not limited to turbidity dissolved organic carbon color and ph as well as filter performance indicator as ufrv this dataset was obtained from august 2014 to may 2020 including data from a heavy rainfall event that happened in february 2020 the nepean catchment areas could receive more than 100 mm of rainfall over one month australian government bureau of meteorology 2022 in extreme weather events such as the period between the 7th and the 10th of february 2020 the catchment received 390 mm of rain australian government national emergency management agency 2022 in such a flash flooding event the inflows to the wfp could peak at 80 100 ntu consequently an extreme rainfall event could impose a serious challenge on filtration performance to meet the drinking water guidelines 2 2 data processing data integration outliers removal and feature selection are implemented to process the source data for subsequent modelling in addition influent water quality data and chemical dosing parameters were integrated as a model input and the filter performance indicators e g ufrv were used as the model output 2 3 outlier detection and boxplot analysis boxplot analysis was conducted as it provides insightful visualization for outlier detection for each variable possible outliers were labelled by computing the interquartile range iqr horn et al 2001 any data points less than or greater than the lower and upper fences respectively were eliminated see eq 1 and eq 2 where q 1 and q 3 are the first and third quartiles respectively horn et al 2001 1 o u t l i e r q 1 1 5 i q r 2 o u t l i e r q 3 1 5 i q r note that a cautious approach was used when removing the outliers as it could negatively affect the model accuracy for example data from heavy rainfall events might be categorized as outliers using the boxplot analysis as such this data was not removed in the outlier removal process and was still used in the data processing on the other hand a grouped outlier set due to unavoidable device errors or incorrect measurements was regarded as an outlier and removed from the dataset 2 3 1 correlation analysis pearson and spearman correlation analyses were applied to find the correlation coefficient between the different parameters to exclude multi collinearity and to extract the possible relationships between each parameter appropriate input variables were selected beforehand to lower the computational time and avoid overfitting the model to the training data 2 4 establishing the machine learning algorithms multivariable linear regression decision tree random forest support vector regression and gaussian process regression algorithms were employed to find the best machine learning algorithm that better estimates the filtration performance the receiver operating characteristic roc was conducted to investigate whether the developed machine learning models could predict extreme water quality events to visualize the performance of the multi class classification problem the area under the curve auc was computed by generating a confusion matrix and the true positive rate t p r and false positive rate f p r metrics were calculated as follows 3 t p r t p t p f n 4 f p r f p f p t n where t p and f p are true positives representing the correctly predicted extreme events with ufrv 150 m3 m2 and false positives representing the model s false alarms where ufrv 150 m3 m2 respectively in contrast t n and f n are true negatives representing the correct predictions of normal treatment conditions with ufrv 150 m3 m2 and false negatives representing the failures to predict the occurrence of extreme events i e failed alarms the roc curve illustrates the trade off between the tpr and fpr for a suite of possible thresholds mirus et al 2018 the auc values could vary between 0 5 and 1 where values near 1 suggest excellent performance and values near 0 5 denote poor forecasting accuracy not differing from random classifier sameen et al 2020 moradi et al 2020 2 4 1 multivariable linear regression the multivariable linear regression is a baseline model to evaluate the added benefit of using a more complex model than the conventional linear models eq 5 represents the relationship between the dependent variable ufrv and the k independent variables using the mlr model 5 u f r v β 0 i 1 k β i x i ε β 0 is the intercept coefficient β i is the regression coefficient and ε is the random error to estimate the regression coefficients the ordinary least squares were used to find the parameters that minimize the model s mean squared error mse of the model as implied by eq 6 6 β arg min y i y i 2 the ufrv is denoted as y y i i 1 2 n β represents the optimal regression parameter and y i represents the mlr model prediction value calculated by eq 5 2 4 2 decision tree although the decision tree method has many advantages such as fast calculation speed high efficiency and relatively insensitive to missing values lu and ma 2020 they are considered noisy models de clercq et al 2020 and tend to overfit the model to the training samples castrillo and garcía 2020 intuitively the tree construction does not continue beyond the current node if the cost of adding another branch from the current node is higher than the complexity parameter c p which is calculated as 7 c p t e r m i n a l n o d e s m i s s c l a s s i λ s p l i t where λ is the penalty term also known as the regularization rate that is used to tune the over impact of regularization on the complexity error a cp value of 1 represents a tree with only 1 split that does not account for variable interactions in this work the optimal value for cp was determined for each model using the hyperparameter optimization techniques discussed in section 2 4 1 2 4 3 random forests the mtry parameter i e the number of candidate variables considered at each split is optimized using grid and random search techniques to run the rf algorithm the mtry default value was selected at p 3 where p is the number of variables in the input matrix l breiman 2001 2 4 4 kernel based regression models the kernel function denotes an inner product in feature space and is represented as 8 k x i x j φ x i ϕ x j where φ is the mapping to a high dimensional feature space choosing the right kernel function and fine tuning its hyper parameters depends on the problem and the information extracted consequently the predicted filter performance ufrv denoted as y y i i 1 2 n is determined as 9 y i 1 n α i k x i x b support vector regression and gaussian process regression were used as kernel based regression models the svr model can concurrently minimize model dimensions and estimation errors while having decent generalization ability and less prone to over fitting qu and zuo 2010 gpr requires a relatively small training data set that includes stability flexibility generalization capacity and flexible kernel functions athey et al 2019 ebden 2015 in this study the kernel functions used for the svr and gpr algorithms and their adjustable hyper parameters are presented in table 1 2 4 5 adjustable hyper parameters table 1 lists commonly used kernel functions for svr and gpr and the adjustable parameters for selected machine learning algorithms in these kernel functions xi and xj are two different data points in the training data set degree defines the dimension of the polynomial function and coef0 is the constant parameter in the sigmoid or polynomial kernel function the gamma parameter γ defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches cost c is the cost of constraints violation which means when the value is small the penalty for misclassification is reduced which means having a strong generalization ability for example in the application of svr with kernel function the hyperparameters namely γ the coefficient of the kernel function and c the regularisation parameter of the optimisation problem are key points in the training process of the svr model the hyperparameter c controls the trade off between minimising the model s complexity and minimising the training error the hyper parameter γ represents the width of the radial basis function rbf kernel and it determines whether the model will tend to over fit the training data or it would make the model not flexible enough for complex function approximation naganathan and babulal 2019 the mapping that the kernel functions are represented to transform the non linear input space to a high dimensional feature space where linear regression is possible depends on the intrinsic topological structure of the data this requires the kernel type and hyper parameters to be optimised to approximate the ideal mapping üstün et al 2005 this study focused on commonly used kernel functions namely the rbf the polynomial the sigmoid hyperbolic tangent the laplacian and the bessel kernel for svr and gpr as supervised machine learning algorithms outlined in table 1 the predictive performance of svr and gpr machine learning algorithms depends exclusively on the suitability of the selected hyper parameters while hyperparameter tuning has widely been applied to find a good combination of control parameters in the model there has yet to be much discussion on which hyperparameter optimisation technique is best in machine learning model development as there is no exact method to obtain the best possible set of hyper parameters search algorithms are usually applied to find the optimal set of hyper parameters fröhlich and zell 2005 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2019 hence in this paper two separate search algorithms random search and grid search were implemented in combination with a 10 fold cross validation procedure on each candidate parameter vector for adjusting hyper parameters of svr and gpr to guarantee the maximum possible quality of the final machine learning algorithms it should be noted that grid search and random search were selected as hyperparameter optimisers as they are among the more popular methods for hyperparameter optimisation other hyperparameter optimisation methods such as the bayesian optimisation method used in other water treatment plant applications yunana et al 2021 were considered but required biased inputs such as operator experience were not used in this study which focussed only water quality and filter performance data could be explored in future studies the selection of the initial ranges of parameters is a common problem in both grid search and random search algorithms which can be selected either based on experience with the regression problem studied or using large ranges of parameters ortiz garcía et al 2009 the usage of large parameter ranges implies an increase in the search space and the training time of the machine learning algorithms table 4 shows the range of values for hyper parameters explored in this work mantovani et al 2015 ortiz garcía et al 2009 tu and nair 2018 mantovani et al 2015 rossi and carvalho 2008 ashrafi et al 2018 the results of the random search hyper parameter optimisation algorithm were compared to the best results found in the grid search 2 5 time lag function all data indicators i e operational data chemical dosing water quality parameters and filtration performance were temporally paired with each other theoretically it takes as long as the residence time for water to go through different steps in a water filtration plant and pass through the filters in reality however the water quality conditions and treatment regime at a given time might not lead to the recorded filter performance at that same time hence a time lag function is used to represent the delay between recorded filter performance indicators and the associated operational data and water quality conditions time lags from zero up to three days for model input variables were considered when the time lag is zero t 0 the filter performance indicators are in sync with the time of the model input variables whereas when the time lag is two t 2 the model input variables are for a time that is 2 days ahead of the time of the filtration performance indicators in other words the model simply uses the previous value as the prediction for the future 10 y t i 1 n α i k x i x t δ t b as the time lag was unknown the performance of machine learning algorithms was evaluated as a function of time lag while the lag that provided the strongest performance was selected 2 6 performance and accuracy assessment of machine learning algorithms the framework to train validate and test the machine learning algorithms to predict filtration performance is presented in fig 1 a 10 fold cross validation was utilised for performance assessment of machine learning algorithms in which the training data are divided into 10 subsets of approximately equal size moradi et al 2020 the resulting machine learning models are established by training on nine subsets and one subset was retained to test the model the procedure is repeated 10 times with each subset used for testing once while the error of the machine learning model is determined by averaging the test errors over the 10 trials the root mean squared error rmse and mean square error mse were employed as the statistical indicators for estimation performance this approach was used to model plant performance over a range of conditions from normal to extreme the extreme events occur over short temporal scales and are infrequent and there is insufficient data to train and independently test the model once the optimum machine learning model and the optimal time lag were determined the final model could be used to optimise the plant performance by changing the influencing treatment parameters to evaluate whether developed models can predict the events with low filtration performance the roc and auc were used by plotting the true positive rate versus the false positive rate at different thresholds the values of auc roc range between 0 5 and 1 where 1 denotes a model s excellent forecast capacity and 0 5 indicates its poor predictive accuracy taheri et al 2019 this was programmed trained and tested using matlab by mathworks matlab 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 data processing the pearson correlation analysis observations are listed in table 2 it was noticed that ufrv was not influenced by temperature r 0 02 ph r 0 03 total mn r 0 02 and alkalinity r 0 05 table 2 hence the parameters with no correlations were excluded as potential variables doc toc was also removed as potential explanatory variables because the number of measurements was not enough and considering them as variables meant that dissolved organic carbon doc and total organic carbon toc data had to be removed as explanatory variables data parameters with a correlation coefficient of more than 0 4 with the target variable ufrv were selected as independent potential input variables to comprehensively consider the amount of data in the dataset kmno4 was also considered as an input parameter to investigate the potential effects of oxidants on filtration performance hence ufrv was correlated with seven parameters 1 true colour 2 turbidity 3 flow 4 chlorine 5 kmno4 6 fecl3 and 7 cationic polymer polydadmac the statistical descriptions of the influencing factors including mean median maximum minimum and standard deviation are shown in table s1 five models with a different number of predictor parameters as presented in table 3 were considered to analyse their contribution to the accuracy of the predicted filtration performance indicator for example the difference between model 1 and model 2 is that fecl3 has been included in model 2 to determine whether considering fecl3 will improve the accuracy of the predicted model 3 2 hyper parameter tuning with grid search and random search the optimal hyper parameters for each supervised machine learning model with the lowest rmse were computed by gs and rs techniques rs randomly generated a set of candidate parameters from the same tuning range for gs as in table 4 table 4 also presents the optimum parameter values only for model 4 with a one day time lag the optimal values of the hyper parameters with respective kernel functions computed by rs and gs techniques for all five models and different time lags up to 3 days are shown in table s2 the optimum hyper parameters for each machine learning algorithm table s2 were applied in selected kernel functions to compare how well each machine learning algorithm can estimate the ufrv of filters whereas the cp was used to adjust the dt model performance for predicting the ufrv 10 fold cross validation was considered in developing the dt model to avoid overfitting pérez guaita et al 2018 for the grid search technique a grid network was established in the range of 0 to 1 with cp to find the optimal value of cp in the present study eventually the cp value of 0 was defined as the optimal value for the dt algorithm for 5 selected models and different time lag values see fig s1 in the supplementary information document 3 3 machine learning model performance assessment once the optimal values of the hyper parameters using gs and rs techniques were determined the performance of the optimisation process for selected machine learning algorithms was evaluated it is important to consider the optimal hyper parameter measures to determine the best predictive machine learning algorithm for filtration performance prediction fig 2 compares the effects of increasing the time lag from 0 to 3 days between ufrv and model input variables model 1 to 5 in table 3 on the performance of developed machine learning algorithms which include mlr dt rf and svr with different kernel functions as well as gpr with different kernel functions that are based on r squared values fig 2 also shows whether incorporating more parameters as model input would improve ufrv predictions fig 2 shows that considering a 1 day time lag between input variables and ufrv as model output resulted in better predictions than time lags of 0 2 and 3 days for all the machine learning algorithm for example the results show that by applying the mlr algorithm to model 4 input variables true colour turbidity flow fecl3 polydadmac and chlorine the r squared values for having the time lag of 0 1 2 and 3 days to be 0 54 0 64 0 61 and 0 57 respectively this implies that the regression model for ufrv prediction has a higher predictive power when using a time lag of 1 day in this dataset also model 4 and model 5 showed better performance in terms of r squared than model 1 model 2 and model 3 however incorporating kmno4 as a model input variable i e the difference between model 4 and model 5 see table 3 did not enhance the model performance in terms of r squared with 1 day time lag using svr rbf gpr rbf gpr bessel and dt algorithms in other machine learning algorithms it only improved the model predictions marginally it is also essential to identify the root mean square error rmse of the machine learning models to identify the best model in ufrv prediction as shown in fig 3 the results of fig 2 and fig 3 revealed that rf with grid search for model 4 model input variables are true colour turbidity flow fecl3 polydadmac and chlorine and 1 day time lag provided high reliability in predicting ufrv r2 0 98 the dt algorithm with model 4 and 1 day time lag yielded a weaker performance compared to those of the rf model r2 0 90 fig 2 a among the svr algorithms with different kernel functions i e linear polynomial rbf and sigmoid the svr algorithm with the sigmoid kernel function svr sigmoid model provided the lowest performance r2 0 00 its performance with both grid search and random search was even lower than those of the mlr model fig 2 b and e however the svr with rbf kernel functions for model 4 with a 1 day time lag performed better than the other svr algorithms with an rmse of 33 68 fig 3 b and r2 of 0 92 fig 2 b the gpr algorithm with rbf laplacian and bessel kernel functions provided a good performance based on the rmse and r2 fig 2 c and f the gpr algorithm with hyperbolic kernel function provided the poorest performance in this study thus the developed rf algorithm with grid search for model 4 with a 1 day time lag performed better than the svr based model the gpr model and the dt model with an rmse of 31 58 fig 3 a and r2 of 0 98 fig 2 a fig 4 compared the results of hyperparameter tuning by the grid search and random search optimisation methods with a 1 day time lag between model output and input variables fig 4 shows that the outcomes from the grid search and random search hyperparameter optimisation methods were broadly similar in their performance measures that partially reflect previously reported findings bergstra and bengio 2012 interestingly the difference in r squared between the two hyper parameter optimisation methods random search and grid search is marginal for kernel functions that only have one or two adjustable parameters e g gpr rbf in contrast there is a large difference in the r squared of the final ufrv model between grid search and random search for the kernels in svr and gpr algorithms with more than two adjustable parameters e g svr with a polynomial kernel function this can be explained by the additional parameters that are optimised by the polynomial kernel function compared to only two parameters γ and c in the svr with rbf kernel function 3 4 grid search vs random search once the machine learning models were analysed a comparison to evaluate which model is more suitable for this dataset was carried out i e the speed at each model converges relatively to the other selected algorithms by normalising rmse against the machine learning algorithm with the highest rmse svr sigmoid in fig 3 and relatively comparing the training time fig 5 depicts a summary of the performance obtained with different machine learning algorithms including mlr dt rf svr and gpr with different kernel functions for model 4 with a 1 day time lag between ufrv and model input variables in this case the performance was determined in terms of r squared maximum the training time minimum and normalised rmse minimum by each model fig 5 shows that the svr sigmoid provided the worst performance in this dataset with the highest normalised rmse lowest r squared and the highest relative training time however the better models are rf svr rbf and gpr with rbf and laplacian as they reported greater prediction accuracy in terms of the lowest rmse and the highest r squared in addition the random search hyper parameter optimisation technique took less training time than the grid search considerably for the rf algorithm the relative training times using the grid search and random search optimisation techniques were similar but the grid search method provided a higher r squared value and a lower rmse hence the machine learning algorithms with top performance in terms of training time and prediction accuracy were rf with grid search svr rbf with random search gpr laplacian with random search and gpr rbf with random search respectively 3 5 roc analysis the roc auc curve analysis was carried out to find out whether developed machine learning models that have better performance than the others rf svr rbf gpr laplacian and gpr rbf could also predict extreme water quality events the ufrv threshold for such events was determined by studying the changing relationship between discharge and ufrv of filters hysteresis during an individual storm event in february 2020 the hysteresis between discharge and ufrv is presented in fig 6 and the ufrv threshold for such events was set to be 150 m3 m2 as the ufrv during an extreme rainfall event high flowrates was less than 150 m3 m2 fig s2 in the supplementary information document shows the roc curve for the extreme weather events ufrv 150 m3 m2 using rf svr rbf gpr laplacian and gpr rbf algorithms and a 1 day time lag between ufrv and model input variables model 5 with gpr laplacian algorithms yielded maximum auc values of 0 86 while the rf svr rbf and gpr rbf algorithms yielded auc values of 0 83 0 85 and 0 85 respectively see table 5 the results of auc values indicate that machine learning algorithms with top performance in this study i e rf with grid search svr rbf with random search gpr laplacian with random search and gpr rbf with random search not only can predict ufrv with high prediction accuracy and lowest relative training time but they can also provide high reliability in forecasting events with low ufrv auc was over 0 8 above the random level as shown in table 5 4 conclusion in this study eleven machine learning regression algorithms were applied to estimate the filter performance from water quality and operational data the required input parameters were determined using an exhaustive feature selection technique and two separate hyperparameter optimisation methods grid search and random search to optimise the parameter set the key findings arising from the study are a 1 day time lag between input variables and unit filter run volume as model output resulted in better predictions than time lags of 0 2 and 3 days the developed random forests algorithm with grid search using true colour turbidity flow fecl3 polydadmac and chlorine as model input variables and considering a 1 day time lag performed better than the svr based model the gpr model and the dt model with an rmse of 31 58 and r2 of 0 98 in terms of extreme wet weather events ufrv prediction the ufrv threshold for such events was set to be 150 m3 m2 from the hysteresis between discharge and ufrv the machine learning algorithms with top performance in terms of the training time prediction accuracy and forecasting events

14891,four different machine learning algorithms including decision tree dt random forest rf multivariable linear regression mlr support vector regressions svr and gaussian process regressions gpr were applied to predict the performance of a multi media filter operating as a function of raw water quality and plant operating variables the models were trained using data collected over a seven year period covering water quality and operating variables including true colour turbidity plant flow and chemical dose for chlorine kmno4 fecl3 and cationic polymer polydadmac the machine learning algorithms have shown that the best prediction is at a 1 day time lag between input variables and unit filter run volume ufrv furthermore the rf algorithm with grid search using the input metrics mentioned above with a 1 day time lag has provided the highest reliability in predicting ufrv with a rmse and r2 of 31 58 and 0 98 respectively similarly rf with grid search has shown the shortest training time prediction accuracy and forecasting events using a roc auc curve analysis auc over 0 8 in extreme wet weather events therefore random forest with grid search and a 1 day time lag is an effective and robust machine learning algorithm that can predict the filter performance to aid water treatment operators in their decision makings by providing real time warning of the potential

frequent heavy rain events can affect water catchments and their performance due to the increased concentrations of suspended materials natural organic matter nom and inorganic substances in source waters khan et al 2017 ritson et al 2014 it has been shown that the water treatment plant s production rate can decrease by 40 due to having weaker flocculants because of higher nom in the feedwater after heavy rainfall loganathan et al 2020 these impose additional burdens on water treatment plants requiring additional maintenance chemical use and waste production khan et al 2015 hence the use of a reliable forecasting model for filter performance can not only help in controlling the performance of the water treatment plant but also in predicting the production efficiency depending on the influent water quality filter performance can be expressed in terms of daily water production filter run time unit filter run volume ufrv effluent turbidity and pressure head loss of these ufrv defined as the volume of water filtered through a unit surface area is a useful way of normalising performance for daily water production and run time which depending on the loading rate can range from 200 m 3 m 2 to 400 m 3 m 2 a w w association 2011 understanding changes in ufrv as a function of feedwater quality and plant operating variables such as coagulant dose provides an effective and robust way to combine large data sets into useful information on plant performance and potentially provide real time warning of problems such as turbidity breakthroughs from the filters given the complexity nonlinearity and numerous variables in the filtration models developing data driven artificial intelligence ai models have been applied for water quality monitoring as they improve the prediction capability for accurately assessing water quality parameters liao and sun 2010 li et al 2017 singh et al 2011 grbić et al 2013 decision tree dt algorithms involve real time water quality monitoring from multivariate data collected from different sensors shakhari and banerjee 2019 lu and ma 2020 this identifies high quality ground water zones jeihouni et al 2020 flood modelling mosavi et al 2018 and algal growth prediction jung et al 2009 it was reported that an improved dt learning method could forecast and evaluate the water quality of chao lake in hong kong and can assess the trophic status of poyang lake in china liao and sun 2010 li et al 2017 furthermore the predictive performance of dt models can be considerably improved by aggregating many independent individual trees known as random forests rf l breiman 2001 the random forest algorithm employs the bootstrap aggregation process to combine a set of dts where each tree is constructed using the best split for each node among a subset of randomly chosen predictors rf averages noisy but unbiased models to reduce the prediction variance to mitigate the dt algorithm s poor performance rf provides a multivariate nonparametric and nonlinear regression where the final prediction in regression is made by averaging each tree s prediction l breiman 2001 hu et al 2017 training rf models are less computationally expensive compared to other machine learning algorithms ziegler and könig 2014 as they are straightforward to use athey et al 2019 and can handle highly correlated predictor variables ziegler and könig 2014 other advantages of the rf algorithm are reducing variance and consistency while not increasing the bias of the predictions genuer 2012 biau et al 2008 recently a holistic review of the implementation of the rf algorithm in water resource applications has shown the effectiveness of these models for prediction and inference purposes in water resources tyralis et al 2019 other promising machine learning techniques are the support vector regression svr and gaussian process regression gpr especially in environmental studies from soil moisture prediction gill et al 2006 to rapid detection of organic contamination events in the water distribution systems yu et al 2018 and coagulant dosage prediction in water treatment plants zhang et al 2013 these algorithms essentially benefit from the kernel trick which efficiently maps the data into a high dimensional feature space using a nonlinear function singh et al 2011 despite the good predictive performance svr and gpr algorithms are sensitive to the choice of hyper parameters i e parameters that cannot be inferred during the model s training hence selecting proper kernel functions and hyper parameters is crucial in applying svr and gpr algorithms to deliver correct results mantovani et al 2015 samuelsson et al 2017 in general the main hyper parameter selection techniques are gradient based approaches chapelle et al 2002 such as 1 grid search gs where the search space of parameters is split into groups of possible parameters to be tested uniformly ortiz garcía et al 2009 and 2 random search rs where possible values for parameters are randomly picked which exhibited more efficient in high dimensional search spaces mantovani et al 2015 bergstra and bengio 2012 in a previous study we compared different machine learning algorithms i e multivariable linear regression mlr svr and gpr with different kernel functions to quantify variations in nom in the raw water reservoir as a function of climatological and water quality factors moradi et al 2020 four independent variables 1 precipitation 2 temperature 3 leaf area index and 4 turbidity were selected to develop and train each machine learning model it was found that model accuracy was very sensitive to the time lag function which is used to average climate observations prior to pairing with doc observations the svr model with a quadratic kernel function and a 12 day time lag function provided the highest reliability in predicting the doc observations with a rmse and r2 of 1 9 and 0 71 respectively in this study we extend the machine learning approach to predict filter performance in terms of ufrv in a treatment plant operation on the same drinking water reservoir the main objective of this paper is to employ different machine learning algorithms including multivariable linear regression decision tree algorithm random forests support vector regression and gaussian process regression to predict the filter performance in a water filtration plant in terms of influent water quality conditions random search and grid search procedures are used to tune the hyper parameters of the different kernel functions embedded in svr and gpr to predict filter performance the results of regression and classification models were discussed in terms of error rates and classification precision 2 methodology 2 1 dataset the data were extracted from the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system of the nepean water filtration plant wfp located in south sydney australia the nepean wfp treats surface water from the nepean reservoir by pre oxidation chlorine and kmno4 coagulation and flocculation two step filtration processes are used roughing filtration and dual media gravity dmg filtration followed by final chlorine disinfection dmg filters at nepean wfp consist of two types of tightly packed filtering materials a layer of anthracite coal media depth 600mm and layers of fine sand media depth 300mm and gravel media depth 75mm the plant uses ferric chloride fecl3 as the primary coagulant and polydadmac as a secondary coagulant mohiuddin et al 2020 the data consisted of long timescale measurements of physicochemical water quality parameters that include and are not limited to turbidity dissolved organic carbon color and ph as well as filter performance indicator as ufrv this dataset was obtained from august 2014 to may 2020 including data from a heavy rainfall event that happened in february 2020 the nepean catchment areas could receive more than 100 mm of rainfall over one month australian government bureau of meteorology 2022 in extreme weather events such as the period between the 7th and the 10th of february 2020 the catchment received 390 mm of rain australian government national emergency management agency 2022 in such a flash flooding event the inflows to the wfp could peak at 80 100 ntu consequently an extreme rainfall event could impose a serious challenge on filtration performance to meet the drinking water guidelines 2 2 data processing data integration outliers removal and feature selection are implemented to process the source data for subsequent modelling in addition influent water quality data and chemical dosing parameters were integrated as a model input and the filter performance indicators e g ufrv were used as the model output 2 3 outlier detection and boxplot analysis boxplot analysis was conducted as it provides insightful visualization for outlier detection for each variable possible outliers were labelled by computing the interquartile range iqr horn et al 2001 any data points less than or greater than the lower and upper fences respectively were eliminated see eq 1 and eq 2 where q 1 and q 3 are the first and third quartiles respectively horn et al 2001 1 o u t l i e r q 1 1 5 i q r 2 o u t l i e r q 3 1 5 i q r note that a cautious approach was used when removing the outliers as it could negatively affect the model accuracy for example data from heavy rainfall events might be categorized as outliers using the boxplot analysis as such this data was not removed in the outlier removal process and was still used in the data processing on the other hand a grouped outlier set due to unavoidable device errors or incorrect measurements was regarded as an outlier and removed from the dataset 2 3 1 correlation analysis pearson and spearman correlation analyses were applied to find the correlation coefficient between the different parameters to exclude multi collinearity and to extract the possible relationships between each parameter appropriate input variables were selected beforehand to lower the computational time and avoid overfitting the model to the training data 2 4 establishing the machine learning algorithms multivariable linear regression decision tree random forest support vector regression and gaussian process regression algorithms were employed to find the best machine learning algorithm that better estimates the filtration performance the receiver operating characteristic roc was conducted to investigate whether the developed machine learning models could predict extreme water quality events to visualize the performance of the multi class classification problem the area under the curve auc was computed by generating a confusion matrix and the true positive rate t p r and false positive rate f p r metrics were calculated as follows 3 t p r t p t p f n 4 f p r f p f p t n where t p and f p are true positives representing the correctly predicted extreme events with ufrv 150 m3 m2 and false positives representing the model s false alarms where ufrv 150 m3 m2 respectively in contrast t n and f n are true negatives representing the correct predictions of normal treatment conditions with ufrv 150 m3 m2 and false negatives representing the failures to predict the occurrence of extreme events i e failed alarms the roc curve illustrates the trade off between the tpr and fpr for a suite of possible thresholds mirus et al 2018 the auc values could vary between 0 5 and 1 where values near 1 suggest excellent performance and values near 0 5 denote poor forecasting accuracy not differing from random classifier sameen et al 2020 moradi et al 2020 2 4 1 multivariable linear regression the multivariable linear regression is a baseline model to evaluate the added benefit of using a more complex model than the conventional linear models eq 5 represents the relationship between the dependent variable ufrv and the k independent variables using the mlr model 5 u f r v β 0 i 1 k β i x i ε β 0 is the intercept coefficient β i is the regression coefficient and ε is the random error to estimate the regression coefficients the ordinary least squares were used to find the parameters that minimize the model s mean squared error mse of the model as implied by eq 6 6 β arg min y i y i 2 the ufrv is denoted as y y i i 1 2 n β represents the optimal regression parameter and y i represents the mlr model prediction value calculated by eq 5 2 4 2 decision tree although the decision tree method has many advantages such as fast calculation speed high efficiency and relatively insensitive to missing values lu and ma 2020 they are considered noisy models de clercq et al 2020 and tend to overfit the model to the training samples castrillo and garcía 2020 intuitively the tree construction does not continue beyond the current node if the cost of adding another branch from the current node is higher than the complexity parameter c p which is calculated as 7 c p t e r m i n a l n o d e s m i s s c l a s s i λ s p l i t where λ is the penalty term also known as the regularization rate that is used to tune the over impact of regularization on the complexity error a cp value of 1 represents a tree with only 1 split that does not account for variable interactions in this work the optimal value for cp was determined for each model using the hyperparameter optimization techniques discussed in section 2 4 1 2 4 3 random forests the mtry parameter i e the number of candidate variables considered at each split is optimized using grid and random search techniques to run the rf algorithm the mtry default value was selected at p 3 where p is the number of variables in the input matrix l breiman 2001 2 4 4 kernel based regression models the kernel function denotes an inner product in feature space and is represented as 8 k x i x j φ x i ϕ x j where φ is the mapping to a high dimensional feature space choosing the right kernel function and fine tuning its hyper parameters depends on the problem and the information extracted consequently the predicted filter performance ufrv denoted as y y i i 1 2 n is determined as 9 y i 1 n α i k x i x b support vector regression and gaussian process regression were used as kernel based regression models the svr model can concurrently minimize model dimensions and estimation errors while having decent generalization ability and less prone to over fitting qu and zuo 2010 gpr requires a relatively small training data set that includes stability flexibility generalization capacity and flexible kernel functions athey et al 2019 ebden 2015 in this study the kernel functions used for the svr and gpr algorithms and their adjustable hyper parameters are presented in table 1 2 4 5 adjustable hyper parameters table 1 lists commonly used kernel functions for svr and gpr and the adjustable parameters for selected machine learning algorithms in these kernel functions xi and xj are two different data points in the training data set degree defines the dimension of the polynomial function and coef0 is the constant parameter in the sigmoid or polynomial kernel function the gamma parameter γ defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches cost c is the cost of constraints violation which means when the value is small the penalty for misclassification is reduced which means having a strong generalization ability for example in the application of svr with kernel function the hyperparameters namely γ the coefficient of the kernel function and c the regularisation parameter of the optimisation problem are key points in the training process of the svr model the hyperparameter c controls the trade off between minimising the model s complexity and minimising the training error the hyper parameter γ represents the width of the radial basis function rbf kernel and it determines whether the model will tend to over fit the training data or it would make the model not flexible enough for complex function approximation naganathan and babulal 2019 the mapping that the kernel functions are represented to transform the non linear input space to a high dimensional feature space where linear regression is possible depends on the intrinsic topological structure of the data this requires the kernel type and hyper parameters to be optimised to approximate the ideal mapping üstün et al 2005 this study focused on commonly used kernel functions namely the rbf the polynomial the sigmoid hyperbolic tangent the laplacian and the bessel kernel for svr and gpr as supervised machine learning algorithms outlined in table 1 the predictive performance of svr and gpr machine learning algorithms depends exclusively on the suitability of the selected hyper parameters while hyperparameter tuning has widely been applied to find a good combination of control parameters in the model there has yet to be much discussion on which hyperparameter optimisation technique is best in machine learning model development as there is no exact method to obtain the best possible set of hyper parameters search algorithms are usually applied to find the optimal set of hyper parameters fröhlich and zell 2005 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2019 hence in this paper two separate search algorithms random search and grid search were implemented in combination with a 10 fold cross validation procedure on each candidate parameter vector for adjusting hyper parameters of svr and gpr to guarantee the maximum possible quality of the final machine learning algorithms it should be noted that grid search and random search were selected as hyperparameter optimisers as they are among the more popular methods for hyperparameter optimisation other hyperparameter optimisation methods such as the bayesian optimisation method used in other water treatment plant applications yunana et al 2021 were considered but required biased inputs such as operator experience were not used in this study which focussed only water quality and filter performance data could be explored in future studies the selection of the initial ranges of parameters is a common problem in both grid search and random search algorithms which can be selected either based on experience with the regression problem studied or using large ranges of parameters ortiz garcía et al 2009 the usage of large parameter ranges implies an increase in the search space and the training time of the machine learning algorithms table 4 shows the range of values for hyper parameters explored in this work mantovani et al 2015 ortiz garcía et al 2009 tu and nair 2018 mantovani et al 2015 rossi and carvalho 2008 ashrafi et al 2018 the results of the random search hyper parameter optimisation algorithm were compared to the best results found in the grid search 2 5 time lag function all data indicators i e operational data chemical dosing water quality parameters and filtration performance were temporally paired with each other theoretically it takes as long as the residence time for water to go through different steps in a water filtration plant and pass through the filters in reality however the water quality conditions and treatment regime at a given time might not lead to the recorded filter performance at that same time hence a time lag function is used to represent the delay between recorded filter performance indicators and the associated operational data and water quality conditions time lags from zero up to three days for model input variables were considered when the time lag is zero t 0 the filter performance indicators are in sync with the time of the model input variables whereas when the time lag is two t 2 the model input variables are for a time that is 2 days ahead of the time of the filtration performance indicators in other words the model simply uses the previous value as the prediction for the future 10 y t i 1 n α i k x i x t δ t b as the time lag was unknown the performance of machine learning algorithms was evaluated as a function of time lag while the lag that provided the strongest performance was selected 2 6 performance and accuracy assessment of machine learning algorithms the framework to train validate and test the machine learning algorithms to predict filtration performance is presented in fig 1 a 10 fold cross validation was utilised for performance assessment of machine learning algorithms in which the training data are divided into 10 subsets of approximately equal size moradi et al 2020 the resulting machine learning models are established by training on nine subsets and one subset was retained to test the model the procedure is repeated 10 times with each subset used for testing once while the error of the machine learning model is determined by averaging the test errors over the 10 trials the root mean squared error rmse and mean square error mse were employed as the statistical indicators for estimation performance this approach was used to model plant performance over a range of conditions from normal to extreme the extreme events occur over short temporal scales and are infrequent and there is insufficient data to train and independently test the model once the optimum machine learning model and the optimal time lag were determined the final model could be used to optimise the plant performance by changing the influencing treatment parameters to evaluate whether developed models can predict the events with low filtration performance the roc and auc were used by plotting the true positive rate versus the false positive rate at different thresholds the values of auc roc range between 0 5 and 1 where 1 denotes a model s excellent forecast capacity and 0 5 indicates its poor predictive accuracy taheri et al 2019 this was programmed trained and tested using matlab by mathworks matlab 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 data processing the pearson correlation analysis observations are listed in table 2 it was noticed that ufrv was not influenced by temperature r 0 02 ph r 0 03 total mn r 0 02 and alkalinity r 0 05 table 2 hence the parameters with no correlations were excluded as potential variables doc toc was also removed as potential explanatory variables because the number of measurements was not enough and considering them as variables meant that dissolved organic carbon doc and total organic carbon toc data had to be removed as explanatory variables data parameters with a correlation coefficient of more than 0 4 with the target variable ufrv were selected as independent potential input variables to comprehensively consider the amount of data in the dataset kmno4 was also considered as an input parameter to investigate the potential effects of oxidants on filtration performance hence ufrv was correlated with seven parameters 1 true colour 2 turbidity 3 flow 4 chlorine 5 kmno4 6 fecl3 and 7 cationic polymer polydadmac the statistical descriptions of the influencing factors including mean median maximum minimum and standard deviation are shown in table s1 five models with a different number of predictor parameters as presented in table 3 were considered to analyse their contribution to the accuracy of the predicted filtration performance indicator for example the difference between model 1 and model 2 is that fecl3 has been included in model 2 to determine whether considering fecl3 will improve the accuracy of the predicted model 3 2 hyper parameter tuning with grid search and random search the optimal hyper parameters for each supervised machine learning model with the lowest rmse were computed by gs and rs techniques rs randomly generated a set of candidate parameters from the same tuning range for gs as in table 4 table 4 also presents the optimum parameter values only for model 4 with a one day time lag the optimal values of the hyper parameters with respective kernel functions computed by rs and gs techniques for all five models and different time lags up to 3 days are shown in table s2 the optimum hyper parameters for each machine learning algorithm table s2 were applied in selected kernel functions to compare how well each machine learning algorithm can estimate the ufrv of filters whereas the cp was used to adjust the dt model performance for predicting the ufrv 10 fold cross validation was considered in developing the dt model to avoid overfitting pérez guaita et al 2018 for the grid search technique a grid network was established in the range of 0 to 1 with cp to find the optimal value of cp in the present study eventually the cp value of 0 was defined as the optimal value for the dt algorithm for 5 selected models and different time lag values see fig s1 in the supplementary information document 3 3 machine learning model performance assessment once the optimal values of the hyper parameters using gs and rs techniques were determined the performance of the optimisation process for selected machine learning algorithms was evaluated it is important to consider the optimal hyper parameter measures to determine the best predictive machine learning algorithm for filtration performance prediction fig 2 compares the effects of increasing the time lag from 0 to 3 days between ufrv and model input variables model 1 to 5 in table 3 on the performance of developed machine learning algorithms which include mlr dt rf and svr with different kernel functions as well as gpr with different kernel functions that are based on r squared values fig 2 also shows whether incorporating more parameters as model input would improve ufrv predictions fig 2 shows that considering a 1 day time lag between input variables and ufrv as model output resulted in better predictions than time lags of 0 2 and 3 days for all the machine learning algorithm for example the results show that by applying the mlr algorithm to model 4 input variables true colour turbidity flow fecl3 polydadmac and chlorine the r squared values for having the time lag of 0 1 2 and 3 days to be 0 54 0 64 0 61 and 0 57 respectively this implies that the regression model for ufrv prediction has a higher predictive power when using a time lag of 1 day in this dataset also model 4 and model 5 showed better performance in terms of r squared than model 1 model 2 and model 3 however incorporating kmno4 as a model input variable i e the difference between model 4 and model 5 see table 3 did not enhance the model performance in terms of r squared with 1 day time lag using svr rbf gpr rbf gpr bessel and dt algorithms in other machine learning algorithms it only improved the model predictions marginally it is also essential to identify the root mean square error rmse of the machine learning models to identify the best model in ufrv prediction as shown in fig 3 the results of fig 2 and fig 3 revealed that rf with grid search for model 4 model input variables are true colour turbidity flow fecl3 polydadmac and chlorine and 1 day time lag provided high reliability in predicting ufrv r2 0 98 the dt algorithm with model 4 and 1 day time lag yielded a weaker performance compared to those of the rf model r2 0 90 fig 2 a among the svr algorithms with different kernel functions i e linear polynomial rbf and sigmoid the svr algorithm with the sigmoid kernel function svr sigmoid model provided the lowest performance r2 0 00 its performance with both grid search and random search was even lower than those of the mlr model fig 2 b and e however the svr with rbf kernel functions for model 4 with a 1 day time lag performed better than the other svr algorithms with an rmse of 33 68 fig 3 b and r2 of 0 92 fig 2 b the gpr algorithm with rbf laplacian and bessel kernel functions provided a good performance based on the rmse and r2 fig 2 c and f the gpr algorithm with hyperbolic kernel function provided the poorest performance in this study thus the developed rf algorithm with grid search for model 4 with a 1 day time lag performed better than the svr based model the gpr model and the dt model with an rmse of 31 58 fig 3 a and r2 of 0 98 fig 2 a fig 4 compared the results of hyperparameter tuning by the grid search and random search optimisation methods with a 1 day time lag between model output and input variables fig 4 shows that the outcomes from the grid search and random search hyperparameter optimisation methods were broadly similar in their performance measures that partially reflect previously reported findings bergstra and bengio 2012 interestingly the difference in r squared between the two hyper parameter optimisation methods random search and grid search is marginal for kernel functions that only have one or two adjustable parameters e g gpr rbf in contrast there is a large difference in the r squared of the final ufrv model between grid search and random search for the kernels in svr and gpr algorithms with more than two adjustable parameters e g svr with a polynomial kernel function this can be explained by the additional parameters that are optimised by the polynomial kernel function compared to only two parameters γ and c in the svr with rbf kernel function 3 4 grid search vs random search once the machine learning models were analysed a comparison to evaluate which model is more suitable for this dataset was carried out i e the speed at each model converges relatively to the other selected algorithms by normalising rmse against the machine learning algorithm with the highest rmse svr sigmoid in fig 3 and relatively comparing the training time fig 5 depicts a summary of the performance obtained with different machine learning algorithms including mlr dt rf svr and gpr with different kernel functions for model 4 with a 1 day time lag between ufrv and model input variables in this case the performance was determined in terms of r squared maximum the training time minimum and normalised rmse minimum by each model fig 5 shows that the svr sigmoid provided the worst performance in this dataset with the highest normalised rmse lowest r squared and the highest relative training time however the better models are rf svr rbf and gpr with rbf and laplacian as they reported greater prediction accuracy in terms of the lowest rmse and the highest r squared in addition the random search hyper parameter optimisation technique took less training time than the grid search considerably for the rf algorithm the relative training times using the grid search and random search optimisation techniques were similar but the grid search method provided a higher r squared value and a lower rmse hence the machine learning algorithms with top performance in terms of training time and prediction accuracy were rf with grid search svr rbf with random search gpr laplacian with random search and gpr rbf with random search respectively 3 5 roc analysis the roc auc curve analysis was carried out to find out whether developed machine learning models that have better performance than the others rf svr rbf gpr laplacian and gpr rbf could also predict extreme water quality events the ufrv threshold for such events was determined by studying the changing relationship between discharge and ufrv of filters hysteresis during an individual storm event in february 2020 the hysteresis between discharge and ufrv is presented in fig 6 and the ufrv threshold for such events was set to be 150 m3 m2 as the ufrv during an extreme rainfall event high flowrates was less than 150 m3 m2 fig s2 in the supplementary information document shows the roc curve for the extreme weather events ufrv 150 m3 m2 using rf svr rbf gpr laplacian and gpr rbf algorithms and a 1 day time lag between ufrv and model input variables model 5 with gpr laplacian algorithms yielded maximum auc values of 0 86 while the rf svr rbf and gpr rbf algorithms yielded auc values of 0 83 0 85 and 0 85 respectively see table 5 the results of auc values indicate that machine learning algorithms with top performance in this study i e rf with grid search svr rbf with random search gpr laplacian with random search and gpr rbf with random search not only can predict ufrv with high prediction accuracy and lowest relative training time but they can also provide high reliability in forecasting events with low ufrv auc was over 0 8 above the random level as shown in table 5 4 conclusion in this study eleven machine learning regression algorithms were applied to estimate the filter performance from water quality and operational data the required input parameters were determined using an exhaustive feature selection technique and two separate hyperparameter optimisation methods grid search and random search to optimise the parameter set the key findings arising from the study are a 1 day time lag between input variables and unit filter run volume as model output resulted in better predictions than time lags of 0 2 and 3 days the developed random forests algorithm with grid search using true colour turbidity flow fecl3 polydadmac and chlorine as model input variables and considering a 1 day time lag performed better than the svr based model the gpr model and the dt model with an rmse of 31 58 and r2 of 0 98 in terms of extreme wet weather events ufrv prediction the ufrv threshold for such events was set to be 150 m3 m2 from the hysteresis between discharge and ufrv the machine learning algorithms with top performance in terms of the training time prediction accuracy and forecasting events with low ufrv auc over 0 8 were rf with grid search svr rbf with random search gpr laplacian with random search and gpr rbf with random search respectively in conclusion the estimated ufrv of dmg filters in a direct filtration plant were in agreement with the actual measured values observed using machine learning based algorithms with optimised hyper parameters overall this study showcases the

14892,knowledge of groundwater residence times grt the time elapsed since surface water infiltration between losing rivers and pumping wells is crucial for management of water resources in alluvial aquifers the radioactive noble gas radon 222 222rn has been used for decades as a natural indicator of surface water infiltration as it can provide quantitative information on grt however models using 222rn as a tracer of grt are often based on a set of highly simplifying assumptions including spatially homogenous 222rn production and exclusively advective mass transport within the aquifer in this paper we use the integrated surface subsurface hydrological model hydrogeosphere hgs to simulate 222rn transport production and decay in a bank filtration context spatially variable 222rn production based on experimental data is explicitly considered we show that variable 222rn production rates coupled with hydrodispersive mixing of groundwater may lead to large biases in grt estimates under certain transient conditions however changes in tracer derived grts correlate well with changes in mean groundwater age whereas 222rn derived grts may only be reliable under a narrow range of field conditions 222rn may serve as a powerful tracer of changes in mean grt even in complex and heterogenous environments data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction unconsolidated alluvial aquifers are often targeted for drinking water production given their high productivity and the convenience of shallow groundwater gw exploitation hiscock and grischek 2002 margat and van der gun 2013 these systems can be described as natural water treatment sites as induced bank filtration or the pumping of gw near a surface water sw body is known to improve water quality through a range of chemical biological and physical processes during underground flow hiscock and grischek 2002 sprenger et al 2011 hydraulic gradients induced by pumping wells placed near streams coupled to high transmissivities can lead to significant infiltration fluxes and gw flow velocities therefore a large fraction of the abstracted water is composed of freshly infiltrated surface water with residence times of days to weeks frei and gilfedder 2021 tufenkji et al 2002 knowledge of both the origin and the residence time i e time from infiltration of pumped water is critical for sustainable water supply and is required to definition of capture zones assessment of gw resources sustainability and susceptibility to contamination and pollution in such contexts environmental and or artificial tracers provide observable information on sources pathways and travel times of gw as well as groundwater surface water gw sw mixing ratios brunner et al 2017 cook and herczeg 2000 the radioactive noble gas radon 222 222rn is one of few environmental tracers that is sensitive to processes of gw sw exchange at timescales of hours to 10 15 days which are often those most relevant for water management in alluvial aquifer contexts this environmental gas tracer which is naturally produced in the subsurface is a powerful indicator of gw sw interactions as concentrations in gw are usually much higher often orders of magnitude than those in sw this tracer has been extensively used over the last three decades to characterize sw infiltration into adjacent alluvial aquifers in terms of infiltration fluxes and gw residence times e g bertin and bourg 1994 frei and gilfedder 2021 hoehn and von gunten 1989 popp et al 2021 stellato et al 2013 vogt et al 2010 estimation of fluxes and residence times of bank filtrate with 222rn usually relies on the apparent age model of hoehn and von gunten 1989 which is based on the definition of a single 222rn end member activity representative of gw at radioactive equilibrium with the aquifer matrix this is usually undertaken by sampling gw at a location where 222rn activities are expected to be at secular equilibrium with the aquifer matrix or by measuring 222rn production rates directly from recovered sediment samples however the definition of a single 222rn end member activity is only meaningful if 222rn production rates are spatially homogenous at the scale of investigation this assumption contrasts with results from several field studies which have shown that 222rn production rates can vary considerably sometimes by over one order of magnitude at small scales within alluvial aquifers e g mullinger et al 2009 peel et al 2022 schaper et al 2022 recent studies put forward the potential of explicitly simulating 222rn activities with mass transport models rather than relying on simple apparent age or implicit models e g gilfedder et al 2019 peel et al 2022 schaper et al 2022 the latter even recommend avoiding the apparent 222rn age model if field measurements suggest substantial variations in 222rn production rates this follows a more general trend in hydrological sciences in which the explicit simulation of tracer concentrations in mass transport models is considered to extract the information content of tracer measurements e g schilling et al 2019 thiros et al 2021 turnadge and smerdon 2014 however the explicit simulation of tracer concentrations might not be suited when the time or the ability to incorporate tracer measurements into mass transport models coupled with sophisticated calibration approaches is not available in such conditions simple mathematical models e g apparent age models or lumped parameter models are usually preferred it is therefore critical to understand how site and tracer specific properties e g aquifer hydraulic properties transient hydraulic conditions spatiotemporal variations in tracer sources sinks etc may lead to bias in tracer derived apparent gw ages systematic exploration of the performance of the apparent 222rn age model simultaneously accounting for different aquifer properties variable hydraulic conditions and spatially heterogenous 222rn production has not yet been undertaken although it is of clear interest for water resources management accordingly the goal of the present study is to test the sensitivity of apparent or radiometric 222rn ages to i aquifer hydraulic and transport parameters ii transient hydraulic conditions and iii the magnitude and spatial scale of variability of 222rn production into gw we quantify the bias between mean and apparent gw ages and illustrate some limits of the apparent 222rn age model we also identify cases in which 222rn can provide reliable information on gw residence time without having to resort to complex numerical models to this end we constructed a synthetic 2 d mass transport model explicitly simulating mean gw age and dissolved 222rn with both spatially homogenous and heterogenous 222rn production the model simulates subsurface flow and transport along a transect downgradient of a losing river with variable 222rn production rates based on high resolution sediment incubation experiments peel et al 2022 specifically we seek to disentangle the relative importance of different sources of apparent age bias arising from i mixing of water of different ages ii transient hydraulic conditions and iii variable 222rn production 1 1 222rn as a tracer of gw age 222rn half life 3 8d is an intermediary product in the 238u decay chain and occurs naturally in gw mainly as a result of alpha decay of matrix bound 226ra cecil and green 2000 the magnitude of 222rn production in gw is controlled by several factors including total 226ra activity of aquifer material the location of 226ra in or around mineral grains sediment specific surface area pore geometry as well as water saturation cecil and green 2000 as there is no significant atmospheric source of 222rn most surface water bodies exhibit 222rn activities generally much lower often orders of magnitude than those measured in gw cecil and green 2000 only in and downstream of strongly gaining river reaches do 222rn activities in streams reach significant levels cartwright and gilfedder 2015 1 2 222rn dating method gw dating with 222rn is based on gradual increase of 222rn activities in recently infiltrated water as a function of residence time i e time since infiltration assuming spatially constant production of 222rn in gw the apparent age of a water sample a a p p t can be computed with the following equation cranswick et al 2014 hoehn and von gunten 1989 1 a a p p 1 λ r n l n a r n e q a r n m e a s a r n e q a r n 0 where a r n m e a s t 1l 3 is the activity of 222rn in a given gw sample a r n e q t 1l 3 is the activity of 222rn at equilibrium with the aquifer matrix 222rn end member activity a r n 0 t 1l 3 is the 222rn activity of surface water at the time of infiltration and λ r n t 1 is the 222rn decay constant 0 18 d 1 the equilibrium 222rn concentration of gw a r n e q is the ratio of the aquifer 222rn production rate γ r n t 2l 3 and the 222rn decay constant 2 a r n e q γ r n λ r n in practice gw may be considered at equilibrium after approximately four to five half lives of 222rn 15 20 days eq 1 has regularly been used to date young i e 15 20 days gw in bank filtration contexts e g cranswick et al 2014 frei and gilfedder 2021 pittroff et al 2017 schilling et al 2017 as is the case for most tracer based apparent age models eq 1 is only valid in the restrictive case of 1 d piston flow meaning if there is no mixing of water of different ages in a gw sample e g due to intra aquifer mixing or sampling of multiple flowlines moreover eq 1 also relies on the definition of a single 222rn end member activity a r n e q representative of gw at equilibrium with the host aquifer matrix which inherently supposes homogenous 222rn production γ r n at the scale of investigation therefore in cases where 222rn production is not homogenous definition of a single or a range of 222rn end member s for the computation of apparent gw ages is not trivial and is limited by the fragmentary knowledge of the distribution of 222rn activities and production rates at a given study site e g peel et al 2022 1 2 1 apparent age bias and gw mixing when tracer concentrations vary non linearly with respect to time any process that leads to mixing and spreading of a solute will systematically result in biases of apparent ages relative to mean ages mccallum et al 2013 varni and carrera 1998 waugh et al 2003 on top of spatially heterogenous production in the case of 222rn sources of apparent age bias include intra aquifer mixing due to dispersion and diffusion as well as mixing of waters following different flow paths in piezometers or wells with long screens bethke and johnson 2008 manning et al 2005 even in the simple case of 1d homogenous steady state flow along a hypothetical flowline hydrodynamic dispersion will lead to mixing of water of different ages and any gw sample will exhibit at least an inverse gaussian distribution of ages with variance proportional to the dispersion coefficient ginn et al 2009 assuming homogenous 222rn production the relationship between mean and apparent 222rn ages in such 1 d systems is given by the following functional relationship derived from massoudieh and ginn 2011 eq 7 3 a a p p x a m e a n x v 0 2 λ r n α l 1 4 α l λ r n v 0 1 where a a p p x t and a m e a n x t are apparent and mean ages at sampling location x l v 0 lt 1 the steady state gw flow velocity or darcy velocity and α l l the longitudinal dispersivity under such conditions the apparent age bias is a function of the ratio v 0 λ r n α l akin to the péclet number and is independent of the magnitude of the 222rn production rate γ r n this relationship highlights how apparent 222rn ages are always smaller than mean ages in the case of homogenous 222rn production only in the extreme case of purely advective transport high péclet number or minute tracer decay both ages are equal in more general terms when the rate of tracer accumulation decreases with increasing residence time such as in the case of 222rn mixing of waters of different ages will lead to an apparent age younger than the mean age mccallum et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic 2 d numerical model a generic 2 d mass transport model was constructed to analyse the effects of aquifer hydraulic and mass transport parameters transient hydraulic conditions and spatially variable 222rn production rates on the distribution of 222rn activities and apparent 222rn ages in the subsurface the synthetic model simulates infiltration of river water into an aquifer and gw flow and transport in variably saturated conditions the numerical code hydrogeosphere aquanty 2023 was used as it is capable of simulating variably saturated flow and solute transport with both source and decay terms corresponding respectively to 222rn ingrowth and disintegration the scope of the 2 d model is to explicitly simulate 222rn signatures in groundwater along multiple flowlines downgradient from the site of infiltration i e a stream or river in both steady state and transient hydraulic conditions model dimensions are 400 m x 50 m in the horizontal x and vertical z directions respectively a channel representing a simplified river bed and bank was included at the top left of the model domain channel depth 4 m width 10 m bank slope 30 the model was discretized into approximately 40 000 triangular elements with element edges ranging from about 15 cm near the top of the model and stream aquifer interface to 2 5 m at depth near the model outlet x 400 m the river was simulated by a constant head boundary condition bc along all channel nodes to ensure continuously losing river conditions i e infiltration of river water into the aquifer the outlet x 400 m was assigned a constant head at least 2 m lower than that at the inlet to simulate the effect of transient hydraulic conditions on 222rn signatures for example as a consequence of increased gw pumping a variable head bc was applied to the model outlet which simulated two incremental 1 m decreases in hydraulic head followed by a gradual return to initial conditions see fig 1 this variable head boundary leads to transient 50 and 100 increase in overall hydraulic gradients and is chosen to highlight the effect of significant variations in gw flow velocity on the distribution of 222rn throughout the model domain no flow bcs were applied to the left x 0 m and bottom z 40 m boundaries the no flow condition at the x 0 boundary represents a hypothetical water divide whereas the lower boundary represents the lower limit of the alluvial aquifer a diffuse and spatially constant recharge of 300 mm y was applied to the top boundary the effect of gw flow velocity and aquifer dispersivity on 222rn signatures in gw was explored by simulating various combinations of homogenous and isotropic hydraulic conductivity k l t 1 and longitudinal and transverse vertical dispersivity α l α t v l three spatially homogenous values of k 100 250 and 500 m d and two of longitudinal dispersivity α l 5 and 20 m were selected transverse vertical dispersivity was set to 10 of longitudinal dispersivity the values of k are representative of sand and gravel aquifers bear 1972 while those of dispersivity are consistent with measurement scales between 1 and 1000 m gelhar et al 1992 schulze makuch 2005 no clogging layer was considered at the stream aquifer interface and the hydraulic conductivity was the same as within the aquifer the van genuchten mualem model was used to simulate variably saturated flow with parameters α and β set to 4 1 m 1 and 2 2 respectively a constant porosity 0 2 was assumed for all simulations which is representative of unconsolidated sandy gravel aquifers e g fetter 2001 the solute transport model simulated both 222rn concentrations and mean gw age mean age was simulated by applying a zero age bc at the inlet and top boundaries and all elements were assigned an age source term simulating a theoretical tracer with a growth rate of unity in the subsurface i e 1 day per day goode 1996 mean gw age is therefore directly simulated through the advection dispersion transport equation and treated as a conservative solute with zero age at model inlets and a subsurface ageing term γ a g e of 1 day per day goode 1996 a zero concentration bc was applied to the inlet and top boundaries for 222rn this boundary condition reflects the fact that 222rn activities in surface waters tend to be negligible compared to those in groundwater as there are no atmospheric sources of 222rn and any dissolved 222rn is quickly lost to the atmosphere through gas transfer cecil and green 2000 222rn production by the aquifer matrix was simulated by applying a spatially variable zero order source bc to all model elements note that 222rn production and emanation rates are related by the following expression e g cook et al 2006 eq 14 4 γ r n e m ρ g r a i n λ r n 1 φ φ where e m bq kg 1 is the 222rn emanation rate ρ g r a i n kg l 1 is the density of the mineral phase and φ is the sediment porosity a homogenous grain density of 2 65 kg l 1 was assumed 222rn production rates in the unsaturated zone were scaled to account for variable water content and air water partitioning of 222rn as described in delottier et al 2022 222rn production rates in the unsaturated zone are effectively decreased by simulating instant equilibrium of produced 222rn between air and water phases according to 222rn solubility and water saturation delottier et al 2022 eq 7 5 γ r n e f f s w s w h c c γ r n s a t h c c s w 1 s w where γ r n e f f s w t 2l 3 is the effective or scaled 222rn production rate in water as a function of water saturation s w γ r n s a t t 2l 3 is the 222rn production rate in saturated conditions i e s w 1 and h c c is the dimensionless air water partitioning coefficient of 222rn h c c c w a t e r c a i r a constant air water partitioning coefficient equal to that at 10 c was used for 222rn h c c 0 35 calculated after weigel 1978 free solution diffusion coefficients for both 222rn and mean age were set to 10 9 m2 s goode 1996 ishimori et al 2013 for each transient simulation initial 222rn concentrations were determined from steady state conditions with outlet hydraulic head h 0 5 m finally the transient model was run for a total simulation time of 60 days fig 1b 222rn production rates are based on a high resolution dataset of 222rn emanation rates in a bank filtration setting peel et al 2022 these production rates provide a realistic basis upon which a variety of spatial distributions of 222rn production could be constructed a simplified geostatistical framework was employed to create spatially variable distributions of 222rn production rates in the 2 d model three synthetic variogram models representing small intermediate and large scale variability of 222rn production were employed to capture a substantial range of spatial distributions of 222rn production rates for all scenarios an exponential variogram model was used with ranges from 20 10 m up to 200 30 m in the x and z directions respectively see table 1 synthetic conditioning data based on the statistical properties of measured 222rn emanation rates were placed at regular intervals within the model grid with spacing equal to half the variogram ranges in both the x and z directions for the three variogram models fifty sets of synthetic conditioning data were created for each of these datasets ten equiprobable realizations of the spatial distribution of emanation rates total 500 realizations per variogram model were generated with a sequential gaussian simulation sgs algorithm with the geone python software package straubhaar 2020 a full description of the geostatistical workflow can be found in appendix a this methodology led to a coefficient of variation cv of modelled 222rn production rates of over 50 for each realization with a mean 222rn production rate 1 σ of 3 0 1 6 bq l 1 s 1 see table 1 2 2 quantification of apparent age bias the bias or relative deviation between apparent 222rn and mean ages at a given location can be defined as 6 bias x t a app x t a mean x t a mean x t where a m e a n x t t and a a p p x t t are the mean directly simulated and apparent computed from simulated 222rn activities ages of groundwater at sampling location x and simulation time t in the considered 2 d system bias can arise from i mixing of water of different ages hydrodynamic dispersion and ii variable 222rn production rates γ r n i e a non unique 222rn end member activity a r n e q mixing due to sampling of multiple flowlines is not considered in the present study although this may be an issue in many real world contexts due to long screens in piezometers to disentangle the contributions of mixing and variable 222rn production to the age bias eq 6 transient simulations were run for the six combinations of hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity see table 1 with a constant value of γ r n assigned to all model elements in these scenarios any age bias results from mixing of gw with different ages synthetic linear observation wells were placed throughout the model domain at regular intervals of 2 5 6 25 and 12 5 m in the horizontal direction for cases where k was equal to respectively 100 250 and 500 m d well placement shown in appendix b each well is placed from the surface to a depth of 20 m output including mean gw age and 222rn activities was produced for all nodes located within 10 cm of these synthetic observation wells this allowed the calculation of apparent age bias at various locations within the model domain at every timestep for cases where 222rn production is spatially constant a generic value of γ r n equal to porosity i e 0 2 was selected for these simulations note that apparent age bias does not depend on the choice of γ r n in the case of constant 222rn input as all simulated 222rn activities are normalized by the end member activity a r n e q for calculation of apparent age for the calculation of apparent ages a r n e q was constant and defined as the ratio of γ r n and λ r n eq 2 subsequently simulations were run by assuming spatially variable 222rn production the 222rn apparent age bias that is the amount of bias attributed solely to the spatial variability of 222rn input was defined from eq 6 as 7 b i a s r n x t b i a s γ r n v a r x t b i a s γ r n c s t x t a a p p γ r n v a r x t a a p p γ r n c s t x t a m e a n x t where b i a s γ r n v a r x t and b i a s γ r n c s t x t are the apparent age biases in the case of spatially variable and constant 222rn production γ r n respectively and a a p p γ r n v a r x t t and a a p p γ r n c s t x t t are similarly the apparent 222rn ages in the two cases the definition of a single 222rn end member equilibrium activity for the computation of apparent age is not straightforward in cases where the 222rn input is spatially variable indeed local changes in production rates will lead to commensurate changes in 222rn activities especially for old groundwater components with mean ages 25 days in real world settings groundwater may be sampled at one or several locations where it is expected to be at secular equilibrium with the aquifer matrix if 222rn production is spatially variable measured end member activities may strongly depend on sampling location to account for this non uniqueness in the definition of 222rn end member equilibrium activities and to encompass all possible apparent ages based on simulation results three 222rn end member activities were defined representing respectively the 1 minimum 2 mean and 3 maximum simulated 222rn concentrations at nodes where the mean age in steady state flow and transport conditions is 25 days these end member activities therefore represent integrated 222rn input signals from model inlets to sampling points for each simulation end member activities were computed from simulated 222rn activities at over 150 nodes where mean gw age was above 25 days to simultaneously account for the influence of mass transport processes advection dispersion the rate of 222rn accumulation and the scale of variability of 222rn production in relation to the sampling scale we introduce a dimensionless damköhler like number n r n 0 8 n r n 0 λ r n l 2 α l v s l where l l is the sampling scale e g the distance from the inlet to the sampling point s l is the scale of variability of 222rn production rates e g geostatistical correlation length and v l t 1 the representative gw flow velocity darcy velocity the first set of terms λ r n l 2 α l v is the damköhler number for a reaction with first order coefficient λ r n e g oldham et al 2013 and represents the relative dispersive mass transport and radiochemical i e 222rn accumulation timescales the ratio s l is a measure of the relative timescale a given water sample will have spent in zones of distinct 222rn production potentially high or low here the radiochemical timescale is given by λ r n instead of the 222rn production rates γ r n as the rate of 222rn accumulation is one of first order increase modulated by the 222rn decay constant if we assume the ratio l v approximates the mean age of a water sample we can simplify eq 8 9 n r n 0 n r n a m e a n λ r n s α l the amount of 222rn bias eq 7 as a function of n r n may offer some insight on the combined effects of mass transport spatial correlation of 222rn production rates and the residence time of gw on the performance of the apparent 222rn age model indeed low values of n r n are associated smaller scale spatial variations in 222rn production rates as given by s lower gw residence times a m e a n and therefore on average lower 222rn activities and higher smoothing of 222rn activities due to hydrodynamic dispersion α l resultant spatial distributions of 222rn activities tend to be smoother and computed apparent ages less influenced by the asymptotic behaviour of the 222rn age model when activities approach those of the end member taken together these effects likely dampen the effect of variable 222rn production on 222rn bias the converse is true for large values of n r n 3 results 3 1 modelled 222rn end member equilibrium activities as described in section 2 2 three different 222rn end member equilibrium activities were defined for each simulation representing respectively the 1 minimum 2 mean and 3 maximum simulated steady state 222rn concentrations at nodes where the mean age is 25 days each of these end member activities vary from one simulation to the next depending on the given spatial distribution of 222rn production rates the range of end member 222rn activities for each of the eighteen illustrative cases described in section 2 1 is shown in fig 2 for the six combinations of k and αl modelled 222rn end member activities vary on average around a value representative of the mean production rate 16 5 bq l 1 see table 1 this results from the lack of a systematic trend in the spatial distribution of 222rn production rates i e spatially constant mean production rate within the model domain however the spread of 222rn equilibrium activities both within a given 222rn end member class min mean or max and between these end member activities depends most strongly on hydraulic conductivity k albeit with significant influence of dispersivity αl and the spatial distribution of production rates as given by the variogram models indeed the range of end member activities and differences between end member classes are largest at low values of k and αl and large variogram ranges coefficients of variation of the mean 222rn end member activities range from 0 04 for the case α l 20 m k 500 m d and smallest spatial correlation vario 1 to 0 09 for the case α l 5 m k 100 m d and largest variogram range vario 3 the ratio of mean minimum to maximum end member activities ranges from 1 1 to 2 3 for the same cases these observations can be linked to the smoothing effect of both gw flow velocity and dispersion on observed 222rn activities this is readily seen in fig 3 which shows the distribution of 222rn activities within the model domain for a single realization of variable 222rn production rates at low velocities and dispersivities 222rn activities are very sensitive to small scale changes in production rates indeed 222rn concentrations will be highly influenced by the local magnitude of 222rn input as velocities and dispersivities increase 222rn activities are averaged out as they integrate 222rn input signals from an increasing portion of the aquifer and tend to be representative of the mean 222rn production rate this averaging effect is modulated by the range of spatial correlation of 222rn production rates indeed large zones of below or above average 222rn input will appear in the model domain when variogram ranges are largest the core of these zones will retain distinct 222rn signatures even when flow velocities or dispersivity are large as gw residence times within these zones allows 222rn activities to equilibrate with the local aquifer 222rn production rates 3 2 apparent age bias in steady state conditions 3 2 1 sensitivity to aquifer parameters k αl tv and scale of variability of 222rn production the range of simulated 222rn apparent age biases in steady state conditions i e incurred only by the spatial variability of 222rn production eq 7 as a function of mean age at all synthetic observation points is shown in fig 4 for each of combination of hydraulic conductivity dispersivity and choice of 222rn end member activity sections 2 1 and 2 2 apparent ages were truncated at 16 5 days i e at 95 end member activities this apparent age is practically an upper limit for the 222rn dating technique see section 1 1 in these instances additional age bias was therefore not computed for readability only results for one variogram model are shown in fig 4a variogram 3 with the largest correlation length for 222rn production results from other variogram models exhibit the same overall trends and are shown in appendix c note that the age bias incurred by mixing of water of different ages through hydrodynamic dispersion has been subtracted from the total apparent age bias see eq 7 in cases simulated here the effect of mixing is well approximated by eq 3 and ranges from 0 05 for the case k 500 m d and α l 5 m to approximately 0 5 for the case k 100 m d and α l 20 m see appendix c as shown in fig 4a the average 222rn apparent age bias is neutral negative and positive when computing apparent ages respectively with the mean maximum and minimum 222rn end members this is a result of the sensitivity of the apparent age equation eq 1 to end member definition indeed using an end member with large 222rn activities will lead on average to an underestimation of gw age and vice versa in all cases presented here age bias will tend to be slightly shifted towards positive values as a result of the higher production rates modelled near infiltration zones see appendix a leading on average to higher 222rn activities and thus apparent ages this is most clearly visible at lower values of k and α l fig 4a as lower gw velocities will lead to increased residence time in zones of high 222rn production and the smoothing effect of dispersivity remains modest the magnitude and range of additional age bias is very sensitive to both gw flow velocity controlled by hydraulic conductivity k dispersivity α l and the scale of variability of 222rn production as given by the variogram models indeed the range of 222rn apparent age bias increases when both velocities and dispersivities are low and the scale of variability of 222rn input is large for example in the case where k 100 m d α l 5 m and the scale of variability is largest variogram 3 the 25 75 interval for additional bias ranges between 0 3 and 1 at mean age 5 days and between 0 4 and 1 at mean age 10 days conversely when k 500 m d α l 20 m and the scale of variability is lowest variogram 1 see fig 4b additional bias is much more modest with a 25 75 interval between 0 and 0 17 at mean age 5 days and between 0 and 0 25 at mean age 10 days this observation is linked to the smoothing effects of both gw flow velocity and dispersivity as described in section 3 1 indeed even though 222rn activities oscillate around a value representative of the mean production rate large variations in observed 222rn concentrations at greater distances or mean gw ages will lead to a large range of possible end member activities and thus to highly non unique apparent age estimates see fig 2 at low mean ages 5 10 days the possible range of positive apparent age bias i e overestimation of gw mean age tends to increase with mean age as the apparent age equation becomes more sensitive to small changes in 222rn activities when the latter start approaching end member activities see eq 1 conversely the range of negative 222rn age bias remains mostly constant as a function of mean age cases where the 222rn age bias is lowest represents those where the 222rn production rates are lowest between the inlet and sampling points 222rn activities will not near those of the end member and computed apparent ages remain low and are not affected by the asymptotic behaviour of the apparent age equation eq 1 at high 222rn activities the decrease in both the values and the spread of 222rn age bias at higher mean ages 5 10 days results from two overlapping effects i the smoothing effect from integrating signals from an increasing portion of the aquifer and ii the truncation of apparent ages at 16 5 days the former is related to the increasing distance between the inlet and sampling points at higher mean ages and 222rn signals being increasingly representative of the mean production rate i e lower sensitivity to small scale variations in 222rn production rates the latter effect is significant for scenarios where the mean and minimum 222rn end members are used in apparent age computations respectively grey and blue in fig 4 in such cases 222rn activities will more rapidly approach end member activities in instances where the mean production rate between the inlet and the sampling point is comparatively high when 222rn activities exceed 95 of those of the end member i e apparent age 16 5 days apparent ages and thus 222rn age bias are not computed therefore at higher mean ages computable apparent ages will disproportionately reflect cases where the mean production rates between the inlet and the sampling point are generally lower this leads to lower apparent ages and therefore to a more negative 222rn age bias this effect is even more pronounced when using the minimum end member as on average 222rn activities will more tend to approach even more rapidly those of the end member therefore lower 222rn age bias at higher values of mean age is not always synonymous with apparent age estimates being better constrained at higher mean ages but rather that apparent ages can be computed at greater distances from the inlet only for a subset of simulations finally the decrease in apparent age bias at higher mean ages in cases where the maximum end member is used is related to the existence of an apparent age threshold in many cases apparent ages will remain low at even high mean ages as 222rn activities may remain significantly lower than those of the maximum end member the combined influences of mean gw age spatial correlation of 222rn production rates as well as hydro dispersive mixing on 222rn age bias can be seen in fig 5 which shows the 222rn age bias as a function of n r n see eq 9 the spread of 222rn age bias is lowest at low values of n r n and tends to increase as n r n increases for example at values of n r n 0 1 the 25 75 interval of 222rn age bias ranges from 0 to 0 2 whereas it ranges from 0 25 to 0 5 at n r n 10 at the highest values of n r n and thus of mean gw age the 222rn bias tends to decrease for the same reasons noted in the previous paragraphs when n r n 1 generally higher spatial correlation of 222rn production lower dispersivity higher mean gw ages measured 222rn activities are likely to be strongly affected by zones of high or low 222rn production which lead to high variability in 222rn activities which will often approach those of the end member s and a large range of 222rn end members leading in turn to high potential bias in computed apparent 222rn apparent ages conversely when n r n 1 222rn activities are more representative of the mean 222rn production rate small differences between end members will exist and only moderate 222rn bias will arise when computing apparent 222rn ages 3 3 apparent age bias in transient conditions fig 6 shows the range of transient simulated mean and apparent ages for the six combinations of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity at nodes where mean age in steady state conditions is equal to 8 0 0 1 d results follow similar trends for different mean ages and variogram models see appendix b all data points not located on the mean age 8 d line result from transient hydraulic conditions increased sw infiltration and gw flow velocity caused by the variable head boundary at the outlet see fig 1 will lead to lower mean ages at any given observation point as already highlighted in section 1 1 2 apparent ages in steady state conditions tend to be lower than mean ages owing to hydrodynamic dispersion and are clustered on average near although slightly below the 1 d bias line see fig 6 which represents the steady state relationship between mean and apparent ages in 1 d systems with constant 222rn input eq 3 this is because 222rn activities integrate information on the distribution of 222rn production between the inlet and a given sampling point and tend to be on average representative of the mean production rate additional negative age bias is due to the additional effect of transverse dispersion which is not considered in 1 d systems as explained in the previous section apparent ages are consistently under and overestimated in relation to the bias line when using the maximum and minimum 222rn endmembers respectively moreover owing to the same smoothing mechanisms described in the previous sections the range of computed apparent ages in steady state conditions is greatest at low velocities and dispersivities and when the scale of variability in 222rn input is highest this is evident in fig 6 by the spread of apparent ages at mean age 8 days for the different combinations of k and α l in transient conditions the twofold increase in gw flow velocity due to the transient head boundary at the outlet leads to a decrease of mean age up to 50 from 8 to 4 days a decrease of apparent 222rn ages as well as to an overall decrease in the spread of apparent ages in other words the potential for additional apparent age bias tends to decrease when gw flow velocities increase once again due to the smoothing effects described previously in the conditions simulated here changes in mean and apparent ages tend to follow a mostly linear pattern with varying slopes depending on the choice of the 222rn endmember in other words in transient conditions variations in apparent ages tend to be associated with proportional variations in mean ages regardless of the choice of the 222rn endmember to better visualize this relationship we define a a p p r n r e l x t and a m e a n r e l x t as respectively the relative apparent 222rn and relative mean gw ages 10 a a p p r n r e l x t a a p p r n x t a a p p r n x 0 11 a m e a n r e l x t a m e a n x t a m e a n x 0 where a a p p r n x t t and a m e a n x t t are the relative apparent 222rn and mean gw ages at location x and time t and a a p p r n x 0 t and a m e a n x 0 t are similarly apparent 222rn and mean gw ages at the start of the simulations t 0 a a p p r n r e l x t and a m e a n r e l x t as a function of simulation time are shown in fig 7 in cases where advection dominates over dispersive processes i e high velocities and low dispersivities relative mean and apparent ages behave in a very consistent manner deviations between the two are mainly controlled by non uniqueness in the definition of a 222rn end member conversely when dispersivity is large in relation to the flow velocity changes in relative mean age are delayed in comparison to relative apparent ages this most evident at the latter portion of the simulations where relative mean ages return more slowly to steady state conditions this is a consequence of the relatively low half life of 222rn 3 8 d which results in gw 222rn activities being quickly in local equilibrium with the aquifer matrix even in transient hydraulic conditions and the persistence of a proportion of younger gw during the return to steady state conditions will only marginally affect 222rn activities and apparent 222rn ages despite some degree of bias arising from dispersion as well as from the non uniqueness of the 222rn end member relative apparent ages track relative mean ages within 5 15 in most simulations in contrast apparent ages are much more poorly constrained most notably at low gw flow velocities in cases where mass transport is dominated by advective rather that dispersive processes relative changes in mean apparent 222rn show excellent correlation with changes in mean gw age 4 discussion 4 1 bias of apparent 222rn ages results from the synthetic models illustrate that even in idealized homogenous 2 d flow systems the 222rn apparent age model may not provide reliable estimates of mean gw age in steady state conditions on top of the negative age bias incurred by mixing of gw with different ages through hydrodispersive mixing and multiple flowline sampling spatial heterogeneity of 222rn production rates could lead to large additional biases put together these effects lead to apparent 222rn ages regularly differing from mean gw ages by a factor of two or more in the conditions simulated here the magnitude of 222rn apparent age bias that is the age bias incurred solely by variable 222rn production rates can be captured by the dimensionless number n r n with low values 1 in cases simulated here correlated to low additional 222rn age bias and vice versa we show that the magnitude of age bias incurred by heterogenous 222rn production is highest i at low flow velocities ii in cases where hydrodispersive mixing is limited iii at high mean gw ages and iv if the scale of spatial correlation of 222rn production rates is high compared to the sampling scale under such circumstances 222rn signals are very sensitive to local variations in 222rn production rates leading to high spatial variability in the distribution of 222rn activities and ambiguity in the definition of a representative 222rn end member activity conversely when flow velocities and dispersion increase 222rn activities are smoothed and tend to reflect mean 222rn production rates reliable estimates of gw age with apparent 222rn age model are therefore limited to cases where advective processes dominate i e high péclet number little mixing of gw of different ages and where there is little additional bias from spatially variable 222rn production rates i e low n r n for both conditions to simultaneously hold hydrodispersive processes must remain marginal in relation to advective transport which requires the spatial scale of variability of 222rn production rates to be significantly smaller than the sampling scale and or mean gw age to remain relatively low see eq 9 results from transient simulations illustrate how time series of 222rn activities can provide reliable information on changes in mean gw age even in cases where dispersive processes are significant and the 222rn end members and apparent 222rn ages are poorly constrained in the contexts modelled here relative apparent and mean ages show very similar trends although some deviations are noticeable in highly transient conditions indeed 222rn signatures are more sensitive than mean gw age to abrupt changes in hydraulic conditions especially in contexts where dispersive processes are significant this results from the differing sensitivities of apparent and mean ages to the presence of gw components with residence times above 15 20 days whereas mean gw ages are determined by the entire age distribution of gw ages at any point in space and time apparent 222rn ages are insensitive to the distribution of ages above the 15 20 day threshold as these components are effectively at local radioactive equilibrium with the aquifer matrix therefore any transient perturbation in the gw age distribution at ages above this threshold will not affect the computation of apparent 222rn ages but will nevertheless have a lasting effect on mean gw ages until the distribution of ages reaches pseudo steady state conditions transient deviations between both ages are more evident when dispersion becomes a dominant mass transport process as gw age distributions tend to be broad and only slowly stabilize to equilibrium conditions conversely when hydraulic conditions vary more smoothly both apparent and mean gw ages remain in excellent agreement the coherence of the relative apparent and mean ages can be attributed to the fact that throughout the simulation period 222rn activities at all observation points integrate production rate signals from the same portions of the aquifer upgradient of the sampling points in other terms transient 222rn signals in gw near infiltration zones remain representative of an average 222rn production rate between infiltration and sampling points therefore in the 2 d settings presented here temporal variations in 222rn activities are almost exclusively attributed to changes in time since infiltration i e gw age and not to changes in gw flow paths through zones of differing 222rn input it must however be noted that a 2 d model will lead to obvious simplifications over complex 3 d flow and mass transport processes encountered in real world environments changes in hydraulic conditions due to precipitation variable river discharge changes in river bed permeability gw pumping etc may lead to changes in gw flow and mass transport patterns not captured by the models presented in this study moreover system transience is simulated exclusively through changes in hydraulic head at the model outlet downgradient of observations points in natural systems changes in river stage from storm events seasonal patterns etc will also control hydraulic gradients between infiltration zones and observation points abrupt variations in river stage may lead to complex flow conditions not modelled here such as temporary flow reversal e g bank storage return flow nevertheless under less highly transient conditions flow patterns will generally reflect overall hydraulic gradients whether they result from downgradient changes in gw head e g through changes in gw pumping or from variations in river stage we therefore expect similar 222rn and mean gw age signatures to emerge in both cases any significant changes if flowline geometry upstream of a sampling point will add an additional layer of complexity in interpreting 222rn signals as sampled gw will be influenced by portions of the aquifer where 222rn production rates may differ in field settings the validity of assuming consistent flowline geometry under transient conditions must be justified by site specific properties this assumption is most likely to hold in circumstances where gw flow and mass transport are controlled by the existence of preferential flow pathways i e highly conductive zones such preferential flow structures are abundant in many alluvial aquifers and are known to strongly affect gw flow solute transport and sw gw exchange fluxes e g boano et al 2014 huggenberger et al 1998 in conditions where gw flow is consistently channelized through large scale hydraulically connected flow structures we expect the correlation between mean and apparent ages to be less controlled by the heterogeneity of hydraulic parameters than by the distribution of 222rn production rates upgradient of sampling points the degree of system transience and the relative influence of advective and dispersive mass transport processes 4 2 implications for use of 222rn as a tracer of gw age the assumptions underpinning the apparent 222rn age model are quite restrictive and can often not be justified by field conditions we ve illustrated how apparent 222rn ages provide reliable estimates of mean gw age in losing river contexts only if each the following conditions are met 1 the scale of variation or spatial correlation of 222rn production rates is small in comparison to the sampling scale and or mean gw age is much lower than the upper limit 15 days of the apparent 222rn age model i e low n r n 2 there is no systematic trend in the spatial distribution of 222rn production rates 3 mass transport is advection dominated i e high péclet number 4 the 222rn endmember can be reasonably well constrained 5 the assumption of sampling a single flowline is reasonable e g short screened intervals 6 there is no mixing of different gw components e g recently infiltrated sw and regional gw or this mixing can explicitly be accounted for e g via tracer based approaches conditions 3 to 6 also need to hold in conditions where the 222rn production rate is constant as any mixing of water of different ages will lead to a negative in the case of 222rn bias of apparent ages in relation to mean gw ages ideally data for verification of conditions 1 and 2 can be obtained through high resolution measurements of 222rn production rates from recovered aquifer material e g through 222rn incubation experiments on sediment cores as this is often practically infeasible high resolution measurements of 222rn activities in gw near radioactive equilibrium with the aquifer matrix can provide an estimate of the degree of heterogeneity of 222rn production this requires a dense piezometer network at locations not influenced by recently infiltrated sw with ages 15 20 days however these measurements will not provide any direct information on the 222rn production rates at locations of active sw infiltration i e where apparent 222rn age estimates are relevant in cases where field conditions and data are inconsistent with the above requirements calculation of absolute 222rn ages should be done with caution or avoided altogether indeed we have shown that even in simple systems such as those simulated in the present study modest variability in the spatial distribution of 222rn production rates can lead to large discrepancies between mean and apparent 222rn ages in conditions modelled here mean and apparent 222rn ages may regularly differ by a factor of two or more even for very young gw mean age 5 days such levels of uncertainty need to be factored into any estimates of gw age made with 222rn additionally the upper age limit of the 222rn dating method is modulated by the magnitude of spatial variability in 222rn production rates considering the variability in 222rn production modelled in this study apparent age estimates for gw with mean ages greater than 10 days may become problematic as 222rn activities may be influenced by zones of high 222rn production not captured by the chosen 222rn end member activity indeed as the sensitivity of 222rn age equation increases as 222rn activities approach those of the end member activity large positive biases in gw age estimates may result this upper age limit of 10 days is lower than the 15 days put forward in other studies e g cranswick et al 2014 hoehn and von gunten 1989 which only applies to conditions where 222rn input is spatially constant these conclusions build on those of recent studies of apparent 222rn ages in alluvial contexts e g gilfedder et al 2019 schaper et al 2022 which have highlighted the limitations of the apparent 222rn age model in both homogenous and heterogenous environments in transient hydraulic conditions however valuable information gw age can be gained from time series of 222rn activities indeed in losing river contexts variations in 222rn activities and computed apparent 222rn ages may be intimately linked to changes in mean gw age indeed if the following criteria are met our simulations have shown that relative changes in apparent 222rn ages can be reliably used as a proxy for variations in mean gw ages 1 the system is not in a state of acute disequilibrium i e system transience in not extreme at the time of sampling 2 flowline geometry of sampled water remains stable through transient conditions i e sampled water integrates 222rn production information from the same zones of the aquifer 3 the gw age distribution of sampled water is dominated by water with ages significantly lower than the upper age limit for the 222rn dating technique 10 days in our simulations 4 the 222rn end member is significantly higher at least 15 than measured 222rn activities 5 there is no mixing of different gw components e g recently infiltrated sw and regional gw or this mixing can explicitly be quantified e g via tracer based approaches interestingly these observations equally hold in cases the spatial distribution of 222rn production is highly heterogenous moreover the computation of relative apparent ages is only moderately sensitive to the definition of the 222rn end member insomuch as its magnitude is significantly larger than measured activities and consistent with production rates at a given field site although absolute mean ages may not be adequately estimated from apparent 222rn ages temporal variations in 222rn activities can be used as a tool to investigate changes in mean gw age at a given sampling location assuming as the conditions listed above hold these assumptions must be justified in individual field settings if estimates of mean gw age can be made at different points in time through an alternate method e g artificial tracer test apparent 222rn and mean ages can be tied allowing the computation of a time series of absolute mean ages from changes in apparent 222rn ages this would apply to both continuous and occasional measurements of 222rn activities we suggest whenever possible comparing several separate measurements of mean and apparent gw ages this allows independent verification of the equivalence between variations in mean and apparent 222rn ages in transient conditions 4 3 limitations our analysis has been limited to simplified 2 d systems which are unable to reproduce complex 3 d flow and mass transport phenomena moreover gw mixing caused by lateral inflows or water exchange with aquitards and or low permeability lenses was not considered which may lead to strong underestimations of mean gw age furthermore we only consider a simplified system with spatially homogenous hydraulic properties conductivity porosity dispersivity it is well established that bias between tracer derived and mean gw ages increases with increasing heterogeneity of hydraulic parameters e g gardner et al 2015 mccallum et al 2013 as noted in the preceding section the effect of hydraulic parameter heterogeneity on the performance of the 222rn age model may not be exceedingly detrimental in conditions were channelized flow and transport are dominant processes however the impact of hydraulic parameter heterogeneity has not been quantified in the present work and should be systematically addressed in future studies furthermore we suspect that the conclusions concerning transient 222rn signals do not hold for sampling locations where convergent flow occurs e g at pumping wells indeed disentangling contributions from all gw components with ages 10 days to the overall 222rn signal is practically impossible without resorting to additional tracer methods and or numerical modelling tools additionally the results presented in this study are valid only for the magnitude of variability of 222rn production rates modelled in the present study i e cv of 50 see table 1 section 2 1 we expect the amount of 222rn age bias to increase with increasing variability in 222rn production rates although this should be investigated in future studies our simulations do not include systematic trends in the spatial distribution of 222rn production rates which could lead to additional bias in apparent 222rn ages this approach was chosen as no observable spatial trend could be discerned from the experimental data used in the simulations it is unclear whether this is a peculiarity of the selected field site or a feature common to many alluvial aquifers the latter may be true at other similar sites as alluvial deposits within a small region of an aquifer often share many features such as common depositional histories as well as rheological and geochemical properties 5 conclusions the objective of the present study was to explore the reliability of 222rn as a tracer of gw age in bank filtration contexts where 222rn production rates are spatially variable by including laboratory measurements of 222rn emanation rates in a physically based model we illustrated how spatially variable 222rn input as well as hydrodispersive mixing may lead to biased estimates of 222rn derived gw age we show that the combined effects of gw mixing and spatially variable 222rn production rates may lead to high biases between apparent 222rn ages and mean gw age limiting the reliability of the 222rn dating technique to contexts where mass transport is advection dominated sampling scale is much larger than the scale of variability of 222rn production rates and gw is sampled from shortly screened intervals the deleterious effects of mixing and variable 222rn input on the apparent 222rn age model are somewhat dampened when interpreting time series of 222rn activities at a given observation point inasmuch as gw flow paths remain essentially stable in transient conditions 222rn activities can provide reliable information on relative changes in mean gw age even in environments where the spatial distribution of 222rn production is highly heterogenous the scope of application for the relative apparent 222rn age model remains quite restrictive and information justifying its use in field settings may often be lacking the sampling and continuous monitoring of additional tracers e g electrical conductivity stable isotopes of water gw temperature may provide further information on gw residence times at temporal scales relevant to bank filtration contexts however these tracers do not systematically exhibit distinct concentrations in river water and sampled gw or show measurable temporal variations in sw that can be linked to variations in gw in such cases 222rn often remains one of few practical tracers that can provide information on gw residence times at timescales of days to weeks the simulation of 222rn and any other studied tracer in fully coupled physically based 3 d mass transport models offers a more robust conceptual framework through which the information content of tracer measurements can be better extracted e g turnadge and smerdon 2014 with such models the uncertainty in tracer relevant parameters such as the spatial distribution of tracer sources and sinks hydraulic mass transport parameters etc may be explicitly accounted for parameterization of these models can be improved through the inclusion of tracer measurements e g schaper et al 2022 thiros et al 2021 which in turn leads to increased predictive accuracy of estimates of management interest such as gw sw exchange fluxes mixing ratios and gw residence times however when access to additional such complex modelling and calibration tools is not possible monitoring changes in 222rn activities can be helpful to gain a better conceptual understanding of the sensitivity of the gw sw system and gw age to changes in hydraulic conditions although absolute age estimates should always be interpreted with caution declaration of competing

14892,knowledge of groundwater residence times grt the time elapsed since surface water infiltration between losing rivers and pumping wells is crucial for management of water resources in alluvial aquifers the radioactive noble gas radon 222 222rn has been used for decades as a natural indicator of surface water infiltration as it can provide quantitative information on grt however models using 222rn as a tracer of grt are often based on a set of highly simplifying assumptions including spatially homogenous 222rn production and exclusively advective mass transport within the aquifer in this paper we use the integrated surface subsurface hydrological model hydrogeosphere hgs to simulate 222rn transport production and decay in a bank filtration context spatially variable 222rn production based on experimental data is explicitly considered we show that variable 222rn production rates coupled with hydrodispersive mixing of groundwater may lead to large biases in grt estimates under certain transient conditions however changes in tracer derived grts correlate well with changes in mean groundwater age whereas 222rn derived grts may only be reliable under a narrow range of field conditions 222rn may serve as a powerful tracer of changes in mean grt even in complex and heterogenous environments data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction unconsolidated alluvial aquifers are often targeted for drinking water production given their high productivity and the convenience of shallow groundwater gw exploitation hiscock and grischek 2002 margat and van der gun 2013 these systems can be described as natural water treatment sites as induced bank filtration or the pumping of gw near a surface water sw body is known to improve water quality through a range of chemical biological and physical processes during underground flow hiscock and grischek 2002 sprenger et al 2011 hydraulic gradients induced by pumping wells placed near streams coupled to high transmissivities can lead to significant infiltration fluxes and gw flow velocities therefore a large fraction of the abstracted water is composed of freshly infiltrated surface water with residence times of days to weeks frei and gilfedder 2021 tufenkji et al 2002 knowledge of both the origin and the residence time i e time from infiltration of pumped water is critical for sustainable water supply and is required to definition of capture zones assessment of gw resources sustainability and susceptibility to contamination and pollution in such contexts environmental and or artificial tracers provide observable information on sources pathways and travel times of gw as well as groundwater surface water gw sw mixing ratios brunner et al 2017 cook and herczeg 2000 the radioactive noble gas radon 222 222rn is one of few environmental tracers that is sensitive to processes of gw sw exchange at timescales of hours to 10 15 days which are often those most relevant for water management in alluvial aquifer contexts this environmental gas tracer which is naturally produced in the subsurface is a powerful indicator of gw sw interactions as concentrations in gw are usually much higher often orders of magnitude than those in sw this tracer has been extensively used over the last three decades to characterize sw infiltration into adjacent alluvial aquifers in terms of infiltration fluxes and gw residence times e g bertin and bourg 1994 frei and gilfedder 2021 hoehn and von gunten 1989 popp et al 2021 stellato et al 2013 vogt et al 2010 estimation of fluxes and residence times of bank filtrate with 222rn usually relies on the apparent age model of hoehn and von gunten 1989 which is based on the definition of a single 222rn end member activity representative of gw at radioactive equilibrium with the aquifer matrix this is usually undertaken by sampling gw at a location where 222rn activities are expected to be at secular equilibrium with the aquifer matrix or by measuring 222rn production rates directly from recovered sediment samples however the definition of a single 222rn end member activity is only meaningful if 222rn production rates are spatially homogenous at the scale of investigation this assumption contrasts with results from several field studies which have shown that 222rn production rates can vary considerably sometimes by over one order of magnitude at small scales within alluvial aquifers e g mullinger et al 2009 peel et al 2022 schaper et al 2022 recent studies put forward the potential of explicitly simulating 222rn activities with mass transport models rather than relying on simple apparent age or implicit models e g gilfedder et al 2019 peel et al 2022 schaper et al 2022 the latter even recommend avoiding the apparent 222rn age model if field measurements suggest substantial variations in 222rn production rates this follows a more general trend in hydrological sciences in which the explicit simulation of tracer concentrations in mass transport models is considered to extract the information content of tracer measurements e g schilling et al 2019 thiros et al 2021 turnadge and smerdon 2014 however the explicit simulation of tracer concentrations might not be suited when the time or the ability to incorporate tracer measurements into mass transport models coupled with sophisticated calibration approaches is not available in such conditions simple mathematical models e g apparent age models or lumped parameter models are usually preferred it is therefore critical to understand how site and tracer specific properties e g aquifer hydraulic properties transient hydraulic conditions spatiotemporal variations in tracer sources sinks etc may lead to bias in tracer derived apparent gw ages systematic exploration of the performance of the apparent 222rn age model simultaneously accounting for different aquifer properties variable hydraulic conditions and spatially heterogenous 222rn production has not yet been undertaken although it is of clear interest for water resources management accordingly the goal of the present study is to test the sensitivity of apparent or radiometric 222rn ages to i aquifer hydraulic and transport parameters ii transient hydraulic conditions and iii the magnitude and spatial scale of variability of 222rn production into gw we quantify the bias between mean and apparent gw ages and illustrate some limits of the apparent 222rn age model we also identify cases in which 222rn can provide reliable information on gw residence time without having to resort to complex numerical models to this end we constructed a synthetic 2 d mass transport model explicitly simulating mean gw age and dissolved 222rn with both spatially homogenous and heterogenous 222rn production the model simulates subsurface flow and transport along a transect downgradient of a losing river with variable 222rn production rates based on high resolution sediment incubation experiments peel et al 2022 specifically we seek to disentangle the relative importance of different sources of apparent age bias arising from i mixing of water of different ages ii transient hydraulic conditions and iii variable 222rn production 1 1 222rn as a tracer of gw age 222rn half life 3 8d is an intermediary product in the 238u decay chain and occurs naturally in gw mainly as a result of alpha decay of matrix bound 226ra cecil and green 2000 the magnitude of 222rn production in gw is controlled by several factors including total 226ra activity of aquifer material the location of 226ra in or around mineral grains sediment specific surface area pore geometry as well as water saturation cecil and green 2000 as there is no significant atmospheric source of 222rn most surface water bodies exhibit 222rn activities generally much lower often orders of magnitude than those measured in gw cecil and green 2000 only in and downstream of strongly gaining river reaches do 222rn activities in streams reach significant levels cartwright and gilfedder 2015 1 2 222rn dating method gw dating with 222rn is based on gradual increase of 222rn activities in recently infiltrated water as a function of residence time i e time since infiltration assuming spatially constant production of 222rn in gw the apparent age of a water sample a a p p t can be computed with the following equation cranswick et al 2014 hoehn and von gunten 1989 1 a a p p 1 λ r n l n a r n e q a r n m e a s a r n e q a r n 0 where a r n m e a s t 1l 3 is the activity of 222rn in a given gw sample a r n e q t 1l 3 is the activity of 222rn at equilibrium with the aquifer matrix 222rn end member activity a r n 0 t 1l 3 is the 222rn activity of surface water at the time of infiltration and λ r n t 1 is the 222rn decay constant 0 18 d 1 the equilibrium 222rn concentration of gw a r n e q is the ratio of the aquifer 222rn production rate γ r n t 2l 3 and the 222rn decay constant 2 a r n e q γ r n λ r n in practice gw may be considered at equilibrium after approximately four to five half lives of 222rn 15 20 days eq 1 has regularly been used to date young i e 15 20 days gw in bank filtration contexts e g cranswick et al 2014 frei and gilfedder 2021 pittroff et al 2017 schilling et al 2017 as is the case for most tracer based apparent age models eq 1 is only valid in the restrictive case of 1 d piston flow meaning if there is no mixing of water of different ages in a gw sample e g due to intra aquifer mixing or sampling of multiple flowlines moreover eq 1 also relies on the definition of a single 222rn end member activity a r n e q representative of gw at equilibrium with the host aquifer matrix which inherently supposes homogenous 222rn production γ r n at the scale of investigation therefore in cases where 222rn production is not homogenous definition of a single or a range of 222rn end member s for the computation of apparent gw ages is not trivial and is limited by the fragmentary knowledge of the distribution of 222rn activities and production rates at a given study site e g peel et al 2022 1 2 1 apparent age bias and gw mixing when tracer concentrations vary non linearly with respect to time any process that leads to mixing and spreading of a solute will systematically result in biases of apparent ages relative to mean ages mccallum et al 2013 varni and carrera 1998 waugh et al 2003 on top of spatially heterogenous production in the case of 222rn sources of apparent age bias include intra aquifer mixing due to dispersion and diffusion as well as mixing of waters following different flow paths in piezometers or wells with long screens bethke and johnson 2008 manning et al 2005 even in the simple case of 1d homogenous steady state flow along a hypothetical flowline hydrodynamic dispersion will lead to mixing of water of different ages and any gw sample will exhibit at least an inverse gaussian distribution of ages with variance proportional to the dispersion coefficient ginn et al 2009 assuming homogenous 222rn production the relationship between mean and apparent 222rn ages in such 1 d systems is given by the following functional relationship derived from massoudieh and ginn 2011 eq 7 3 a a p p x a m e a n x v 0 2 λ r n α l 1 4 α l λ r n v 0 1 where a a p p x t and a m e a n x t are apparent and mean ages at sampling location x l v 0 lt 1 the steady state gw flow velocity or darcy velocity and α l l the longitudinal dispersivity under such conditions the apparent age bias is a function of the ratio v 0 λ r n α l akin to the péclet number and is independent of the magnitude of the 222rn production rate γ r n this relationship highlights how apparent 222rn ages are always smaller than mean ages in the case of homogenous 222rn production only in the extreme case of purely advective transport high péclet number or minute tracer decay both ages are equal in more general terms when the rate of tracer accumulation decreases with increasing residence time such as in the case of 222rn mixing of waters of different ages will lead to an apparent age younger than the mean age mccallum et al 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic 2 d numerical model a generic 2 d mass transport model was constructed to analyse the effects of aquifer hydraulic and mass transport parameters transient hydraulic conditions and spatially variable 222rn production rates on the distribution of 222rn activities and apparent 222rn ages in the subsurface the synthetic model simulates infiltration of river water into an aquifer and gw flow and transport in variably saturated conditions the numerical code hydrogeosphere aquanty 2023 was used as it is capable of simulating variably saturated flow and solute transport with both source and decay terms corresponding respectively to 222rn ingrowth and disintegration the scope of the 2 d model is to explicitly simulate 222rn signatures in groundwater along multiple flowlines downgradient from the site of infiltration i e a stream or river in both steady state and transient hydraulic conditions model dimensions are 400 m x 50 m in the horizontal x and vertical z directions respectively a channel representing a simplified river bed and bank was included at the top left of the model domain channel depth 4 m width 10 m bank slope 30 the model was discretized into approximately 40 000 triangular elements with element edges ranging from about 15 cm near the top of the model and stream aquifer interface to 2 5 m at depth near the model outlet x 400 m the river was simulated by a constant head boundary condition bc along all channel nodes to ensure continuously losing river conditions i e infiltration of river water into the aquifer the outlet x 400 m was assigned a constant head at least 2 m lower than that at the inlet to simulate the effect of transient hydraulic conditions on 222rn signatures for example as a consequence of increased gw pumping a variable head bc was applied to the model outlet which simulated two incremental 1 m decreases in hydraulic head followed by a gradual return to initial conditions see fig 1 this variable head boundary leads to transient 50 and 100 increase in overall hydraulic gradients and is chosen to highlight the effect of significant variations in gw flow velocity on the distribution of 222rn throughout the model domain no flow bcs were applied to the left x 0 m and bottom z 40 m boundaries the no flow condition at the x 0 boundary represents a hypothetical water divide whereas the lower boundary represents the lower limit of the alluvial aquifer a diffuse and spatially constant recharge of 300 mm y was applied to the top boundary the effect of gw flow velocity and aquifer dispersivity on 222rn signatures in gw was explored by simulating various combinations of homogenous and isotropic hydraulic conductivity k l t 1 and longitudinal and transverse vertical dispersivity α l α t v l three spatially homogenous values of k 100 250 and 500 m d and two of longitudinal dispersivity α l 5 and 20 m were selected transverse vertical dispersivity was set to 10 of longitudinal dispersivity the values of k are representative of sand and gravel aquifers bear 1972 while those of dispersivity are consistent with measurement scales between 1 and 1000 m gelhar et al 1992 schulze makuch 2005 no clogging layer was considered at the stream aquifer interface and the hydraulic conductivity was the same as within the aquifer the van genuchten mualem model was used to simulate variably saturated flow with parameters α and β set to 4 1 m 1 and 2 2 respectively a constant porosity 0 2 was assumed for all simulations which is representative of unconsolidated sandy gravel aquifers e g fetter 2001 the solute transport model simulated both 222rn concentrations and mean gw age mean age was simulated by applying a zero age bc at the inlet and top boundaries and all elements were assigned an age source term simulating a theoretical tracer with a growth rate of unity in the subsurface i e 1 day per day goode 1996 mean gw age is therefore directly simulated through the advection dispersion transport equation and treated as a conservative solute with zero age at model inlets and a subsurface ageing term γ a g e of 1 day per day goode 1996 a zero concentration bc was applied to the inlet and top boundaries for 222rn this boundary condition reflects the fact that 222rn activities in surface waters tend to be negligible compared to those in groundwater as there are no atmospheric sources of 222rn and any dissolved 222rn is quickly lost to the atmosphere through gas transfer cecil and green 2000 222rn production by the aquifer matrix was simulated by applying a spatially variable zero order source bc to all model elements note that 222rn production and emanation rates are related by the following expression e g cook et al 2006 eq 14 4 γ r n e m ρ g r a i n λ r n 1 φ φ where e m bq kg 1 is the 222rn emanation rate ρ g r a i n kg l 1 is the density of the mineral phase and φ is the sediment porosity a homogenous grain density of 2 65 kg l 1 was assumed 222rn production rates in the unsaturated zone were scaled to account for variable water content and air water partitioning of 222rn as described in delottier et al 2022 222rn production rates in the unsaturated zone are effectively decreased by simulating instant equilibrium of produced 222rn between air and water phases according to 222rn solubility and water saturation delottier et al 2022 eq 7 5 γ r n e f f s w s w h c c γ r n s a t h c c s w 1 s w where γ r n e f f s w t 2l 3 is the effective or scaled 222rn production rate in water as a function of

set to 10 9 m2 s goode 1996 ishimori et al 2013 for each transient simulation initial 222rn concentrations were determined from steady state conditions with outlet hydraulic head h 0 5 m finally the transient model was run for a total simulation time of 60 days fig 1b 222rn production rates are based on a high resolution dataset of 222rn emanation rates in a bank filtration setting peel et al 2022 these production rates provide a realistic basis upon which a variety of spatial distributions of 222rn production could be constructed a simplified geostatistical framework was employed to create spatially variable distributions of 222rn production rates in the 2 d model three synthetic variogram models representing small intermediate and large scale variability of 222rn production were employed to capture a substantial range of spatial distributions of 222rn production rates for all scenarios an exponential variogram model was used with ranges from 20 10 m up to 200 30 m in the x and z directions respectively see table 1 synthetic conditioning data based on the statistical properties of measured 222rn emanation rates were placed at regular intervals within the model grid with spacing equal to half the variogram ranges in both the x and z directions for the three variogram models fifty sets of synthetic conditioning data were created for each of these datasets ten equiprobable realizations of the spatial distribution of emanation rates total 500 realizations per variogram model were generated with a sequential gaussian simulation sgs algorithm with the geone python software package straubhaar 2020 a full description of the geostatistical workflow can be found in appendix a this methodology led to a coefficient of variation cv of modelled 222rn production rates of over 50 for each realization with a mean 222rn production rate 1 σ of 3 0 1 6 bq l 1 s 1 see table 1 2 2 quantification of apparent age bias the bias or relative deviation between apparent 222rn and mean ages at a given location can be defined as 6 bias x t a app x t a mean x t a mean x t where a m e a n x t t and a a p p x t t are the mean directly simulated and apparent computed from simulated 222rn activities ages of groundwater at sampling location x and simulation time t in the considered 2 d system bias can arise from i mixing of water of different ages hydrodynamic dispersion and ii variable 222rn production rates γ r n i e a non unique 222rn end member activity a r n e q mixing due to sampling of multiple flowlines is not considered in the present study although this may be an issue in many real world contexts due to long screens in piezometers to disentangle the contributions of mixing and variable 222rn production to the age bias eq 6 transient simulations were run for the six combinations of hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity see table 1 with a constant value of γ r n assigned to all model elements in these scenarios any age bias results from mixing of gw with different ages synthetic linear observation wells were placed throughout the model domain at regular intervals of 2 5 6 25 and 12 5 m in the horizontal direction for cases where k was equal to respectively 100 250 and 500 m d well placement shown in appendix b each well is placed from the surface to a depth of 20 m output including mean gw age and 222rn activities was produced for all nodes located within 10 cm of these synthetic observation wells this allowed the calculation of apparent age bias at various locations within the model domain at every timestep for cases where 222rn production is spatially constant a generic value of γ r n equal to porosity i e 0 2 was selected for these simulations note that apparent age bias does not depend on the choice of γ r n in the case of constant 222rn input as all simulated 222rn activities are normalized by the end member activity a r n e q for calculation of apparent age for the calculation of apparent ages a r n e q was constant and defined as the ratio of γ r n and λ r n eq 2 subsequently simulations were run by assuming spatially variable 222rn production the 222rn apparent age bias that is the amount of bias attributed solely to the spatial variability of 222rn input was defined from eq 6 as 7 b i a s r n x t b i a s γ r n v a r x t b i a s γ r n c s t x t a a p p γ r n v a r x t a a p p γ r n c s t x t a m e a n x t where b i a s γ r n v a r x t and b i a s γ r n c s t x t are the apparent age biases in the case of spatially variable and constant 222rn production γ r n respectively and a a p p γ r n v a r x t t and a a p p γ r n c s t x t t are similarly the apparent 222rn ages in the two cases the definition of a single 222rn end member equilibrium activity for the computation of apparent age is not straightforward in cases where the 222rn input is spatially variable indeed local changes in production rates will lead to commensurate changes in 222rn activities especially for old groundwater components with mean ages 25 days in real world settings groundwater may be sampled at one or several locations where it is expected to be at secular equilibrium with the aquifer matrix if 222rn production is spatially variable measured end member activities may strongly depend on sampling location to account for this non uniqueness in the definition of 222rn end member equilibrium activities and to encompass all possible apparent ages based on simulation results three 222rn end member activities were defined representing respectively the 1 minimum 2 mean and 3 maximum simulated 222rn concentrations at nodes where the mean age in steady state flow and transport conditions is 25 days these end member activities therefore represent integrated 222rn input signals from model inlets to sampling points for each simulation end member activities were computed from simulated 222rn activities at over 150 nodes where mean gw age was above 25 days to simultaneously account for the influence of mass transport processes advection dispersion the rate of 222rn accumulation and the scale of variability of 222rn production in relation to the sampling scale we introduce a dimensionless damköhler like number n r n 0 8 n r n 0 λ r n l 2 α l v s l where l l is the sampling scale e g the distance from the inlet to the sampling point s l is the scale of variability of 222rn production rates e g geostatistical correlation length and v l t 1 the representative gw flow velocity darcy velocity the first set of terms λ r n l 2 α l v is the damköhler number for a reaction with first order coefficient λ r n e g oldham et al 2013 and represents the relative dispersive mass transport and radiochemical i e 222rn accumulation timescales the ratio s l is a measure of the relative timescale a given water sample will have spent in zones of distinct 222rn production potentially high or low here the radiochemical timescale is given by λ r n instead of the 222rn production rates γ r n as the rate of 222rn accumulation is one of first order increase modulated by the 222rn decay constant if we assume the ratio l v approximates the mean age of a water sample we can simplify eq 8 9 n r n 0 n r n a m e a n λ r n s α l the amount of 222rn bias eq 7 as a function of n r n may offer some insight on the combined effects of mass transport spatial correlation of 222rn production rates and the residence time of gw on the performance of the apparent 222rn age model indeed low values of n r n are associated smaller scale spatial variations in 222rn production rates as given by s lower gw residence times a m e a n and therefore on average lower 222rn activities and higher smoothing of 222rn activities due to hydrodynamic dispersion α l resultant spatial distributions of 222rn activities tend to be smoother and computed apparent ages less influenced by the asymptotic behaviour of the 222rn age model when activities approach those of the end member taken together these effects likely dampen the effect of variable 222rn production on 222rn bias the converse is true for large values of n r n 3 results 3 1 modelled 222rn end member equilibrium activities as described in section 2 2 three different 222rn end member equilibrium activities were defined for each simulation representing respectively the 1 minimum 2 mean and 3 maximum simulated steady state 222rn concentrations at nodes where the mean age is 25 days each of these end member activities vary from one simulation to the next depending on the given spatial distribution of 222rn production rates the range of end member 222rn activities for each of the eighteen illustrative cases described in section 2 1 is shown in fig 2 for the six combinations of k and αl modelled 222rn end member activities vary on average around a value representative of the mean production rate 16 5 bq l 1 see table 1 this results from the lack of a systematic trend in the spatial distribution of 222rn production rates i e spatially constant mean production rate within the model domain however the spread of 222rn equilibrium activities both within a given 222rn end member class min mean or max and between these end member activities depends most strongly on hydraulic conductivity k albeit with significant influence of dispersivity αl and the spatial distribution of production rates as given by the variogram models indeed the range of end member activities and differences between end member classes are largest at low values of k and αl and large variogram ranges coefficients of variation of the mean 222rn end member activities range from 0 04 for the case α l 20 m k 500 m d and smallest spatial correlation vario 1 to 0 09 for the case α l 5 m k 100 m d and largest variogram range vario 3 the ratio of mean minimum to maximum end member activities ranges from 1 1 to 2 3 for the same cases these observations can be linked to the smoothing effect of both gw flow velocity and dispersion on observed 222rn activities this is readily seen in fig 3 which shows the distribution of 222rn activities within the model domain for a single realization of variable 222rn production rates at low velocities and dispersivities 222rn activities are very sensitive to small scale changes in production rates indeed 222rn concentrations will be highly influenced by the local magnitude of 222rn input as velocities and dispersivities increase 222rn activities are averaged out as they integrate 222rn input signals from an increasing portion of the aquifer and tend to be representative of the mean 222rn production rate this averaging effect is modulated by the range of spatial correlation of 222rn production rates indeed large zones of below or above average 222rn input will appear in the model domain when variogram ranges are largest the core of these zones will retain distinct 222rn signatures even when flow velocities or dispersivity are large as gw residence times within these zones allows 222rn activities to equilibrate with the local aquifer 222rn production rates 3 2 apparent age bias in steady state conditions 3 2 1 sensitivity to aquifer parameters k αl tv and scale of variability of 222rn production the range of simulated 222rn apparent age biases in steady state conditions i e incurred only by the spatial variability of 222rn production eq 7 as a function of mean age at all synthetic observation points is shown in fig 4 for each of combination of hydraulic conductivity dispersivity and choice of 222rn end member activity sections 2 1 and 2 2 apparent ages were truncated at 16 5 days i e at 95 end member activities this apparent age is practically an upper limit for the 222rn dating technique see section 1 1 in these instances additional age bias was therefore not computed for readability only results for one variogram model are shown in fig 4a variogram 3 with the largest correlation length for 222rn production results from other variogram models exhibit the same overall trends and are shown in appendix c note that the age bias incurred by mixing of water of different ages through hydrodynamic dispersion has been subtracted from the total apparent age bias see eq 7 in cases simulated here the effect of mixing is well approximated by eq 3 and ranges from 0 05 for the case k 500 m d and α l 5 m to approximately 0 5 for the case k 100 m d and α l 20 m see appendix c as shown in fig 4a the average 222rn apparent age bias is neutral negative and positive when computing apparent ages respectively with the mean maximum and minimum 222rn end members this is a result of the sensitivity of the apparent age equation eq 1 to end member definition indeed using an end member with large 222rn activities will lead on average to an underestimation of gw age and vice versa in all cases presented here age bias will tend to be slightly shifted towards positive values as a result of the higher production rates modelled near infiltration zones see appendix a leading on average to higher 222rn activities and thus apparent ages this is most clearly visible at lower values of k and α l fig 4a as lower gw velocities will lead to increased residence time in zones of high 222rn production and the smoothing effect of dispersivity remains modest the magnitude and range of additional age bias is very sensitive to both gw flow velocity controlled by hydraulic conductivity k dispersivity α l and the scale of variability of 222rn production as given by the variogram models indeed the range of 222rn apparent age bias increases when both velocities and dispersivities are low and the scale of variability of 222rn input is large for example in the case where k 100 m d α l 5 m and the scale of variability is largest variogram 3 the 25 75 interval for additional bias ranges between 0 3 and 1 at mean age 5 days and between 0 4 and 1 at mean age 10 days conversely when k 500 m d α l 20 m and the scale of variability is lowest variogram 1 see fig 4b additional bias is much more modest with a 25 75 interval between 0 and 0 17 at mean age 5 days and between 0 and 0 25 at mean age 10 days this observation is linked to the smoothing effects of both gw flow velocity and dispersivity as described in section 3 1 indeed even though 222rn activities oscillate around a value representative of the mean production rate large variations in observed 222rn concentrations at greater distances or mean gw ages will lead to a large range of possible end member activities and thus to highly non unique apparent age estimates see fig 2 at low mean ages 5 10 days the possible range of positive apparent age bias i e overestimation of gw mean age tends to increase with mean age as the apparent age equation becomes more sensitive to small changes in 222rn activities when the latter start approaching end member activities see eq 1 conversely the range of negative 222rn age bias remains mostly constant as a function of mean age cases where the 222rn age bias is lowest represents those where the 222rn production rates are lowest between the inlet and sampling points 222rn activities will not near those of the end member and computed apparent ages remain low and are not affected by the asymptotic behaviour of the apparent age equation eq 1 at high 222rn activities the decrease in both the values and the spread of 222rn age bias at higher mean ages 5 10 days results from two overlapping effects i the smoothing effect from integrating signals from an increasing portion of the aquifer and ii the truncation of apparent ages at 16 5 days the former is related to the increasing distance between the inlet and sampling points at higher mean ages and 222rn signals being increasingly representative of the mean production rate i e lower sensitivity to small scale variations in 222rn production rates the latter effect is significant for scenarios where the mean and minimum 222rn end members are used in apparent age computations respectively grey and blue in fig 4 in such cases 222rn activities will more rapidly approach end member activities in instances where the mean production rate between the inlet and the sampling point is comparatively high when 222rn activities exceed 95 of those of the end member i e apparent age 16 5 days apparent ages and thus 222rn age bias are not computed therefore at higher mean ages computable apparent ages will disproportionately reflect cases where the mean production rates between the inlet and the sampling point are generally lower this leads to lower apparent ages and therefore to a more negative 222rn age bias this effect is even more pronounced when using the minimum end member as on average 222rn activities will more tend to approach even more rapidly those of the end member therefore lower 222rn age bias at higher values of mean age is not always synonymous with apparent age estimates being better constrained at higher mean ages but rather that apparent ages can be computed at greater distances from the inlet only for a subset of simulations finally the decrease in apparent age bias at higher mean ages in cases where the maximum end member is used is related to the existence of an apparent age threshold in many cases apparent ages will remain low at even high mean ages as 222rn activities may remain significantly lower than those of the maximum end member the combined influences of mean gw age spatial correlation of 222rn production rates as well as hydro dispersive mixing on 222rn age bias can be seen in fig 5 which shows the 222rn age bias as a function of n r n see eq 9 the spread of 222rn age bias is lowest at low values of n r n and tends to increase as n r n increases for example at values of n r n 0 1 the 25 75 interval of 222rn age bias ranges from 0 to 0 2 whereas it ranges from 0 25 to 0 5 at n r n 10 at the highest values of n r n and thus of mean gw age the 222rn bias tends to decrease for the same reasons noted in the previous paragraphs when n r n 1 generally higher spatial correlation of 222rn production lower dispersivity higher mean gw ages measured 222rn activities are likely to be strongly affected by zones of high or low 222rn production which lead to high variability in 222rn activities which will often approach those of the end member s and a large range of 222rn end members leading in turn to high potential bias in computed apparent 222rn apparent ages conversely when n r n 1 222rn activities are more representative of the mean 222rn production rate small differences between end members will exist and only moderate 222rn bias will arise when computing apparent 222rn ages 3 3 apparent age bias in transient conditions fig 6 shows the range of transient simulated mean and apparent ages for the six combinations of hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal dispersivity at nodes where mean age in steady state conditions is equal to 8 0 0 1 d results follow similar trends for different mean ages and variogram models see appendix b all data points not located on the mean age 8 d line result from transient hydraulic conditions increased sw infiltration and gw flow velocity caused by the variable head boundary at the outlet see fig 1 will lead to lower mean ages at any given observation point as already highlighted in section 1 1 2 apparent ages in steady state conditions tend to be lower than mean ages owing to hydrodynamic dispersion and are clustered on average near although slightly below the 1 d bias line see fig 6 which represents the steady state relationship between mean and apparent ages in 1 d systems with constant 222rn input eq 3 this is because 222rn activities integrate information on the distribution of 222rn production between the inlet and a given sampling point and tend to be on average representative of the mean production rate additional negative age bias is due to the additional effect of transverse dispersion which is not considered in 1 d systems as explained in the previous section apparent ages are consistently under and overestimated in relation to the bias line when using the maximum and minimum 222rn endmembers respectively moreover owing to the same smoothing mechanisms described in the previous sections the range of computed apparent ages in steady state conditions is greatest at low velocities and dispersivities and when the scale of variability in 222rn input is highest this is evident in fig 6 by the spread of apparent ages at mean age 8 days for the different combinations of k and α l in transient conditions the twofold increase in gw flow velocity due to the transient head boundary at the outlet leads to a decrease of mean age up to 50 from 8 to 4 days a decrease of apparent 222rn ages as well as to an overall decrease in the spread of apparent ages in other words the potential for additional apparent age bias tends to decrease when gw flow velocities increase once again due to the smoothing effects described previously in the conditions simulated here changes in mean and apparent ages tend to follow a mostly linear pattern with varying slopes depending on the choice of the 222rn endmember in other words in transient conditions variations in apparent ages tend to be associated with proportional variations in mean ages regardless of the choice of the 222rn endmember to better visualize this relationship we define a a p p r n r e l x t and a m e a n r e l x t as respectively the relative apparent 222rn and relative mean gw ages 10 a a p p r n r e l x t a a p p r n x t a a p p r n x 0 11 a m e a n r e l x t a m e a n x t a m e a n x 0 where a a p p r n x t t and a m e a n x t t are the relative apparent 222rn and mean gw ages at location x and time t and a a p p r n x 0 t and a m e a n x 0 t are similarly apparent 222rn and mean gw ages at the start of the simulations t 0 a a p p r n r e l x t and a m e a n r e l x t as a function of simulation time are shown in fig 7 in cases where advection dominates over dispersive processes i e high velocities and low dispersivities relative mean and apparent ages behave in a very consistent manner deviations between the two are mainly controlled by non uniqueness in the definition of a 222rn end member conversely when dispersivity is large in relation to the flow velocity changes in relative mean age are delayed in comparison to relative apparent ages this most evident at the latter portion of the simulations where relative mean ages return more slowly to steady state conditions this is a consequence of the relatively low half life of 222rn 3 8 d which results in gw 222rn activities being quickly in local equilibrium with the aquifer matrix even in transient hydraulic conditions and the persistence of a proportion of younger gw during the return to steady state conditions will only marginally affect 222rn activities and apparent 222rn ages despite some degree of bias arising from dispersion as well as from the non uniqueness of the 222rn end member relative apparent ages track relative mean ages within 5 15 in most simulations in contrast apparent ages are much more poorly constrained most notably at low gw flow velocities in cases where mass transport is dominated by advective rather that dispersive processes relative changes in mean apparent 222rn show excellent correlation with changes in mean gw age 4 discussion 4 1 bias of apparent 222rn ages results from the synthetic models illustrate that even in idealized homogenous 2 d flow systems the 222rn apparent age model may not provide reliable estimates of mean gw age in steady state conditions on top of the negative age bias incurred by mixing of gw with different ages through hydrodispersive mixing and multiple flowline sampling spatial heterogeneity of 222rn production rates could lead to large additional biases put together these effects lead to apparent 222rn ages regularly differing from mean gw ages by a factor of two or more in the conditions simulated here the magnitude of 222rn apparent age bias that is the age bias incurred solely by variable 222rn production rates can be captured by the dimensionless number n r n with low values 1 in cases simulated here correlated to low additional 222rn age bias and vice versa we show that the magnitude of age bias incurred by heterogenous 222rn production is highest i at low flow velocities ii in cases where hydrodispersive mixing is limited iii at high mean gw ages and iv if the scale of spatial correlation of 222rn production rates is high compared to the sampling scale under such circumstances 222rn signals are very sensitive to local variations in 222rn production rates leading to high spatial variability in the distribution of 222rn activities and ambiguity in the definition of a representative 222rn end member activity conversely when flow velocities and dispersion increase 222rn activities are smoothed and tend to reflect mean 222rn production rates reliable estimates of gw age with apparent 222rn age model are therefore limited to cases where advective processes dominate i e high péclet number little mixing of gw of different ages and where there is little additional bias from spatially variable 222rn production rates i e low n r n for both conditions to simultaneously hold hydrodispersive processes must remain marginal in relation to advective transport which requires the spatial scale of variability of 222rn production rates to be significantly smaller than the sampling scale and or mean gw age to remain relatively low see eq 9 results from transient simulations illustrate how time series of 222rn activities can provide reliable information on changes in mean gw age even in cases where dispersive processes are significant and the 222rn end members and apparent 222rn ages are poorly constrained in the contexts modelled here relative apparent and mean ages show very similar trends although some deviations are noticeable in highly transient conditions indeed 222rn signatures are more sensitive than mean gw age to abrupt changes in hydraulic conditions especially in contexts where dispersive processes are significant this results from the differing sensitivities of apparent and mean ages to the presence of gw components with residence times above 15 20 days whereas mean gw ages are determined by the entire age distribution of gw ages at any point in space and time apparent 222rn ages are insensitive to the distribution of ages above the 15 20 day threshold as these components are effectively at local radioactive equilibrium with the aquifer matrix therefore any transient perturbation in the gw age distribution at ages above this threshold will not affect the computation of apparent 222rn ages but will nevertheless have a lasting effect on mean gw ages until the distribution of ages reaches pseudo steady state conditions transient deviations between both ages are more evident when dispersion becomes a dominant mass transport process as gw age distributions tend to be broad and only slowly stabilize to equilibrium conditions conversely when hydraulic conditions vary more smoothly both apparent and mean gw ages remain in excellent agreement the coherence of the relative apparent and mean ages can be attributed to the fact that throughout the simulation period 222rn activities at all observation points integrate production rate signals from the same portions of the aquifer upgradient of the sampling points in other terms transient 222rn signals in gw near infiltration zones remain representative of an average 222rn production rate between infiltration and sampling points therefore in the 2 d settings presented here temporal variations in 222rn activities are almost exclusively attributed to changes in time since infiltration i e gw age and not to changes in gw flow paths through zones of differing 222rn input it must however be noted that a 2 d model will lead to obvious simplifications over complex 3 d flow and mass transport processes encountered in real world environments changes in hydraulic conditions due to precipitation variable river discharge changes in river bed permeability gw pumping etc may lead to changes in gw flow and mass transport patterns not captured by the models presented in this study moreover system transience is simulated exclusively through changes in hydraulic head at the model outlet downgradient of observations points in natural systems changes in river stage from storm events seasonal patterns etc will also control hydraulic gradients between infiltration zones and observation points abrupt variations in river stage may lead to complex flow conditions not modelled here such as temporary flow reversal e g bank storage return flow nevertheless under less highly transient conditions flow patterns will generally reflect overall hydraulic gradients whether they result from downgradient changes in gw head e g through changes in gw pumping or from variations in river stage we therefore expect similar 222rn and mean gw age signatures to emerge in both cases any significant changes if flowline geometry upstream of a sampling point will add an additional layer of complexity in interpreting 222rn signals as sampled gw will be influenced by portions of the aquifer where 222rn production rates may differ in field settings the validity of assuming consistent flowline geometry under transient conditions must be justified by site specific properties this assumption is most likely to hold in circumstances where gw flow and mass transport are controlled by the existence of preferential flow pathways i e highly conductive zones such preferential flow structures are abundant in many alluvial aquifers and are known to strongly affect gw flow solute transport and sw gw exchange fluxes e g boano et al 2014 huggenberger et al 1998 in conditions where gw flow is consistently channelized through large scale hydraulically connected flow structures we expect the correlation between mean and apparent ages to be less controlled by the heterogeneity of hydraulic parameters than by the distribution of 222rn production rates upgradient of sampling points the degree of system transience and the relative influence of advective and dispersive mass transport processes 4 2 implications for use of 222rn as a tracer of gw age the assumptions underpinning the apparent 222rn age model are quite restrictive and can often not be justified by field conditions we ve illustrated how apparent 222rn ages provide reliable estimates of mean gw age in losing river contexts only if each the following conditions are met 1 the scale of variation or spatial correlation of 222rn production rates is small in comparison to the sampling scale and or mean gw age is much lower than the upper limit 15 days of the apparent 222rn age model i e low n r n 2 there is no systematic trend in the spatial distribution of 222rn production rates 3 mass transport is advection dominated i e high péclet number 4 the 222rn endmember can be reasonably well constrained 5 the assumption of sampling a single flowline is reasonable e g short screened intervals 6 there is no mixing of different gw components e g recently infiltrated sw and regional gw or this mixing can explicitly be accounted for e g via tracer based approaches conditions 3 to 6 also need to hold in conditions where the 222rn production rate is constant as any mixing of water of different ages will lead to a negative in the case of 222rn bias of apparent ages in relation to mean gw ages ideally data for verification of conditions 1 and 2 can be obtained through high resolution measurements of 222rn production rates from recovered aquifer material e g through 222rn incubation experiments on sediment cores as this is often practically infeasible high resolution measurements of 222rn activities in gw near radioactive equilibrium with the aquifer matrix can provide an estimate of the degree of heterogeneity of 222rn production this requires a dense piezometer network at locations not influenced by recently infiltrated sw with ages 15 20 days however these measurements will not provide any direct information on the 222rn production rates at locations of active sw infiltration i e where apparent 222rn age estimates are relevant in cases where field conditions and data are inconsistent with the above requirements calculation of absolute 222rn ages should be done with caution or avoided altogether indeed we have shown that even in simple systems such as those simulated in the present study modest variability in the spatial distribution of 222rn production rates can lead to large discrepancies between mean and apparent 222rn ages in conditions modelled here mean and apparent 222rn ages may regularly differ by a factor of two or more even for very young gw mean age 5 days such levels of uncertainty need to be factored into any estimates of gw age made with 222rn additionally the upper age limit of the 222rn dating method is modulated by the magnitude of spatial variability in 222rn production rates considering the variability in 222rn production modelled in this study apparent age estimates for gw with mean ages greater than 10 days may become problematic as 222rn activities may be influenced by zones of high 222rn production not captured by the chosen 222rn end member activity indeed as the sensitivity of 222rn age equation increases as 222rn activities approach those of the end member activity large positive biases in gw age estimates may result this upper age limit of 10 days is lower than the 15 days put forward in other studies e g cranswick et al 2014 hoehn and von gunten 1989 which only applies to conditions where 222rn input is spatially constant these conclusions build on those of recent studies of apparent 222rn ages in alluvial contexts e g gilfedder et al 2019 schaper et al 2022 which have highlighted the limitations of the apparent 222rn age model in both homogenous and heterogenous environments in transient hydraulic conditions however valuable information gw age can be gained from time series of 222rn activities indeed in losing river contexts variations in 222rn activities and computed apparent 222rn ages may be intimately linked to changes in mean gw age indeed if the following criteria are met our simulations have shown that relative changes in apparent 222rn ages can be reliably used as a proxy for variations in mean gw ages 1 the system is not in a state of acute disequilibrium i e system transience in not extreme at the time of sampling 2 flowline geometry of sampled water remains stable through transient conditions i e sampled water integrates 222rn production information from the same zones of the aquifer 3 the gw age distribution of sampled water is dominated by water with ages significantly lower than the upper age limit for the 222rn dating technique 10 days in our simulations 4 the 222rn end member is significantly higher at least 15 than measured 222rn activities 5 there is no mixing of different gw components e g recently infiltrated sw and regional gw or this mixing can explicitly be quantified e g via tracer based approaches interestingly these observations equally hold in cases the spatial distribution of 222rn production is highly heterogenous moreover the computation of relative apparent ages is only moderately sensitive to the definition of the 222rn end member insomuch as its magnitude is significantly larger than measured activities and consistent with production rates at a given field site although absolute mean ages may not be adequately estimated from apparent 222rn ages temporal variations in 222rn activities can be used as a tool to investigate changes in mean gw age at a given sampling location assuming as the conditions listed above hold these assumptions must be justified in individual field settings if estimates of mean gw age can be made at different points in time through an alternate method e g artificial tracer test apparent 222rn and mean ages can be tied allowing the computation of a time series of absolute mean ages from changes in apparent 222rn ages this would apply to both continuous and occasional measurements of 222rn activities we suggest whenever possible comparing several separate measurements of mean and apparent gw ages this allows independent verification of the equivalence between variations in mean and apparent 222rn ages in transient conditions 4 3 limitations our analysis has been limited to simplified 2 d systems which are unable to reproduce complex 3 d flow and mass transport phenomena moreover gw mixing caused by lateral inflows or water exchange with aquitards and or low permeability lenses was not considered which may lead to strong underestimations of mean gw age furthermore we only consider a simplified system with spatially homogenous hydraulic properties conductivity porosity dispersivity it is well established that bias between tracer derived and mean gw ages increases with increasing heterogeneity of hydraulic parameters e g gardner et al 2015 mccallum et al 2013 as noted in the preceding section the effect of hydraulic parameter heterogeneity on the performance of the 222rn age model may not be exceedingly detrimental in conditions were channelized flow and transport are dominant processes however the impact of hydraulic parameter heterogeneity has not been quantified in the present work and should be systematically addressed in future studies furthermore we suspect that the conclusions concerning transient 222rn signals do not hold for sampling locations where convergent flow occurs e g at pumping wells indeed disentangling contributions from all gw components with ages 10 days to the overall 222rn signal is practically impossible without resorting to additional tracer methods and or numerical modelling tools additionally the results presented in this study are valid only for the magnitude of variability of 222rn production rates modelled in the present study i e cv of 50 see table 1 section 2 1 we expect the amount of 222rn age bias to increase with increasing variability in 222rn production rates although this should be investigated in future studies our simulations do not include systematic trends in the spatial distribution of 222rn production rates which could lead to additional bias in apparent 222rn ages this approach was chosen as no observable spatial trend could be discerned from the experimental data used in the simulations it is unclear whether this is a peculiarity of the selected field site or a feature common to many alluvial aquifers the latter may be true at other similar sites as alluvial deposits within a small region of an aquifer often share many features such as common depositional histories as well as rheological and geochemical properties 5 conclusions the objective of the present study was to explore the reliability of 222rn as a tracer of gw age in bank filtration contexts where 222rn production rates are spatially variable by including laboratory measurements of 222rn emanation rates in a physically based model we illustrated how spatially variable 222rn input as well as hydrodispersive mixing may lead to biased estimates of 222rn derived gw age we show that the combined effects of gw mixing and spatially variable 222rn production rates may lead to high biases between apparent 222rn ages and mean gw age limiting the reliability of the 222rn dating technique to contexts where mass transport is advection dominated sampling scale is much larger than the scale of variability of 222rn production rates and gw is sampled from shortly screened intervals the deleterious effects of mixing and variable 222rn input on the apparent 222rn age model are somewhat dampened when interpreting time series of 222rn activities at a given observation point inasmuch as gw flow paths remain essentially stable in transient conditions 222rn activities can provide reliable information on relative changes in mean gw age even in environments where the spatial distribution of 222rn production is highly heterogenous the scope of application for the relative apparent 222rn age model remains quite restrictive and information justifying its use in field settings may often be lacking the sampling and continuous monitoring of additional tracers e g electrical conductivity stable isotopes of water gw temperature may provide further information on gw residence times at temporal scales relevant to bank filtration contexts however these tracers do not systematically exhibit distinct concentrations in river water and sampled gw or show measurable temporal variations in sw that can be linked to variations in gw in such cases 222rn often remains one of few practical tracers that can provide information on gw residence times at timescales of days to weeks the simulation of 222rn and any other studied tracer in fully coupled physically based 3 d mass transport models offers a more robust conceptual framework through which the information content of tracer measurements can be better extracted e g turnadge and smerdon 2014 with such models the uncertainty in tracer relevant parameters such as the spatial distribution of tracer sources and sinks hydraulic mass transport parameters etc may be explicitly accounted for parameterization of these models can be improved through the inclusion of tracer measurements e g schaper et al 2022 thiros et al 2021 which in turn leads to increased predictive accuracy of estimates of management interest such as gw sw exchange fluxes mixing ratios and gw residence times however when access to additional such complex modelling and calibration tools is not possible monitoring changes in 222rn activities can be helpful to gain a better conceptual understanding of the sensitivity of the gw sw system and gw age to changes in hydraulic conditions although absolute age estimates should always be interpreted with caution declaration of competing

efficiency at 100 and the highest rate of 7 34 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 in the open reactor with glucose enhanced total nitrogen tn removal to 74 6 by the algal bacterial consortium was achieved via mixotrophic algal assimilation and bacterial denitrification under oxygen limited and glucose sufficient conditions nitrogen distribution indicated that ammonia oxidation 41 8 and algal assimilation 43 5 were the main pathways to remove ammonium by the algal bacterial consortium tn removal by the algal bacterial consortium was primarily achieved by algal assimilation 28 1 40 8 followed by bacterial denitrification 2 9 26 5 furthermore the algal bacterial consortium contributed to n2o mitigation compared with the activated sludge reducing n2o production by 35 5 55 0 via autotrophic pathways and by 81 0 93 6 via mixotrophic pathways nitrogen assimilation by algae was boosted with the addition of glucose and thus largely restrained n2o production from nitrification and denitrification the synergism between algae and bacteria was also conducive to an enhanced n2o reduction by denitrification and reduced direct indirect carbon emissions graphical abstract image

zhang et al 2016a which would increase the carbon footprint of wwtps by 10 fu et al 2022 therefore new configurations and processes are expected to fulfill energy carbon neutral wastewater treatment recently algal bacterial consortium has been proposed as an alternative approach for nitrogen removal while producing biomass as value added substances and saving both energy and chemical reagents

the nitrogen removal mechanisms of the algal bacterial consortium the effects of oxygen organic carbon sources and functional microorganisms on nitrogen removal by the algal bacterial consortium were assessed the nitrogen removal performance was evaluated in enclosed open and aerated reactors simulating photobioreactor open pond and aeration basin respectively the roles of algae nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the nitrogen conversion were elucidated n2o was quantified in the algal bacterial and algal bacterial systems to decipher the n2o production pathways 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultures chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris was purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science wuhan china the algae were cultured in 1 l conical flasks containing 700 ml bg11 medium and enriched in an incubator under the following conditions light intensity of 4500 500 lux light dark regime of 12 12 h and temperature of 25 c the inoculum during the logarithmic growth phase was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min prior to collecting the algal pellets for further experiments the activated sludge was obtained from the aeration tank of a municipal wwtp in wuhan china and cultivated in a sequencing batch reactor sbr feeding with synthetic wastewater at 150 mg nh4 n l 1 d 1 synthetic wastewater was prepared with the following composition nh4cl 191 mg l 1 k2hpo4 40 mg l

to 8 0 8 5 for each cycle it consisted of 1 h anaerobic phase 2 h aerobic phase and 1 h settling at a total time of 4 h the mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of the activated sludge was 5 0 5 g l 1 prior to experiments the activated sludge was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the bacterial pellets 2 2 experimental design the experiments were carried out in enclosed open and aerated reactors simulating photobioreactor open pond and aeration basin respectively which were widely used for algal cultivation zhou et al 2014 the enclosed reactor was constructed using rubber stopper sealed conical flask where the nitrogen gas was purged for 15 min to create anoxic environment it was known that the short term anoxic phase would not affect the ammonium oxidation process salem et al 2006 the availability of organic carbon was controlled to study the contribution of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms to nitrogen removal the aerated reactor was provided the external aeration flow rate of 100 ml min 1 during the light period n2o production was monitored in the enclosed open and aerated reactors with different oxygen availability the cultures i e algae bacteria algal bacterial consortium were incubated at 25 c in a shaking incubator with a shaking speed of 200 rpm the light dark regime was set as 12 h light phase with light intensity of 5000 500 lux and 12 h dark phase the initial biomass concentrations for algae bacteria and algal bacterial consortium inoculation ratio of 1 1 were 0 4 0 4 and 0 8 g l 1 respectively the experimental details are listed in table 1 autoclave control experiments were carried out at 121 c to study the adsorption of nitrogen to the biomass 2 3 analytical methods the mixed liquor samples were centrifuged and then filtered through a 0 22 µm millipore filter the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn were analyzed using a smartchem 140 discrete auto analyzer austriamicrosystems italy the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration and its volatile fraction were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2012 the cod concentration was measured using an drb200 digester and photometer dr3900 hach usa the content of inorganic carbon ic was determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer hty ct1000b tai lin technology instrument china do and ph were monitored using their respective meters in order to analyze the total chlorophyll concentration 6 ml of each sample was extracted using methanol xiong et al 2017 the sample was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the pellet afterwards the pellet was re suspended in 6 ml of 90 methanol the suspension in methanol was then incubated at 60 c for 10 min and centrifuged again at 8000 rpm for 10 min the absorbances of the supernatant at the wavelengths of 665 652 and 470 nm were determined using a visible spectrophotometer uv 5500 pc metash shanghai where a 90 methanol solution was used as a blank the concentrations of chlorophyll a chl a and chlorophyll b chl b were calculated based on eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1 c h l a mg l 1 16 82 a 665 9 28 a 652 2 c h l b mg l 1 36 92 a 652 16 54 a 665 all measurements were conducted in triplicates error bars in figures represent the range of one standard deviation in the result of an experimental measurement such as nitrogen concentration removal efficiency rate etc in this work 2 4 extrapolation of possible nitrogen removal pathways in this study systematic experiments were conducted to investigate the distribution of nh4 n and tn considering all possible removal pathways including stripping adsorption assimilation and nitrification denitrification the proportions of each component were obtained based on measurement calculation and deduction from the total ammonium nitrogen at 50 mg n l 1 specifically residual ammonium was confirmed by measurement ammonia stripping was calculated based on the empirical equation while the stripping of nitrite and nitrate was demonstrated to be negligible zhou et al 2019 the proportion of adsorption was obtained through the control experiment with autoclaved biomass since the population of heterotrophic bacteria in the activated sludge was predominant fig s10 bacterial assimilation in the bacterial reactor was calculated based on the difference between the ammonium removal in the presence of cod and in the absence of cod neglecting the contribution from autotrophic bacteria for algal assimilation in the algal reactor it was obtained by deducing residual ammonium stripping and adsorption from the entire ammonium mass for nitrification denitrification in the bacterial reactor it could be calculated by deducting the residual ammonium stripping and assimilation from the entire ammonium tn mass for algal bacterial reactor the specific proportion of assimilation and nitrification denitrification were estimated from the corresponding distributions in algal and bacterial reactors according to the following assumptions a the proportion of bacterial assimilation in the algal bacterial reactor was same as that in the bacterial reactor given the same bacterial concentration and experimental conditions b the proportion of algal assimilation in the algal bacterial reactor was same as that in the algal reactor given the same algal concentration and experimental conditions c the proportion of nitrification by bacteria in the enclosed algal bacterial reactor was identical regardless of the presence of cod as a result of the same biomass concentration and sufficient oxygen supply d the proportions of nitrification by bacteria in the open and aerated algal bacterial reactors were identical to the corresponding values in the open and aerated bacterial reactors respectively the similar calculation procedures of nitrogen distribution were also adopted previously nguyen et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 2 5 n2o measurement and calculation the dissolved n2o concentration in the liquid phase was analyzed based on the reported method duan et al 2020 liquid sample was collected with a syringe and subsequently transferred to a 12 ml vacuumed labco exetainer with 1 ml 1 g l 1 hgcl2 the metabolic inhibitor added the dissolved n2o was then measured using a gas chromatograph 7890 plus gc lunan ruihong chemical instrument china equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and a hp plot molesieve column 30 m 0 53 mm 25 µm the temperatures of the injector ecd and column were set at 150 c 280 c and 180 c respectively nitrogen gas was supplied as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15 ml min 1 the n2o concentration in the gas phase was calculated based on henry s law and the n2o volumetric mass transfer coefficient k l a n 2 o the total n2o production was the sum of n2o concentrations in liquid phase and gas phase to determine k l a n 2 o an independent experiment was carried out for open and aerated reactors containing algae bacteria and algal bacterial culture respectively nitrogen gas was first sparged into conical flasks containing culture until do reached zero air was either atmospherically transferred into the open reactor or sparged at a constant flow rate into the aerated reactor until do concentration was stable the profiles of do dynamics were recorded and input into a mass transfer model as shown in eq 3 3 d c t o 2 dt k l a o 2 c ts o 2 c t o 2 where t represents time h k l a o 2 represents volumetric mass transfer coefficient h 1 c t o 2 represents oxygen concentration in liquid bulk phase at time t mg l 1 c ts o 2 represents saturated oxygen concentration in liquid bulk phase mg l 1 it should be noted that the k l a is a parameter that determines the rate at which a gaseous compound e g o2 n2o can transfer between the gas phase and the liquid phase the rate is a function of the k l a and the concentration gradient between the saturated gas liquid interface and the bulk phase by assuming the negligible diffusion resistance of the laminar underlayer for the gas phase the kinetics of this transport will mostly be defined by the transition across the laminar underlayer of the liquid phase allowing us to linearly relate rate to its liquid concentration using the eq 3 this kinetic equation has been demonstrated by previous studies klöckner and büchs 2012 tissot et al 2012 2011 zhang et al 2009a 2009b the detailed parameter values and simulation profile can be found in fig s1 in the supporting information the k l a n 2 o can be calculated based on k l a o 2 under the same experimental conditions with eq 4 4 k l a n 2 o k l a o 2 d f o 2 d f n 2 o where k l a n 2 o represents volumetric transfer coefficient of n2o h 1 k l a o 2 represents volumetric transfer coefficient of oxygen h 1 d f n 2 o represents molecular diffusivity of n2o in water 1 88 10 9 m2 s 1 at 25 c tamimi et al 1994 d f o 2 represents molecular diffusivity of oxygen in water 2 20 10 9 m2 s 1 at 25 c ferrell and himmelblau 1967 in this study n2o was produced by both nitrification and denitrification process respectively the nitrifying n2o emission factor was calculated based on eq 5 5 n 2 o ef nf n 2 o em nh 4 n 100 where n 2 o ef nf represents the nitrifying n2o emission factor n 2 o em represents mass of n2o emitted mg n nh 4 n represents mass of nh4 n consumed mg n the denitrifying n2o emission factor was calculated based on eq 6 6 n 2 o ef dnf n 2 o em tn 100 where n 2 o ef dnf represents the denitrifying n2o emission factor n 2 o em represents mass of n2o emitted mg n tn represents mass of tn removed mg n 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate and microbe interactions of algal bacterial consortium to get a better understanding of the algal bacterial process the key growth substrates were investigated under different biomass and oxic conditions fig 1 shows the dynamic profiles of nitrogen species do and ph and nitrogen removal efficiencies and rates in enclosed open and aerated reactors with algal bacterial consortium in the presence of nh4 n and cod for all groups nh4 n concentration decreased no3 n concentration accumulated and no2 n concentration was at a low level during the first 12 h with light irradiated fig 1a c and e confirming the presence of nitrification the do was undetectable during the first 6 h and elevated to 0 5 mg o2 l 1 in the subsequent 6 h fig 1b in the enclosed reactor which indicated that the photo oxygenation by algae was not able to support oxygen uptake by algal bacterial consortium in the presence of sufficient cod 490 mg l 1 however the photo oxygenation rate would surpass the oxygen uptake rate by nitrifiers 11 4 mg o2 l 1 h 1 in the absence of glucose fig s2c during initial 12 h more inorganic nitrogen 18 3 mg n l 1 was removed by algal bacterial consortium in the presence of glucose compared to that in the absence of glucose figs 1a and s2a which demonstrated that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification may occur in the enclosed reactor under mixotrophic and oxygen limited conditions 0 0 5 mg o2 l 1 similarly simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes were previously observed at low do concentration of 0 3 0 1 mg o2 l 1 in a sbr bai et al 2022 switching to darkness at 12 h would cease the photooxygenation and thus cause a sudden do drop from 0 5 to 0 mg o2 l 1 fig 1b during the 12 h dark period the decreasing no3 n and increasing ph proved that denitrification was active in the enclosed reactor fig 1a and b with the absence of do the slight decrease of nh4 n concentrations 12 24 h was attributed to algal assimilation instead of ammonium oxidation by aob fig 1a follow up experiments were performed in the enclosed reactor containing only algae to further investigate the algal assimilation process it was observed that 82 7 and 29 2 nh4 n were assimilated by algae in the presence and absence of glucose respectively figs s3a and s4a which also suggested that organic matter would largely stimulate ammonium assimilation by algae as reported c vulgaris can uptake co2 bicarbonate hco3 and nh4 n through photoautotrophic metabolism for growth arbib et al 2014 kim et al 2014 meanwhile the c6h12o6 e g glucose o2 and nh4 n could be converted into algal biomass through heterotrophic pathway fan et al 2020 compared to nitrate and nitrite ammonium was preferentially assimilated and removed by algae gao et al 2016 the expression of nitrogen assimilation enzyme were affected by light and organic carbon and thus the uptake rate of ammonium under mixotrophic conditions was 4 times higher than that under autotrophic or heterotrophic conditions perez garcia et al 2011 in this study chl a and chl b concentrations of c vulgaris under mixotrophic cultivation conditions were higher than those under autotrophic cultivation conditions figs s5 s6 and s7 mixotrophic algae could assimilate both organic carbon via phosphorylation and inorganic carbon via photosynthesis utilize co2 produced during aerobic respiration and reduce the self shading problem thus achieving growth rates that were 1 2 1 7 times higher than the heterotrophic one cheng et al 2022 and biomass yields that were 2 3 times higher than the autotrophic one cao et al 2020 on the contrast of enclosed reactor do was available during the entire experimental period 24 h in both open and aerated reactors fig 1d and f as a result nh4 n was depleted at a faster rate accompanied by no3 n accumulation over 20 mg n l 1 the no3 n almost remained unchanged after depletion of nh4 n as shown in fig 1c and e indicating that the role of denitrifies in nitrogen removal was not significant in these two algal bacterial reactors the nitrogen removed by denitrifiers constituted 18 5 and 6 1 of the ammonium input in open and aerated bacterial reactor refer to figs s8d g and 3b oxygen as energy favorable electron acceptor not only limited denitrification activity but also inhibited the algal photosynthesis and assimilation processes sforza et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 reported that excessive do above 4 mg o2 l 1 would limit the process of photosynthesis and restrain the growth of algae the aeration influenced the availability of inorganic carbon source for photoautotrophically growing algae meng et al 2020 however the total chlorophyll concentration remained high 21 4 29 8 mg l 1 at 24 h under high do levels 9 0 14 5 mg o2 l 1 in enclosed algal reactor in this study fig s5b the final chlorophyll concentration in open algal reactor with the do range of 8 0 9 0 mg o2 l 1 was even higher than that in enclosed algal reactor figs s5b and s6b the open algal reactor achieved the highest chlorophyll concentrations 30 6 mg l 1 in the presence of glucose fig s6b besides oxygen chlorophyll synthesis by algae was also regulated by organic carbon sources and bacterial competition as shown in figs s5 s6 and s7 3 2 nitrogen removal performance of algal bacterial consortium the nh4 n removal performances of algal bacterial consortium in open and aerated reactors 100 removal efficiency 4 4 mg n l 1 h 1 removal rate were better than those in the enclosed reactor 90 removal efficiency 3 2 mg n l 1 h 1 removal rate however higher tn removal efficiency and rate were achieved during the anoxic phase do of 0 5 mg o2 l 1 in the enclosed reactor than those in the open and aerated reactors do concentrations maintained a relatively low level up to 0 5 mg o2 l 1 during light period as a result of algal photosynthesis and dropped to zero during dark period in the enclosed reactor see fig 1b low oxygen concentration below 0 49 mg o2 l 1 promoted the nitrogen removal via denitrification kampman et al 2018 but restrained ammonium oxidation rate peng et al 2000 for open and aerated systems do was mainly supplied by external air leading to do concentrations above 8 0 mg o2 l 1 fig 1d and f do at 8 0 mg o2 l 1 were not conducive to bacterial denitrification see figs 1d f and s1e h as heterotrophic denitrification would be inhibited under high do concentrations bian et al 2022 except for the difference in oxygen availability co2 produced by bacterial respiration in the enclosed reactor can promote photosynthesis of algae which contributed to nitrogen removal bankston et al 2020 higher aeration intensity in the aerated reactor would facilitate co2 stripping decrease inorganic carbon consequently restrain activities of algae and nitrifying bacteria and finally lead to a decrease in tn removal zhang et al 2020 overall in order to achieve better removal of both nh4 n and tn a suitable aeration rate should be controlled to sustain balanced growth of algae and bacteria tang et al 2016 poor tn removal performance was observed in algal bacterial reactor under the autotrophic condition due to a weakened denitrification process fig s2c f and i the nh4 n removal rate in the absence of glucose 4 16 mg n l 1 h 1 was lower than that in the presence of glucose 5 87 mg n l 1 h 1 in the open algal bacterial reactor figs 2 b and s2f this difference could be explained by algal assimilation and cod dependent stimulation nh4 n and tn could be removed in algal reactor without glucose added and the organic carbon greatly improved the nitrogen removal performance figs s3c f and s4c f during mixotrophic cultivation heterotrophically growing algae possessed higher growth rates and become predominant over photoautotrophically growing algae probably because the glucose can induce the hexose h symport system deng et al 2019 this activated heterotrophic growth mode might account for the enhanced nitrogen removal via algal assimilation for open algal bacterial reactor the tn removal rate through mixotrophic microorganisms 1 50 mg n l 1 h 1 in fig 2b was higher than that by autotrophic microorganisms 0 86 mg n l 1 h 1 in fig s2f hence the assimilation by heterotrophically growing algae and bacteria played an important role in the tn removal of the algal bacterial consortium in this study addition of glucose was essential for bacterial denitrification as the electron donor and for algal assimilation as the stimulator given the glucose consumption rate at 9 18 kg per kgnh4 n in this study and the commercial price of glucose at 0 58 kg 1 fu et al 2022 the external organic carbon cost would be 7 22 per kgtn removed in the algal bacterial system which is lower than the corresponding value 7 45 per kgtn removed in the bacterial denitrification process for the algal reactor nitrogen removal performances in the enclosed reactor were generally lower than those in the open reactor figs s3c f and s4c f the oxygen in the enclosed algal reactor reached up to 14 6 mg o2 l 1 fig s4b it might be due to the decreased algal biomass about 10 in the enclosed reactor under higher do concentrations of 14 6 mg o2 l 1 fig s3b it was reported that a do concentration over 30 mg o2 l 1 would adversely impact the algal growth leading to a 30 loss in biomass productivity kazbar et al 2019 while the inhibition on photosynthetic rate was observed at do concentrations above 16 mg o2 l 1 sforza et al 2020 the maximum inhibitory oxygen concentrations were also related with light intensity and biomass concentration the mathematical modeling proposed by sforza et al 2020 involving maximum specific oxygen rate average light intensity concentration of co2 photorespiration constant etc served as a powerful predictive tool to determine the maximum inhibitory oxygen concentrations on a case by case basis although algal reactor and bacterial reactor with the feeding of glucose were able to remove 96 0 and 100 of nh4 n within 24 h respectively their nh4 n removal rates 2 76 and 3 18 mg n l 1 h 1 were much lower than that by algal bacterial consortium 5 87 mg n l 1 h 1 figs 2 s3 and s8 the same trend was observed in the absence of glucose as demonstrated in figs s2 s4 and s9 the ammonium and tn removal rates in the open and aerated algal bacterial reactors were 1 11 1 96 times and 1 21 4 62 times higher than those in the bacterial reactor respectively figs 2 s2 s8 and s9 consistently the combination of algae and activated sludge exhibited superior nitrogen removal performance than the activated sludge nguyen et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 the additional o2 generated by algal photosynthesis contributed to microbial respiration that was related to organic matter degradation and nitrification sun et al 2020 the interaction between algae and bacteria could also alter bacterial abundance alleviate oxidative stress and provide cofactors such as vitamins fan et al 2020 more efficient nh4 n removal by algal bacterial consortium was a joint outcome of additional oxygen supplement and ammonium assimilation by algae in the case of sufficient oxygen and no aeration stripping open reactors the algal bacterial consortium obtained the highest removal rate of ammonium with 7 34 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 fig 2b the ammonium removal rates by algal bacterial consortium 3 96 7 34 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 obtained in this study were higher than the reported values 3 41 4 69 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 this might be attributed to two reasons one was that nitrifying bacteria were easily suffered from photoinhibition leading to inactivation of the key enzymes involved in the nitrogen transformation process such as ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao vergara et al 2016 zhang et al 2022b the 12 h 12 h light dark cycle implemented in this study was more favorable for nitrifying bacteria growth than continuous light irradiation in previous studies chen et al 2019 besides higher cod n 10 1 was found to enhance the assimilation capacity of algae and bacteria dang et al 2022 which explained better nitrogen removal of this work than those with limited cod availability zhu et al 2019 3 3 nitrogen removal pathways by algal bacterial consortium the enclosed open and aerated reactors were used to cultivate algal bacterial consortium mimicking photobioreactor open pond and aeration basin respectively to investigate all the possible nitrogen removal pathways as well as the shift of these pathways under varying biomass and oxic conditions which were depicted in fig 3 in the enclosed bacterial reactor volatilization and assimilation of nh4 n by bacteria accounted for 2 7 and 13 7 of the total nh4 n removed respectively while 6 2 of nh4 n were nitrified due to residual oxygen in the headspace fig 3a comparatively majority of nh4 n were removed by nitrifiers e g nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonadaceae in the open and aerated bacterial reactors fig s10 algal assimilation 77 7 88 6 was the dominant nh4 n removal pathway in the algal reactor under all conditions fig 3a nutrients in wastewater were first adsorbed onto the algal surface and then assimilated by the cells kim et al 2013 the assimilation process includes three steps a translocation of the inorganic nitrogen b reduction of nitrite and nitrate to ammonium c the incorporation of ammonium into amino acids cai et al 2013 therefore algal assimilation preferred ammonium to nitrite and nitrate as more energy would be required for reducing oxidized nitrogen for example nitrate was not consumed by algae until ammonium was depleted completely maestrini et al 1986 in enclosed open and aerated algal bacterial reactors nitrification and algal assimilation made comparable contributions to nh4 n removal average values 41 8 for nitrification versus 43 5 for algal assimilation additionally nh4 n could be removed by ammonia stripping which was accelerated under high temperature and ph the free ammonia stripping accounted for 5 5 of nh4 n removal in this study 13 5 and 7 2 of nh4 n was removed via bacterial assimilation in bacteria and algal bacterial consortium respectively while negligible nh4 n was removed by adsorption it was known that both sludge and algae adsorbed little ammonium mohamed ramli et al 2018 the relative contribution of denitrification to tn removal was 0 8 18 5 in the bacterial reactor confirming the presence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification even at do levels of 7 0 mg o2 l 1 fig 3b despite of inhibited activity at high do level the denitrifying bacteria could contribute to nitrogen removal chang et al 2006 yang et al 2012 besides paracoccus at the genus level contained in inoculated sludge fig s11 which may perform denitrification for nitrogen removal under aerobic condition zhang et al 2023 similar to possible nh4 n removal pathways in fig 3a algal assimilation contributed to 65 1 of tn removal in algal reactor in fig 3b the percentage of algal adsorption was averaged at 0 5 of tn removal in three algal reactors while no bacterial adsorption was observed as for algal bacterial reactor the tn removal efficiency was 73 7 under enclosed conditions which was much higher than those under open and aerated conditions partially owing to the stimulated denitrification during the dark and oxygen limited period algal assimilation had an important contribution 58 2 68 6 to tn removal in all three algal bacterial reactors see fig 3b probably owing to genes including glna glt and gdh in nitrogen fixation wang et al 2021 it was known that algae were able to convert inorganic nitrogen e g nitrate nitrite nitric acid and ammonium to its organic form e g enzymes protein and peptides for biological activity cai et al 2013 however the functions of related enzymes and genes in the nitrogen removal pathways of the algal bacterial consortium are yet to be assessed in future experiments nitrogen removal by stripping and bacterial assimilation accounted for 2 5 5 1 and 2 2 5 2 in three algal bacterial reactors fig 3b it was revealed for the first time that the nitrogen removal pathways were shifted under varying oxic conditions in the simulated photobioreactor the algal assimilation and denitrification pathways were making comparable contribution to tn removal fig 3b however the denitrification pathway would be partially suppressed in the simulated open pond and forcefully inhibited in the simulated aeration basin comparatively the oxic conditions exerted less impact on the tn removal by algal assimilation the findings would help to shed some light on the underlying nitrogen removal mechanisms in the co culturing systems 3 4 n2o mitigation by algal bacterial consortium n2o production by algae bacteria and algal bacterial consortium was investigated in the enclosed open and aerated reactors the algae produced negligible n2o under any conditions it was reported that n2o from c vulgaris feeding ammonium as nitrogen source was hardly detected plouviez et al 2017 the direct evidence demonstrated that algae could produce n2o was yet missing the n2o production in bacterial reactor was between 1 02 and 2 44 mg n l 1 fig s12 the n2o productions in the absence of additional cod in the aerated 1 02 mg n l 1 and open reactors 1 13 mg n l 1 were comparable by contrast the bacterial reactor would produce more n2o heterotrophically 1 43 2 44 mg n l 1 fig s12 when cod was depleting at 12 h or cod n below 1 5 was obtained n2o production was boosted fig s12 under organic carbon limiting conditions higher electron flux was directed to nitrite reduction than that going to n2o reduction leading to n2o accumulation from incomplete denitrification pan et al 2013 the possible reasons resulting in an enhanced n2o production after depletion of cod were speculated based on the literature though it should be confirmed in the future experiment the n2o in the enclosed algal bacterial reactor without glucose accumulated to 0 29 mg n l 1 which was 71 7 74 5 lower than those in the open and aerated bacterial reactors figs 4 a and s12 the limited oxygen in the enclosed reactor served to be the rate limiting factor to hinder electron flux thus decreasing the electron distributed to either nh2oh oxidation pathway or aob denitrification pathway for autotrophic n2o production vasilaki et al 2019 besides the ammonium assimilation by photoautotrophic algae could reduce the nitrogen utilized by nitrifying bacteria through nitrification in contrast n2o accumulation was rapidly increased to 2 93 mg n l 1 during dark period in the presence of glucose fig 4a on one hand the limited availability of do close to zero in fig 1b might stimulate n2o production from heterotrophic denitrification on the other hand the residual cod would be partially consumed by algal assimilation resulting in an insufficient electron donor for denitrification and rapid accumulation of n2o during the dark period the enzymatic reactions by qnorb nirk qnorb bacteria nosz narg napa and narg bacteria may contribute to the accumulation of n2o under carbon limiting conditions zhang et al 2016b the n2o accumulations in open and aerated reactors without glucose were 0 51 and 0 66 mg n l 1 within 24 h respectively fig 4b and c aob was considered to be the major contributor to n2o emission up to 83 in the full scale wwtps law et al 2012 n2o production by aob was affected by incomplete oxidation of nh2oh and aob denitrification with no2 as the terminal electron acceptor yamazaki et al 2014 plenty of aob had copper containing nitrite reductase nirk and nitric oxide reductase norb but did not have nitrous oxide reductase n2or that made n2o the final product so aob became net n2o producers duan et al 2017 compared with the enclosed reactor much higher do in the open and aerated reactors might promote the activity of amo to catalyze the oxidation of nh2oh thus providing more electrons for n2o production ni and yuan 2015 the model proposed by peng et al 2014 predicted an increased importance of nh2oh oxidation pathway at higher do which was in line with the point above the introduction of glucose would decrease n2o production with a factor of 69 5 in open algal bacterial reactor fig 4b this indicated that heterotrophic denitrification with sufficient cod supply served to be the major sink for the produced n2o by nitrifiers it was reported that the high cod n ratio could stimulate denitrification and thus reduce n2o emission in simultaneous nitrification anammox and denitrification processes zhang et al 2021 the cod concentration decreased rapidly in the initial 6 h and stabilized in the following 18 h and the cod n had the similar variation trends ranging from 2 64 to 8 16 fig 4b similarly a 59 0 reduction of n2o was observed in the aerated algal bacterial reactor with the presence of glucose compared to that without glucose fig 4c the organic carbon accelerated the denitrification process and thus reduced the nitrite concentration which might hinder nitrite reductase activity it was reported that the enzymatic activities of nitrite reductase were positively correlated with the amount of n2o produced yang et al 2022 the nitrifying n2o emission factors by algal bacterial consortium in this study were in the range of 0 3 1 1 fig s13 by comparing the n2o quantification with varying availability of organic carbon and oxygen it was evident that aerated and heterotrophic conditions would favor n2o emission although n2o has been demonstrated to be the major source of carbon footprint in biological nitrogen removal the relevant knowledge on n2o emission from algal bacterial consortium was rather limited our results suggested that algal bacterial consortium might play crucial roles in carbon footprint mitigation in the open pond and aeration basin mostly owing to algal nitrogen assimilation and algal photosynthetic oxygen first algal bacterial reactor resulted in 35 5 55 0 n2o reduction under autotrophic conditions compared to bacterial reactor figs 4 and s12 algal assimilation could contribute to 40 0 46 7 ammonium removal and 28 1 40 8 tn removal nitrogen assimilation by algae produced no n2o and consumed co2 that was produced by aerobic and anoxic respiration consequently to achieve the same nh4 n and tn removal performance algal bacterial consortium would reduce direct emissions of both n2o and co2 second much more n2o mitigation 81 0 93 6 by algal bacterial consortium was observed under heterotrophic conditions it has been demonstrated by this study that the addition of external cod could largely boost the nitrogen assimilation by algae figs s3 and s4 reducing the nitrogen transformation via nitrification and denitrification figs 1 and s2 and further restraining the bacterial n2o production figs 4 and s12 the residual cod concentration of the algal bacterial reactor was higher than that of the bacterial reactor at 12 h fig 4 versus fig s12 which would ensure a speedy n2o conversion to n2 during denitrification process and abolish n2o accumulation caused by insufficient carbon sources possible explanation was that the release of organic matter from dead algae cells would replenish the consumed cod during cultivation lu et al 2020 by comparing the denitrifying n2o emission factors by algal bacterial consortium 0 7 1 3 to those by bacteria 13 7 14 3 in fig s14 it was confirmed that the n2o reduction by algal bacterial consortium normalized by tn removal was even more significant third algae as a natural aeration device provided o2 through algal photosynthesis for nitrifiers to perform nitrification park et al 2011 the mutual interaction between algal cells and nitrifying bacteria might accelerate oxygen utilization via sharing metabolic matter ramanan et al 2016 in this way algal bacterial consortium were conducive to decreasing indirect carbon footprint from energy consumption photosynthetic oxygen could reduce the intensity of mechanical aeration and then partially avoid the release of gaseous n2o due to stripping this might benefit carbon reduction in the end of pipe treatment in sum our results indicated that the combination of algal metabolism with nitrification and denitrification was a promising alternative for enhanced nitrogen removal and minimized carbon emissions 4 conclusion in this study nitrogen transformation pathways and n2o reduction potential by a coupling consortium of c vulgaris and activated sludge were investigated in simulated photobioreactors open ponds and aeration basins the main conclusions are listed as follows the ammonium was completely removed at the highest rate of 7 34 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 by the algal bacterial consortium in simulated open pond with the addition of glucose as for the ammonium removal pathways in algal bacterial reactor ammonia oxidation and algal assimilation made comparable contributions under open and aerated conditions while the limited oyxgen supply the enclosed condition lessened the ammonia oxidation tn removal was primarily achieved by algal assimilation 28 1 40 8 followed by bacterial denitrification 2 9 26 5 in the algal bacterial consortium compared to activated sludge the algal bacterial consortium resulted in 35 5 55 0 n2o mitigation under autotrophic conditions and 81 0 93 6 reduction with the addition of glucose nitrogen assimilation by algae was boosted with the addition of glucose and thus largely restrained n2o production from nitrification and denitrification the synergism between algae and bacteria was conducive to an enhanced n2o reduction by denitrification declaration of competing

14893,this work investigated nitrogen transformation pathways of the algal bacterial consortium as well as its potential in reducing nitrous oxide n2o emission in enclosed open and aerated reactors the results confirmed the superior ammonium removal performance of the algal bacterial consortium relative to the single algae chlorella vulgaris or the activated sludge achieving the highest efficiency at 100 and the highest rate of 7 34 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 in the open reactor with glucose enhanced total nitrogen tn removal to 74 6 by the algal bacterial consortium was achieved via mixotrophic algal assimilation and bacterial denitrification under oxygen limited and glucose sufficient conditions nitrogen distribution indicated that ammonia oxidation 41 8 and algal assimilation 43 5 were the main pathways to remove ammonium by the algal bacterial consortium tn removal by the algal bacterial consortium was primarily achieved by algal assimilation 28 1 40 8 followed by bacterial denitrification 2 9 26 5 furthermore the algal bacterial consortium contributed to n2o mitigation compared with the activated sludge reducing n2o production by 35 5 55 0 via autotrophic pathways and by 81 0 93 6 via mixotrophic pathways nitrogen assimilation by algae was boosted with the addition of glucose and thus largely restrained n2o production from nitrification and denitrification the synergism between algae and bacteria was also conducive to an enhanced n2o reduction by denitrification and reduced direct indirect carbon emissions graphical abstract image

prasannamedha 2021 conventional biological nitrogen removal processes are based on energy intensive nitrification and denitrification li et al 2016 ammonium nh4 is oxidized to nitrate no3 via nitrite no2 under aerobic conditions whereas no3 is reduced to dinitrogen n2 gas under anoxic conditions the nitrification denitrification thus requires aeration and carbon sources aeration accounts for 60 80 of the total energy consumption in wastewater treatment plants wwtps rendered as the major source of indirect carbon emissions nguyen et al 2020 in some regions for instance 70 of china s urban sewage has the characteristics of low chemical oxygen demand cod to nitrogen ratio and thus the external organic carbon is indispensable for heterotrophic denitrification to achieve total nitrogen tn removal zhang et al 2016a which would increase the carbon footprint of wwtps by 10 fu et al 2022 therefore new configurations and processes are expected to fulfill energy carbon neutral wastewater treatment recently algal bacterial consortium has been proposed as an alternative approach for nitrogen removal while producing biomass as value added substances and saving both energy and chemical reagents

carbon footprint mitigation endeavors were made to couple algae with nitrification and nitritation i e short cut way for nitrogen removal karya et al 2013 wang et al 2015 for example different

ammonium nitrate nitrite etc could be removed by algal uptake christenson and sims 2011 although the respective roles of algae and activated sludge in terms of nitrogen and cod removal were studied

has been also reported plouviez et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 n2o emission might be indirectly influenced by the interactions among the substrates algae nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria fagerstone et al 2011 although n2o reduction was reported in the symbiotic system qiao et al 2020 few attempts have been made to understand the mitigation mechanisms so far the objective of this work was to unravel the nitrogen removal mechanisms of the algal bacterial consortium the effects of oxygen organic carbon sources and functional microorganisms on nitrogen removal by the algal bacterial consortium were assessed the nitrogen removal performance was evaluated in enclosed open and aerated reactors simulating photobioreactor open pond and aeration basin respectively the roles of algae nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the nitrogen conversion were elucidated n2o was quantified in the algal bacterial and algal bacterial systems to decipher the n2o production pathways 2 materials and methods 2

medium and enriched in an incubator under the following conditions light intensity of 4500 500 lux light dark regime of 12 12 h and temperature of 25 c the inoculum during the logarithmic growth phase was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min prior to collecting the algal pellets for further experiments the activated sludge was obtained from the aeration tank of a municipal wwtp in wuhan china and cultivated in a sequencing batch reactor sbr feeding with synthetic wastewater at 150 mg nh4 n l 1 d 1 synthetic wastewater was prepared with the following composition nh4cl 191 mg l 1 k2hpo4 40 mg l

5 g l 1 prior to experiments the activated sludge was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the bacterial pellets 2 2 experimental design the experiments were carried out in enclosed open and aerated reactors simulating photobioreactor open pond and aeration basin respectively which were widely used for algal cultivation zhou et al 2014 the enclosed reactor was constructed using rubber stopper sealed conical flask where the nitrogen gas was purged for 15 min to create anoxic environment it was known that the short term anoxic phase would not affect the ammonium oxidation process salem et al 2006 the availability of organic carbon was controlled to study the contribution of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms to nitrogen removal the aerated reactor was provided the external aeration flow rate of 100 ml min 1 during the light period n2o production was monitored in the enclosed open and aerated reactors with different oxygen availability the cultures i e algae bacteria algal bacterial consortium were incubated at 25 c in a shaking incubator with a shaking speed of 200 rpm the light dark regime was set as 12 h light phase with light intensity of 5000 500 lux and 12 h dark phase the initial biomass concentrations for algae bacteria and algal bacterial consortium inoculation ratio of 1 1 were 0 4 0 4 and 0 8 g l 1 respectively the experimental details are listed in table 1 autoclave control experiments were carried out at 121 c to study the adsorption of nitrogen to the biomass 2 3 analytical methods the mixed liquor samples were centrifuged and then filtered through a 0 22 µm millipore filter the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn were analyzed using a smartchem 140 discrete auto analyzer austriamicrosystems italy the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration and its volatile fraction were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2012 the cod concentration was measured using an drb200 digester and photometer dr3900 hach usa the content of inorganic carbon ic was determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer hty ct1000b tai lin technology instrument china do and ph were monitored using their respective meters in order to analyze the total chlorophyll concentration 6 ml of each sample was extracted using methanol xiong et al 2017 the sample was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the pellet afterwards the pellet was re suspended in 6 ml of 90 methanol the suspension in methanol was then incubated at 60 c for 10 min and centrifuged again at 8000 rpm for 10 min the absorbances of the supernatant at the wavelengths of 665 652 and 470 nm were determined using a visible spectrophotometer uv 5500 pc metash shanghai where a 90 methanol solution was used as a blank the concentrations of chlorophyll a chl a and chlorophyll b chl b were calculated based on eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1 c h l a mg l 1 16 82 a 665 9 28 a 652 2 c h l b mg l 1 36 92 a 652 16 54 a 665 all measurements were conducted in triplicates error bars in figures represent the range of one standard deviation in the result of an experimental measurement such as nitrogen concentration removal efficiency rate etc in this work 2 4 extrapolation of possible nitrogen removal pathways in this study systematic experiments were conducted to investigate the distribution of nh4 n and tn considering all possible removal pathways including stripping adsorption assimilation and nitrification denitrification the proportions of each component were obtained based on measurement calculation and deduction from the total ammonium nitrogen at 50 mg n l 1 specifically residual ammonium was confirmed by measurement ammonia stripping was calculated based on the empirical equation while the stripping of nitrite and nitrate was demonstrated to be negligible zhou et al 2019 the proportion of adsorption was obtained through the control experiment with autoclaved biomass since the population of heterotrophic bacteria in the activated sludge was predominant fig s10 bacterial assimilation in the bacterial reactor was calculated based on the difference between the ammonium removal in the presence of cod and in the absence of cod neglecting the contribution from autotrophic bacteria for algal assimilation in the algal reactor it was obtained by deducing residual ammonium stripping and adsorption from the entire ammonium mass for nitrification denitrification in the bacterial reactor it could be calculated by deducting the residual ammonium stripping and assimilation from the entire ammonium tn mass for algal bacterial reactor the specific proportion of assimilation and nitrification denitrification were estimated from the corresponding distributions in algal and bacterial reactors according to the following assumptions a the proportion of bacterial assimilation in the algal bacterial reactor was same as that in the bacterial reactor given the same bacterial concentration and experimental conditions b the proportion of algal assimilation in the algal bacterial reactor was same as that in the algal reactor given the same algal concentration and experimental conditions c the proportion of nitrification by bacteria in the enclosed algal bacterial reactor was identical regardless of the presence of cod as a result of the same biomass concentration and sufficient oxygen supply d the proportions of nitrification by bacteria in the open and aerated algal bacterial reactors were identical to the corresponding values in the open and aerated bacterial reactors respectively the similar calculation procedures of nitrogen distribution were also adopted previously nguyen et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 2 5 n2o measurement and calculation the dissolved n2o concentration in the liquid phase was analyzed based on the reported method duan et al 2020 liquid sample was collected with a syringe and subsequently transferred to a 12 ml vacuumed labco exetainer with 1 ml 1 g l 1 hgcl2 the metabolic inhibitor added the dissolved n2o was then measured using a gas chromatograph 7890 plus gc lunan ruihong chemical instrument china equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and a hp plot molesieve column 30 m 0 53 mm 25 µm the temperatures of the injector ecd and column were set at 150 c 280 c and 180 c respectively nitrogen gas was supplied as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15 ml min 1 the n2o concentration in the gas phase was calculated based on henry s law and the n2o volumetric mass transfer coefficient k l a n 2 o the total n2o production was the sum of n2o concentrations in liquid phase and gas phase to determine k l a n 2 o an independent experiment was carried out for open and aerated reactors containing algae bacteria and algal bacterial culture respectively nitrogen gas was first sparged into conical flasks containing culture until do reached zero air was either atmospherically transferred into the open reactor or sparged at a constant flow rate into the aerated reactor until do concentration was stable the profiles of do dynamics were recorded and input into a mass transfer model as shown in eq 3 3 d c t o 2 dt k l a o 2 c ts o 2 c t o 2 where t represents time h k l a o 2 represents volumetric mass transfer coefficient h 1 c t o 2 represents oxygen concentration in liquid bulk phase at time t mg l 1 c ts o 2 represents saturated oxygen concentration in liquid bulk phase mg l 1 it should be noted that the k l a is a parameter that determines the rate at which a gaseous compound e g o2 n2o can transfer between the gas phase and the liquid phase the rate is a function of the k l a and the concentration gradient between the saturated gas liquid interface and the bulk phase by assuming the negligible diffusion resistance of the laminar underlayer for the gas phase the kinetics of this transport will mostly be defined by the transition across the laminar underlayer of the liquid phase allowing us to linearly relate rate to its liquid concentration using the eq 3 this kinetic equation has been demonstrated by previous studies klöckner and büchs 2012 tissot et al 2012 2011 zhang et al 2009a 2009b the detailed parameter values and simulation profile can be found in fig s1 in the supporting information the k l a n 2 o can be calculated based on k l a o 2 under the same experimental conditions with eq 4 4 k l a n 2 o k l a o 2 d f o 2 d f n 2 o where k l a n 2 o represents volumetric transfer coefficient of n2o h 1 k l a o 2 represents volumetric transfer coefficient of oxygen h 1 d f n 2 o represents molecular diffusivity of n2o in water 1 88 10 9 m2 s 1 at 25 c tamimi et al 1994 d f o 2 represents molecular diffusivity of oxygen in water 2 20 10 9 m2 s 1 at 25 c ferrell and himmelblau 1967 in this study n2o was produced by both nitrification and denitrification process respectively the nitrifying n2o emission factor was calculated based on eq 5 5 n 2 o ef nf n 2 o em nh 4 n 100 where n 2 o ef nf represents the nitrifying n2o emission factor n 2 o em represents mass of n2o emitted mg n nh 4 n represents mass of nh4 n consumed mg n the denitrifying n2o emission factor was calculated based on eq 6 6 n 2 o ef dnf n 2 o em tn 100 where n 2 o ef dnf represents the denitrifying n2o emission factor n 2 o em represents mass of n2o emitted mg n tn represents mass of tn removed mg n 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate and microbe interactions of algal bacterial consortium to get a better understanding of the algal bacterial process the key growth substrates were investigated under different biomass and oxic conditions fig 1 shows the dynamic profiles of nitrogen species do and ph and nitrogen removal efficiencies and rates in enclosed open and aerated reactors with algal bacterial consortium in the presence of nh4 n and cod for all groups nh4 n concentration decreased no3 n concentration accumulated and no2 n concentration was at a low level during the first 12 h with light irradiated fig 1a c and e confirming the presence of nitrification the do was undetectable during the first 6 h and elevated to 0 5 mg o2 l 1 in the subsequent 6 h fig 1b in the enclosed reactor which indicated that the photo oxygenation by algae was not able to support oxygen uptake by algal bacterial consortium in the presence of sufficient cod 490 mg l 1 however the photo oxygenation rate would surpass the oxygen uptake rate by nitrifiers 11 4 mg o2 l 1 h 1 in the absence of glucose fig s2c during initial 12 h more inorganic nitrogen 18 3 mg n l 1 was removed by algal bacterial consortium in the presence of glucose compared to that in the absence of glucose figs 1a and s2a which demonstrated that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification may occur in the enclosed reactor under mixotrophic and oxygen limited conditions 0 0 5 mg o2 l 1 similarly simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes were previously observed at low do concentration of 0 3 0 1 mg o2 l 1 in a sbr bai et al 2022 switching to darkness at 12 h would cease the photooxygenation and thus cause a sudden do drop from 0 5 to 0 mg o2 l 1 fig 1b during the 12 h dark period the decreasing no3 n and increasing ph proved that denitrification was active in the enclosed reactor fig 1a and b with the absence of do the slight decrease of nh4 n concentrations 12 24 h was attributed to algal assimilation instead of ammonium oxidation by aob fig 1a follow up experiments were performed in the enclosed reactor containing only algae to further investigate the algal assimilation process it was observed that 82 7 and 29 2 nh4 n were assimilated by algae in the presence and absence of glucose respectively figs s3a and s4a which also suggested that organic matter would largely stimulate ammonium assimilation by algae as reported c vulgaris can uptake co2 bicarbonate hco3 and nh4 n through photoautotrophic metabolism for growth arbib et al 2014 kim et al 2014 meanwhile the c6h12o6 e g glucose o2 and nh4 n could be converted into algal biomass through heterotrophic pathway fan et al 2020 compared to nitrate and nitrite ammonium was preferentially assimilated and removed by algae gao et al 2016 the expression of nitrogen assimilation enzyme were affected by light and organic carbon and thus the uptake rate of ammonium under mixotrophic conditions was 4 times higher than that under autotrophic or heterotrophic conditions perez garcia et al 2011 in this study chl a and chl b concentrations of c vulgaris under mixotrophic cultivation conditions were higher than those under autotrophic cultivation conditions figs s5 s6 and s7 mixotrophic algae could assimilate both organic carbon via phosphorylation and inorganic carbon via photosynthesis utilize co2 produced during aerobic respiration and reduce the self shading problem thus achieving growth rates that were 1 2 1 7 times higher than the heterotrophic one cheng et al 2022 and biomass yields that were 2 3 times higher than the autotrophic one cao et al 2020 on the contrast of enclosed reactor do was available during the entire experimental period 24 h in both open and aerated reactors fig 1d and f as a result nh4 n was depleted at a faster rate accompanied by no3 n accumulation over 20 mg n l 1 the no3 n almost remained unchanged after depletion of nh4 n as shown in fig 1c and e indicating that the role of denitrifies in nitrogen removal was not significant in these two algal bacterial reactors the nitrogen removed by denitrifiers constituted 18 5 and 6 1 of the ammonium input in open and aerated bacterial reactor refer to figs s8d g and 3b oxygen as energy favorable electron acceptor not only limited denitrification activity but also inhibited the algal photosynthesis and assimilation processes sforza et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 reported that excessive do above 4 mg o2 l 1 would limit the process of photosynthesis and restrain the growth of algae the aeration influenced the availability of inorganic carbon source for photoautotrophically growing algae meng et al 2020 however the total chlorophyll concentration remained high 21 4 29 8 mg l 1 at 24 h under high do levels 9 0 14 5 mg o2 l 1 in enclosed algal reactor in this study fig s5b the final chlorophyll concentration in open algal reactor with the do range of 8 0 9 0 mg o2 l 1 was even higher than that in enclosed algal reactor figs s5b and s6b the open algal reactor achieved the highest chlorophyll concentrations 30 6 mg l 1 in the presence of glucose fig s6b besides oxygen chlorophyll synthesis by algae was also regulated by organic carbon sources and bacterial competition as shown in figs s5 s6 and s7 3 2 nitrogen removal performance of algal bacterial consortium the nh4 n removal performances of algal bacterial consortium in open and aerated reactors 100 removal efficiency 4 4 mg n l 1 h 1 removal rate were better than those in the enclosed reactor 90 removal efficiency 3 2 mg n l 1 h 1 removal rate however higher tn removal efficiency and rate were achieved during the anoxic phase do of 0 5 mg o2 l 1 in the enclosed reactor than those in the open and aerated reactors do concentrations maintained a relatively low level up to 0 5 mg o2 l 1 during light period as a result of algal photosynthesis and dropped to zero during dark period in the enclosed reactor see fig 1b low oxygen concentration below 0 49 mg o2 l 1 promoted the nitrogen removal via denitrification kampman et al 2018 but restrained ammonium oxidation rate peng et al 2000 for open and aerated systems do was mainly supplied by external air leading to do concentrations above 8 0 mg o2 l 1 fig 1d and f do at 8 0 mg o2 l 1 were not conducive to bacterial denitrification see figs 1d f and s1e h as heterotrophic denitrification would be inhibited under high do concentrations bian et al 2022 except for the difference in oxygen availability co2 produced by bacterial respiration in the enclosed reactor can promote photosynthesis of algae which contributed to nitrogen removal bankston et al 2020 higher aeration intensity in the aerated reactor would facilitate co2 stripping decrease inorganic carbon consequently restrain activities of algae and nitrifying bacteria and finally lead to a decrease in tn removal zhang et al 2020 overall in order to achieve better removal of both nh4 n and tn a suitable aeration rate should be controlled to sustain balanced growth of algae and bacteria tang et al 2016 poor tn removal performance was observed in algal bacterial reactor under the autotrophic condition due to a weakened denitrification process fig s2c f and i the nh4 n removal rate in the absence of glucose 4 16 mg n l 1 h 1 was lower than that in the presence of glucose 5 87 mg n l 1 h 1 in the open algal bacterial reactor figs 2 b and s2f this difference could be explained by algal assimilation and cod dependent stimulation nh4 n and tn could be removed in algal reactor without glucose added and the organic carbon greatly improved the nitrogen removal performance figs s3c f and s4c f during mixotrophic cultivation heterotrophically growing algae possessed higher growth rates and become predominant over photoautotrophically growing algae probably because the glucose can induce the hexose h symport system deng et al 2019 this activated heterotrophic growth mode might account for the enhanced nitrogen removal via algal assimilation for open algal bacterial reactor the tn removal rate through mixotrophic microorganisms 1 50 mg n l 1 h 1 in fig 2b was higher than that by autotrophic microorganisms 0 86 mg n l 1 h 1 in fig s2f hence the assimilation by heterotrophically growing algae and bacteria played an important role in the tn removal of the algal bacterial consortium in this study addition of glucose was essential for bacterial denitrification as the electron donor and for algal assimilation as the stimulator given the glucose consumption rate at 9 18 kg per kgnh4 n in this study and the commercial price of glucose at 0 58 kg 1 fu et al 2022 the external organic carbon cost would be 7 22 per kgtn removed in the algal bacterial system which is lower than the corresponding value 7 45 per kgtn removed in the bacterial denitrification process for the algal reactor nitrogen removal performances in the enclosed reactor were generally lower than those in the open reactor figs s3c f and s4c f the oxygen in the enclosed algal reactor reached up to 14 6 mg o2 l 1 fig s4b it might be due to the decreased algal biomass about 10 in the enclosed reactor under higher do concentrations of 14 6 mg o2 l 1 fig s3b it was reported that a do concentration over 30 mg o2 l 1 would adversely impact the algal growth leading to a 30 loss in biomass productivity kazbar et al 2019 while the inhibition on photosynthetic rate was observed at do concentrations above 16 mg o2 l 1 sforza et al 2020 the maximum inhibitory oxygen concentrations were also related with light intensity and biomass concentration the mathematical modeling proposed by sforza et al 2020 involving maximum specific oxygen rate average light intensity concentration of co2 photorespiration constant etc served as a powerful predictive tool to determine the maximum inhibitory oxygen concentrations on a case by case basis although algal reactor and bacterial reactor with the feeding of glucose were able to remove 96 0 and 100 of nh4 n within 24 h respectively their nh4 n removal rates 2 76 and 3 18 mg n l 1 h 1 were much lower than that by algal bacterial consortium 5 87 mg n l 1 h 1 figs 2 s3 and s8 the same trend was observed in the absence of glucose as demonstrated in figs s2 s4 and s9 the ammonium and tn removal rates in the open and aerated algal bacterial reactors were 1 11 1 96 times and 1 21 4 62 times higher than those in the bacterial reactor respectively figs 2 s2 s8 and s9 consistently the combination of algae and activated sludge exhibited superior nitrogen removal performance than the activated sludge nguyen et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 the additional o2 generated by algal photosynthesis contributed to microbial respiration that was related to organic matter degradation and nitrification sun et al 2020 the interaction between algae and bacteria could also alter bacterial abundance alleviate oxidative stress and provide cofactors such as vitamins fan et al 2020 more efficient nh4 n removal by algal bacterial consortium was a joint outcome of additional oxygen supplement and ammonium assimilation by algae in the case of sufficient oxygen and no aeration stripping open reactors the algal bacterial consortium obtained the highest removal rate of ammonium with 7 34 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 fig 2b the ammonium removal rates by algal bacterial consortium 3 96 7 34 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 obtained in this study were higher than the reported values 3 41 4 69 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 this might be attributed to two reasons one was that nitrifying bacteria were easily suffered from photoinhibition leading to inactivation of the key enzymes involved in the nitrogen transformation process such as ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao vergara et al 2016 zhang et al 2022b the 12 h 12 h light dark cycle implemented in this study was more favorable for nitrifying bacteria growth than continuous light irradiation in previous studies chen et al 2019 besides higher cod n 10 1 was found to enhance the assimilation capacity of algae and bacteria dang et al 2022 which explained better nitrogen removal of this work than those with limited cod availability zhu et al 2019 3 3 nitrogen removal pathways by algal bacterial consortium the enclosed open and aerated reactors were used to cultivate algal bacterial consortium mimicking photobioreactor open pond and aeration basin respectively to investigate all the possible nitrogen removal pathways as well as the shift of these pathways under varying biomass and oxic conditions which were depicted in fig 3 in the enclosed bacterial reactor volatilization and assimilation of nh4 n by bacteria accounted for 2 7 and 13 7 of the total nh4 n removed respectively while 6 2 of nh4 n were nitrified due to residual oxygen in the headspace fig 3a comparatively majority of nh4 n were removed by nitrifiers e g nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonadaceae in the open and aerated bacterial reactors fig s10 algal assimilation 77 7 88 6 was the dominant nh4 n removal pathway in the algal reactor under all conditions fig 3a nutrients in wastewater were first adsorbed onto the algal surface and then assimilated by the cells kim et al 2013 the assimilation process includes three steps a translocation of the inorganic nitrogen b reduction of nitrite and nitrate to ammonium c the incorporation of ammonium into amino acids cai et al 2013 therefore algal assimilation preferred ammonium to nitrite and nitrate as more energy would be required for reducing oxidized nitrogen for example nitrate was not consumed by algae until ammonium was depleted completely maestrini et al 1986 in enclosed open and aerated algal bacterial reactors nitrification and algal assimilation made comparable contributions to nh4 n removal average values 41 8 for nitrification versus 43 5 for algal assimilation additionally nh4 n could be removed by ammonia stripping which was accelerated under high temperature and ph the free ammonia stripping accounted for 5 5 of nh4 n removal in this study 13 5 and 7 2 of nh4 n was removed via bacterial assimilation in bacteria and algal bacterial consortium respectively while negligible nh4 n was removed by adsorption it was known that both sludge and algae adsorbed little ammonium mohamed ramli et al 2018 the relative contribution of denitrification to tn removal was 0 8 18 5 in the bacterial reactor confirming the presence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification even at do levels of 7 0 mg o2 l 1 fig 3b despite of inhibited activity at high do level the denitrifying bacteria could contribute to nitrogen removal chang et al 2006 yang et al 2012 besides paracoccus at the genus level contained in inoculated sludge fig s11 which may perform denitrification for nitrogen removal under aerobic condition zhang et al 2023 similar to possible nh4 n removal pathways in fig 3a algal assimilation contributed to 65 1 of tn removal in algal reactor in fig 3b the percentage of algal adsorption was averaged at 0 5 of tn removal in three algal reactors while no bacterial adsorption was observed as for algal bacterial reactor the tn removal efficiency was 73 7 under enclosed conditions which was much higher than those under open and aerated conditions partially owing to the stimulated denitrification during the dark and oxygen limited period algal assimilation had an important contribution 58 2 68 6 to tn removal in all three algal bacterial reactors see fig 3b probably owing to genes including glna glt and gdh in nitrogen fixation wang et al 2021 it was known that algae were able to convert inorganic nitrogen e g nitrate nitrite nitric acid and ammonium to its organic form e g enzymes protein and peptides for biological activity cai et al 2013 however the functions of related enzymes and genes in the nitrogen removal pathways of the algal bacterial consortium are yet to be assessed in future experiments nitrogen removal by stripping and bacterial assimilation accounted for 2 5 5 1 and 2 2 5 2 in three algal bacterial reactors fig 3b it was revealed for the first time that the nitrogen removal pathways were shifted under varying oxic conditions in the simulated photobioreactor the algal assimilation and denitrification pathways were making comparable contribution to tn removal fig 3b however the denitrification pathway would be partially suppressed in the simulated open pond and forcefully inhibited in the simulated aeration basin comparatively the oxic conditions exerted less impact on the tn removal by algal assimilation the findings would help to shed some light on the underlying nitrogen removal mechanisms in the co culturing systems 3 4 n2o mitigation by algal bacterial consortium n2o production by algae bacteria and algal bacterial consortium was investigated in the enclosed open and aerated reactors the algae produced negligible n2o under any conditions it was reported that n2o from c vulgaris feeding ammonium as nitrogen source was hardly detected plouviez et al 2017 the direct evidence demonstrated that algae could produce n2o was yet missing the n2o production in bacterial reactor was between 1 02 and 2 44 mg n l 1 fig s12 the n2o productions in the absence of additional cod in the aerated 1 02 mg n l 1 and open reactors 1 13 mg n l 1 were comparable by contrast the bacterial reactor would produce more n2o heterotrophically 1 43 2 44 mg n l 1 fig s12 when cod was depleting at 12 h or cod n below 1 5 was obtained n2o production was boosted fig s12 under organic carbon limiting conditions higher electron flux was directed to nitrite reduction than that going to n2o reduction leading to n2o accumulation from incomplete denitrification pan et al 2013 the possible reasons resulting in an enhanced n2o production after depletion of cod were speculated based on the literature though it should be confirmed in the future experiment the n2o in the enclosed algal bacterial reactor without glucose accumulated to 0 29 mg n l 1 which was 71 7 74 5 lower than those in the open and aerated bacterial reactors figs 4 a and s12 the limited oxygen in the enclosed reactor served to be the rate limiting factor to hinder electron flux thus decreasing the electron distributed to either nh2oh oxidation pathway or aob denitrification pathway for autotrophic n2o production vasilaki et al 2019 besides the ammonium assimilation by photoautotrophic algae could reduce the nitrogen utilized by nitrifying bacteria through nitrification in contrast n2o accumulation was rapidly increased to 2 93 mg n l 1 during dark period in the presence of glucose fig 4a on one hand the limited availability of do close to zero in fig 1b might stimulate n2o production from heterotrophic denitrification on the other hand the residual cod would be partially consumed by algal assimilation resulting in an insufficient electron donor for denitrification and rapid accumulation of n2o during the dark period the enzymatic reactions by qnorb nirk qnorb bacteria nosz narg napa and narg bacteria may contribute to the accumulation of n2o under carbon limiting conditions zhang et al 2016b the n2o accumulations in open and aerated reactors without glucose were 0 51 and 0 66 mg n l 1 within 24 h respectively fig 4b and c aob was considered to be the major contributor to n2o emission up to 83 in the full scale wwtps law et al 2012 n2o production by aob was affected by incomplete oxidation of nh2oh and aob denitrification with no2 as the terminal electron acceptor yamazaki et al 2014 plenty of aob had copper containing nitrite reductase nirk and nitric oxide reductase norb but did not have nitrous oxide reductase n2or that made n2o the final product so aob became net n2o producers duan et al 2017 compared with the enclosed reactor much higher do in the open and aerated reactors might promote the activity of amo to catalyze the oxidation of nh2oh thus providing more electrons for n2o production ni and yuan 2015 the model proposed by peng et al 2014 predicted an increased importance of nh2oh oxidation pathway at higher do which was in line with the point above the introduction of glucose would decrease n2o production with a factor of 69 5 in open algal bacterial reactor fig 4b this indicated that heterotrophic denitrification with sufficient cod supply served to be the major sink for the produced n2o by nitrifiers it was reported that the high cod n ratio could stimulate denitrification and thus reduce n2o emission in simultaneous nitrification anammox and denitrification processes zhang et al 2021 the cod concentration decreased rapidly in the initial 6 h and stabilized in the following 18 h and the cod n had the similar variation trends ranging from 2 64 to 8 16 fig 4b similarly a 59 0 reduction of n2o was observed in the aerated algal bacterial reactor with the presence of glucose compared to that without glucose fig 4c the organic carbon accelerated the denitrification process and thus reduced the nitrite concentration which might hinder nitrite reductase activity it was reported that the enzymatic activities of nitrite reductase were positively correlated with the amount of n2o produced yang et al 2022 the nitrifying n2o emission factors by algal bacterial consortium in this study were in the range of 0 3 1 1 fig s13 by comparing the n2o quantification with varying availability of organic carbon and oxygen it was evident that aerated and heterotrophic conditions would favor n2o emission although n2o has been demonstrated to be the major source of carbon footprint in biological nitrogen removal the relevant knowledge on n2o emission from algal bacterial consortium was rather limited our results suggested that algal bacterial consortium might play crucial roles in carbon footprint mitigation in the open pond and aeration basin mostly owing to algal nitrogen assimilation and algal photosynthetic oxygen first algal bacterial reactor resulted in 35 5 55 0 n2o reduction under autotrophic conditions compared to bacterial reactor figs 4 and s12 algal assimilation could contribute to 40 0 46 7 ammonium removal and 28 1 40 8 tn removal nitrogen assimilation by algae produced no n2o and consumed co2 that was produced by aerobic and anoxic respiration consequently to achieve the same nh4 n and tn removal performance algal bacterial consortium would reduce direct emissions of both n2o and co2 second much more n2o mitigation 81 0 93 6 by algal bacterial consortium was observed under heterotrophic conditions it has been demonstrated by this study that the addition of external cod could largely boost the nitrogen assimilation by algae figs s3 and s4 reducing the nitrogen transformation via nitrification and denitrification figs 1 and s2 and further restraining the bacterial n2o production figs 4 and s12 the residual cod concentration of the algal bacterial reactor was higher than that of the bacterial reactor at 12 h fig 4 versus fig s12 which would ensure a speedy n2o conversion to n2 during denitrification process and abolish n2o accumulation caused by insufficient carbon sources possible explanation was that the release of organic matter from dead algae cells would replenish the consumed cod during cultivation lu et al 2020 by comparing the denitrifying n2o emission factors by algal bacterial consortium 0 7 1 3 to those by bacteria 13 7 14 3 in fig s14 it was confirmed that the n2o reduction by algal bacterial consortium normalized by tn removal was even more significant third algae as a natural aeration device provided o2 through algal photosynthesis for nitrifiers to perform nitrification park et al 2011 the mutual interaction between algal cells and nitrifying bacteria might accelerate oxygen utilization via sharing metabolic matter ramanan et al 2016 in this way algal bacterial consortium were conducive to decreasing indirect carbon footprint from energy consumption photosynthetic oxygen could reduce the intensity of mechanical aeration and then partially avoid the release of gaseous n2o due to stripping this might benefit carbon reduction in the end of pipe treatment in sum our results indicated that the combination of algal metabolism with nitrification and denitrification was a promising alternative for enhanced nitrogen removal and minimized carbon emissions 4 conclusion in this study nitrogen transformation pathways and n2o reduction potential by a coupling consortium of c vulgaris and activated sludge were investigated in simulated photobioreactors open ponds and aeration basins the main conclusions are listed as follows the ammonium was completely removed at the highest rate of 7 34 mg n g mlss 1 h 1 by the algal bacterial consortium in simulated open pond with the addition of glucose as for the ammonium removal pathways in algal bacterial reactor ammonia oxidation and algal assimilation made comparable contributions under open and aerated conditions while the limited oyxgen supply the enclosed condition lessened the ammonia oxidation tn removal was primarily achieved by algal assimilation 28 1 40 8 followed by bacterial denitrification 2 9 26 5 in the algal bacterial consortium compared to activated sludge the algal bacterial consortium resulted in 35 5 55 0 n2o mitigation under autotrophic conditions and 81 0 93 6 reduction with the addition of glucose nitrogen assimilation by algae was boosted with the addition of glucose and thus largely restrained n2o production from nitrification and denitrification the synergism between algae and bacteria was conducive to an enhanced n2o reduction by denitrification declaration of competing

in recent years the occurrence of emerging organic micropollutants µps in water wastewater has drawn much attentions µps include pesticides herbicides pharmaceuticals plasticizers and may result when discharged along with wastewater effluent in significant toxicity and environmental hazards lotfi et al 2022 µps can accumulate in the environment for a long time which makes human exposed to potential health risks alsbaiee et al 2016 carpenter and helbling 2018 the conventional activated sludge process plays an irreplaceable role in wastewater treatment however it is difficult to remove µps with such activated sludge processes in traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps helbling et al 2012 hence the secondary effluent of wwtps is regarded as the main pathway through which µps enter the aquatic environment and the concentration of µps in wastewater ranges from ng l to mg l see table s1 in supplementary information si advanced oxidation processes aops are effective methods to remove µps from secondary effluent by in situ production of hydroxyl radicals oh and other highly reactive oxygen species ros singh et al 2020 ros are divided into free radicals i e oh superoxide radicals o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and molecular oxidants i e hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ozone o 3 singh et al 2019a molecular oxidants have a longer lifetime than free radicals as shown in table s2 si the role of free radicals on µps removal has already been emphasized previously but the function of molecular oxidants seems to be overlooked in fact some µps with specific structures e g double bonds aromatic rings are easily oxidized by o3 zhang et al found that h2o2 played an indispensable role in carbamazepine removal by directly reacting with the target µps or promote the generation of oh zhang et al 2022 nonthermal plasma based aops are a novel type of aops which generate a high density plasma through a high voltage discharge both free radicals and molecular oxidants can be generated in a typical plasma system by a series of physical and chemical reactions shang et al 2022 these ros including oh o2 1o2 h2o2 and o 3 can degrade µps nonthermal plasma based aops have the unique advantages of strong oxidation ability short treatment time no external chemical addition and limited secondary pollution however previous studies on µps removal by plasma mainly take advantage of the free radicals in the plasma zone which results in the loss of molecular oxidants along with the exhaust singh et al 2019b efficient use of o3 and other molecular oxidants during plasma treatment is key to enhance the plasma treatment performance the removal behavior of µps in secondary wastewater effluent by plasma based aops has rarely been studied previous studies typically focus on the use of plasma treatment to remove µps from synthetic wastewater vanraes et al 2017 vanraes et al 2015 wardenier et al 2019a wardenier et al 2019b wardenier et al 2019c however the complexity of the real wastewater composition is an important obstacle for the full scale application of plasma treatment since it reduces the effectiveness of aops for wastewater remediation a variety of inorganics organics and microorganisms may compete for oxidants and impede the removal of µps moreover current studies mostly work with plasma treatment systems operated in batch mode however the output of secondary municipal wastewater effluent is huge and batch mode is unpractical for full scale applications in order to tackle the challenges above a novel cascade reactor configuration was developed to remove µps from secondary municipal wastewater effluent operating in continuous mode it consists of a dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma reactor with a falling water film on an activated carbon textile zorflex that is connected in series with a preceding ozonation chamber the µps are firstly ozonated in the ozonation chamber and then degraded by ros in the plasma chamber compared to previous studies mainly focusing on free radicals production in nonthermal plasma based aop here the utilization of different ros was achieved in this novel cascade reactor configuration the reactor was operated in a single pass mode assuring continuous operation in view of µps removal from real wastewater the effects of operational parameters and wastewater composition on the µps removal performance were comprehensively evaluated furthermore ros generation in different water matrices was compared the economic energy cost of the entire cascade system for µps removal in secondary effluent was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 secondary wastewater and reagents the secondary effluent was collected from a wwtp in belgium and stored at 4 c before treatment it does not exceed 2 days before treatment properties of the secondary effluent used in this work are given in table 1 the concentration of naturally occurring micropollutant varied a lot due to wastewater source season weather and so on if naturally occurring micropollutants were used degradation efficiency of micropollutants after plasma treatment will be different due the changes of the initial concentration of micropollutants spiking target micropollutants with a fixed concentration in the secondary effluent is therefore a better choice furthermore the applied concentration of micropollutants enables the detection after treatment thus atrazine atz alachlor ala diuron diu primidone prd 1 7 α ethinylestradiol ee2 bisphenol a bpa and 2 n octyl 4 isothiazolin 3 one oit were selected as model µps in this study the physical chemical properties of these µps are given in tables s3 and s4 in si the selected µps were dissolved in deionized water resulting in a stock solution with individual µps at a concentration of 5 0 mg l according to table s1 the µps concentration in real secondary wastewater effluent of wwtps ranges between 0 01 μg l and 250 μg l therefore the stock solution was diluted to the desired concentration 200 μg l using secondary effluent the stock solution was diluted with ultrapure water to obtain synthetic wastewater with a μps concentration of 200 μg l 2 2 setup and experimental procedures a schematic representation of the dbd plasma reactor is shown in fig 1 detailed information about the reactor can be found in our previous work vanraes et al 2017 2015 wardenier et al 2019a 2019b 2019c in short wastewater flows through the ozonation and plasma chambers in a sequence a stainless steel tube was placed inside the quartz glass tube the stainless steel tube was used as the grounded inner electrode which was covered by 2 layers of activated carbon textile the wastewater was pumped up from the ozonation chamber through the stainless steel pipe and then flowed down the activated carbon textile plasma was generated using oxygen gas on the activated carbon textile by applying a pulsed high voltage to an outer mesh electrode covering a quartz glass tube next produced o3 and residual o2 gas mixtures were bubbled into the ozonation chamber a pulse generator model tgp110 thulby thandar instrument was used to trigger the ac high voltage power supply working at 50 khz and modulated the sinusoidal voltage waveform using a square wave function the modulated waveform was defined by a plasma on time of 5 ms t on and a plasma off time of 45 ms t off the duty cycle was defined as following 1 dc t on t on t off 10 a tektronix td 1002 digital oscilloscope was used to monitor the voltage and current waveforms using a tektronix p6015 a hv probe and an ionphysics current probe respectively the total input power p used to generate the plasma was calculated by multiplying the duty cycle with the instantaneous power delivered to the reactor p0 2 p p 0 dc the ozonation chamber was filled with 600 ml wastewater the wastewater was pumped from the ozonation chamber to the plasma chamber at a designed liquid flow from 60 to 100 ml min a falling water film was formed on the activated carbon textile zorflex the gas entered the bottom of the plasma chamber at a designed gas flow from 0 4 to 1 standard liter per minute slm finally the wastewater after treatment was sampled and analyzed the details of the analytical methods are given in section 2 5 the reactor performance was evaluated in terms of removal efficiency and energy consumption the removal efficiency of the µps r was defined as follows 3 r c 0 c t c t 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of the µps 200 µg l 1 and c t µg l 1 is the final concentration of the µps energy consumption was characterized by the electrical energy per order ee o kwh m³ figure of merit yang et al 2021 as shown in eq 4 4 ee o p f log c o c t where p kw is the total input power used to generate the plasma in the reactor which was calculated by eq 2 and f m³ h 1 is the liquid flow all experiments were performed thrice and the average value was adopted for the treatment based on ozonation alone only the ozonation chamber is used the ozonation chamber was filled with 600 ml wastewater the wastewater was only treated in the ozonation chamber and it flowed out from ozonation chamber directly and did not flow into plasma chamber the gas entered the bottom of the plasma chamber at a gas flow of 1 slm and then entered the ozonation chamber via a diffuser for the treatment based on plasma alone only the plasma chamber is used the plasma chamber was fed with 600 ml the gas entered the bottom of the plasma chamber at a gas flow of 1 slm wastewater did not enter the ozonation chamber and it passed through the plasma chamber only once 2 3 design of response surface methodology modeling the response surface methodology rsm based on the box behnken design bbd method was used to optimize the operational parameters of the reactor chys et al 2015 three independent variables included gas flow rate liquid flow rate and discharge power as shown in table 2 the discharge power is related to the generation of ros and both the gas and liquid flow rates might affect the mass transfer of ros as reported in a previous study atz as a typical recalcitrant contaminant in wastewater is difficult to remove in the plasma reactor wardenier et al 2019c its removal efficiency is lower than that of other µps such as ala diu dichlorvos pentachlorophenol carbamazepine ee2 bpa wardenier et al 2019c thus the removal efficiency and energy consumption for atz removal were selected as response factors and the effects of those operational parameters on the response factor are studied the corresponding rsm model can be found in eq 5 5 y i a b x 1 c x 2 d x 3 e x 1 x 2 f x 1 x 3 g x 2 x 3 hx 1 2 ix 2 2 jx 3 2 in which y i represents the response factor for the removal efficiency of atz yr as well as for the energy consumption of atz removal yee o kwh m³ x 1 x 2 and x 3 refer to gas flow rate slm liquid flow rate ml min 1 and discharge power w respectively multiple regression was used to estimate the coefficients a to j based on the experimental conditions and the measured results namely yr or yee o 2 4 free radical quenching experiment p benzoquinone 1 4 diazabicyclooctane and tert butanol were used as scavenger to quench the o 2 1o2 and oh respectively lou et al 2022 each scavenger was added into synthetic wastewater and the concentration of each scavenger was set at 20 mmol l 1 synthetic wastewater containing scavenger was treated through the entire cascade system at the optimal parameters the detailed experiment procedure was shown in section 2 2 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of µps was determined by an agilent gas chromatography mass spectrometry system gc ms 6890 series gc system 5973 ms adapted from previous research yang et al 2022 and a detailed procedure is outlined in text s1 si h2o2 concentrations were measured by the titaniumoxysulphate method pandiyaraj et al 2021 the indigo method was used to measure the concentration of dissolved ozone in liquid bader and hoigné 1981 o 3 dt and h 2 o 2 dt were the exposures of o 3 and h 2 o 2 and were obtained from the time integrated the concentration of o 3 and h 2 o 2 over the treatment time guo et al 2021 the details are given in text s2 si oh exposures were indirectly measured by the terephthalic acid method see text s3 si liu et al 2021 the concentrations of nitrite no2 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and chemical oxygen demand cod were determined according to standard methods using the commercial hach test kits coupling with an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr2800 hach belgium the ph and conductivity of the wastewater were measured using portable ph and conductivity meter respectively hq30d hach us the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of samples were determined by a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 5301 pc shimadzu japan the details of 3d eem measurements and data processing are given in text s4 si the ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis spectra of samples were recorded by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr2800 hach belgium in the wavelength range between 200 nm and 800 nm synergistic effect between plasma and ozonation was evaluated by the synergistic index which was calculated by the eq 6 6 synergistic index k μ ps plasma ozonation k μ ps plasma k μ ps ozonation where k μ ps plasma ozonation k μ ps plasma and k μ ps ozonation min 1 were the apparent pseudo first order reaction constants of μps degradation for plasma ozonation plasma alone ozonation alone 3 results and discussion 3 1 rsm approach and statistical analysis 3 1 1 establishment of model equations and data fitting in the first step the efficiency and energy consumption of atz removal in secondary wastewater effluent were selected as response factors to build an appropriate rsm approach the operational parameters experimental and predicted results of removal efficiency and ee o are shown in table s5 the experimental results show that the atz removal efficiency and energy consumption ranged between 90 98 and 4 0 7 0 kwh m³ respectively a good agreement between the experimental and the predicted results was achieved for both the removal efficiency yr r2 0 98 the number of datapoints included in the regression n 17 and energy consumption yee o r2 0 99 n 17 the model equations were established as follow 7 y r 88 1 1 x 1 28 x 2 4 5 x 3 0 02 x 1 x 2 0 3 x 1 x 3 0 3 x 2 x 3 0 2 x 1 2 1 1 x 2 2 1 6 x 3 2 8 y ee o 12 0 1 x 1 4 3 x 2 5 2 x 3 0 02 x 1 x 2 0 006 x 1 x 3 0 0006 x 2 x 3 0 02 x 1 2 0 6 x 2 2 1 2 x 3 2 the model for atz removal efficiency and energy consumption the coefficients corresponding to the gas flow x1 liquid flow x2 and discharge power x3 are statistically significant p 0 05 see table s6 si the absolute values of the coefficients represent how significantly the different operational parameters affect the atz removal efficiency and energy consumption the significance sequence of each factor is discharge power c liquid flow rate b gas flow rate a 3 1 2 influence of operational parameters on efficiency and energy consumption of atrazine removal surface plots of rsm in terms of the removal efficiency and energy consumption are shown for atz at different operational parameters in figs s1 and s2 as run 5 and 8 indicated table s5 the removal efficiency increased by 6 but the energy consumption increased by 28 when the discharge power increased from 25 w to 45 w the increase of input power achieved by an increase of the applied voltage can increase the electric field in the reactor and facilitate the dissociation ionization and excitation of the feed gas kim et al 2013 thereby generating more ros sun et al 1997 as such a higher µps removal efficiency can be obtained at higher input power conditions but the energy consumption increases as well from an economical point of view a lower input power is beneficial for the commercial application of the plasma reactor according to the requirements of the swiss water protection act the removal efficiency of µps was recommended not less than 80 bourgin et al 2018 when the discharge power was 25 w the removal efficiency of µps was higher than 85 and the energy consumption was merely 4 0 kwh m³ indicating the high removal efficiency and energy efficient properties of the plasma reactor as such in this context the optimal discharge power can be determined as 25 w when the liquid flow rate increased from 60 to 100 ml min 1 the removal efficiency and energy consumption reduced by 5 and 33 respectively see run 10 and 12 in table s5 indeed the removal efficiency of µps decreased with the increase of liquid flow rate because the residence time of the ros in the ozonation and plasma chamber is shortened at faster liquid flow rates in other words a higher liquid flow rate shortens the reaction time of ros and µps the energy consumption reduces as the liquid flow increases which is in agreement with our previous studies wardenier et al 2019c for energy consumption the optimum liquid flow rate was found to be 100 ml min 1 as indicated in fig s1 when the gas flow rate increased from 0 4 to 0 8 slm the removal efficiency was reduced slightly this phenomenon can be caused by the complex interactions between the gas flow and the generation of plasma ros an excessive gas flow rate reduces the contact time between gas molecules and also affects the transfer of ros from gas to liquid phase which is not conducive to the degradation of μps aggelopoulos et al 2020 in addition an excessively large gas flow rate can greatly shorten the residence time of the ros in the ozonation chamber which reduces the utilization rate of ros a higher gas flow rate also causes a sharp increase in the consumption of feed gas and increases the operational costs therefore for removal efficiency and energy consumption 0 4 slm was defined as the optimum gas flow rate 3 2 removal of micropollutants at optimal conditions 3 2 1 micropollutants both secondary effluent and synthetic wastewater containing seven µps diu oit atz ala bpa ee2 and prd were treated at the optimized operational conditions as shown in fig 2 a b the removal efficiencies of the seven µps were all over 85 and they were ranked as bpa ee2 oit diu atz ala prd the energy consumption in case of secondary effluent is between 2 4 kw m³ and 5 3 kw m³ whereas the energy consumption for synthetic wastewater is between 2 3 kw m³ and 4 8 kw m³ it should be noted that there is no significant difference for energy consumption in between synthetic wastewater and real wastewater in this study it indicates that this reactor can overcome the negative influences brought by a complex water matrix composition well compared to nonthermal plasma based aops in previous literatures in table 3 the plasma reactor used in this study performs very well in terms of removal efficiency and energy consumption this is attributed to the improved utilization of ros in this reactor compare to previous plasma reactor molecular oxidants degraded µps again in an ozonation chamber in this novel cascade reactor configuration thus higher removal efficiency and lower energy consumption were achieved 3 2 2 contribution of plasma and ozonation secondary effluent containing micropollutants was treated by plasma chamber and ozonation chamber respectively the contribution of plasma and ozonation chamber on the degradation of µps was evaluated the degradation efficiencies of µps after treatment with plasma ozonation were about 30 50 higher than that of treated by plasma alone or ozonation alone the presence of ozonation chamber promoted the degradation efficiency of µps and reduced the energy consumption because the utilization of ros in entire cascade system is enhanced the degradation kinetics of bpa treated by plasma ozonation plasma alone and ozonation alone were shown in fig s5 the synergistic index of bpa degradation between plasma and ozonation was 3 43 as such a strong synergistic effect on the degradation of μps was noticed in addition the degradation efficiencies of ee2 bpa oit treated by plasma alone were about 15 25 lower than that treated by ozonation alone see fig 3 it indicates that the degradation of ee2 bpa oit depends on the oxidation of o3 liu et al found that those µps were easily degraded by o3 as their double bonds and aromatic rings were destroyed liu et al 2020 the degradation efficiencies of diu atz and ala were not significantly different after treatment with ozonation alone and plasma alone previous works shown that the reaction constants between o3 and diu atz ala were small and the degradation of diu atz and ala was closely related to the act of free radicals meephon et al 2019 plaza et al 2021 the degradation of diu atz and ala in ozonation chamber was attributed to the free radicals generated by the decomposition of molecular oxidants 3 2 3 inorganic nitrogen the changes of some common water quality parameters of real wastewater including concentrations of ph conductivity nitrite nitrate and ammonium were measured as well the ph value of the secondary effluent varied between 6 99 and 7 10 after treatment with little change the conductivity was reduced from 629 μs cm to 605 μs cm after treatment this may be related to the decrease of nitrite nitrate and ammonium concentration the removal efficiencies of nitrite nitrate and ammonium at the optimized operational conditions were 90 5 4 2 69 6 5 5 and 40 0 7 7 respectively nitrite and nitrate react with oh h2o2 and o 3 as shown in eqs r1 r4 bradu et al 2020 lukes et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 due to the generation of solvated electrons nitrite and nitrate may be reduced and then n2 can be produced ammonium can react with oh and o 3 and then n2 nitrite and nitrate can be generated as shown in eqs r5 r8 wu et al 2020 normally tertiary inorganic nitrogen removal from the secondary effluent can be accomplished by biological methods adsorption or ion exchange amini et al 2018 liu et al 2019a yi et al 2020 nonthermal plasma based aops can degrade µps in wastewater while removing inorganic nitrogen at the same time without additional chemicals or technology the results obtained in this work open a window to remove inorganic nitrogen from secondary effluent r1 2 no 2 h h 2 o 2 onooh h 2 o r2 no 2 o 3 no 3 o 2 r3 no 2 oh n o 2 o h r4 no 3 oh n o 3 o h r5 nh 4 3 oh 0 5 n 2 h 3 h 2 o r6 nh 4 3 oh 0 5 n o 2 3 h 2 h 2 o r7 nh 4 3 oh 0 5 n o 3 2 h 1 5 h 2 o r8 nh 4 o 3 0 5 n 2 h 1 5 h 2 o 3 2 4 bulk organic matter the secondary effluent contains a large amount of high molecular weight organic pollutants these complex mixtures usually consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances such as proteins humic acids and fulvic acids they can be degraded to lower molecular weight compounds by ros the total dissolved solids tds were reduced from 570 mg l to 550 mg l this can be attributed to the removal of organic matters the removal efficiency of cod at the optimized operational conditions was 11 4 3 6 kim et al found that improving the carbon mineralization efficiency is much more difficult than enhancing target µps removal efficiency during nonthermal plasma based aops kim et al 2013 in case mineralization would be required the addition of catalysts or combining plasma with other aops should be investigated the changes of high molecular weight organic pollutants after treatment with the plasma reactor were analyzed using 3d eem and uv vis spectra fig 4 three peaks a b c peak in the 3d eem spectra were observed in the original real wastewater representing proteins fulvic acids and humic acids respectively chen et al 2021 all peaks in the real wastewater after plasma treatment disappeared it indicates that proteins humic and fulvic acids were removed ultraviolet absorbance is an important indicator for organic pollutants in secondary effluent various compounds containing aromatic hydrocarbons and conjugated systems of double bonds or hydroxyl groups are the main organic pollutants in secondary effluent accounting for 40 to 60 of dissolved organic carbon anumol et al 2015 these organic pollutants have strong absorption peaks at the ultraviolet wavelength of 254 nm anumol et al 2015 the absorbance at 254 nm uv254 of secondary effluent after plasma treatment was reduced by 48 the reduction of absorbance indicates that the organic pollutants were degraded 3 3 the removal mechanisms of micropollutants 3 3 1 generation of reactive oxidative species the generation of ros e g h2o2 o 3 and oh was investigated in different types of water over a period of 10 min the exposures of all investigated ros were higher in ultrapure water than in synthetic wastewater and real wastewater fig 5 indicating that ros are consumed due to the presence of µps and the co existent inorganic and organic matter in the secondary effluent therefore compared with other water matrices the exposures of ros in secondary effluent were the lowest for each water matrix the exposures of oh generated by the plasma were the lowest followed by o 3 and h2o2 taking the ros in ultrapure water as an example the maximum exposures of oh o 3 and h2o2 were 2 93 10 11 0 07 and 0 28 m s respectively in general h2o2 does not directly participate in the degradation of µps but indirectly reacts with µps by generating free radicals aggelopoulos et al 2020 as shown in eqs r9 and r10 an important source of oh is the reaction between o 3 and h2o2 thus the contents of h2o2 and o 3 in all water matrices reduced with time whereas the contents of oh increased with time the reaction rates of various micropollutants with oh and o 3 are shown in table s4 the reaction rates and concentration of oh are larger than those of o 3 therefore oh will play a more important role in removing µps r9 h 2 o 2 o 3 oh h o 2 o 2 r10 h 2 o 2 2 o 3 3 o 2 2 oh 3 3 2 role of various radicals in nonthermal plasma based aops various strong oxidizing radicals can be produced in large quantities and the production of these radicals oh o2 1o2 will have an impact on the removal of µps in order to study the role of various radicals in the removal of µps during plasma treatment radical trapping experiments were conducted by adding scavengers to synthetic wastewater fig 6 the removal of µps was inhibited because of the addition of scavengers e g p benzoquinone 1 4 diazabicyclooctane and tert butanol but the effects of them on each µp were different more than 95 of ee2 was removed even in the presence of scavengers the absence of free radicals did not have a large impact on ee2 removal when o2 and 1o2 were quenched the removal efficiency of bpa was reduced by 40 55 as such it can be seen that o2 and 1o2 are important oxidizing radicals rather than oh for the removal of bpa which is in line with previous work yang et al 2018 the removal efficiency of oit decreased from 98 7 0 4 to 71 3 2 6 in the absence of o2 the removal efficiency of oit did not reduce much without 1o2 and oh the removal efficiency of diu dropped by 30 40 after scavenging o2 and oh o2 and oh are responsible to degrade the diu as also demonstrated by meephon et al 2019 three kinds of free radicals have effect on the removal of atz among which oh has the most significant effect plaza et al found that oh played a vital role to degrade atz and its alkylic oxidation plaza et al 2021 the removal efficiency of ala and prd reduced by about 35 40 in the absence of o2 and oh while the effect of 1o2 on their removal was not significant the oxidation pathway of ala in a plasma reactor was studied by bolobajev et al 2021 they confirmed that the removal of ala starts with the attack of oh and includes dehalogenation electrophilic attack of the aromatic ring ether bond cleavage and cyclisation liu et al assessed the contribution of ros in the photochemical catalysis of prd and found that oh play the most critical role in prd removal liu et al 2019b this is because active sites in the prd molecular structure that are easily fractured by oh are mainly aromatic rings and methylene groups between two nitrogen atoms the investigation reveals that the role of ros in the removal of µps in plasma are type specific but the co existence of various efficient ros in controlled plasmas can provide a possible fit for all solution for µps removal from wastewater 3 3 3 effect of co existent inorganic and organic matter nitrate no 3 ammonium nh 4 nitrite no 2 carbonate co 3 and humic acids ha are typically present in secondary effluent these inorganic and organic components were spiked in the synthetic wastewater and their effects on the µps removal efficiency was investigated the five co existent components had no obvious reducing effect on the removal of bpa and ee2 even at a quite high concentration the removal efficiency of bpa and ee2 was more than 92 fig 7 ha and no 2 had a more remarkable reducing effect on the degradation of diu oit atz and ala than other ions ha is a ubiquitous natural organic matter found in most groundwater surface water and wastewater ha competes with µps for reaction with ros and therefore interferes with the removal of µps so µps decomposition is significantly reduced at constant energy input h 2 o 2 o 3 oh and other ros that played a crucial role in the removal of µps were rapidly consumed by no 2 bradu et al 2020 lukes et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 fortunately no 2 concentration in the secondary effluent is generally less than 1 mg l table 1 prd was difficult to remove in the plasma reactor and the five co existent components had a significant inhibitory effect on its removal efficiency as it dropped by about 20 30 no 3 and co 3 are scavengers of radicals and can react with oh fan et al 2021 fan et al found that nh 4 reacts with oh and 1o2 through which n2 no 3 and no 2 may be generated fan et al 2021 finally the removal efficiency was thus reduced and extra energy input may be required due to the complex matrix compositions 4 conclusions in this study a dbd plasma reactor with a falling water film on an activated carbon textile zorflex preceded by an ozonation chamber connected in series was used to treat secondary effluent containing seven µps atz ala prd diu oit and bpa compare with previous plasma reactor the two chambers in this cascade system enabled full scale utilization of both free radicals and molecular oxidants produced by highly reactive plasmas the degradation efficiencies of µps after treatment with entire cascade system were about 30 50 higher than that of treated by plasma alone or ozonation alone at the optimized operational conditions the energy consumption of real wastewater treatment was between 2 4 kw m³ and 5 3 kw m³ while that of synthetic wastewater was between 2 3 kw m³ and 4 8 kw m³ furthermore this study also shows that plasma can not only degrade µps but also nitrite nitrate ammonium and cod in secondary effluent the exposures of oh generated by the plasma were the lowest followed by o 3 and h2o2 the removal of diu oit and bpa were mainly affected by o2 and the removal of atz ala and prd were closely related to the oh the results of this study provide useful information for developing effective technologies to treat real wastewater which is helpful in the control and remediation of µps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14894,emerging micropollutants µps appearing in water bodies endanger aquatic animals plants microorganisms and humans the nonthermal plasma based advanced oxidation process is a promising technology for eliminating µps in wastewater but still needs further development in view of full scale industrial application a novel cascade reactor design which consists of an ozonation chamber preceding a dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma reactor with a falling water film on an activated carbon textile zorflex was used to remove a selection of µps from secondary municipal wastewater effluent compare to previous plasma reactor molecular oxidants degraded micropollutants again in an ozonation chamber in this study and the utilization of different reactive oxygen species ros was improved a gas flow rate of 0 4 standard liter per minute slm a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 and a discharge power of 25 w are identified as the optimal plasma reactor parameters and the µp degradation efficiency and electrical energy per order value ee o are 84 98 and 2 4 5 3 kw m³ respectively the presence of ros during plasma treatment was determined in view of the µps removal mechanisms the degradation of diuron diu bisphenol a bpa and 2 n octyl 4 isothiazolin 3 one oit was mainly performed in ozonation chamber while the degradation of atrazine atz alachlor ala and primidone prd occurred in entire cascade system the ros not only degrade the µps but also remove nitrite 90 5 nitrate 69 6 ammonium 39 6 and bulk organics 11 4 this study provides insights and optimal settings for an energy

keywords advanced oxidation processes micropollutants nonthermal plasma wastewater treatment reactive oxygen species data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in recent years the occurrence of emerging organic micropollutants µps in water wastewater has drawn much attentions µps include pesticides herbicides pharmaceuticals plasticizers and may result when discharged along with wastewater effluent in significant toxicity and environmental hazards lotfi et al 2022 µps can accumulate in the environment for a long time which makes human exposed to potential health risks alsbaiee et al 2016 carpenter and helbling 2018 the conventional activated sludge process plays an irreplaceable role in wastewater treatment however it is difficult to remove µps with such activated sludge processes in traditional wastewater treatment plants wwtps helbling et al 2012 hence the secondary effluent of wwtps is regarded as the main pathway through which µps enter the aquatic environment and the concentration of µps in wastewater ranges from ng l to mg l see table s1 in supplementary information si advanced oxidation processes aops are effective methods to remove µps from secondary effluent by in situ production of hydroxyl radicals oh and other highly reactive oxygen species ros singh et al 2020 ros are divided into free radicals i e oh superoxide radicals o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and molecular oxidants i e hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ozone o 3 singh et al 2019a molecular oxidants have a longer lifetime than free radicals as shown in table s2 si the role of free radicals on µps removal has already been emphasized previously but the function of molecular oxidants seems to be overlooked in fact some µps with specific structures e g double bonds aromatic rings are easily oxidized by o3 zhang et al found that h2o2 played an indispensable role in carbamazepine removal by directly reacting with the target µps or promote the generation of oh zhang et al 2022 nonthermal plasma based aops are a novel type of aops which generate a high density plasma through a high voltage discharge both free radicals and molecular oxidants can be generated in a typical plasma system by a series of physical and chemical reactions shang et al 2022 these ros including oh o2 1o2 h2o2 and o 3 can degrade µps nonthermal plasma based aops have the unique advantages of strong oxidation ability short treatment time no external chemical addition and limited secondary pollution however previous studies on µps removal by plasma mainly take advantage of the free radicals in the plasma zone which results in the loss of molecular oxidants along with the exhaust singh et al 2019b efficient use of o3 and other molecular oxidants during plasma treatment is key to enhance the plasma treatment performance the removal behavior of µps in secondary wastewater effluent by plasma based aops has rarely been studied previous studies typically focus on the use of plasma treatment to remove µps from synthetic wastewater vanraes et al 2017 vanraes et al 2015 wardenier et al 2019a wardenier et al 2019b wardenier et al 2019c however the complexity of the real wastewater composition is an important obstacle for the full scale application of plasma treatment since it reduces the effectiveness of aops for wastewater remediation a variety of inorganics organics and microorganisms may compete for oxidants and impede the removal of µps moreover current studies mostly work with plasma treatment systems operated in batch mode however the output of secondary municipal wastewater effluent is huge and batch mode is unpractical for full scale applications in order to tackle the challenges above a novel cascade reactor configuration was developed to remove µps from secondary municipal wastewater effluent operating in continuous mode it consists of a dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma reactor with a falling water film on an activated carbon textile zorflex that is connected in series with a preceding ozonation chamber the µps are firstly ozonated in the ozonation chamber and then degraded by ros in the plasma chamber compared to previous studies mainly focusing on free radicals production in nonthermal plasma based aop here the utilization of different ros was achieved in this novel cascade reactor configuration the reactor was operated in a single pass mode assuring continuous operation in view of µps removal from real wastewater the effects of operational parameters and wastewater composition on the µps removal performance were comprehensively evaluated furthermore ros generation in different water matrices was compared the economic energy cost of the entire cascade system for µps removal in secondary effluent was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 secondary wastewater and reagents the secondary effluent was collected from a wwtp in belgium and stored at 4 c before treatment it does not exceed 2 days before treatment properties of the secondary effluent used in this work are given in table 1 the concentration of naturally occurring micropollutant varied a lot due to wastewater source season weather and so on if naturally occurring micropollutants were used degradation efficiency of micropollutants after plasma treatment will be different due the changes of the initial concentration of micropollutants spiking target micropollutants with a fixed concentration in the secondary effluent is therefore a better choice furthermore the applied concentration of micropollutants enables the detection after treatment thus atrazine atz alachlor ala diuron diu primidone prd 1 7 α ethinylestradiol ee2 bisphenol a bpa and 2 n octyl 4 isothiazolin 3 one oit were selected as model µps in this study the physical chemical properties of these µps are given in tables s3 and s4 in si the selected µps were dissolved in deionized water resulting in a stock solution with individual µps at a concentration of 5 0 mg l according to table s1 the µps concentration in real secondary wastewater effluent of wwtps ranges between 0 01 μg l and 250 μg l therefore the stock solution was diluted to the desired concentration 200 μg l using secondary effluent the stock solution was diluted with ultrapure water to obtain synthetic wastewater with a μps concentration of 200 μg l 2 2 setup and experimental procedures a schematic representation of the dbd plasma reactor is shown in fig 1 detailed information about the reactor can be found in our previous work vanraes et al 2017 2015 wardenier et al 2019a 2019b 2019c in short wastewater flows through the ozonation and plasma chambers in a sequence a stainless steel tube was placed inside the quartz glass tube the stainless steel tube was used as the grounded inner electrode which was covered by 2 layers of activated carbon textile the wastewater was pumped up from the ozonation chamber through the stainless steel pipe and then flowed down the activated carbon textile plasma was generated using oxygen gas on the activated carbon textile by applying a pulsed high voltage to an outer mesh electrode covering a quartz glass tube next produced o3 and residual o2 gas mixtures were bubbled into the ozonation chamber a pulse generator model tgp110 thulby thandar instrument was used to trigger the ac high voltage power supply working at 50 khz and modulated the sinusoidal voltage waveform using a square wave function the modulated waveform was defined by a plasma on time of 5 ms t on and a plasma off time of 45 ms t off the duty cycle was defined as following 1 dc t on t on t off 10 a tektronix td 1002 digital oscilloscope was used to monitor the voltage and current waveforms using a tektronix p6015 a hv probe and an ionphysics current probe respectively the total input power p used to generate the plasma was calculated by multiplying the duty cycle with the instantaneous power delivered to the reactor p0 2 p p 0 dc the ozonation chamber was filled with 600 ml wastewater the wastewater was pumped from the ozonation chamber to the plasma chamber at a designed liquid flow from 60 to 100 ml min a falling water film was formed on the activated carbon textile zorflex the gas entered the bottom of the plasma chamber at a designed gas flow from 0 4 to 1 standard liter per minute slm finally the wastewater after treatment was sampled and analyzed the details of the analytical methods are given in section 2 5 the reactor performance was evaluated in terms of removal efficiency and energy consumption the removal efficiency of the µps r was defined as follows 3 r c 0 c t c t 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration of the µps 200 µg l 1 and c t µg l 1 is the final concentration of the µps energy consumption was characterized by the electrical energy per order ee o kwh m³ figure of merit yang et al 2021 as shown in eq 4 4 ee o p f log c o c t where p kw is the total input power used to generate the plasma in the reactor which was calculated by eq 2 and f m³ h 1 is the liquid flow all experiments were performed thrice and the average value was adopted for the treatment based on ozonation alone only the ozonation chamber is used the ozonation chamber was filled with 600 ml wastewater the wastewater was only treated in the ozonation chamber and it flowed out from ozonation chamber directly and did not flow into plasma chamber the gas entered the bottom of the plasma chamber at a gas flow of 1 slm and then entered the ozonation chamber via a diffuser for the treatment based on plasma alone only the plasma chamber is used the plasma chamber was fed with 600 ml the gas entered the bottom of the plasma chamber at a gas flow of 1 slm wastewater did not enter the ozonation chamber and it passed through the plasma chamber only once 2 3 design of response surface methodology modeling the response surface methodology rsm based on the box behnken design bbd method was used to optimize the operational parameters of the reactor chys et al 2015 three independent variables included gas flow rate liquid flow rate and discharge power as shown in table 2 the discharge power is related to the generation of ros and both the gas and liquid flow rates might affect the mass transfer of ros as reported in a previous study atz as a typical recalcitrant contaminant in wastewater is difficult to remove in the plasma reactor wardenier et al 2019c its removal efficiency is lower than that of other µps such as ala diu dichlorvos pentachlorophenol carbamazepine ee2 bpa wardenier et al 2019c thus the removal efficiency and energy consumption for atz removal were selected as response factors and the effects of those operational parameters on the response factor are studied the corresponding rsm model can be found in eq 5 5 y i a b x 1 c x 2 d x 3 e x 1 x 2 f x 1 x 3 g x 2 x 3 hx 1 2 ix 2 2 jx 3 2 in which y i represents the response factor for the removal efficiency of atz yr as well as for the energy consumption of atz removal yee o kwh m³ x 1 x 2 and x 3 refer to gas flow rate slm liquid flow rate ml min 1 and discharge power w respectively multiple regression was used to estimate the coefficients a to j based on the experimental conditions and the measured results namely yr or yee o 2 4 free radical quenching experiment p benzoquinone 1 4 diazabicyclooctane and tert butanol were used as scavenger to quench the o 2 1o2 and oh respectively lou et al 2022 each scavenger was added into synthetic wastewater and the concentration of each scavenger was set at 20 mmol l 1 synthetic wastewater containing scavenger was treated through the entire cascade system at the optimal parameters the detailed experiment procedure was shown in section 2 2 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of µps was determined by an agilent gas chromatography mass spectrometry system gc ms 6890 series gc system 5973 ms adapted from previous research yang et al 2022 and a detailed procedure is outlined in text s1 si h2o2 concentrations were measured by the titaniumoxysulphate method pandiyaraj et al 2021 the indigo method was used to measure the concentration of dissolved ozone in liquid bader and hoigné 1981 o 3 dt and h 2 o 2 dt were the exposures of o 3 and h 2 o 2 and were obtained from the time integrated the concentration of o 3 and h 2 o 2 over the treatment time guo et al 2021 the details are given in text s2 si oh exposures were indirectly measured by the terephthalic acid method see text s3 si liu et al 2021 the concentrations of nitrite no2 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and chemical oxygen demand cod were determined according to standard methods using the commercial hach test kits coupling with an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr2800 hach belgium the ph and conductivity of the wastewater were measured using portable ph and conductivity meter respectively hq30d hach us the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of samples were determined by a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 5301 pc shimadzu japan the details of 3d eem measurements and data processing are given in text s4 si the ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis spectra of samples were recorded by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr2800 hach belgium in the wavelength range between 200 nm and 800 nm synergistic effect between plasma and ozonation was evaluated by the synergistic index which was calculated by the eq 6 6 synergistic index k μ ps plasma ozonation k μ ps plasma k μ ps ozonation where k μ ps plasma ozonation k μ ps plasma and k μ ps ozonation min 1 were the apparent pseudo first order reaction constants of μps degradation for plasma ozonation plasma alone ozonation alone 3 results and discussion 3 1 rsm approach and statistical analysis 3 1 1 establishment of model equations and data fitting in the first step the efficiency and energy consumption of atz removal in secondary wastewater effluent were selected as response factors to build an appropriate rsm approach the operational parameters experimental and predicted results of removal efficiency and ee o are shown in table s5 the experimental results show that the atz removal efficiency and energy consumption ranged between 90 98 and 4 0 7 0 kwh m³ respectively a good agreement between the experimental and the predicted results was achieved for both the removal efficiency yr r2 0 98 the number of datapoints included in the regression n 17 and energy consumption yee o r2 0 99 n 17 the model equations were established as follow 7 y r 88 1 1 x 1 28 x 2 4 5 x 3 0 02 x 1 x 2 0 3 x 1 x 3 0 3 x 2 x 3 0 2 x 1 2 1 1 x 2 2 1 6 x 3 2 8 y ee o 12 0 1 x 1 4 3 x 2 5 2 x 3 0 02 x 1 x 2 0 006 x 1 x 3 0 0006 x 2 x 3 0 02 x 1 2 0 6 x 2 2 1 2 x 3 2 the model for atz removal efficiency and energy consumption the coefficients corresponding to the gas flow x1 liquid flow x2 and discharge power x3 are statistically significant p 0 05 see table s6 si the absolute values of the coefficients represent how significantly the different operational parameters affect the atz removal efficiency and energy consumption the significance sequence of each factor is discharge power c liquid flow rate b gas flow rate a 3 1 2 influence of operational parameters on efficiency and energy consumption of atrazine removal surface plots of rsm in terms of the removal efficiency and energy consumption are shown for atz at different operational parameters in figs s1 and s2 as run 5 and 8 indicated table s5 the removal efficiency increased by 6 but the energy consumption increased by 28 when the discharge power increased from 25 w to 45 w the increase of input power achieved by an increase of the applied voltage can increase the electric field in the reactor and facilitate the dissociation ionization and excitation of the feed gas kim et al 2013 thereby generating more ros sun et al 1997 as such a higher µps removal efficiency can be obtained at higher input power conditions but the energy consumption increases as well from an economical point of view a lower input power is beneficial for the commercial application of the plasma reactor according to the requirements of the swiss water protection act the removal efficiency of µps was recommended not less than 80 bourgin et al 2018 when the discharge power was 25 w the removal efficiency of µps was higher than 85 and the energy consumption was merely 4 0 kwh m³ indicating the high removal efficiency and energy efficient properties of the plasma reactor as such in this context the optimal discharge power can be determined as 25 w when the liquid flow rate increased from 60 to 100 ml min 1 the removal efficiency and energy consumption reduced by 5 and 33 respectively see run 10 and 12 in table s5 indeed the removal efficiency of µps decreased with the increase of liquid flow rate because the residence time of the ros in the ozonation and plasma chamber is shortened at faster liquid flow rates in other words a higher liquid flow rate shortens the reaction time of ros and µps the energy consumption reduces as the liquid flow increases which is in agreement with our previous studies wardenier et al 2019c for energy consumption the optimum liquid flow rate was found to be 100 ml min 1 as indicated in fig s1 when the gas flow rate increased from 0 4 to 0 8 slm the removal efficiency was reduced slightly this phenomenon can be caused by the complex interactions between the gas flow and the generation of plasma ros an excessive gas flow rate reduces the contact time between gas molecules and also affects the transfer of ros from gas to liquid phase which is not conducive to the degradation of μps aggelopoulos et al 2020 in addition an excessively large gas flow rate can greatly shorten the residence time of the ros in the ozonation chamber which reduces the utilization rate of ros a higher gas flow rate also causes a sharp increase in the consumption of feed gas and increases the operational costs therefore for removal efficiency and energy consumption 0 4 slm was defined as the optimum gas flow rate 3 2 removal of micropollutants at optimal conditions 3 2 1 micropollutants both secondary effluent and synthetic wastewater containing seven µps diu oit atz ala bpa ee2 and prd were treated at the optimized operational conditions as shown in fig 2 a b the removal efficiencies of the seven µps were all over 85 and they were ranked as bpa ee2 oit diu atz ala prd the energy consumption in case of secondary effluent is between 2 4 kw m³ and 5 3 kw m³ whereas the energy consumption for synthetic wastewater is between 2 3 kw m³ and 4 8 kw m³ it should be noted that there is no significant difference for energy consumption in between synthetic wastewater and real wastewater in this study it indicates that this reactor can overcome the negative influences brought by a complex water matrix composition well compared to nonthermal plasma based aops in previous literatures in table 3 the plasma reactor used in this study performs very well in terms of removal efficiency and energy consumption this is attributed to the improved utilization of ros in this reactor compare to previous plasma reactor molecular oxidants degraded µps again in an ozonation chamber in this novel cascade reactor configuration thus higher removal efficiency and lower energy consumption were achieved 3 2 2 contribution of plasma and ozonation secondary effluent containing micropollutants was treated by plasma chamber and ozonation chamber respectively the contribution of plasma and ozonation chamber on the degradation of µps was evaluated the degradation efficiencies of µps after treatment with plasma ozonation were about 30 50 higher than that of treated by plasma alone or ozonation alone the presence of ozonation chamber promoted the degradation efficiency of µps and reduced the energy consumption because the utilization of ros in entire cascade system is enhanced the degradation kinetics of bpa treated by plasma ozonation plasma alone and ozonation alone were shown in fig s5 the synergistic index of bpa degradation between plasma and ozonation was 3 43 as such a strong synergistic effect on the degradation of μps was noticed in addition the degradation efficiencies of ee2 bpa oit treated by plasma alone were about 15 25 lower than that treated by ozonation alone see fig 3 it indicates that the degradation of ee2 bpa oit depends on the oxidation of o3 liu et al found that those µps were easily degraded by o3 as their double bonds and aromatic rings were destroyed liu et al 2020 the degradation efficiencies of diu atz and ala were not significantly different after treatment with ozonation alone and plasma alone previous works shown that the reaction constants between o3 and diu atz ala were small and the degradation of diu atz and ala was closely related to the act of free radicals meephon et al 2019 plaza et al 2021 the degradation of diu atz and ala in ozonation chamber was attributed to the free radicals generated by the decomposition of molecular oxidants 3 2 3 inorganic nitrogen the changes of some common water quality parameters of real wastewater including concentrations of ph conductivity nitrite nitrate and ammonium were measured as well the ph value of the secondary effluent varied between 6 99 and 7 10 after treatment with little change the conductivity was reduced from 629 μs cm to 605 μs cm after treatment this may be related to the decrease of nitrite nitrate and ammonium concentration the removal efficiencies of nitrite nitrate and ammonium at the optimized operational conditions were 90 5 4 2 69 6 5 5 and 40 0 7 7 respectively nitrite and nitrate react with oh h2o2 and o 3 as shown in eqs r1 r4 bradu et al 2020 lukes et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 due to the generation of solvated electrons nitrite and nitrate may be reduced and then n2 can be produced ammonium can react with oh and o 3 and then n2 nitrite and nitrate can be generated as shown in eqs r5 r8 wu et al 2020 normally tertiary inorganic nitrogen removal from the secondary effluent can be accomplished by biological methods adsorption or ion exchange amini et al 2018 liu et al 2019a yi et al 2020 nonthermal plasma based aops can degrade µps in wastewater while removing inorganic nitrogen at the same time without additional chemicals or technology the results obtained in this work open a window to remove inorganic nitrogen from secondary effluent r1 2 no 2 h h 2 o 2 onooh h 2 o r2 no 2 o 3 no 3 o 2 r3 no 2 oh n o 2 o h r4 no 3 oh n o 3 o h r5 nh 4 3 oh 0 5 n 2 h 3 h 2 o r6 nh 4 3 oh 0 5 n o 2 3 h 2 h 2 o r7 nh 4 3 oh 0 5 n o 3 2 h 1 5 h 2 o r8 nh 4 o 3 0 5 n 2 h 1 5 h 2 o 3 2 4 bulk organic matter the secondary effluent contains a large amount of high molecular weight organic pollutants these complex mixtures usually consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances such as proteins humic acids and fulvic acids they can be degraded to lower molecular weight compounds by ros the total dissolved solids tds were reduced from 570 mg l to 550 mg l this can be attributed to the removal of organic matters the removal efficiency of cod at the optimized operational conditions was 11 4 3 6 kim et al found that improving the carbon mineralization efficiency is much more difficult than enhancing target µps removal efficiency during nonthermal plasma based aops kim et al 2013 in case mineralization would be required the addition of catalysts or combining plasma with other aops should be investigated the changes of high molecular weight organic pollutants after treatment with the plasma reactor were analyzed using 3d eem and uv vis spectra fig 4 three peaks a b c peak in the 3d eem spectra were observed in the original real wastewater representing proteins fulvic acids and humic acids respectively chen et al 2021 all peaks in the real wastewater after plasma treatment disappeared it indicates that proteins humic and fulvic acids were removed ultraviolet absorbance is an important indicator for organic pollutants in secondary effluent various compounds containing aromatic hydrocarbons and conjugated systems of double bonds or hydroxyl groups are the main organic pollutants in secondary effluent accounting for 40 to 60 of dissolved organic carbon anumol et al 2015 these organic pollutants have strong absorption peaks at the ultraviolet wavelength of 254 nm anumol et al 2015 the absorbance at 254 nm uv254 of secondary effluent after plasma treatment was reduced by 48 the reduction of absorbance indicates that the organic pollutants were degraded 3 3 the removal mechanisms of micropollutants 3 3 1 generation of reactive oxidative species the generation of ros e g h2o2 o 3 and oh was investigated in different types of water over a period of 10 min the exposures of all investigated ros were higher in ultrapure water than in synthetic wastewater and real wastewater fig 5 indicating that ros are consumed due to the presence of µps and the co existent inorganic and organic matter in the secondary effluent therefore compared with other water matrices the exposures of ros in secondary effluent were the lowest for each water matrix the exposures of oh generated by the plasma were the lowest followed by o 3 and h2o2 taking the ros in ultrapure water as an example the maximum exposures of oh o 3 and h2o2 were 2 93 10 11 0 07 and 0 28 m s respectively in general h2o2 does not directly participate in the degradation of µps but indirectly reacts with µps by generating free radicals aggelopoulos et al 2020 as shown in eqs r9 and r10 an important source of oh is the reaction between o 3 and h2o2 thus the contents of h2o2 and o 3 in all water matrices reduced with time whereas the contents of oh increased with time the reaction rates of various micropollutants with oh and o 3 are shown in table s4 the reaction rates and concentration of oh are larger than those of o 3 therefore oh will play a more important role in removing µps r9 h 2 o 2 o 3 oh h o 2 o 2 r10 h 2 o 2 2 o 3 3 o 2 2 oh 3 3 2 role of various radicals in nonthermal plasma based aops various strong oxidizing radicals can be produced in large quantities and the production of these radicals oh o2 1o2 will have an impact on the removal of µps in order to study the role of various radicals in the removal of µps during plasma treatment radical trapping experiments were conducted by adding scavengers to synthetic wastewater fig 6 the removal of µps was inhibited because of the addition of scavengers e g p benzoquinone 1 4 diazabicyclooctane and tert butanol but the effects of them on each µp were different more than 95 of ee2 was removed even in the presence of scavengers the absence of free radicals did not have a large impact on ee2 removal when o2 and 1o2 were quenched the removal efficiency of bpa was reduced by 40 55 as such it can be seen that o2 and 1o2 are important oxidizing radicals rather than oh for the removal of bpa which is in line with previous work yang et al 2018 the removal efficiency of oit decreased from 98 7 0 4 to 71 3 2 6 in the absence of o2 the removal efficiency of oit did not reduce much without 1o2 and oh the removal efficiency of diu dropped by 30 40 after scavenging o2 and oh o2 and oh are responsible to degrade the diu as also demonstrated by meephon et al 2019 three kinds of free radicals have effect on the removal of atz among which oh has the most significant effect plaza et al found that oh played a vital role to degrade atz and its alkylic oxidation plaza et al 2021 the removal efficiency of ala and prd reduced by about 35 40 in the absence of o2 and oh while the effect of 1o2 on their removal was not significant the oxidation pathway of ala in a plasma reactor was studied by bolobajev et al 2021 they confirmed that the removal of ala starts with the attack of oh and includes dehalogenation electrophilic attack of the aromatic ring ether bond cleavage and cyclisation liu et al assessed the contribution of ros in the photochemical catalysis of prd and found that oh play the most critical role in prd removal liu et al 2019b this is because active sites in the prd molecular structure that are easily fractured by oh are mainly aromatic rings and methylene groups between two nitrogen atoms the investigation reveals that the role of ros in the removal of µps in plasma are type specific but the co existence of various efficient ros in controlled plasmas can provide a possible fit for all solution for µps removal from wastewater 3 3 3 effect of co existent inorganic and organic matter nitrate no 3 ammonium nh 4 nitrite no 2 carbonate co 3 and humic acids ha are typically present in secondary effluent these inorganic and organic components were spiked in the synthetic wastewater and their effects on the µps removal efficiency was investigated the five co existent components had no obvious reducing effect on the removal of bpa and ee2 even at a quite high concentration the removal efficiency of bpa and ee2 was more than 92 fig 7 ha and no 2 had a more remarkable reducing effect on the degradation of diu oit atz and ala than other ions ha is a ubiquitous natural organic matter found in most groundwater surface water and wastewater ha competes with µps for reaction with ros and therefore interferes with the removal of µps so µps decomposition is significantly reduced at constant energy input h 2 o 2 o 3 oh and other ros that played a crucial role in the removal of µps were rapidly consumed by no 2 bradu et al 2020 lukes et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 fortunately no 2 concentration in the secondary effluent is generally less than 1 mg l table 1 prd was difficult to remove in the plasma reactor and the five co existent components had a significant inhibitory effect on its removal efficiency as it dropped by about 20 30 no 3 and co 3 are scavengers of radicals and can react with oh fan et al 2021 fan et al found that nh 4 reacts with oh and 1o2 through which n2 no 3 and no 2 may be generated fan et al 2021 finally the removal efficiency was thus reduced and extra energy input may be required due to the complex matrix compositions 4 conclusions in this study a dbd plasma reactor with a falling water film on an activated carbon textile zorflex preceded by an ozonation chamber connected in series was used to treat secondary effluent containing seven µps atz ala prd diu oit and bpa compare with previous plasma reactor the two chambers in this cascade system enabled full scale utilization of both free radicals and molecular oxidants produced by highly reactive plasmas the degradation efficiencies of µps after treatment with entire cascade system were about 30 50 higher than that of treated by plasma alone or ozonation alone at the optimized operational conditions the energy consumption of real wastewater treatment was between 2 4 kw m³ and 5 3 kw m³ while that of synthetic wastewater was between 2 3 kw m³ and 4 8 kw m³ furthermore this study also shows that plasma can not only degrade µps but also nitrite nitrate ammonium and cod in secondary effluent the exposures of oh generated by the plasma were the lowest followed by o 3 and h2o2 the removal of diu oit and bpa were mainly affected by o2 and the removal of atz ala and prd were closely related to the oh the results of this study provide useful information for developing effective technologies to treat real wastewater which is helpful in the control and remediation of µps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
