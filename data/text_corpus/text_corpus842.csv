4210,the spatiotemporal pattern of soil moisture sm is challenging to identify as it is defined by the complex interactions of the atmosphere soil and vegetation cover we addressed this challenge by identifying the dominant controlling factors of soil moisture variations in i a single factor ii pair factor and iii three factor combination scenarios using bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence the analysis was done over the u s midwest at four soil depths 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm using grided datasets covering 1982 2020 the scale dependent analysis in the time domain shows that vapor pressure deficit vpd is the primary controlling factor of the soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil layer and the deeper layer s dynamic is primarily controlled by precipitation based on all scales in single factor analysis i e explaining sm dynamics using only one factor vpd precipitation and radiation have a higher coherency with sm than other factors for two factor analysis the combination of precipitation radiation and for three factor analysis the combinations of precipitation vpd and a vegetation index are the best predictors of sm variations overall our analysis highlights that the dominant factors affecting the soil moisture variability could be different at various time scales locations and soil layers the temporal scale dependency is mainly due to the seasonality of the factors while space and location dependency is primarily due to the inherent characteristics of the climate environment and soil our findings provide useful insights into how time scale dependency of soil moisture is linked with agro meteorological factors particularly for downscaling or upscaling issues in hydro climatological modeling keywords multiple wavelet coherence precipitation radiation soil moisture u s midwest vapor pressure deficit 1 introduction soil moisture is the key component of the earth s climate system that links land and atmospheric interactions by controlling water and heat energy fluxes vereecken et al 2016 williams et al 2016 it influences the partitioning of the available energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes affecting the surface s net radiation absorption and controls precipitation runoff responses schwingshackl et al 2018 there is a close connection between soil moisture dynamics and several environmental events such as droughts propagation sawada 2018 flooding saini et al 2016 and large scale circulation systems berg et al 2017 welty and zeng 2018 the spatiotemporal pattern of soil moisture is scale dependent vanderlinden et al 2012 and can be affected by a number of interlinked factors cosh et al 2008 crow et al 2012 fatichi et al 2015 hu et al 2009 the small scale soil moisture is primarily controlled by heterogeneity in vegetation soil texture and topography in contrast soil moisture variability at large scale is mainly led by atmospheric circulation climatic variability and geographical location brocca et al 2009 schneider et al 2008b this dynamic multifactorial dependency poses major challenges in hydrological sciences to characterize the soil moisture characteristics at different spatiotemporal scales vereecken et al 2007 additionally anthropogenic activities and the changing climate have increased the uncertainty and variability of precipitation over agriculturally dominated areas like the u s midwest easterling et al 2000 in the u s midwest extreme precipitation can have perilous consequences for river flooding soil moisture dynamics and plant cultivation dirmeyer and kinter 2010 thus consideration of the multifaceted impacts on soil moisture is essential to simulate and interpret future climate scenarios more accurate quantification of the soil moisture dynamics in climate models would translate to a more plausible representation of future climate especially considering the impacts of extreme events seneviratne et al 2010 the dynamic of soil moisture has been analyzed in many studies from field and catchment scales niether et al 2017 rosenbaum et al 2012 to the regional and global scales biswas and si 2011 brocca et al 2010 cosh et al 2008 hu et al 2009 starks et al 2006 vachaud et al 1985 using multi resolution data sources a comprehensive review of different factors on soil moisture variability at cross scales has been provided by vanderlinden et al 2012 field studies usually use in situ measurements that are limited by a single crop type e g hupet and vanclooster 2002 jamshidi et al 2020 larger scale studies have employed satellite data e g mccoll et al 2017 used smap sadeghi et al 2020 used smos to evaluate the spatial variability of soil moisture the major drawback of satellite based soil moisture retrieval is its shallow penetration depth i e 5 cm of topsoil layer which is not an adequate representative of the soil moisture variation for most plant species with deep rooting depth huang et al 2016 the soil moisture behavior in deeper layers is notably decoupled from the topsoil layers under dry conditions and sustains its regular temporal variability hirschi et al 2014 with the advancement of land data assimilation systems ldas the data on land surface states including soil moisture can be retrieved at high spatiotemporal resolutions and different soil depths covering root zone and below hirschi et al 2014 integration of the ldas dataset and satellite derived variables e g precipitation vegetation indices etc provides a unique opportunity to identify the correlation between soil moisture and agro climatological components quantitative approaches have been extensively applied to characterize scale time and location dependency of the correlations between soil moisture and different controlling factors examples include fourier transform potts et al 2010 multiresolution analysis biswas et al 2013 su and ryu 2015 empirical mode decomposition hu et al 2014 hu and si 2013 and wavelet transform das and mohanty 2008 liang et al 2011 liu et al 2017 however the hydrological processes are complex and codependent thus multiple variables can concurrently contribute to a process soil moisture variation henninger et al 1976 yao et al 2012 several methods have been proposed to analyze the multivariate correlations at different time scales and locations empirical mode decomposition emd for example can divide variables into several intrinsic modes according to dominant scales rehman and mandic 2010 emd has been combined with the squared multiple correlation coefficient to explain the multivariate relationships hu and si 2013 she et al 2015 since emd can be used for nonstationary and nonlinear data the relationships between soil moisture and its controlling factors vary across time scales and locations the functionality of emd in capturing all the variances and the neutralization effect of multiple correlation coefficients may not be adequate for describing soil moisture dynamics at multiple locations and scales hu et al 2017 to disentangle the scale dependency of soil moisture and its controlling factors approaches such as multiple spectral coherence have been employed si 2008 typically multiple spectral coherence is built on the assumption that the time series is stationary moreover it underestimates the multivariate relationships thus the multivariate methods mentioned above are not an ideal tool to reveal the localized multivariate relationships to analyze the multivariate correlations multivariate wavelet coherence mwc provides a functional asset mwc has been used to evaluate the spatiotemporal dependency of soil moisture and meteorological forcing hu et al 2017 water bodies gu et al 2021 su et al 2019 nitrate concentrations in streamflow and hydrological factors gu et al 2020 soil organic matter variations and controlling factors zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2020 used the wavelet analysis to quantify the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture dynamic at different soil depths focusing on plant functional type to the best of our knowledge no assessments have been carried out to evaluate the temporal scale dependency of multiple controlling factors of soil moisture dynamics given various environmental conditions therefore in this study the purpose of our research is to 1 analyzing the scale dependent control of potential influencing factors on the soil moisture 2 characterizing bivariate and multivariate correlations of soil moisture and different agro meteorological factors in the u s midwest 3 comparing the factors performance and identifying a dominant component or a combination of factors that optimally explain the soil moisture variability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study focuses on the u s midwest by considering ten sites roughly uniformly spaced across the domain with different land use land cover fig 1 these locations include four insitu scan wcc nrcs usda gov scan sites and six ameriflux http ameriflux ornl gov for which quality controlled data were generated with land information system lis that was also used and validated in our study niyogi et al 2017 a summary description of each study site was shown in table 1 we refer to these sites by three symbols an abbreviation for each study site name as shown in table 1 considering a homogenous soil type for the top 30 cm the soil texture in these locations range from coarse sandy soil in oho site to fine clay loam in mms and ames texture cosby et al 1984 the vegetation cover typically greens up around march to april the maximum greenness occurs during june and vegetation senescence is from august to september niyogi et al 2017 2 2 variables and data sources the study aims at identifying and analyzing the factors that govern the inter annual variability of soil moisture we obtained soil moisture data up to a total soil depth of 2 m including four soil layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm and separately analyzed each layer soil moisture embodies scale dependent temporal and spatial heterogeneity which results from the interaction of vegetation covers and atmospheric factors such as precipitation radiation and surface biophysical as well as meteorological factors for the vegetation indices the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was considered the literature illustrates that ndvi can provide a useful proxy for evapotranspiration and soil moisture mapping over a large spatial scale adegoke and carleton 2002 hunsaker et al 2009 nicholson and farrar 1994 schnur et al 2010 the ndvi corresponds to the leaf area index lai which is an important factor to analyze the hydrological process of the land surface and controls various biological and physical processes associated with vegetation andersen et al 2002 lai and or ndvi is an important factor to drive soil moisture dynamics by controlling evapotranspiration especially under water limited conditions albertson and kiely 2001 the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar is another important variable in the assessment of vegetation productively fensholt et al 2004 the three vegetation indexes each provide insights regarding the biophysical status for example lai represents an estimate of the green leaf area for terrestrial vegetation however fapar characterizes the canopy s energy absorption capacity moreover ndvi responds differently to several characteristics such as leaf properties and soil reflectance in this work we accordingly consider a range of vegetation based indicators including ndvi lai and the fapar on the regional scale climate forcing factors such as precipitation pre vapor pressure deficit vpd soil temperature st and radiation rd are essential in controlling the temporal pattern of soil moisture dynamics fatichi et al 2015 while precipitation and radiation are more important factors soil temperature shows a significant effect on soil moisture characteristics and soil structures for example long period predictions of water movement are more complicated since all or part of the soil moisture may not be in a liquid state when soil undergoes freeze and thaw cycles ferrand and sulayman 1996 it illustrates that soil temperature is an important factor in studying soil moisture features the contribution of vpd to soil moisture is mainly shown in regulating the stomatal response of plants bharati et al 2002 kimm et al 2020 and prior work found that vpd is the domain role in controlling soil moisture adegoke and carleton 2002 kimm et al 2020 lobell et al 2013 lobell et al 2014 meanwhile wind speed ws plays an important role in soil moisture bois et al 2008 liu et al 2012 for selecting the possible climatic factors we considered i soil temperature st ii a range of meteorological factors including precipitation pre radiation rd wind speed ws and vapor pressure deficit vpd we provided a summary of the selection of potential controlling factors table s1 we retrieved the data from different remotely sensed sources including satellite and land surface data as listed in table 2 soil moisture and soil temperature were retrieved from the north american land data assimilation system nldas precipitation data were retrieved from climate hazards center infrared precipitation with station data chirps2 radiation wind speed and vapor pressure deficit were retrieved from gridmet and ndvi lai and fapar were retrieved from noaa climate data record cdr of avhrr the data covered the last 38 years in daily scale format from 1982 to 2020 with the spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 the space grid of soil moisture and temperature data originally is 0 125 0 125 and was scaled to 0 05 0 05 to be consistent with other products the daily data were checked for quality and consistency and outliers and erroneous data were replaced using interpolation techniques then daily data was resampled to monthly and used in the bivariate and multivariate wavelet analysis 2 3 statistical method we analyzed the bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence between soil moisture and its controlling factors for this purpose the first step is to calculate the wavelet transform two classes of wavelet transform continuous and discrete wavelet transform provide different advantages for analyzing signals for example continuous wavelet transform is a better selection to extract the feature in time series while discrete wavelet transform is a compact representation of data especially suitable for data compression and noise reduction grinsted et al 2004 since we tend to analyze the low signal noise ratio signals in time series we only discuss the continuous wavelet transform described in the next sub section 2 3 1 the continuous wavelet transform cwt given a time series x i i 1 2 n with an equal time spacing δ t the cwt w i s at the scale s and time t i i δ t can be explained as an improved version of the discrete fourier transformation f w j e x p i ω t j but in ctw the periodic exponential e x p i ω t j is substituted using a wavelet φ t j t i s gedalof et al 2004 which is a function in time and frequency space grinsted et al 2004 the wavelets are subsets of a finite length oscillating wave shape i e mother wavelet that can be contracted and stretched by changing the wavelet scale s and translated by varying the localized time t i the time series can be decomposed based on scale and time grinsted et al 2004 1 w i s j 1 n 1 x j c s φ 0 t j t i s where c s δ t s is the normalization factor in order to φ have unit energy and denotes the complex conjugate the wavelet power can be defined as w i s 2 when a time series is not cyclic the cwt shapes have edge artifacts i e theedgeof a pixel is not aligned with the exact pixel boundary therefore a cone of influence coi has been introduced as a region in the wavelet spectrum such that edge effects are not ignored torrence and compo 1998 the coi is calculated based on the edge discontinuity threshold of e 2 with reference to the guideline in grinsted et al 2004 for each cwt presented as a pale region in the cwt figures in the result section discussed ahead the significance level of the wavelet spectrum is assessed against red noise i e a continuous reduction of spectral scale with increasing frequency schulz and mudelsee 2002 and the statistical significance of the results is evaluated by a significance level of p 0 05 in our study the morlet wavelet was selected as the mother wavelet because it can achieve a balance between frequency and time other alternatives include the mexican hat function and the classic sine function however the morlet wavelet function has been highlighted to be a suitable candidate for the shape of hydrological signals e g gaucherel 2002 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 labat 2005 as it provides a good balance between time and frequency localization the morlet wavelet is defined as 2 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 in which η and ω 0 are dimensionless time and frequency respectively typically ω 0 6 can provide a good balance between frequency and time grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 additional detailed information about cwt can be found in grinsted et al 2004 2 3 2 wavelet transform coherence wtc wtc is a correlation coefficient localized in frequency and time domains quantifying the degree of a linear relationship between time series cazelles et al 2008 for the time series x and y the wavelet transforms are defined as w i x s and w i y s respectively then wavelet coherence is computed using 3 r i 2 s s 1 w i xy s 2 s s 1 w i x s 2 s s 1 w i y s 2 where s denotes a smoothing operator 4 w i xy w i x s w i y s in which indicates the complex conjugate and r i 2 is the correlation coefficient that ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 demonstrates a perfect correlation between the two signals and 0 demonstrates no correlation 2 3 3 multiple wavelet coherence mwc for multiple predictor variables x x x 1 x 2 x p the mwc ρ m 2 s τ at location τ and scale s can be written as 5 ρ m 2 s τ w x y s τ w x x s τ 1 w x y s τ w y y s τ where w x x s τ is the matrix of the smoothed cross and auto wavelet power spectra among multiple variables of x w y y s τ is the smoothed wavelet power spectrum of y w x y s τ is the matrix of the smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between x and y and indicates the complex conjugate hu and si 2016 it is essential to choose a set of scales s in wavelet analysis for the morlet wavelet we can build a more complete picture using an arbitrary set of scales for convenience the scales are selected as outlined in torrence and compo 1998 6 s j s 0 2 j δ j j 0 1 j 7 j δ j 1 log 2 n δ t s 0 in which s 0 and j are the smallest and largest resolvable scale respectively s 0 is considered as the approximately 2 δ t equivalent fourier period for both the bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence the 5 significance level is calculated using the monte carlo method grinsted et al 2004 hu and si 2016 2 4 factor identification and analysis structure the ability of different controlling factors or their combinations to explain soil moisture variations was assessed by the integration of average wavelet coherence awc and the percent area of significance coherence pasc relative to the time frequency domain hu and si 2016 su et al 2019 a greater pasc and larger awc for a particular predictor indicate that the predictor can explain a higher level of soil moisture variance we highlight that applying mwc i e considering more than one controlling factor can result in a larger awc but does not necessarily ensure a greater pasc hu and si 2016 the additional factor added to the single factor scenario i e in two factor and three factor analysis is only considered significant when it could increase pasc by at least 5 hu et al 2017 we first assessed the variations of the studied factors averaged over 1982 to 2020 to have a better understanding of each site s characteristics then we evaluated the temporal scale dependency between the soil moisture considering four depths and controlling factors at a small time scale less than 6 months a medium scale 6 to 12 months and a large scale greater than 12 months at each site next we considered the mean of all time scales and identified the dominant controlling factors of soil moisture variations in three scenarios including i single factors ii pair bivariate factor and iii three factor combinations lastly we concluded the optimal factor combinations for controlling soil moisture variations at each study site and soil depth by evaluating the resulting bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence in the previous steps 3 results 3 1 the variability at each site the average soil temperature trend considering 1982 to 2020 data follows the air temperature trend and broadly the climate of the study sites figs s1 and 2 a given the relatively colder climate of the wcr station illinois a lower range of soil temperature compared to other stations is expected besides this difference the average soil temperature trend shows a similar feature across all study sites the lowest soil temperature occurs during january and the highest occurs during july august the amplitude of fluctuations decreased with the increase of soil depths with a lag in the lower layers different precipitation regimes are identified for the study sites fig 2 b and c there are two distinctive wet and dry periods at man ame joh kfs ne3 and wcr sites and no precipitation seasonality is found at the dex mms bo1 and oho stations the dex and mms stations have the highest annual precipitation 1200 mm and the lowest precipitation occurs at joh and man 450 mm considering the vegetation characteristics of the study sites we found a higher ndvi lai and fapar at the mms and wcr stations while other stations exhibit a similar annual variation fig 3 radiation and vpd range similarly across the stations with a higher range occurring at joh and a lower range at wcr stations the dex site is comparatively calm and relatively higher winds are found at wcr and ame stations the monthly soil moisture variations for each site are shown in fig 4 deeper soil layers experience smaller seasonal variations at a lagged time compared to the topsoil layers the dex site shows the highest range of soil moisture values while the joh site displays the lowest soil moisture variations 3 2 controlling factors considering time scales the awc between soil moisture and controlling factors at a small scale less than 6 months medium scale 6 12 months and large scale greater than 12 months are shown in figs 5 7 respectively the detailed statistics of the calculated awc and pasc for each time scale are provided in table s3 we found the highest coherency between the different environmental factors and soil moisture dynamics at the medium 6 12 months time scale for this time scale vpd emerged as the primary factor modulating the soil moisture dynamics the coherent coefficient for vpd ranges between 0 40 for deeper soil layers to 0 82 for topsoil layers and is notable at the study sites without the wet and dry seasons shifting from medium time scale to higher and lower time frequencies precipitation emerged as a critical variable controlling the soil moisture in deeper soil layers while the influence of vpd is more evident on the topsoil layers the resulting coherency coefficient for precipitation at a small time scale ranges from 0 40 to 0 56 and vpd ranges from 0 50 to 0 60 across the study sites and soil depths at the large time scale the coherency coefficients are higher than the small time scale and range from 0 51 to 0 75 for vpd and 0 56 to 0 70 for precipitation vegetation indices do not show a strong coherence with soil moisture dynamics instances of high coherency between soil moisture and vegetation indices only occur at two forested areas including wcr at the small time scale lai awc 0 53 and oho at the large time scale fapar awc 0 57 3 3 single and multiple controlling factors in this section we present the identified single two and three factor scenarios that characterize the largest awc and pasc correspond to soil moisture changes detailed resulting statistics are shown for three example sites correspond to different vegetation cover in tables 3 and 4 and was also in tables s4 and s5 for the single influential factor scenario the vpd shows the highest awc for the first two layers and as the soil depth increased the precipitation is found to have a more dominant role the only exceptions are the man station for which radiation shows the highest awc for the first soil layer and wcr for which precipitation is the most contributing factor for all soil layers in the single factor scenario 12 54 of the soil moisture variations could be explained by the controlling factors and the impact of the controlling factors is more pronounced in the topsoil layers than the deeper layers for the two factors scenario the combination of precipitation and radiation pre rd is the common dominant combination which accounted for 30 to 58 of the soil moisture variations the next common best combination is precipitation and vapor pressure deficit pre vpd pasc 28 59 particularly for upper soil layers precipitation and soil temperature pre st is also an effective controlling combination which accounts for 39 to 59 of the soil moisture variations for the three factors scenario the combination of precipitation vpd and a vegetation factor is the predominant factor explaining 41 to 60 of soil moisture dynamics in the first and second layers for deeper layers we could not establish a specific trend nevertheless the combinations of precipitation soil temperature and vpd or lai are more highlighted in deeper layers 3 4 coherence in the time frequency domain in this section we present the results of wavelet coherence for the single and multiple factors of the largest coherence identified in the previous section figs 8 to 10 in these figures the y axis shows the periodicity up to 128 months x axis shows the study time 1982 to 2020 and coi is shown as a pale region with black edges overall we noted significant annual periodic characteristics prevailing at different soil depths in all study sites either with intermittent breaks or continuous annual periodicity for the single factor scenario soil moisture variations show a higher coherence with the controlling factor precipitation at wcr and ne3 radiation at man and vpd at the rest of the stations for an 8 to 16 month periodicity fig 8 taking the example of ame station with vpd as the prime controlling factor we noted a high coherence red shaded for a periodicity between 8 and 16 months consistent and continuous throughout the years for radiation the man station there is a continuous coherence throughout the years of study but in smaller periodicity 8 12 months narrower red shadows however for precipitation at wcr and ne3 stations there is intermittent periodicity through the years soil moisture in top layers 0 40 cm displays more fragmentary high frequency oscillations while soil moisture periodicities in deeper layers 40 200 cm are fewer with lower frequency shifting from one factor to the two factor scenario significantly improves the consistency and coherency for the larger periodicity 32 months fig 9 a larger variance can be explained resulting from the two factor combination average pasc 42 1 compared to a single factor 36 5 suggesting that adding a factor to the analysis could help explain soil moisture dynamics table 4 the increases in pasc in the two factor scenarios are mainly due to oscillations with periodicity greater than 32 months switching to two factor combinations does not exhibit large improvements at dex 1st soil layer kfs 3rd soil depth ne3 1st and 4th soil depths and more notably at joh 1st 3rd soil depths stations more specifically the increase is not statistically significant p value 0 05 at the dex 3rd soil depth joh 4th soil depth and kfs 4th soil depth at these stations the additional factors are not significantly different from red noise in explaining additional soil moisture variation adding an additional factor to the two factor combination we noted only a small improvement average pasc 44 25 in the coherency between soil moisture and the controlling factors fig 10 the wavelet coherence between soil moisture and three factor combinations shows similar periodic characteristics as the two factor combinations while awc increases for most locations and soil layers the pasc values only increase in seven study sites for different soil layers the observed difference between the pasc and awc values is primarily attributed to the inefficiency of the added factor third factor to the two factor scenario in explaining the soil moisture variance more specifically the third factor has collinearity with the previous factors which causes overlapping and attenuating effects thus only the factors that individually and independently explained the soil moisture variability are considered influential contributing factors overall at the ame bo1 kfs and ne3 stations we did not observe any advantages by adding the third additional factor other stations experience a range of improvements with more highlighted fragmentary oscillations these stations include forest areas mms oho and wcr a higher coherency by combining three factors for the forested areas suggests more complex surface crop atmosphere interactions compared to grassland and cropland that could not be simply explained by one or two factors 3 5 identifying the optimal combinations of the controlling factor in this section we present the optimal factor combinations that more accurately explain the soil moisture variations at each station table 5 lists the optimal combinations for each soil layer the optimal combination largely varies with stations and soil depths considering the croplands for example in the ame and ne3 stations a combination of precipitation and radiation is the best combination to explore the soil moisture dynamics for most of the soil layers but in joh dex and bo1 sites different combinations of precipitation vpd soil temperature and fapar are found optimal considering the topsoil layers in grasslands precipitation vpd is the optimal factor in the kfs station while the precipitation fapar radiation is the best in the man station variable combinations are found for the deeper layers in these stations with vpd as a common factor in the forested areas the precipitation soil temperature combination is an influential factor for the first soil layer while in deeper layers different combinations of precipitation vpd soil temperature and lai contribute to the resulting optimal factors 4 discussion the soil moisture variations are influenced by the spatiotemporal change in various environmental and meteorological factors in this study we highlight that the dominant factors affecting the soil moisture variability could be different at various time scales locations and soil layers the scale dependency in time is primarily due to the seasonality of the factors while space and location dependency is mostly due to the inherent characteristics of the climate environment and soil aligned with our study liu et al 2017 reported the temporal dependent relationship between soil moisture and precipitation under the impact of plant functional types wilson et al 2004 also report the importance of the spatial distribution of soils and vegetation in controlling spatial soil moisture variations the prime controlling factors vary with soil depths because of the difference in the soil properties and different soil plant atmosphere interactions among the different soil layers soil water holding capacity moisture distribution and movement are known to be a function of soil texture structure and organic matter brouwer et al 1985 gaur and mohanty 2013 additionally the topsoil layer interacts more with environmental variables i e atmospheric forcing water uptake by the canopy that are more exposed to wet and dry cycles after a precipitation episode evaporation occurs at its maximum rate phase one of evaporation and water infiltrates to the lower layers rapidly due to the gravity force the topsoil layers buffer the bottom soil layer and reduce the impact of soil evaporation moreover water extraction by plant roots is less notable in the bottom layers schwartz et al 2010 therefore the factors that causing water extraction from the soil e g vpd radiation are more coherent with the topsoil most of the studied sites resemble this pattern as the soil moisture dynamics of top layers 0 40 cm were found to have more coherence with vpd considering the single factor scenario tables 3 and s4 the topsoil interactions with the atmosphere and exposure to more wet and dry cycles also cause high frequency periodicity which is illustrated by the continuous wavelet power spectrum in figs 8 to 10 in contrast the slower moisture redistribution in the bottom soil layers shows low frequency periodicity as evident in figs 8 10 the dominant controlling factors also vary with time scale due to the different periodicity of the environmental variables particularly precipitation comparing the controlling factors of soil moisture in topsoil layers in the dex and ame stations cropland we observed that in the dex station with no specific wet and dry season the controlling factor vpd in small and medium time scale is similar however in the ame station with distinctive wet and dry seasons precipitation is the most influential factor in a small time scale while vpd is more impactful on a medium time scale for most of the sites with bimodal precipitation patterns the controlling factors changed with different scales since most of the variables discussed in the study have seasonal changes the resulting coherency is strongest at the medium time scale fig 6 however seasonality is not the only determining factor for identifying the controlling factors environmental and climatic features of the study sites are also contributed to the findings to be different spatially for example the wcr station represents a heavily forested area deciduous broadleaf forest at which lai variations show a distinct seasonality fig 3 the increase in lai may to september is synchronized with the wettest months that account for 60 70 of annual precipitation the soil texture however is sandy that does not have a high water holding capacity as a result lai s impact is more evident as an indirect control of the soil moisture variations the mms station also shows a significant jump in lai from may to september fig 3 but precipitation is the prime factor controlling the soil moisture dynamics this station receives more annual precipitation compared to wrc with a heavy soil texture compared to sandy soil in wrc therefore the coherency between soil moisture and lai is not the strongest at the mms station the combinations of precipitation with radiation vpd and soil temperature are the most common to control the soil moisture variability precipitation provides the inputs to a soil system while radiation and vpd cause water extraction from the system radiation provides the source of energy for the latent heat requirement vpd provides the gradient for the evaporating and transpiration bodies i e soil and plants and soil temperature contributes to energy flux that affects soil evaporation and biophysical processes for root water uptake these variables have seasonal and inter annual variability see figs 2 and 3 which strengthens their coherence with soil moisture by affecting the evaporative demand and heat balance temperature and altering the gradient for soil evaporation and plant transpiration historically the role of vpd in manipulating soil moisture has been overlooked however consistent with our study more recent evaluations have shown the role of vpd on soil moisture dynamic particularly during periods of hydrologic stress kimm et al 2020 lobell et al 2013 lobell et al 2014 novick et al 2015 kimm et al 2020 reported that vpd could explain nearly 90 of maize and soybean transpiration variability in the u s midwest vpd role in plants is linked with stomatal activity and overall water uptake by the roots jamshidi et al 2021 plant stomata primarily regulates the balance between water loss from the leaves and co2 uptake from the atmosphere katul et al 2012 in a high vpd environment plants tend to increase stomatal resistance and restrict photosynthetic activities huang et al 2017 high vpd periods often coincide with low precipitation due to the reduction of specific humidity and increased temperature gentine et al 2016 green et al 2017 therefore the role of vpd could be more pronounced in water limited areas in our study the impact of vpd is particularly pronounced at the joh site with low annual precipitation and during the drought years soil temperature variations are caused by latent heat exchanges between the soil surface and aboveground atmosphere onwuka 2018 the heat transfer between the soil layers zhao et al 2008 soil temperature affects different soil biological physical and chemical properties which consequently influence plant growth in various pathways clarke et al 2015 karandish and shahnazari 2016 for example toselli et al 1999 described a lower water update by the plants in low soil temperature due to the increased water viscosity on the other hand with the increase in soil temperature the metabolic activity of plants root improves and leads to root proliferation and higher water uptakes callejas et al 2009 lahti et al 2005 soil temperature can also directly contribute to soil evaporation kidron and kronenfeld 2016 reported that for a 1 c increase in soil temperature the evaporation rate increases by 0 07 mm day although the study was done over a desert region it highlights the importance of soil heat storage impact on soil moisture variations our study results highlight that the root morphology and the rooting depth vary by plant type yang et al 2016 the grass species at man and kfs stations distribute their root within 50 cm of the soil profile thus depleting the surface soil moisture causes them to senesce eggemeyer et al 2009 in contrast woody plants in the forested sites could extract water from deeper soil layers below 50 cm when the water content of the upper soil profile falls below readily available water moisture the deeper effective rooting depth in forested sites and their flexibility to extract water from deeper layers is likely the reason for the lower coherence between precipitation and soil moisture at the forested sites mms wcr oho in figs 5 7 and s2 the vegetation indices considered in our study ndvi fapar lai are not effectively bound with meteorological data to explain the soil moisture variability only some instances were found at ame dex wcr stations the feedback between soil moisture dynamics and vegetation is more complicated than soil and climate properties schneider et al 2008a and the physiological and phenological characteristics of vegetation could indirectly affect soil moisture english et al 2005 three different vegetation types characterize our study sites i cropland ii forest and iii grasslands the different structures of the aboveground canopy of the vegetation covers in our study site have likely altered the precipitation amount reaching the under canopy surface due to canopy interception acharya et al 2017 liu et al 2017 this disparity could be the reason for a higher periodicity in the topsoil layers which is mostly observed in grasslands compared to the croplands and forested areas figs 8 10 5 conclusion the bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence were used to explore the scale dependent coherence between the soil moisture dynamics and possible agro meteorological factors in the u s midwest the complexity of soil moisture canopy and atmosphere continuum can be better visualized and analyzed using the wavelet analysis particularly considering the predictors intricate dynamics our results highlight the importance of vpd in controlling soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil layers 0 100 cm more evidently when a medium time scale is considered in contrast soil moisture of deeper layers is primarily controlled by precipitation particularly for small and large time scales by performing the analysis using the historical records of the data 1982 2020 the role of vpd is more dominant during the drought years this finding is notable for quantifying drought severity in agriculturally dominated areas such as the u s midwest the multivariate analysis shows that the combination of precipitation vpd and vegetation indexes can better interpret soil moisture variability and this combination is time and location dependent depending on the climate of the study site e g temperature range precipitation regimes evaporative demand and the land cover e g forest cropland the optimal combination varies nevertheless while some key factors affecting the soil moisture variability are intuitive e g precipitation we emphasized the role of vpd which is typically overlooked in soil moisture analysis our assessments can be used as a data driven approach for developing or expanding soil moisture networks modeling and predicting soil moisture dynamics and the corresponding hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration modeling or flood prediction in particular our findings can contribute to developing more adaptive algorithms for downscaling and upscaling soil moisture from the coarse climate model or satellite data currently high resolution soil moisture data are generated either based on interpolating in situ data or using statistical dynamical approaches to downscale remotely sensed data nayak and villarini 2018 niyogi et al 2017 we identified the soil moisture association for agro meteorological variables at different time frequency domains such information will be useful for parameterizing the statistical

4210,the spatiotemporal pattern of soil moisture sm is challenging to identify as it is defined by the complex interactions of the atmosphere soil and vegetation cover we addressed this challenge by identifying the dominant controlling factors of soil moisture variations in i a single factor ii pair factor and iii three factor combination scenarios using bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence the analysis was done over the u s midwest at four soil depths 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm using grided datasets covering 1982 2020 the scale dependent analysis in the time domain shows that vapor pressure deficit vpd is the primary controlling factor of the soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil layer and the deeper layer s dynamic is primarily controlled by precipitation based on all scales in single factor analysis i e explaining sm dynamics using only one factor vpd precipitation and radiation have a higher coherency with sm than other factors for two factor analysis the combination of precipitation radiation and for three factor analysis the combinations of precipitation vpd and a vegetation index are the best predictors of sm variations overall our analysis highlights that the dominant factors affecting the soil moisture variability could be different at various time scales locations and soil layers the temporal scale dependency is mainly due to the seasonality of the factors while space and location dependency is primarily due to the inherent characteristics of the climate environment and soil our findings provide useful insights into how time scale dependency of soil moisture is linked with agro meteorological factors particularly for downscaling or upscaling issues in hydro climatological modeling keywords multiple wavelet coherence precipitation radiation soil moisture u s midwest vapor pressure deficit 1 introduction soil moisture is the key component of the earth s climate system that links land and atmospheric interactions by controlling water and heat energy fluxes vereecken et al 2016 williams et al 2016 it influences the partitioning of the available energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes affecting the surface s net radiation absorption and controls precipitation runoff responses schwingshackl et al 2018 there is a close connection between soil moisture dynamics and several environmental events such as droughts propagation sawada 2018 flooding saini et al 2016 and large scale circulation systems berg et al 2017 welty and zeng 2018 the spatiotemporal pattern of soil moisture is scale dependent vanderlinden et al 2012 and can be affected by a number of interlinked factors cosh et al 2008 crow et al 2012 fatichi et al 2015 hu et al 2009 the small scale soil moisture is primarily controlled by heterogeneity in vegetation soil texture and topography in contrast soil moisture variability at large scale is mainly led by atmospheric circulation climatic variability and geographical location brocca et al 2009 schneider et al 2008b this dynamic multifactorial dependency poses major challenges in hydrological sciences to characterize the soil moisture characteristics at different spatiotemporal scales vereecken et al 2007 additionally anthropogenic activities and the changing climate have increased the uncertainty and variability of precipitation over agriculturally dominated areas like the u s midwest easterling et al 2000 in the u s midwest extreme precipitation can have perilous consequences for river flooding soil moisture dynamics and plant cultivation dirmeyer and kinter 2010 thus consideration of the multifaceted impacts on soil moisture is essential to simulate and interpret future climate scenarios more accurate quantification of the soil moisture dynamics in climate models would translate to a more plausible representation of future climate especially considering the impacts of extreme events seneviratne et al 2010 the dynamic of soil moisture has been analyzed in many studies from field and catchment scales niether et al 2017 rosenbaum et al 2012 to the regional and global scales biswas and si 2011 brocca et al 2010 cosh et al 2008 hu et al 2009 starks et al 2006 vachaud et al 1985 using multi resolution data sources a comprehensive review of different factors on soil moisture variability at cross scales has been provided by vanderlinden et al 2012 field studies usually use in situ measurements that are limited by a single crop type e g hupet and vanclooster 2002 jamshidi et al 2020 larger scale studies have employed satellite data e g mccoll et al 2017 used smap sadeghi et al 2020 used smos to evaluate the spatial variability of soil moisture the major drawback of satellite based soil moisture retrieval is its shallow penetration depth i e 5 cm of topsoil layer which is not an adequate representative of the soil moisture variation for most plant species with deep rooting depth huang et al 2016 the soil moisture behavior in deeper layers is notably decoupled from the topsoil layers under dry conditions and sustains its regular temporal variability hirschi et al 2014 with the advancement of land data assimilation systems ldas the data on land surface states including soil moisture can be retrieved at high spatiotemporal resolutions and different soil depths covering root zone and below hirschi et al 2014 integration of the ldas dataset and satellite derived variables e g precipitation vegetation indices etc provides a unique opportunity to identify the correlation between soil moisture and agro climatological components quantitative approaches have been extensively applied to characterize scale time and location dependency of the correlations between soil moisture and different controlling factors examples include fourier transform potts et al 2010 multiresolution analysis biswas et al 2013 su and ryu 2015 empirical mode decomposition hu et al 2014 hu and si 2013 and wavelet transform das and mohanty 2008 liang et al 2011 liu et al 2017 however the hydrological processes are complex and codependent thus multiple variables can concurrently contribute to a process soil moisture variation henninger et al 1976 yao et al 2012 several methods have been proposed to analyze the multivariate correlations at different time scales and locations empirical mode decomposition emd for example can divide variables into several intrinsic modes according to dominant scales rehman and mandic 2010 emd has been combined with the squared multiple correlation coefficient to explain the multivariate relationships hu and si 2013 she et al 2015 since emd can be used for nonstationary and nonlinear data the relationships between soil moisture and its controlling factors vary across time scales and locations the functionality of emd in capturing all the variances and the neutralization effect of multiple correlation coefficients may not be adequate for describing soil moisture dynamics at multiple locations and scales hu et al 2017 to disentangle the scale dependency of soil moisture and its controlling factors approaches such as multiple spectral coherence have been employed si 2008 typically multiple spectral coherence is built on the assumption that the time series is stationary moreover it underestimates the multivariate relationships thus the multivariate methods mentioned above are not an ideal tool to reveal the localized multivariate relationships to analyze the multivariate correlations multivariate wavelet coherence mwc provides a functional asset mwc has been used to evaluate the spatiotemporal dependency of soil moisture and meteorological forcing hu et al 2017 water bodies gu et al 2021 su et al 2019 nitrate concentrations in streamflow and hydrological factors gu et al 2020 soil organic matter variations and controlling factors zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2020 used the wavelet analysis to quantify the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture dynamic at different soil depths focusing on plant functional type to the best of our knowledge no assessments have been carried out to evaluate the temporal scale dependency of multiple controlling factors of soil moisture dynamics given various environmental conditions therefore in this study the purpose of our research is to 1 analyzing the scale dependent control of potential influencing factors on the soil moisture 2 characterizing bivariate and multivariate correlations of soil moisture and different agro meteorological factors in the u s midwest 3 comparing the factors performance and identifying a dominant component or a combination of factors that optimally explain the soil moisture variability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study focuses on the u s midwest by considering ten sites roughly uniformly spaced across the domain with different land use land cover fig 1 these locations include four insitu scan wcc nrcs usda gov scan sites and six ameriflux http ameriflux ornl gov for which quality controlled data were generated with land information system lis that was also used and validated in our study niyogi et al 2017 a summary description of each study site was shown in table 1 we refer to these sites by three symbols an abbreviation for each study site name as shown in table 1 considering a homogenous soil type for the top 30 cm the soil texture in these locations range from coarse sandy soil in oho site to fine clay loam in mms and ames texture cosby et al 1984 the vegetation cover typically greens up around march to april the maximum greenness occurs during june and vegetation senescence is from august to september niyogi et al 2017 2 2 variables and data sources the study aims at identifying and analyzing the factors that govern the inter annual variability of soil moisture we obtained soil moisture data up to a total soil depth of 2 m including four soil layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm and separately analyzed each layer soil moisture embodies scale dependent temporal and spatial heterogeneity which results from the interaction of vegetation covers and atmospheric factors such as precipitation radiation and surface biophysical as well as meteorological factors for the vegetation indices the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was considered the literature illustrates that ndvi can provide a useful proxy for evapotranspiration and soil moisture mapping over a large spatial scale adegoke and carleton 2002 hunsaker et al 2009 nicholson and farrar 1994 schnur et al 2010 the ndvi corresponds to the leaf area index lai which is an important factor to analyze the hydrological process of the land surface and controls various biological and physical processes associated with vegetation andersen et al 2002 lai and or ndvi is an important factor to drive soil moisture dynamics by controlling evapotranspiration especially under water limited conditions albertson and kiely 2001 the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar is another important variable in the assessment of vegetation productively fensholt et al 2004 the three vegetation indexes each provide insights regarding the biophysical status for example lai represents an estimate of the green leaf area for terrestrial vegetation however fapar characterizes the canopy s energy absorption capacity moreover ndvi responds differently to several characteristics such as leaf properties and soil reflectance in this work we accordingly consider a range of vegetation based indicators including ndvi lai and the fapar on the regional scale climate forcing factors such as precipitation pre vapor pressure deficit vpd soil temperature st and radiation rd are essential in controlling the temporal pattern of soil moisture dynamics fatichi et al 2015 while precipitation and radiation are more important factors soil temperature shows a significant effect on soil moisture characteristics and soil structures for example long period predictions of water movement are more complicated since all or part of the soil moisture may not be in a liquid state when soil undergoes freeze and thaw cycles ferrand and sulayman 1996 it illustrates that soil temperature is an important factor in studying soil moisture features the contribution of vpd to soil moisture is mainly shown in regulating the stomatal response of plants bharati et al 2002 kimm et al 2020 and prior work found that vpd is the domain role in controlling soil moisture adegoke and carleton 2002 kimm et al 2020 lobell et al 2013 lobell et al 2014 meanwhile wind speed ws plays an important role in soil moisture bois et al 2008 liu et al 2012 for selecting the possible climatic factors we considered i soil temperature st ii a range of meteorological factors including precipitation pre radiation rd wind speed ws and vapor pressure deficit vpd we provided a summary of the selection of potential controlling factors table s1 we retrieved the data from different remotely sensed sources including satellite and land surface data as listed in table 2 soil moisture and soil temperature were retrieved from the north american land data assimilation system nldas precipitation data were retrieved from climate hazards center infrared precipitation with station data chirps2 radiation wind speed and vapor pressure deficit were retrieved from gridmet and ndvi lai and fapar were retrieved from noaa climate data record cdr of avhrr the data covered the last 38 years in daily scale format from 1982 to 2020 with the spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 the space grid of soil moisture and temperature data originally is 0 125 0 125 and was scaled to 0 05 0 05 to be consistent with other products the daily data were checked for quality and consistency and outliers and erroneous data were replaced using interpolation techniques then daily data was resampled to monthly and used in the bivariate and multivariate wavelet analysis 2 3 statistical method we analyzed the bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence between soil moisture and its controlling factors for this purpose the first step is to calculate the wavelet transform two classes of wavelet transform continuous and discrete wavelet transform provide different advantages for analyzing signals for example continuous wavelet transform is a better selection to extract the feature in time series while discrete wavelet transform is a compact representation of data especially suitable for data compression and noise reduction grinsted et al 2004 since we tend to analyze the low signal noise ratio signals in time series we only discuss the continuous wavelet transform described in the next sub section 2 3 1 the continuous wavelet transform cwt given a time series x i i 1 2 n with an equal time spacing δ t the cwt w i s at the scale s and time t i i δ t can be explained as an improved version of the discrete fourier transformation f w j e x p i ω t j but in ctw the periodic exponential e x p i ω t j is substituted using a wavelet φ t j t i s gedalof et al 2004 which is a function in time and frequency space grinsted et al 2004 the wavelets are subsets of a finite length oscillating wave shape i e mother wavelet that can be contracted and stretched by changing the wavelet scale s and translated by varying the localized time t i the time series can be decomposed based on scale and time grinsted et al 2004 1 w i s j 1 n 1 x j c s φ 0 t j t i s where c s δ t s is the normalization factor in order to φ have unit energy and denotes the complex conjugate the wavelet power can be defined as w i s 2 when a time series is not cyclic the cwt shapes have edge artifacts i e theedgeof a pixel is not aligned with the exact pixel boundary therefore a cone of influence coi has been introduced as a region in the wavelet spectrum such that edge effects are not ignored torrence and compo 1998 the coi is calculated based on the edge discontinuity threshold of e 2 with reference to the guideline in grinsted et al 2004 for each cwt presented as a pale region in the cwt figures in the result section discussed ahead the significance level of the wavelet spectrum is assessed against red noise i e a continuous reduction of spectral scale with increasing frequency schulz and mudelsee 2002 and the statistical significance of the results is evaluated by a significance level of p 0 05 in our study the morlet wavelet was selected as the mother wavelet because it can achieve a balance between frequency and time other alternatives include the mexican hat function and the classic sine function however the morlet wavelet function has been highlighted to be a suitable candidate for the shape of hydrological signals e g gaucherel 2002 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 labat 2005 as it provides a good balance between time and frequency localization the morlet wavelet is defined as 2 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 in which η and ω 0 are dimensionless time and frequency respectively typically ω 0 6 can provide a good balance between frequency and time grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 additional detailed information about cwt can be found in grinsted et al 2004 2 3 2 wavelet transform coherence wtc wtc is a correlation coefficient localized in frequency and time domains quantifying the degree of a linear relationship between time series cazelles et al 2008 for the time series x and y the wavelet transforms are defined as w i x s and w i y s respectively then wavelet coherence is computed using 3 r i 2 s s 1 w i xy s 2 s s 1 w i x s 2 s s 1 w i y s 2 where s denotes a smoothing operator 4 w i xy w i x s w i y s in which indicates the complex conjugate and r i 2 is the correlation coefficient that ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 demonstrates a perfect correlation between the two signals and 0 demonstrates no correlation 2 3 3 multiple wavelet coherence mwc for multiple predictor variables x x x 1 x 2 x p the mwc ρ m 2 s τ at location τ and scale s can be written as 5 ρ m 2 s τ w x y s τ w x x s τ 1 w x y s τ w y y s τ where w x x s τ is the matrix of the smoothed cross and auto wavelet power spectra among multiple variables of x w y y s τ is the smoothed wavelet power spectrum of y w x y s τ is the matrix of the smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between x and y and indicates the complex conjugate hu and si 2016 it is essential to choose a set of scales s in wavelet analysis for the morlet wavelet we can build a more complete picture using an arbitrary set of scales for convenience the scales are selected as outlined in torrence and compo 1998 6 s j s 0 2 j δ j j 0 1 j 7 j δ j 1 log 2 n δ t s 0 in which s 0 and j are the smallest and largest resolvable scale respectively s 0 is considered as the approximately 2 δ t equivalent fourier period for both the bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence the 5 significance level is calculated using the monte carlo method grinsted et al 2004 hu and si 2016 2 4 factor identification and analysis structure the ability of different controlling factors or their combinations to explain soil moisture variations was assessed by the integration of average wavelet coherence awc and the percent area of significance coherence pasc relative to the time frequency domain hu and si 2016 su et al 2019 a greater pasc and larger awc for a particular predictor indicate that the predictor can explain a higher level of soil moisture variance we highlight that applying mwc i e considering more than one controlling factor can result in a larger awc but does not necessarily ensure a greater pasc hu and si 2016 the additional factor added to the single factor scenario i e in two factor and three factor analysis is only considered significant when it could increase pasc by at least 5 hu et al 2017 we first assessed the variations of the studied factors averaged over 1982 to 2020 to have a better understanding of each site s characteristics then we evaluated the temporal scale dependency between the soil moisture considering four depths and controlling factors at a small time scale less than 6 months a medium scale 6 to 12 months and a large scale greater than 12 months at each site next we considered the mean of all time scales and identified the dominant controlling factors of soil moisture variations in three scenarios including i single factors ii pair bivariate factor and iii three factor combinations lastly we concluded the optimal factor combinations for controlling soil moisture variations at each study site and soil depth by evaluating the resulting bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence in the previous steps 3 results 3 1 the variability at each site the average soil temperature trend considering 1982 to 2020 data follows the air temperature trend and broadly the climate of the study sites figs s1 and 2 a given the relatively colder climate of the wcr station illinois a lower range of soil temperature compared to other stations is expected besides this difference the average soil temperature trend shows a similar feature across all study sites the lowest soil temperature occurs during january and the highest occurs during july august the amplitude of fluctuations decreased with the increase of soil depths with a lag in the lower layers different precipitation regimes are identified for the study sites fig 2 b and c there are two distinctive wet and dry periods at man ame joh kfs ne3 and wcr sites and no precipitation seasonality is found at the dex mms bo1 and oho stations the dex and mms stations have the highest annual precipitation 1200 mm and the lowest precipitation occurs at joh and man 450 mm considering the vegetation characteristics of the study sites we found a higher ndvi lai and fapar at the mms and wcr stations while other stations exhibit a similar annual variation fig 3 radiation and vpd range similarly across the stations with a higher range occurring at joh and a lower range at wcr stations the dex site is comparatively calm and relatively higher winds are found at wcr and ame stations the monthly soil moisture variations for each site are shown in fig 4 deeper soil layers experience smaller seasonal variations at a lagged time compared to the topsoil layers the dex site shows the highest range of soil moisture values while the joh site displays the lowest soil moisture variations 3 2 controlling factors considering time scales the awc between soil moisture and controlling factors at a small scale less than 6 months medium scale 6 12 months and large scale greater than 12 months are shown in figs 5 7 respectively the detailed statistics of the calculated awc and pasc for each time scale are provided in table s3 we found the highest coherency between the different environmental factors and soil moisture dynamics at the medium 6 12 months time scale for this time scale vpd emerged as the primary factor modulating the soil moisture dynamics the coherent coefficient for vpd ranges between 0 40 for deeper soil layers to 0 82 for topsoil layers and is notable at the study sites without the wet and dry seasons shifting from medium time scale to higher and lower time frequencies precipitation emerged as a critical variable controlling the soil moisture in deeper soil layers while the influence of vpd is more evident on the topsoil layers the resulting coherency coefficient for precipitation at a small time scale ranges from 0 40 to 0 56 and vpd ranges from 0 50 to 0 60 across the study sites and soil depths at the large time scale the coherency coefficients are higher than the small time scale and range from 0 51 to 0 75 for vpd and 0 56 to 0 70 for precipitation vegetation indices do not show a strong coherence with soil moisture dynamics instances of high coherency between soil moisture and vegetation indices only occur at two forested areas including wcr at the small time scale lai awc 0 53 and oho at the large time scale fapar awc 0 57 3 3 single and multiple controlling factors in this section we present the identified single two and three factor scenarios that characterize the largest awc and pasc correspond to soil moisture changes detailed resulting statistics are shown for three example sites correspond to different vegetation cover in tables 3 and 4 and was also in tables s4 and s5 for the single influential factor scenario the vpd shows the highest awc for the first two layers and as the soil depth increased the precipitation is found to have a more dominant role the only exceptions are the man station for which radiation shows the highest awc for the first soil layer and wcr for which precipitation is the most contributing factor for all soil layers in the single factor scenario 12 54 of the soil moisture variations could be explained by the controlling factors and the impact of the controlling factors is more pronounced in the topsoil layers than the deeper layers for the two factors scenario the combination of precipitation and radiation pre rd is the common dominant combination which accounted for 30 to 58 of the soil moisture variations the next common best combination is precipitation and vapor pressure deficit pre vpd pasc 28 59 particularly for upper soil layers precipitation and soil temperature pre st is also an effective controlling combination which accounts for 39 to 59 of the soil moisture variations for the three factors scenario the combination of precipitation vpd and a vegetation factor is the predominant factor explaining 41 to 60 of soil moisture dynamics in the first and second layers for deeper layers we could not establish a specific trend nevertheless the combinations of precipitation soil temperature and vpd or lai are more highlighted in deeper layers 3 4 coherence in the time frequency domain in this section we present the results of wavelet coherence for the single and multiple factors of the largest coherence identified in the previous section figs 8 to 10 in these figures the y axis shows the periodicity up to 128 months x axis shows the study time 1982 to 2020 and coi is shown as a pale region with black edges overall we noted significant annual periodic characteristics prevailing at different soil depths in all study sites either with intermittent breaks or continuous annual periodicity for the single factor scenario soil moisture variations show a higher coherence with the controlling factor precipitation at wcr and ne3 radiation at man and vpd at the rest of the stations for an 8 to 16 month periodicity fig 8 taking the example of ame station with vpd as the prime controlling factor we noted a high coherence red shaded for a periodicity between 8 and 16 months consistent and continuous throughout the years for radiation the man station there is a continuous coherence throughout the years of study but in smaller periodicity 8 12 months narrower red shadows however for precipitation at wcr and ne3 stations there is intermittent periodicity through the years soil moisture in top layers 0 40 cm displays more fragmentary high frequency oscillations while soil moisture periodicities in deeper layers 40 200 cm are fewer with lower frequency shifting from one factor to the two factor scenario significantly improves the consistency and coherency for the larger periodicity 32 months fig 9 a larger variance can be explained resulting from the two factor combination average pasc 42 1 compared to a single factor 36 5 suggesting that adding a factor to the analysis could help explain soil moisture dynamics table 4 the increases in pasc in the two factor scenarios are mainly due to oscillations with periodicity greater than 32 months switching to two factor combinations does not exhibit large improvements at dex 1st soil layer kfs 3rd soil depth ne3 1st and 4th soil depths and more notably at joh 1st 3rd soil depths stations more specifically the increase is not statistically significant p value 0 05 at the dex 3rd soil depth joh 4th soil depth and kfs 4th soil depth at these stations the additional factors are not significantly different from red noise in explaining additional soil moisture variation adding an additional factor to the two factor combination we noted only a small improvement average pasc 44 25 in the coherency between soil moisture and the controlling factors fig 10 the wavelet coherence between soil moisture and three factor combinations shows similar periodic characteristics as the two factor combinations while awc increases for most locations and soil layers the pasc values only increase in seven study sites for different soil layers the observed difference between the pasc and awc values is primarily attributed to the inefficiency of the added factor third factor to the two factor scenario in explaining the soil moisture variance more specifically the third factor has collinearity with the previous factors which causes overlapping and attenuating effects thus only the factors that individually and independently explained the soil moisture variability are considered influential contributing factors overall at the ame bo1 kfs and ne3 stations we did not observe any advantages by adding the third additional factor other stations experience a range of improvements with more highlighted fragmentary oscillations these stations include forest areas mms oho and wcr a higher coherency by combining three factors for the forested areas suggests more complex surface crop atmosphere interactions compared to grassland and cropland that could not be simply explained by one or two factors 3 5 identifying the optimal combinations of the controlling factor in this section we present the optimal factor combinations that more accurately explain the soil moisture variations at each station table 5 lists the optimal combinations for each soil layer the optimal combination largely varies with stations and soil depths considering the croplands for example in the ame and ne3 stations a combination of precipitation and radiation is the best combination to explore the soil moisture dynamics for most of the soil layers but in joh dex and bo1 sites different combinations of precipitation vpd soil temperature and fapar are found optimal considering the topsoil layers in grasslands precipitation vpd is the optimal factor in the kfs station while the precipitation fapar radiation is the best in the man station variable combinations are found for the deeper layers in these stations with vpd as a common factor in the forested areas the precipitation soil temperature combination is an influential factor for the first soil layer while in deeper layers different combinations of precipitation vpd soil temperature and lai contribute to the resulting optimal factors 4 discussion the soil moisture variations are influenced by the spatiotemporal change in various environmental and meteorological factors in this study we highlight that the dominant factors affecting the soil moisture variability could be different at various time scales locations and soil layers the scale dependency in time is primarily due to the seasonality of the factors while space and location dependency is mostly due to the inherent characteristics of the climate environment and soil aligned with our study liu et al 2017 reported the temporal dependent relationship between soil moisture and precipitation under the impact of plant functional types wilson et al 2004 also report the importance of the spatial distribution of soils and vegetation in controlling spatial soil moisture variations the prime controlling factors vary with soil depths because of the difference in the soil properties and different soil plant atmosphere interactions among the different soil layers soil water holding capacity moisture distribution and movement are known to be a function of soil texture structure and organic matter brouwer et al 1985 gaur and mohanty 2013 additionally the topsoil layer interacts more with environmental variables i e atmospheric forcing water uptake by the canopy that are more exposed to wet and dry cycles after a precipitation episode evaporation occurs at its maximum rate phase one of evaporation and water infiltrates to the lower layers rapidly due to the gravity force the topsoil layers buffer the bottom soil layer and reduce the impact of soil evaporation moreover water extraction by plant roots is less notable in the bottom layers schwartz et al 2010 therefore the factors that causing water extraction from the soil e g vpd radiation are more coherent with the topsoil most of the studied sites resemble this pattern as the soil moisture dynamics of top layers 0 40 cm were found to have more coherence with vpd considering the single factor scenario tables 3 and s4 the topsoil interactions with the atmosphere and exposure to more wet and dry cycles also cause high frequency periodicity which is illustrated by the continuous wavelet power spectrum in figs 8 to 10 in contrast the slower moisture redistribution in the bottom soil layers shows low frequency periodicity as evident in figs 8 10 the dominant controlling factors also vary with time scale due to the different periodicity of the environmental variables particularly precipitation comparing the controlling factors of soil moisture in topsoil layers in the dex and ame stations cropland we observed that in the dex station with no specific wet and dry season the controlling factor vpd in small and medium time scale is similar however in the ame station with distinctive wet and dry seasons precipitation is the most influential factor in a small time scale while vpd is more impactful on a medium time scale for most of the sites with bimodal precipitation patterns the controlling factors changed with different scales since most of the variables discussed in the study have seasonal changes the resulting coherency is strongest at the medium time scale fig 6 however seasonality is not the only determining factor for identifying the controlling factors environmental and climatic features of the study sites are also contributed to the findings to be different spatially for example the wcr station represents a heavily forested area deciduous broadleaf forest at which lai variations show a distinct seasonality fig 3 the increase in lai may to september is synchronized with the wettest months that account for 60 70 of annual precipitation the soil texture however is sandy that does not have a high water holding capacity as a result lai s impact is more evident as an indirect control of the soil moisture variations the mms station also shows a significant jump in lai from may to september fig 3 but precipitation is the prime factor controlling the soil moisture dynamics this station receives more annual precipitation compared to wrc with a heavy soil texture compared to sandy soil in wrc therefore the coherency between soil moisture and lai is not the strongest at the mms station the combinations of precipitation with radiation vpd and soil temperature are the most common to control the soil moisture variability precipitation provides the inputs to a soil system while radiation and vpd cause water extraction from the system radiation provides the source of energy for the latent heat requirement vpd provides the gradient for the evaporating and transpiration bodies i e soil and plants and soil temperature contributes to energy flux that affects soil evaporation and biophysical processes for root water uptake these variables have seasonal and inter annual variability see figs 2 and 3 which strengthens their coherence with soil moisture by affecting the evaporative demand and heat balance temperature and altering the gradient for soil evaporation and plant transpiration historically the role of vpd in manipulating soil moisture has been overlooked however consistent with our study more recent evaluations have shown the role of vpd on soil moisture dynamic particularly during periods of hydrologic stress kimm et al 2020 lobell et al 2013 lobell et al 2014 novick et al 2015 kimm et al 2020 reported that vpd could explain nearly 90 of maize and soybean transpiration variability in the u s midwest vpd role in plants is linked with stomatal activity and overall water uptake by the roots jamshidi et al 2021 plant stomata primarily regulates the balance between water loss from the leaves and co2 uptake from the atmosphere katul et al 2012 in a high vpd environment plants tend to increase stomatal resistance and restrict photosynthetic activities huang et al 2017 high vpd periods often coincide with low precipitation due to the reduction of specific humidity and increased temperature gentine et al 2016 green et al 2017 therefore the role of vpd could be more pronounced in water limited areas in our study the impact of vpd is particularly pronounced at the joh site with low annual precipitation and during the drought years soil temperature variations are caused by latent heat exchanges between the soil surface and aboveground atmosphere onwuka 2018 the heat transfer between the soil layers zhao et al 2008 soil temperature affects different soil biological physical and chemical properties which consequently influence plant growth in various pathways clarke et al 2015 karandish and shahnazari 2016 for example toselli et al 1999 described a lower water update by the plants in low soil temperature due to the increased water viscosity on the other hand with the increase in soil temperature the metabolic activity of plants root improves and leads to root proliferation and higher water uptakes callejas et al 2009 lahti et al 2005 soil temperature can also directly contribute to soil evaporation kidron and kronenfeld 2016 reported that for a 1 c increase in soil temperature the evaporation rate increases by 0 07 mm day although the study was done over a desert region it highlights the importance of soil heat storage impact on soil moisture variations our study results highlight that the root morphology and the rooting depth vary by plant type yang et al 2016 the grass species at man and kfs stations distribute their root within 50 cm of the soil profile thus depleting the surface soil moisture causes them to senesce eggemeyer et al 2009 in contrast woody plants in the forested sites could extract water from deeper soil layers below 50 cm when the water content of the upper soil profile falls below readily available water moisture the deeper effective rooting depth in forested sites and their flexibility to extract water from deeper layers is likely the reason for the lower coherence between precipitation and soil moisture at the forested sites mms wcr oho in figs 5 7 and s2 the vegetation indices considered in our study ndvi fapar lai are not effectively bound with meteorological data to explain the soil moisture variability only some instances were found at ame dex wcr stations the feedback between soil moisture dynamics and vegetation is more complicated than soil and climate properties schneider et al 2008a and the physiological and phenological characteristics of vegetation could indirectly affect soil moisture english et al 2005 three different vegetation types characterize our study sites i cropland ii forest and iii grasslands the different structures of the aboveground canopy of the vegetation covers in our study site have likely altered the precipitation amount reaching the under canopy surface due to canopy interception acharya et al 2017 liu et al 2017 this disparity could be the reason for a higher periodicity in the topsoil layers which is mostly observed in grasslands compared to the croplands and forested areas figs 8 10 5 conclusion the bivariate and multiple wavelet coherence were used to explore the scale dependent coherence between the soil moisture dynamics and possible agro meteorological factors in the u s midwest the complexity of soil moisture canopy and atmosphere continuum can be better visualized and analyzed using the wavelet analysis particularly considering the predictors intricate dynamics our results highlight the importance of vpd in controlling soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil layers 0 100 cm more evidently when a medium time scale is considered in contrast soil moisture of deeper layers is primarily controlled by precipitation particularly for small and large time scales by performing the analysis using the historical records of the data 1982 2020 the role of vpd is more dominant during the drought years this finding is notable for quantifying drought severity in agriculturally dominated areas such as the u s midwest the multivariate analysis shows that the combination of precipitation vpd and vegetation indexes can better interpret soil moisture variability and this combination is time and location dependent depending on the climate of the study site e g temperature range precipitation regimes evaporative demand and the land cover e g forest cropland the optimal combination varies nevertheless while some key factors affecting the soil moisture variability are intuitive e g precipitation we emphasized the role of vpd which is typically overlooked in soil moisture analysis our assessments can be used as a data driven approach for developing or expanding soil moisture networks modeling and predicting soil moisture dynamics and the corresponding hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration modeling or flood prediction in particular our findings can contribute to developing more adaptive algorithms for downscaling and upscaling soil moisture from the coarse climate model or satellite data currently high resolution soil moisture data are generated either based on interpolating in situ data or using statistical dynamical approaches to downscale remotely sensed data nayak and villarini 2018 niyogi et al 2017 we identified the soil moisture association for agro meteorological variables at different time frequency domains such information will be useful for parameterizing the statistical distributions of surface and subsurface soil moisture when coarse spatial resolution data are downscaled or interpolated across a region 6 data availability statement the data can be obtained from the

4211,this work developed four inverse models based on particle swarm optimization pso chicken swarm optimization cso bees algorithm ba and teaching learning based optimization tlbo to identify parameters of space fractional advection dispersion equation s fade the s fade has four parameters including average pore water velocity v fractional dispersion coefficient d f fractional derivative order α and skewness β a sensitivity analysis indicated that the v is the most effective parameter on the s fade results followed by α d f and β respectively the experimental data required were measured at different transport distances of homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns five criteria namely convergence trend objective function value runtime repeatability of results and modeling complexity were used to evaluate algorithm performances and to rank them using a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis based on the obtained results all four algorithms acquired the global optimal values for the v and α parameters using a maximum iteration of 1000 as a stopping criterion and an initial population of 10 while they obtained the relatively different values for the d f and β parameters the pso and tlbo algorithms successfully found the global minimum values of the objective functions for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils among the four algorithms the tlbo algorithm was the best one in terms of convergence trend repeatability of results and modeling complexity and it was the worst algorithm in term of runtime among the pso cso and ba algorithms the ba algorithm was superior over the pso and cso algorithms in terms of runtime and repeatability of results while the pso algorithm was superior over the ba and cso algorithms in term of converge speed overall according to the results of the topsis method the tlbo algorithm was the best alternative to estimate the s fade parameters followed by ba pso and cso algorithms also the comparison of the s fade parameters estimated by the tlbo algorithm as the best one among the four algorithms with those estimated by fracfit toolbox revealed that both the techniques obtained the relatively identical and admissible values for the v and α parameters while the tlbo algorithm acquired the more precise values for the d f and β parameters a detailed analyses demonstrated that the tlbo algorithm was markedly superior to the fracfit toolbox in terms of the aforementioned criteria in a nutshell the tlbo algorithm can be used as a highly efficient optimization method to estimate the s fade parameters in both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous soils keywords fracfit toolbox non fickian transport gradient based optimization algorithms inverse problem method teaching learning based optimization topsis method 1 introduction groundwater is one of the worthiest water resources for human life two major issues of depletion and degradation threaten groundwater which affect the quantity and the quality of the groundwater resources an accurate modeling of contaminant movement in groundwater is critical to efficiently manage the groundwater systems as well known contaminant transport usually takes place in a multiscale heterogeneous environment neuman and tartakovsky 2009 the heterogeneity of a porous medium gives rise to a non fickian transport process at all scales neuman and tartakovsky 2009 which often cannot be well described by advection dispersion equation ade berkowitz et al 2006 todays the nonlocal solute transport models are recommended to capture the non fickian transport process space fractional advection dispersion equation s fade is one of promising spatially nonlocal models to characterize the non fickian transport in which the second order derivative of the dispersion term is replaced with a fractional order derivative schumer et al 2001 the s fade captures well the super diffusive transport zhang et al 2009 the estimation complexity of the s fade parameters i e average pore water velocity v fractional dispersion coefficient d f order of fractional differentiation α and skewness of the transport process β is the main obstacle to practical implementation of this model benson et al 2000a obtained separately the parameters of the symmetrical s fade using a measured plume variance in other work benson et al 2001 estimated the index α using hydraulic conductivity statistics the separate estimation of the transport parameters is problematic therefore zhou and selim 2003 presented an approach to appraise the α and d f simultaneously built upon relationship between transport distance variance and mean transport distance or time they proposed the three types of the relationships including linear non linear and logarithmic the results of this method strongly depend on the type of the relationship used the simultaneous estimation of the v d f α and β is a promising approach which is conducted using an inverse problem method this method has been used extensively and provided very satisfactory results in previous studies some of these inverse models utilized gradient based optimization algorithms e g pachepsky et al 2000 huang et al 2006 gao et al 2009 martinez et al 2010 wei et al 2017 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2020 while some of them utilized metaheuristic algorithms e g kelly et al 2017 mehdinejadiani 2017 the gradient based optimization algorithms require computing the derivatives of the objective function with respect to model parameters bharat et al 2009 and suffer from high dependency on the initial guess of the solution vector problem of choosing the learning step that gives good convergence and high probability of sticking in local optima faris et al 2018 in addition the gradient based optimization algorithms have some other sharp drawbacks in solving complex problems such as micro grid planning vehicle routing unit commitment and community detection in social networks deb et al 2020 the metaheuristic algorithms orchestrate an interaction between exploitation local search around a good solution and exploration global search in the whole solution space to avoid trapping at local optima and perform a robust search in the solution space the metaheuristic algorithms are also called stochastic algorithms with randomization and global exploration space because these algorithms generate an initial solution randomly and then enhance the solution by an iterative local search procedure the metaheuristic algorithms can be classified into single solution and population based algorithms elshaer and awad 2020 which the population based ones include evolutionary algorithms e g genetic algorithm ga evolutionary strategy es differential evolution de flower pollination algorithm fpa and scatter search ss and swarm intelligence algorithms e g bees algorithm ba ant colony optimization aco particle swarm optimization pso chicken swarm optimization cso whale optimization algorithm woa and teaching learning based optimization tlbo mirjalili and lewis 2016 elshaer and awad 2020 metaheuristic algorithms have been widely applied to solve complex problems in the field of water resources and agriculture for example bharat et al 2009 formulated an inverse model based on the pso algorithm to estimate the parameters of a diffusion model they demonstrated that the pso algorithm was an efficient and robust alternative to obtain the parameters and guaranteed the global solution zhang et al 2010 successfully applied a version of the ga called micro ga to determine the effective soil hydraulic properties the ga and aco were applied to identify hydraulic parameters of confined unconfined and leaky aquifers by bateni et al 2015 and their performances were compared with those of graphical and nonlinear programming nlp techniques the results demonstrated the superiority of the ga and aco to the graphical and nlp techniques in estimating the aquifer hydraulic parameters also the outcomes revealed that the aco converges to the optimal solution faster than other techniques studied a matlab toolbox fracfit was presented by kelly et al 2017 to find the optimal parameters of four fractional models the fracfit is a flexible toolbox so that the user can select either lsqnonlin routine a gradient based algorithm or ga routine a metaheuristic algorithm mehdinejadiani 2017 appraised the parameters of the symmetrical s fade using an inverse model which utilized the ba as the optimization algorithm the results of this work revealed that the ba compared to the fracfit toolbox gave much more accurate estimations of the s fade parameters the applicability of several metaheuristic algorithms including imperialist competitive algorithm ica the pso ba and ga for allocating water to agricultural farms were compared by saeidian et al 2019 the findings of this work showed that the income resulting from the water allocation by the ica was maximum and the ica and pso outperformed the ba and ga in most evaluations madadi et al 2020 formulated the solute transport process in rivers using transient storage model and identified its parameters by applying an improved version of symbiotic organism search sos algorithm statistical indices indicted that the improved sos algorithm was superior to the others in estimating the parameters of the transient storage model wu et al 2020 coupled extreme learning machine elm model with woa and fpa and developed two hybrid models of woaelm and fpaelm for monthly pan evaporation ep prediction they found that the fpaelm predicted the monthly ep more accurate than the woaelm and both of which were superior to differential evolution algorithm optimized elm deelm improved m5 model tree m5p and artificial neural networks ann models in addition to the above mentioned there is a large body of research on the efficiency of the metaheuristic algorithms in solving the optimization problems of the water resources and agricultural engineering e g ines and droogers 2002 ayvaz et al 2007 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 okkan and kirdemir 2020 yu et al 2020 which are not mentioned here for the sake of brevity however to the best authors knowledge the application of the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters has not been reported so far thus the main goal of the present work is to investigate the capabilities of the pso cso and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters moreover the performances of the above mentioned algorithms will be compared with that of the fracfit toolbox 2 materials and methods 2 1 governing equation the one dimensional form of the s fade for a non reactive contaminant can be expressed as follows benson et al 2000b 1 c x t t v c x t x 1 2 1 β d f α c x t x α 1 2 1 β d f α c x t x α where c x t is the solute concentration m l 3 t is the time t x is the spatial coordinate l v is the average pore water velocity l t 1 d f is the fractional dispersion coefficient l α t 1 α 1 2 denotes the order of the fractional derivative dimensionless β 1 1 denotes the skewness of the transport process dimensionless α c x t x α and α c x t x α are the left and right side riemann liouville fractional derivatives which have the following forms respectively kilbas et al 2006 2a α c x t x α 1 γ

the analytical solution of the s fade for an initially solute free and semi finite soil column in which a non reactive contaminant with concentration c 0 is continuously injected at x 0 can be expressed as follows benson et al 2000b 3a c x t c 0 1 f α β x v t σ where σ cos π α 2 d f t 1 α and f α β denotes the standard stable cumulative probabilities computed for α 1 and z 0 as follows

implemented a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of the input parameters i e v d f α and β on the results of the s fade the sensitivity analysis was conducted by calculating normalized sensitivities of s fade results with respect to the input parameters whose details are given in supplementary materials after sensitivity analysis we developed four separate inverse models based on the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters as well known each inverse model consists of three components including design variables an objective function and an optimization algorithm in the present work the design variables were the s fade parameters i e v d f α and β and the objective function was formulated as follows 4a minimize o f i 1 n ω i e i 2 where of is the objective function n is the number of measurement points and e i is the difference between the calculated and measured concentrations at a certain distance and at time t i i e 4b e i c i calc c i meas in eq 4a ω i is the i th normalized weight coefficient defined as follows kelly et al 2017 4c ω i 1 c i meas c 0 1 c i meas c 0 as above mentioned each inverse model utilizes an optimization algorithm we used the pso cso ba and tlbo as optimization algorithms in the developed inverse models for the sake of brevity the descriptions of these algorithms are presented in supplementary materials 2 3 collection of experimental data a series of tracer tests were performed in a laboratory setup fig 1 to measure the data required for the implementation of the inverse models the setup consists of a plexiglas pipe with a height of 200 cm and a diameter of 10 cm which is installed on a cubic shaped box with dimensions of 20 20 20 cm and held by three metal rods the inside wall of the plexiglas pipe was roughened by gluing sand particles to diminish the wall flow effect six ports with intervals of 30 cm were created in the pipe wall for sampling water the ports were wrapped by nylon mesh to protect them from clogging the distilled water or nacl solution were stored in two plastic tanks which were connected to the cubic shaped box using hoses a pump model rkm 60 550 w made in prc established the flows through soil columns whose rates were adjusted by cut off valves and measured by a flow meter the tracer tests were conducted in both homogeneous and heterogeneous saturated porous media the homogeneous porous medium was a 120 cm vertical soil column prepared with a medium textured sand see fig 2 however the heterogeneous porous medium was a 180 cm vertical soil column prepared with a mixture of coarse medium and fine textured sands gravel and pebbles of 1 to 5 mm in diameter see fig 2 the sands were collected from the deposits of a river bed and washed well with tap water several times finally the clean sands were desalinated by distilled water air dried and sieved using standard sieve series of american society for testing and materials astm after the preparation of the sands the columns were filled with the sands under saturated conditions and tapped by a rubber rod to avoid air entrapment and to achieve a uniform packing after filling each column with sand the pump was turned on and established an upward flow of the distilled water through the soil column prior to each tracer test the flow rates of 260 and 550 ml min 1 were established in the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively note that these flow rates were kept constant during the tracer tests subsequently the nacl solution at a concentration of 500 mg l 1 as a tracer was continuously injected into the soil columns after the start of the tracer injection we took water samples from the ports at 1 min intervals and measured their electrical conductivities ecs using a calibrated ec meter orion model 130a germany then the ec values were converted to the nacl concentration by a calibration curve note that we stopped the water sampling and the ec measurement at each port when the nacl concentration nearly reached the inflow concentration and finally we characterized the measured breakthrough curve btc at each distance by drawing the variations of the measured concentrations versus the time at that distance 2 4 execution of developed inverse models as mentioned in section 2 2 the four inverse models were developed based on the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters the scripts of the inverse models were prepared in the matlab software in all algorithms the maximum number of iteration ite r max was considered as the stopping criterion we set the parameters of the algorithms according to table 1 to appraise the s fade parameters at each distance the analytical solution of the s fade was fitted to the measured btc at that distance using the developed inverse models it is necessary to mention that each inverse model was executed 10 times at each distance and the average value of 10 runs was reported as the final result at that distance the root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r2 were utilized as two indicators to assess the goodness of fit of the inverse models and consequently the goodness of fit of the algorithms which were calculated as follows sanikhani et al 2018 5a rmse 1 n i 1 n c i calc c i meas 2 5b r 2 i 1 n c i meas c meas c i calc c calc i 1 n c i meas c meas 2 i 1 n c i calc c calc 2 2 where c meas and c calc are respectively the average of the measured and calculated concentrations at a given distance and the other variables are defined as in eq 4b 2 5 performance evaluation of algorithms in this study we utilized the five comparative criteria namely convergence trend objective function value runtime repeatability of results and modeling complexity to evaluate the performances of the algorithms at each transport distance then we ranked the algorithms using the computational method of the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis which is detailed in supplementary materials according to the mentioned criteria note that each algorithm was run 10 times at each transport distance to evaluate the aforementioned criteria from viewpoint of the convergence trend the accessibility to a relatively stable optimal solution or a relatively constant objective function value after a less iteration number can imply the primacy of an algorithm as mentioned in eq 4a the objective function should be minimized to estimate the optimal values of the s fade parameters therefore a less objective function value can be a superiority criterion of an algorithm the runtimes were evaluated by executing each algorithm for a specific iteration number then the average values of the runtimes were compared it is clear that a less runtime is an advantage for an algorithm to evaluate the repeatability criterion the variances of the objective function values in 10 times run of each algorithm were calculated it should be noted that a smaller variance represents a more repeatable solution and as a result a prominent algorithm the criterion of the modeling complexity is related to the number of parameters of each algorithm from users viewpoint an algorithm with a smaller number of parameters is superior to that with a larger number of parameters from the above descriptions one can find that all criteria are negative 2 6 performance comparison of the best algorithm with fracfit toolbox in this study the performance of the most efficient algorithm among the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters was compared with that of the fracfit toolbox this toolbox can be applied to continuous and instantaneous injections the fracfit toolbox utilizes eq 4a as the objective function and it allows the user to choose the lsqnonlin routine or the ga routine as an optimization algorithm in the present study we chose the ga routine as a metaheuristic algorithm to estimate the s fade parameters and we used the ite r max 200 as the stopping criterion and the initial population of 10 n pop 10 to execute the fracfit toolbox and the best algorithm selected among the four others similar to the mentioned in section 2 4 the fracfit toolbox and the best algorithm were executed 10 times at each transport distance and the average value of 10 runs was reported as the final result at that distance the rmse r2 mean bias error mbe standard deviation of the residual sd nash sutcliffe s efficiency nse t statistic ts uncertainty at 95 u95 and global performance indicator gpi were used as the indicators to assess the goodness of fit of the fracfit toolbox and the best algorithm the rmse and r2 indicators were calculated using eqs 5a and 5b and the others were calculated using the following formulae gueymard 2014 behar et al 2015 sanikhani et al 2018 5c mbe 1 n c meas i 1 n c i calc c i meas 5d sd 1 c meas i 1 n n c i calc c i meas 2 i 1 n c i calc c i meas 2 n 5e nse 1 i 1

and gpi would be respectively 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 and 0 for a perfect model gueymard 2014 behar et al 2015 finally we compared the performances of the fracfit toolbox with that of the best algorithm using the criteria of the convergence trend objective function value runtime and repeatability of results 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity of s fade to input parameters fig 3 shows the results of sensitivity analysis as observed the v parameter has the greatest impact on the s fade results followed by α d f and β parameters respectively this finding implies that the precise estimation of the v parameter is utmost important to correctly simulate the solute concentration by the s fade further inspections reveal that the variation of the v parameter significantly influences the mean travel distance while the variation of the β parameter only slightly affects the btc skewness see fig 4 a and 4b also the variation of the α parameter influences the early and late time tails of the btc while the variation of the d f parameter only affects the late time tails of the btc see fig 4c and d 3 2 estimation results of parameters by algorithms tables 2 and 3 list the s fade parameters estimated by the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms and the associated values of rmse and r2 at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively it is necessary to mention that the values presented in table 2 are the average values of the parameters obtained from 10 runs one can find from tables 2 and 3 that all algorithms yield the relatively equal values for the v and α parameters while they yield the relatively different values for the d f and β parameters although the d f and β values resulted from algorithms are different the rmse and r2 values of all algorithms are close to their ideal values 0 and 1 respectively at all distances this can be related to this fact that all algorithms are capable of estimating the global optimal values for the v and α parameters the more effective parameters on the s fade results using ite r max 1000 as the stopping criterion and n pop 10 the coincidence of the fitted and measured btcs also demonstrates that the four algorithms obtain the global optimal values for the s fade parameters especially v and α parameters at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns for example figs 5 and 6 show the fitted and measured btcs at the 120 and 180 cm distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively as observed in table 2 the α values estimated by all algorithms are less than 2 at all distances this means that the solute transport process is non fickian at all distances of the homogeneous soil column the non fickian transport process can be related to the heterogeneity of the soil at microscopic scale al tabbaa et al 2000 and the relatively non uniform packing of the soil column xiong et al 2006 the previous studies e g benson et al 2000a huang et al 2006 mehdinejadiani 2017 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2020 sharma et al 2020 have also reported the non fickian transport process in homogeneous porous media according to the α values the soil column is relatively homogeneous up to the transport distance of 30 cm and it is averagely homogenous at the other transport distances clarke et al 2005 these findings are in agreement with the physical properties of the used sand because the homogeneous soil column was filled with a relatively uniform sand according to the α values presented in table 3 the solute transport process in the heterogeneous soil column significantly deviates from the fickian type transport as observed the α values vary within the ranges of 1 3 1 7 for the 30 90 60 120 and 150 cm transport distances and 1 1 to 1 3 for the 180 cm transport distance this finding implies that the soil column is averagely heterogeneous up to the 150 cm transport distance while it is relatively heterogeneous at the 180 cm transport distance clarke et al 2005 these findings are consistent with the physical properties of the used sands because the heterogeneous soil column was filled with a mixture of coarse medium and fine textured sands gravel and pebbles of 1 5 mm in diameter it is also found from tables 2 and 3 that the α values of the heterogeneous soil column are consistently smaller than those of the homogeneous soil column this finding implies the more deviation of the transport process from the fickian type transport in the heterogeneous soil column which is in excellent agreement with the results of the previous studies e g huang et al 2006 xiong et al 2006 mehdinejadiani 2017 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2020 3 3 performance comparison of algorithms 3 3 1 comparison of convergence trends figs 7 and 8 illustrate the convergence trends of the four algorithms to minimize the objective function in a semi logarithmic coordinate system at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively it is necessary to mention that the convergence trends displayed in figs 7 and 8 are related to the best run among the 10 runs executed at each transport distance as observed the convergence speed of the four algorithms is extremely high in the initial iterations then gradually reduces and finally the algorithms converge in addition to the comparison of the convergence trends the mean convergence speeds of the four algorithms were also compared the mean convergence speeds were calculated by averaging the number of iterations in which each algorithm reached a constant value of the objective function and consequently constant values of the parameters fig 9 shows that the tlbo algorithm provides the fastest convergence speed to achieve the optimal solution at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns while the cso algorithm provides the lowest convergence speed to achieve the optimal solution in the homogeneous soil when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 the tlbo pso ba and cso algorithms averagely converge within 162 520 593 and 723 iterations respectively in the heterogeneous soil when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 the tlbo pso ba and cso algorithms averagely converge within 133 439 452 and 723 iterations respectively these findings demonstrate that the tlbo algorithm converges very fast to the optimal solution at all transport distances of the heterogeneous soil column followed by the pso ba and cso algorithms respectively 3 3 2 comparison of objective function values tables 4 and 5 present the mean objective function values obtained by the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively note that the objective function values mentioned in tables 4 and 5 are the average values of the objective functions acquired by each algorithm in 10 runs as observed in the homogeneous soil the four algorithms converge to the relatively equal objective function values in the heterogeneous soil the cso and ba algorithms converge to the relatively equal objective function values while the pso and tlbo algorithms converge to relatively equal ones in this soil the objective function values obtained by the pso and tlbo algorithms are somewhat less than those obtained by the cso and ba algorithms these findings imply that when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 the pso and tlbo algorithms converge to the global minimum values of the objective functions in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils 3 3 3 comparison of runtimes tables 4 and 5 give the mean runtimes of the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively the mean runtime at each distance is the average of the computation times elapsed by each algorithm in 10 runs when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 from tables 4 and 5 it can be found that the ba algorithm requires the least runtimes at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns while the tlbo algorithm requires the most runtimes to find the global optimal values of the s fade parameters the ba pso cso and tlbo algorithms averagely require the runtimes of 188 6 240 3 258 2 and 520 6 s in the homogeneous soil and 266 7 381 9 415 9 and 703 4 s in the heterogeneous soil respectively these findings reveal that the ba algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms in term of runtime 3 3 4 comparison of repeatability of results table 6 summarizes the variances of the objective function values at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 as observed the variances of the objective function values resulted from the tlbo algorithm approximately equal to zero at all transport distances this implies the full repeatability of the objective function values and therefore of the s fade parameter values obtained by the tlbo algorithm at each distance to further investigate this finding the variance of the s fade parameter values acquired by the tlbo algorithm was calculated at each distance according to the obtained results the variances of the s fade parameter values approximately equal to zero at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns therefore the tlbo algorithm is capable of obtaining the fully repeatable values for the s fade parameters at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns and it is significantly superior to the other three algorithms in term of repeatability of results also a detailed comparison of repeatability of the results obtained by the pso ba and cso algorithms indicates that in the homogeneous soil the variances of the objective function values yielded from the ba are significantly less than those yielded from the cso and pso algorithms this finding signifies that the s fade parameter values resulted from the ba algorithm are more repeatable than those resulted from the cso and pso algorithms the comparison of the variance values associated to the cso and pso algorithms reveals that the pso algorithms obtains more repeatable results at 60 and 90 cm distances while the cso algorithms obtains more repeatable ones at 30 and 120 cm distances see table 6 based on the obtained variances the mean variance values of the pso and cso algorithms are 79 39 10 9 and 31 83 10 9 respectively one can infer from this finding that the s fade parameter values acquired by the cso algorithm are more repeatable than those acquired by the pso algorithm in the heterogeneous soil the variances of the objective function values resulted from the ba algorithm at all transport distances are meaningfully less than the variances of those yielded from the pso and cso algorithms see table 6 thus one can conclude that compared to the pso and cso algorithms the ba algorithm acquires more repeatable results it is also found from table 6 that the variances of the objective function values come from the cso algorithm at all distances are less than the variances of those yielded from the pso algorithm except at the distances of 150 and 180 cm according to the mean variance values of the pso and cso algorithms respectively 1443 10 9 and 245 4 10 9 the cso algorithm leads to more repeatable results than the pso algorithm overall the repeatability of results is the highest for the tlbo algorithm at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns followed by the ba cso and pso algorithms 3 3 5 comparison of modeling complexity table 1 tabulates the parameters of the algorithms studied here as we know these parameters are set by the user as observed the pso ba and cso algorithms require five parameters to solve an optimization problem while the tlbo algorithm only needs one parameter as mentioned in section 2 5 the smaller number of parameters makes the users more comfortable with the algorithm hence the tlbo algorithm is the simplest algorithm among the four algorithms and it is superior to them in term of modeling complexity furthermore one can say that the pso ba and cso algorithms are similar from the viewpoint of the modeling complexity because they require the identical number of setting parameters 3 3 6 ranking results of algorithms we now rank the four algorithms on the basis of the relative closeness values to the ideal solutions obtained by the topsis method fig 10 presents the relative closeness values to the ideal solutions for the algorithms at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively the results indicate that the tlbo algorithm attains the maximum relative closeness values at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns hence we rank the tlbo algorithm as the best ones among the four algorithms the relative closeness values of the ba algorithm are less than those of the tlbo algorithm and more than those of the pso and cso algorithms therefore the ba algorithm lies in the second place it is also found from fig 10 that the relative closeness values to the ideal solutions associated to the pso algorithm are more than those associated to the cso algorithm except at the 90 cm distance of the homogeneous soil and at the 60 90 and 120 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil the relative closeness values associated to the pso algorithm are less than those associated to the cso algorithm at the 90 cm distance of the homogeneous soil and at the 60 and 90 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil while the relative closeness values associated to the pso and cso algorithms are equal at the 120 cm distance of the heterogeneous soil the mean relative closeness values of the pso and cso algorithms in the homogenous soil respectively 0 3400 and 0 3500 and in the heterogeneous soil respectively 0 3433 and 0 3217 reveal that both algorithms have a relatively similar efficiency to appraise the s fade parameters overall we can prioritize the algorithms in order of tlbo ba pso and cso as a result of the analyses one can conclude that among the four algorithms the tlbo algorithm is the most robust one to estimate the s fade parameters in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils 3 4 estimation results of parameters by tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox as mentioned in section 3 3 6 the tlbo algorithm gains the best performance to appraise the s fade parameters among the four algorithms studied in this work therefore we compared the performance of the tlbo algorithm with that of the fracfit toolbox to estimate the s fade parameters tables 7 and 8 give the s fade parameters appraised by the tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox along with the associated values of the indicators at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively the parameter values reported in tables 7 and 8 are the mean parameter values which were obtained by averaging the parameter values in 10 runs the indicator values signify that the tlbo algorithm provides better estimations for the s fade parameters than the fracfit toolbox at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns the graphical comparison of the fitted and measured btcs including the coincidence of the fitted and measured btcs figs 11 and 12 and scatterplots fig 13 also confirms the above findings that is the tlbo algorithm compared to the fracfit toolbox estimates the s fade parameters more accurately in addition to the above mentioned a deep analysis of the parameters estimated by the tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox reveals that the v values obtained by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox vary within ranges of 2 802 4 629 and 3 109 4 614 cm min 1 for the homogeneous soil respectively and they vary within ranges of 3 388 to 7 363 and 4 335 to 7 676 cm min 1 for the heterogeneous soil respectively therefore the variation domains of the v values obtained by the two techniques are relatively similar indeed the v values acquired by the two techniques are close to each other except at the 30 cm distance of the homogeneous soil and at the 30 and 60 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil see tables 7 and 8 as a result both the techniques perform relatively similar in estimating the v parameter which is the most effective parameter on the s fade results a detailed inspection of the α values indicates that the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox acquire the α values for the homogeneous soil column in the ranges of 1 597 to 1 749 and 1 621 to 1 847 respectively see table 7 based on the α values estimated by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox the soil column is relatively homogeneous up to the transport distance of 30 cm and is averagely homogeneous at the other transport distances clarke et al 2005 therefore the α values stemmed from the two techniques are acceptable and accordant with the physical properties of the used sand because the homogeneous soil column was filled with a relatively uniform sand by the same token we investigated the estimated α values for the heterogeneous soil column in detail as observed in table 8 the α values estimated by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox are in the ranges of 1 376 to 1705 and 1 490 to 1 694 respectively according to the α values acquired by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox the soil column is averagely heterogeneous clarke et al 2005 these findings seem logical with regards to the physical properties of the used sand because the heterogeneous soil column was filled with three different sand textures gravel and pebbles of 1 to 5 mm in diameter therefore the two techniques are correctly capable of estimating the α parameter in both the homogenous and the heterogeneous soils which is the second important parameter affecting the s fade results in contrary to the v and α parameters the d f parameter values resulted from the two techniques differ significantly from each other in both the soils the d f values appraised by the fracfit toolbox at the 30 60 90 and 120 cm distances of the homogeneous soil column are respectively 2 134 1 613 2 859 and 3 882 times those estimated by the tlbo algorithm see table 7 similarly it is observed from table 8 that the d f values resulted from the fracfit toolbox at the 30 120 150 and 180 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil are respectively 1 623 1 323 1 610 and 2 679 times those yielded from the tlbo algorithm note that the d f values obtained from the two techniques are approximately equal at the 60 and 90 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil column by continuing the analysis of the estimated parameter values we find that the β values obtained by the two techniques are significantly different in magnitude and the same in sign at all transport distances of both the soils as observed in tables 7 and 8 the magnitude of the β values estimated by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox vary from 0 2282 to 0 3669 and 0 1505 to 0 5709 for the homogeneous soil respectively and they vary from 0 3812 to 0 9999 and 0 1348 to 0 5087 for the heterogeneous soil respectively indeed according to these findings the two techniques obtain different jump sizes for contaminant particles in the same directions 3 5 performance comparison of the tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox figs 14 and 15 depict the convergence trends of the two techniques for the best run among the 10 runs of each technique at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively to better illustrate we chose the logarithmic scale for iteration axis as observed the convergence speed of the two techniques is faster in the earlier iterations then it decelerates gradually and finally the techniques converge the comparison of convergence trends of the tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox reveals that in general the convergence trend of the tlbo algorithm is faster in the earlier iterations and smoother in the later iterations to further investigate we also compared the mean convergence speeds of the two techniques to this end we considered the mean number of iterations in which each technique achieved a constant value of the objective function as a mean convergence speed as seen in fig 16 the tlbo algorithm converges much faster than the fracfit toolbox at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns a detailed investigation elucidates that the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox averagely converge in the homogeneous soil after almost 56 and 155 iterations respectively and they averagely converge in the heterogeneous soil after almost 53 and 155 iterations respectively table 9 presents the mean objective function values obtained by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns similar to section 3 3 2 the objective function values reported in table 9 are average values of the objective functions acquired by each technique in 10 runs according to the results the objective function values to which the tlbo algorithm converges are significantly less than those to which the fracfit toolbox converges at all distances these findings imply the superiority of the tlbo algorithm over the fracfit toolbox in minimizing the objective function and consequently in finding the globally optimal values of the s fade parameters we also compared the two techniques in term of runtime as shown in table 9 compared to the fracfit toolbox the tlbo algorithm requires much less runtime to converge at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns the runtime decreases on average almost four times when the tlbo algorithm is applied to estimate the s fade parameters instead of the fracfit toolbox finally we evaluated the repeatability of the results obtained from the two techniques for this purpose we calculated the variances of the objective function values at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns as observed in table 10 the variances of the objective function values resulted from the tlbo algorithm are approximately equal to zero at all distances this signifies the full repeatability of the objective function values and therefore of the s fade parameter values obtained by the tlbo algorithm in different runs at each distance however the variances of the objective function values resulted from the fracfit toolbox suggest that the toolbox might lead to variable results in different runs at each distance overall the performance comparison of the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox demonstrates that the tlbo algorithm is markedly superior to the fracfit toolbox in terms of convergence trend objective function value runtime and repeatability of results 4 conclusion the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the performances of the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms for the estimation of the s fade parameters and to compare the performance of the best algorithm among them with that of the fracfit toolbox to this end first of all we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of the input parameters i e v d f α and β then we developed four inverse models based on the aforementioned algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters and we carried out the tracer tests in the saturated homogeneous and heterogeneous vertical soil columns with diameters of 10 cm to implement the developed inverse models and the fracfit toolbox the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns were respectively 120 and 180 cm in length and we measured the experimental btcs at the 30 cm intervals the four algorithms were evaluated according to the criteria of convergence trend objective function value runtime repeatability of results and modeling complexity and then prioritized using the topsis method the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the v parameter had the greatest impact on the s fade results followed by α d f and β parameters respectively when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 all four algorithms obtained the global optimal values for the v and α parameters the more effective parameters on the s fade results while they obtained the relatively different values for the d f and β parameters the less effective parameters on the s fade results also the α values estimated by the algorithms described well the non fickian transport process and the soil heterogeneity degrees in the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils the pso and tlbo algorithms converged to the global minimum values of the objective functions in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils among the four algorithms the tlbo algorithm exhibited the best performance in terms of convergence trend repeatability of results and modeling complexity while it exhibited the worst performance in term of runtime the comparison of the pso cso and ba algorithms demonstrated that the ba algorithm outperformed the pso and cso algorithms in terms of runtime and repeatability of results while the pso algorithm outperformed the ba and cso algorithms in term of converge speed overall according to the results of the topsis method the algorithms were ranked in order of tlbo ba pso and cso the comparison of the parameter values estimated by the tlbo algorithm as the most paramount algorithm among the four others and the fracfit toolbox revealed that the two techniques gave the relatively similar and acceptable values for the v and α parameters while tlbo algorithm obtained more accurate values for the d f and β parameters the α values estimated by the two techniques represented correctly the deviation from fickian type transport and the soil heterogeneity degrees at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns in general the tlbo algorithm outperformed the fracfit toolbox from the viewpoints of the convergence trend objective function value runtime and repeatability of results to sum up it appears that the tlbo algorithm can be used as a highly effective and practical optimization method to estimate the s fade parameters in both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous soils therefore the findings of this study can be utmost useful to remove the estimation complexity of the s fade parameters and to increase the practical application of this model in hydrology declaration

order α and skewness β a sensitivity analysis indicated that the v is the most effective parameter on the s fade results followed by α d f and β respectively the experimental data required were measured at different transport distances of homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns five criteria namely convergence trend objective function value runtime repeatability of results and modeling complexity were used to evaluate algorithm performances and to rank them using a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis based on the obtained results all four algorithms acquired the global optimal values for the v and α parameters using a maximum iteration of 1000 as a stopping criterion and an initial population of 10 while they obtained the relatively different values for the d f and β parameters the pso and tlbo algorithms successfully found the global minimum values of the objective functions for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils among the four algorithms the tlbo algorithm was the best one in terms of convergence trend repeatability of results and modeling complexity and it was the worst algorithm in term of runtime among the pso cso and ba algorithms the ba algorithm was superior over the pso and cso algorithms in terms of runtime and repeatability of results while the pso algorithm was superior over the ba and cso algorithms in term of converge speed overall according to the results of the topsis method the tlbo algorithm was the best alternative to estimate the s fade parameters followed by ba pso and cso algorithms also the comparison of the s fade parameters estimated by the tlbo algorithm as the best one among the four algorithms with those estimated by fracfit toolbox revealed that both the techniques obtained the relatively identical and admissible values for the v and α parameters while the tlbo algorithm acquired the more precise values for the d f and β parameters a detailed analyses demonstrated that the tlbo algorithm was markedly superior to the fracfit toolbox in terms of the aforementioned criteria in a nutshell the tlbo algorithm can be used as a highly efficient optimization method to estimate the s fade parameters in both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous soils keywords fracfit toolbox non fickian transport gradient based optimization algorithms inverse problem method teaching learning based optimization topsis method 1 introduction groundwater is one of the worthiest water resources for human life two major issues of depletion and degradation threaten groundwater which affect the quantity and the quality of the groundwater resources an accurate modeling of contaminant movement in groundwater is critical to efficiently manage the groundwater systems as well known contaminant transport usually takes place in a multiscale heterogeneous environment neuman and tartakovsky 2009 the heterogeneity of a porous medium gives rise to a non fickian transport process at all scales neuman and tartakovsky 2009 which often cannot be well described by advection dispersion equation ade berkowitz et al 2006 todays the nonlocal solute transport models are recommended to capture the non fickian transport process space fractional advection dispersion equation s fade is one of promising spatially nonlocal models to characterize the non fickian transport in which the second order derivative of the dispersion term is replaced with a fractional order derivative schumer et al 2001 the s fade captures well the super diffusive transport zhang et al 2009 the estimation complexity of the s fade parameters i e average pore water velocity v fractional dispersion coefficient d f order of fractional differentiation α and skewness of the transport process β is the main obstacle to practical implementation of this model benson et al 2000a obtained separately the parameters of the symmetrical s fade using a measured plume variance in other work benson et al 2001 estimated the index α using hydraulic conductivity statistics the separate estimation of the transport parameters is problematic therefore zhou and selim 2003 presented an approach to appraise the α and d f simultaneously built upon relationship between transport distance variance and mean transport distance or time they proposed the three types of the relationships including linear non linear and logarithmic the results of this method strongly depend on the type of the relationship used the simultaneous estimation of the v d f α and β is a promising approach which is conducted using an inverse problem method this method has been used extensively and provided very satisfactory results in previous studies some of these inverse models utilized gradient based optimization algorithms e g pachepsky et al 2000 huang et al 2006 gao et al 2009 martinez et al 2010 wei et al 2017 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2020 while some of them utilized metaheuristic algorithms e g kelly et al 2017 mehdinejadiani 2017 the gradient based optimization algorithms require computing the derivatives of the objective function with respect to model parameters bharat et al 2009 and suffer from high dependency on the initial guess of the solution vector problem of choosing the learning step that gives good convergence and high probability of sticking in local optima faris et al 2018 in addition the gradient based optimization algorithms have some other sharp drawbacks in solving complex problems such as micro grid planning vehicle routing unit commitment and community detection in social networks deb et al 2020 the metaheuristic algorithms orchestrate an interaction between exploitation local search around a good solution and exploration global search in the whole solution space to avoid trapping at local optima and perform a robust search in the solution space the metaheuristic algorithms are also called stochastic algorithms with randomization and global exploration space because these algorithms generate an initial solution randomly and then enhance the solution by an iterative local search procedure the metaheuristic algorithms can be classified into single solution and population based algorithms elshaer and awad 2020 which the population based ones include evolutionary algorithms e g genetic algorithm ga evolutionary strategy es

applied to solve complex problems in the field of water resources and agriculture for example bharat et al 2009 formulated an inverse model based on the pso algorithm to estimate the parameters of a diffusion model they demonstrated that the pso algorithm was an efficient and robust alternative to obtain the parameters and guaranteed the global solution zhang et al 2010 successfully applied a version of the ga called micro ga to determine the effective soil hydraulic properties the ga and aco were applied to identify hydraulic parameters of confined unconfined and leaky aquifers by bateni et al 2015 and their performances were compared with those of graphical and nonlinear programming nlp techniques the results demonstrated the superiority of the ga and aco to the graphical and nlp techniques in estimating the aquifer hydraulic parameters also the outcomes revealed that the aco converges to the optimal solution faster than other techniques studied a matlab toolbox fracfit was presented by kelly et al 2017 to find the optimal parameters of four fractional models the fracfit is a flexible toolbox so that the user can select either lsqnonlin routine a gradient based algorithm or ga routine a metaheuristic algorithm mehdinejadiani 2017 appraised the parameters of the symmetrical s fade using an inverse model which utilized the ba as the optimization algorithm the results of this work revealed that the ba compared to the fracfit toolbox gave much more accurate estimations of the s fade parameters the applicability of several metaheuristic algorithms including imperialist competitive algorithm ica the pso ba and ga for allocating water to agricultural farms were compared by saeidian et al 2019 the findings of this work showed that the income resulting from the water allocation by the ica was maximum and the ica and pso outperformed the ba and ga in most evaluations madadi et al 2020 formulated the solute transport process in rivers using transient storage model and identified its parameters by applying an improved version of symbiotic organism search sos algorithm statistical indices indicted that the improved sos algorithm was superior to the others in estimating the parameters of the transient storage model wu et al 2020 coupled extreme learning machine elm model with woa and fpa and developed two hybrid models of woaelm and fpaelm for monthly pan evaporation ep prediction they found that the fpaelm predicted the monthly ep more accurate than the woaelm and both of which were superior to differential evolution algorithm optimized elm deelm improved m5 model tree m5p and artificial neural networks ann models in addition to the above mentioned there is a large body of research on the efficiency of the metaheuristic algorithms in solving the optimization problems of the water resources and agricultural engineering e g ines and droogers 2002 ayvaz et al 2007 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 okkan and kirdemir 2020 yu et al 2020 which are not mentioned here for the sake of brevity however to the best authors knowledge the application of the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters has not been reported so far thus the main goal of the present work is to investigate the capabilities of the pso cso and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters moreover the performances of the above mentioned algorithms will be compared with that of the fracfit toolbox 2 materials and methods 2 1 governing equation the one dimensional form of the s fade for a non reactive contaminant can be expressed as follows benson et al 2000b 1 c x t t v c x t x 1 2 1 β d f α c x t x α 1 2 1 β d f α c x t x α where c x t is the solute concentration m l 3 t is the time t x is the spatial coordinate l v is the average pore water velocity l t 1 d f is the fractional dispersion coefficient l α t 1 α 1 2 denotes the order of the fractional derivative dimensionless β 1 1 denotes the skewness of the transport process dimensionless α c x t x α and α c x t x α are the left and right side riemann liouville fractional derivatives which have the following forms respectively kilbas et al 2006 2a α c x t x α 1 γ

the analytical solution of the s fade for an initially solute free and semi finite soil column in which a non reactive contaminant with concentration c 0 is continuously injected at x 0 can be expressed as follows benson et al 2000b 3a c x t c 0 1 f α β x v t σ where σ cos π α 2 d f t 1 α and f α β denotes the standard stable cumulative probabilities computed for α 1 and z 0 as follows

implemented a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of the input parameters i e v d f α and β on the results of the s fade the sensitivity analysis was conducted by calculating normalized sensitivities of s fade results with respect to the input parameters whose details are given in supplementary materials after sensitivity analysis we developed four separate inverse models based on the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters as well known each inverse model consists of three components including design variables an objective function and an optimization algorithm in the present work the design variables were the s fade parameters i e v d f α and β and the objective function was formulated as follows 4a minimize o f i 1 n ω i e i 2 where of is the objective function n is the number of measurement points and e i is the difference between the calculated and measured concentrations at a certain distance and at time t i i e 4b e i c i calc c i meas in eq 4a ω i is the i th normalized weight coefficient defined as follows kelly et al 2017 4c ω i 1 c i meas c 0 1 c i meas c 0 as above mentioned each inverse model utilizes an optimization algorithm we used the pso cso ba and tlbo as optimization algorithms in the developed inverse models for the sake of brevity the descriptions of these algorithms are presented in supplementary materials 2 3 collection of experimental data a series of tracer tests were performed in a laboratory setup fig 1 to measure the data required for the implementation of the inverse models the setup consists of a plexiglas pipe with a height of 200 cm and a diameter of 10 cm which is installed on a cubic shaped box with dimensions of 20 20 20 cm and held by three metal rods the inside wall of the plexiglas pipe was roughened by gluing sand particles to diminish the wall flow effect six ports with intervals of 30 cm were created in the pipe wall for sampling water the ports were wrapped by nylon mesh to protect them from clogging the distilled water or nacl solution were stored in two plastic tanks which were connected to the cubic shaped box using hoses a pump model rkm 60 550 w made in prc established the flows through soil columns whose rates were adjusted by cut off valves and measured by a flow meter the tracer tests were conducted in both homogeneous and heterogeneous saturated porous media the homogeneous porous medium was a 120 cm vertical soil column prepared with a medium textured sand see fig 2 however the heterogeneous porous medium was a 180 cm vertical soil column prepared with a mixture of coarse medium and fine textured sands gravel and pebbles of 1 to 5 mm in diameter see fig 2 the sands were collected from the deposits of a river bed and washed well with tap water several times finally the clean sands were desalinated by distilled water air dried and sieved using standard sieve series of american society for testing and materials astm after the preparation of the sands the columns were filled with the sands under saturated conditions and tapped by a rubber rod to avoid air entrapment and to achieve a uniform packing after filling each column with sand the pump was turned on and established an upward flow of the distilled water through the soil column prior to each tracer test the flow rates of 260 and 550 ml min 1 were established in the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively note that these flow rates were kept constant during the tracer tests subsequently the nacl solution at a concentration of 500 mg l 1 as a tracer was continuously injected into the soil columns after the start of the tracer injection we took water samples from the ports at 1 min intervals and measured their electrical conductivities ecs using a calibrated ec meter orion model 130a germany then the ec values were converted to the nacl concentration by a calibration curve note that we stopped the water sampling and the ec measurement at each port when the nacl concentration nearly reached the inflow concentration and finally we characterized the measured breakthrough curve btc at each distance by drawing the variations of the measured concentrations versus the time at that distance 2 4 execution of developed inverse models as mentioned in section 2 2 the four inverse models were developed based on the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters the scripts of the inverse models were prepared in the matlab software in all algorithms the maximum number of iteration ite r max was considered as the stopping criterion we set the parameters of the algorithms according to table 1 to appraise the s fade parameters at each distance the analytical solution of the s fade was fitted to the measured btc at that distance using the developed inverse models it is necessary to mention that each inverse model was executed 10 times at each distance and the average value of 10 runs was reported as the final result at that distance the root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r2 were utilized as two indicators to assess the goodness of fit of the inverse models and consequently the goodness of fit of the algorithms which were calculated as follows sanikhani et al 2018 5a rmse 1 n i 1 n c i calc c i meas 2 5b r 2 i 1 n c i meas c meas c i calc c calc i 1 n c i meas c meas 2 i 1 n c i calc c calc 2 2 where c meas and c calc are respectively the average of the measured and calculated concentrations at a given distance and the other variables are defined as in eq 4b 2 5 performance evaluation of algorithms in this study we utilized the five comparative criteria namely convergence trend objective function value runtime repeatability of results and modeling complexity to evaluate the performances of the algorithms at each transport distance then we ranked the algorithms using the computational method of the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis which is detailed in supplementary materials according to the mentioned criteria note that each algorithm was run 10 times at each transport distance to evaluate the aforementioned criteria from viewpoint of the convergence trend the accessibility to a relatively stable optimal solution or a relatively constant objective function value after a less iteration number can imply the primacy of an algorithm as mentioned in eq 4a the objective function should be minimized to estimate the optimal values of the s fade parameters therefore a less objective function value can be a superiority criterion of an algorithm the runtimes were evaluated by executing each algorithm for a specific iteration number then the average values of the runtimes were compared it is clear that a less runtime is an advantage for an algorithm to evaluate the repeatability criterion the variances of the objective function values in 10 times run of each algorithm were calculated it should be noted that a smaller variance represents a more repeatable solution and as a result a prominent algorithm the criterion of the modeling complexity is related to the number of parameters of each algorithm from users viewpoint an algorithm with a smaller number of parameters is superior to that with a larger number of parameters from the above descriptions one can find that all criteria are negative 2 6 performance comparison of the best algorithm with fracfit toolbox in this study the performance of the most efficient algorithm among the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters was compared with that of the fracfit toolbox this toolbox can be applied to continuous and instantaneous injections the fracfit toolbox utilizes eq 4a as the objective function and it allows the user to choose the lsqnonlin routine or the ga routine as an optimization algorithm in the present study we chose the ga routine as a metaheuristic algorithm to estimate the s fade parameters and we used the ite r max 200 as the stopping criterion and the initial population of 10 n pop 10 to execute the fracfit toolbox and the best algorithm selected among the four others similar to the mentioned in section 2 4 the fracfit toolbox and the best algorithm were executed 10 times at each transport distance and the average value of 10 runs was reported as the final result at that distance the rmse r2 mean bias error mbe standard deviation of the residual sd nash sutcliffe s efficiency nse t statistic ts uncertainty at 95 u95 and global performance indicator gpi were used as the indicators to assess the goodness of fit of the fracfit toolbox and the best algorithm the rmse and r2 indicators were calculated using eqs 5a and 5b and the others were calculated using the following formulae gueymard 2014 behar et al 2015 sanikhani et al 2018 5c mbe 1 n c meas i 1 n c i calc c i meas 5d sd 1 c meas i 1 n n c i calc c i meas 2 i 1 n c i calc c i meas 2 n 5e nse 1 i 1

the criteria of the convergence trend objective function value runtime and repeatability of results 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity of s fade to input parameters fig 3 shows the results of sensitivity analysis as observed the v parameter has the greatest impact on the s fade results followed by α d f and β parameters respectively this finding implies that the precise estimation of the v parameter is utmost important to correctly simulate the solute concentration by the s fade further inspections reveal that the variation of the v parameter significantly influences the mean travel distance while the variation of the β parameter only slightly affects the btc skewness see fig 4 a and 4b also the variation of the α parameter influences the early and late time tails of the btc while the variation of the d f parameter only affects the late time tails of the btc see fig 4c and d 3 2 estimation results of parameters by algorithms tables 2 and 3 list the s fade parameters estimated by the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms and the associated values of rmse and r2 at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively it is necessary to mention that the values presented in table 2 are the average values of the parameters obtained from 10 runs one can find from tables 2 and 3 that all algorithms yield the relatively equal values for the v and α parameters while they yield the relatively different values for the d f and β parameters although the d f and β values resulted from algorithms are different the rmse and r2 values of all algorithms are close to their ideal values 0 and 1 respectively at all distances this can be related to this fact that all algorithms are capable of estimating the global optimal values for the v and α parameters the more effective parameters on the s fade results using ite r max 1000 as the stopping criterion and n pop 10 the coincidence of the fitted and measured btcs also demonstrates that the four algorithms obtain the global optimal values for the s fade parameters especially v and α parameters at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns for example figs 5 and 6 show the fitted and measured btcs at the 120 and 180 cm distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively as observed in table 2 the α values estimated by all algorithms are less than 2 at all distances this means that the solute transport process is non fickian at all distances of the homogeneous soil column the non fickian transport process can be related to the heterogeneity of the soil at microscopic scale al tabbaa et al 2000 and the relatively non uniform packing of the soil column xiong et al 2006 the previous studies e g benson et al 2000a huang et al 2006 mehdinejadiani 2017 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2020 sharma et al 2020 have also reported the non fickian transport process in homogeneous porous media according to the α values the soil column is relatively homogeneous up to the transport distance of 30 cm and it is averagely homogenous at the other transport distances clarke et al 2005 these findings are in agreement with the physical properties of the used sand because the homogeneous soil column was filled with a relatively uniform sand according to the α values presented in table 3 the solute transport process in the heterogeneous soil column significantly deviates from the fickian type transport as observed the α values vary within the ranges of 1 3 1 7 for the 30 90 60 120 and 150 cm transport distances and 1 1 to 1 3 for the 180 cm transport distance this finding implies that the soil column is averagely heterogeneous up to the 150 cm transport distance while it is relatively heterogeneous at the 180 cm transport distance clarke et al 2005 these findings are consistent with the physical properties of the used sands because the heterogeneous soil column was filled with a mixture of coarse medium and fine textured sands gravel and pebbles of 1 5 mm in diameter it is also found from tables 2 and 3 that the α values of the heterogeneous soil column are consistently smaller than those of the homogeneous soil column this finding implies the more deviation of the transport process from the fickian type transport in the heterogeneous soil column which is in excellent agreement with the results of the previous studies e g huang et al 2006 xiong et al 2006 mehdinejadiani 2017 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 moradi and mehdinejadiani 2020 3 3 performance comparison of algorithms 3 3 1 comparison of convergence trends figs 7 and 8 illustrate the convergence trends of the four algorithms to minimize the objective function in a semi logarithmic coordinate system at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively it is necessary to mention that the convergence trends displayed in figs 7 and 8 are related to the best run among the 10 runs executed at each transport distance as observed the convergence speed of the four algorithms is extremely high in the initial iterations then gradually reduces and finally the algorithms converge in addition to the comparison of the convergence trends the mean convergence speeds of the four algorithms were also compared the mean convergence speeds were calculated by averaging the number of iterations in which each algorithm reached a constant value of the objective function and consequently constant values of the parameters fig 9 shows that the tlbo algorithm provides the fastest convergence speed to achieve the optimal solution at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns while the cso algorithm provides the lowest convergence speed to achieve the optimal solution in the homogeneous soil when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 the tlbo pso ba and cso algorithms averagely converge within 162 520 593 and 723 iterations respectively in the heterogeneous soil when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 the tlbo pso ba and cso algorithms averagely converge within 133 439 452 and 723 iterations respectively these findings demonstrate that the tlbo algorithm converges very fast to the optimal solution at all transport distances of the heterogeneous soil column followed by the pso ba and cso algorithms respectively 3 3 2 comparison of objective function values tables 4 and 5 present the mean objective function values obtained by the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively note that the objective function values mentioned in tables 4 and 5 are the average values of the objective functions acquired by each algorithm in 10 runs as observed in the homogeneous soil the four algorithms converge to the relatively equal objective function values in the heterogeneous soil the cso and ba algorithms converge to the relatively equal objective function values while the pso and tlbo algorithms converge to relatively equal ones in this soil the objective function values obtained by the pso and tlbo algorithms are somewhat less than those obtained by the cso and ba algorithms these findings imply that when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 the pso and tlbo algorithms converge to the global minimum values of the objective functions in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils 3 3 3 comparison of runtimes tables 4 and 5 give the mean runtimes of the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively the mean runtime at each distance is the average of the computation times elapsed by each algorithm in 10 runs when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 from tables 4 and 5 it can be found that the ba algorithm requires the least runtimes at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns while the tlbo algorithm requires the most runtimes to find the global optimal values of the s fade parameters the ba pso cso and tlbo algorithms averagely require the runtimes of 188 6 240 3 258 2 and 520 6 s in the homogeneous soil and 266 7 381 9 415 9 and 703 4 s in the heterogeneous soil respectively these findings reveal that the ba algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms in term of runtime 3 3 4 comparison of repeatability of results table 6 summarizes the variances of the objective function values at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 as observed the variances of the objective function values resulted from the tlbo algorithm approximately equal to zero at all transport distances this implies the full repeatability of the objective function values and therefore of the s fade parameter values obtained by the tlbo algorithm at each distance to further investigate this finding the variance of the s fade parameter values acquired by the tlbo algorithm was calculated at each distance according to the obtained results the variances of the s fade parameter values approximately equal to zero at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns therefore the tlbo algorithm is capable of obtaining the fully repeatable values for the s fade parameters at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns and it is significantly superior to the other three algorithms in term of repeatability of results also a detailed comparison of repeatability of the results obtained by the pso ba and cso algorithms indicates that in the homogeneous soil the variances of the objective function values yielded from the ba are significantly less than those yielded from the cso and pso algorithms this finding signifies that the s fade parameter values resulted from the ba algorithm are more repeatable than those resulted from the cso and pso algorithms the comparison of the variance values associated to the cso and pso algorithms reveals that the pso algorithms obtains more repeatable results at 60 and 90 cm distances while the cso algorithms obtains more repeatable ones at 30 and 120 cm distances see table 6 based on the obtained variances the mean variance values of the pso and cso algorithms are 79 39 10 9 and 31 83 10 9 respectively one can infer from this finding that the s fade parameter values acquired by the cso algorithm are more repeatable than those acquired by the pso algorithm in the heterogeneous soil the variances of the objective function values resulted from the ba algorithm at all transport distances are meaningfully less than the variances of those yielded from the pso and cso algorithms see table 6 thus one can conclude that compared to the pso and cso algorithms the ba algorithm acquires more repeatable results it is also found from table 6 that the variances of the objective function values come from the cso algorithm at all distances are less than the variances of those yielded from the pso algorithm except at the distances of 150 and 180 cm according to the mean variance values of the pso and cso algorithms respectively 1443 10 9 and 245 4 10 9 the cso algorithm leads to more repeatable results than the pso algorithm overall the repeatability of results is the highest for the tlbo algorithm at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns followed by the ba cso and pso algorithms 3 3 5 comparison of modeling complexity table 1 tabulates the parameters of the algorithms studied here as we know these parameters are set by the user as observed the pso ba and cso algorithms require five parameters to solve an optimization problem while the tlbo algorithm only needs one parameter as mentioned in section 2 5 the smaller number of parameters makes the users more comfortable with the algorithm hence the tlbo algorithm is the simplest algorithm among the four algorithms and it is superior to them in term of modeling complexity furthermore one can say that the pso ba and cso algorithms are similar from the viewpoint of the modeling complexity because they require the identical number of setting parameters 3 3 6 ranking results of algorithms we now rank the four algorithms on the basis of the relative closeness values to the ideal solutions obtained by the topsis method fig 10 presents the relative closeness values to the ideal solutions for the algorithms at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively the results indicate that the tlbo algorithm attains the maximum relative closeness values at all transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns hence we rank the tlbo algorithm as the best ones among the four algorithms the relative closeness values of the ba algorithm are less than those of the tlbo algorithm and more than those of the pso and cso algorithms therefore the ba algorithm lies in the second place it is also found from fig 10 that the relative closeness values to the ideal solutions associated to the pso algorithm are more than those associated to the cso algorithm except at the 90 cm distance of the homogeneous soil and at the 60 90 and 120 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil the relative closeness values associated to the pso algorithm are less than those associated to the cso algorithm at the 90 cm distance of the homogeneous soil and at the 60 and 90 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil while the relative closeness values associated to the pso and cso algorithms are equal at the 120 cm distance of the heterogeneous soil the mean relative closeness values of the pso and cso algorithms in the homogenous soil respectively 0 3400 and 0 3500 and in the heterogeneous soil respectively 0 3433 and 0 3217 reveal that both algorithms have a relatively similar efficiency to appraise the s fade parameters overall we can prioritize the algorithms in order of tlbo ba pso and cso as a result of the analyses one can conclude that among the four algorithms the tlbo algorithm is the most robust one to estimate the s fade parameters in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils 3 4 estimation results of parameters by tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox as mentioned in section 3 3 6 the tlbo algorithm gains the best performance to appraise the s fade parameters among the four algorithms studied in this work therefore we compared the performance of the tlbo algorithm with that of the fracfit toolbox to estimate the s fade parameters tables 7 and 8 give the s fade parameters appraised by the tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox along with the associated values of the indicators at different transport distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively the parameter values reported in tables 7 and 8 are the mean parameter values which were obtained by averaging the parameter values in 10 runs the indicator values signify that the tlbo algorithm provides better estimations for the s fade parameters than the fracfit toolbox at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns the graphical comparison of the fitted and measured btcs including the coincidence of the fitted and measured btcs figs 11 and 12 and scatterplots fig 13 also confirms the above findings that is the tlbo algorithm compared to the fracfit toolbox estimates the s fade parameters more accurately in addition to the above mentioned a deep analysis of the parameters estimated by the tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox reveals that the v values obtained by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox vary within ranges of 2 802 4 629 and 3 109 4 614 cm min 1 for the homogeneous soil respectively and they vary within ranges of 3 388 to 7 363 and 4 335 to 7 676 cm min 1 for the heterogeneous soil respectively therefore the variation domains of the v values obtained by the two techniques are relatively similar indeed the v values acquired by the two techniques are close to each other except at the 30 cm distance of the homogeneous soil and at the 30 and 60 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil see tables 7 and 8 as a result both the techniques perform relatively similar in estimating the v parameter which is the most effective parameter on the s fade results a detailed inspection of the α values indicates that the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox acquire the α values for the homogeneous soil column in the ranges of 1 597 to 1 749 and 1 621 to 1 847 respectively see table 7 based on the α values estimated by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox the soil column is relatively homogeneous up to the transport distance of 30 cm and is averagely homogeneous at the other transport distances clarke et al 2005 therefore the α values stemmed from the two techniques are acceptable and accordant with the physical properties of the used sand because the homogeneous soil column was filled with a relatively uniform sand by the same token we investigated the estimated α values for the heterogeneous soil column in detail as observed in table 8 the α values estimated by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox are in the ranges of 1 376 to 1705 and 1 490 to 1 694 respectively according to the α values acquired by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox the soil column is averagely heterogeneous clarke et al 2005 these findings seem logical with regards to the physical properties of the used sand because the heterogeneous soil column was filled with three different sand textures gravel and pebbles of 1 to 5 mm in diameter therefore the two techniques are correctly capable of estimating the α parameter in both the homogenous and the heterogeneous soils which is the second important parameter affecting the s fade results in contrary to the v and α parameters the d f parameter values resulted from the two techniques differ significantly from each other in both the soils the d f values appraised by the fracfit toolbox at the 30 60 90 and 120 cm distances of the homogeneous soil column are respectively 2 134 1 613 2 859 and 3 882 times those estimated by the tlbo algorithm see table 7 similarly it is observed from table 8 that the d f values resulted from the fracfit toolbox at the 30 120 150 and 180 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil are respectively 1 623 1 323 1 610 and 2 679 times those yielded from the tlbo algorithm note that the d f values obtained from the two techniques are approximately equal at the 60 and 90 cm distances of the heterogeneous soil column by continuing the analysis of the estimated parameter values we find that the β values obtained by the two techniques are significantly different in magnitude and the same in sign at all transport distances of both the soils as observed in tables 7 and 8 the magnitude of the β values estimated by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox vary from 0 2282 to 0 3669 and 0 1505 to 0 5709 for the homogeneous soil respectively and they vary from 0 3812 to 0 9999 and 0 1348 to 0 5087 for the heterogeneous soil respectively indeed according to these findings the two techniques obtain different jump sizes for contaminant particles in the same directions 3 5 performance comparison of the tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox figs 14 and 15 depict the convergence trends of the two techniques for the best run among the 10 runs of each technique at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns respectively to better illustrate we chose the logarithmic scale for iteration axis as observed the convergence speed of the two techniques is faster in the earlier iterations then it decelerates gradually and finally the techniques converge the comparison of convergence trends of the tlbo algorithm and fracfit toolbox reveals that in general the convergence trend of the tlbo algorithm is faster in the earlier iterations and smoother in the later iterations to further investigate we also compared the mean convergence speeds of the two techniques to this end we considered the mean number of iterations in which each technique achieved a constant value of the objective function as a mean convergence speed as seen in fig 16 the tlbo algorithm converges much faster than the fracfit toolbox at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns a detailed investigation elucidates that the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox averagely converge in the homogeneous soil after almost 56 and 155 iterations respectively and they averagely converge in the heterogeneous soil after almost 53 and 155 iterations respectively table 9 presents the mean objective function values obtained by the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns similar to section 3 3 2 the objective function values reported in table 9 are average values of the objective functions acquired by each technique in 10 runs according to the results the objective function values to which the tlbo algorithm converges are significantly less than those to which the fracfit toolbox converges at all distances these findings imply the superiority of the tlbo algorithm over the fracfit toolbox in minimizing the objective function and consequently in finding the globally optimal values of the s fade parameters we also compared the two techniques in term of runtime as shown in table 9 compared to the fracfit toolbox the tlbo algorithm requires much less runtime to converge at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns the runtime decreases on average almost four times when the tlbo algorithm is applied to estimate the s fade parameters instead of the fracfit toolbox finally we evaluated the repeatability of the results obtained from the two techniques for this purpose we calculated the variances of the objective function values at different distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns as observed in table 10 the variances of the objective function values resulted from the tlbo algorithm are approximately equal to zero at all distances this signifies the full repeatability of the objective function values and therefore of the s fade parameter values obtained by the tlbo algorithm in different runs at each distance however the variances of the objective function values resulted from the fracfit toolbox suggest that the toolbox might lead to variable results in different runs at each distance overall the performance comparison of the tlbo algorithm and the fracfit toolbox demonstrates that the tlbo algorithm is markedly superior to the fracfit toolbox in terms of convergence trend objective function value runtime and repeatability of results 4 conclusion the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the performances of the pso cso ba and tlbo algorithms for the estimation of the s fade parameters and to compare the performance of the best algorithm among them with that of the fracfit toolbox to this end first of all we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of the input parameters i e v d f α and β then we developed four inverse models based on the aforementioned algorithms to estimate the s fade parameters and we carried out the tracer tests in the saturated homogeneous and heterogeneous vertical soil columns with diameters of 10 cm to implement the developed inverse models and the fracfit toolbox the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns were respectively 120 and 180 cm in length and we measured the experimental btcs at the 30 cm intervals the four algorithms were evaluated according to the criteria of convergence trend objective function value runtime repeatability of results and modeling complexity and then prioritized using the topsis method the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the v parameter had the greatest impact on the s fade results followed by α d f and β parameters respectively when ite r max 1000 and n pop 10 all four algorithms obtained the global optimal values for the v and α parameters the more effective parameters on the s fade results while they obtained the relatively different values for the d f and β parameters the less effective parameters on the s fade results also the α values estimated by the algorithms described well the non fickian transport process and the soil heterogeneity degrees in the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils the pso and tlbo algorithms converged to the global minimum values of the objective functions in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils among the four algorithms the tlbo algorithm exhibited the best performance in terms of convergence trend repeatability of results and modeling complexity while it exhibited the worst performance in term of runtime the comparison of the pso cso and ba algorithms demonstrated that the ba algorithm outperformed the pso and cso algorithms in terms of runtime and repeatability of results while the pso algorithm outperformed the ba and cso algorithms in term of converge speed overall according to the results of the topsis method the algorithms were ranked in order of tlbo ba pso and cso the comparison of the parameter values estimated by the tlbo algorithm as the most paramount algorithm among the four others and the fracfit toolbox revealed that the two techniques gave the relatively similar and acceptable values for the v and α parameters while tlbo algorithm obtained more accurate values for the d f and β parameters the α values estimated by the two techniques represented correctly the deviation from fickian type transport and the soil heterogeneity degrees at all distances of the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns in general the tlbo algorithm outperformed the fracfit toolbox from the viewpoints of the convergence trend objective function value runtime and repeatability of results to sum up it appears that the tlbo algorithm can be used as a highly effective and practical optimization method to estimate the s fade parameters in both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous soils therefore the findings of this study can be utmost useful to remove the estimation complexity of the s fade parameters and to increase the practical application of this model in hydrology declaration

geothermal and oil gas production wells due to migration of natural reservoir fines has been widely reported in the literature khilar and fogler 1998 the reason is drastic permeability decline due to mobilisation migration and straining of natural reservoir fines by the flowing fluid water oil or gas the effect of permeability decline well impairment during well exploitation is revealed by either rate decline q t under fixed pressure drawdown 1 δ p t p res p w or by the increase in pressure drawdown during the maintenance of a constant production rate this formation damage effect is expressed

constant production rate discussed in this work the impedance is a dimensionless pressure drawdown fig 1 a shows impedance growth i e well productivity decline during hot water production from geothermal reservoir you et al 2015 well index decreased 2 2 times during the well exploitation fig 1c and 1d present well productivity decline during exploitation of an artesian well burman and das 1990 during the reported exploitation period well index decreased 3 1 times both papers indicate migration of natural reservoir fines followed by the rock clogging as a main cause for the formation damage the particles that are attached to the rock coat the rock surface therefore the detachment of these particles does not significantly increase rock permeability however plugging of thin pores during fines migration cuts off a flow path yielding significant permeability decline fig 2 a fig 2b presents the schematic for fines detachment by the drag and lifting forces exerting attached particles from the flowing fluid while the particles are attached by the electrostatic and gravitational forces these speculations explain why the detached particles migrate and clog the pores causing permeability impairment civan 2007 russell et al 2017 muneer et al 2020 fig 3 shows scanning electron microscopy sem images of detaching and migrating kaolinite fines the most widely spread minerals generating migrating fines are clays mostly kaolinite illite and chlorite however often silica silts or unconsolidated sand can be also detached yielding significant permeability damage fig 3a

detached from the booklet the kaolinite platelet can plug even large pores fig 3b shows the pore plugging by the set of kaolinite booklets after their detachment and migration the pore was open before the flow started fines migration is one of the most important physics phenomena causing productivity decline in aquifers and oil reservoirs which explains an intensive current theoretical and

2019 wang et al 2020 yosri et al 2020 the mechanical equilibrium conditions for a particle on a plane substrate or rock surface are given by bergendahl and grasso 2000 freitas and sharma 2001 bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 li et al 2005 johnson and tong 2006 these conditions allow predicting a fine particle mobilisation by the flow under a change in velocity salinity ph temperature etc the kinetic equation for detachment rate is proportional to the difference between the current and critical equilibrium values of velocity salinity ph temperature etc the relaxation times are empirical constants and do not reflect the mechanical equilibrium conditions of attached particles zheng et al 2014 bai et al 2015 bai et al 2019 an alternative model for particle detachment is the maximum

particle properties size form zeta potential etc can highly affect the suspension colloidal transport in natural rocks using discrete values for those properties yields significant increase in the number of equations and corresponding computational difficulties yuan and shapiro 2010 probabilistic averaging of the transport equations that accounts for probabilistic distributions of the particle

the production history is extremely important for production forecast and also for planning well stimulation acidizing fracturing and re fracturing re perforation etc however a method for history matching and model tuning using the laboratory data is unavailable an analytical model for well inflow performance accounting for fines migration of the particles with distributed properties is also not available the present work fills the gap we derived an exact solution for radial flow towards well for size distributed fine particles the analytical model for fluid production under fines migration allows matching well production history using the laboratory data we introduced a notion of formation damage zone size around the production well where the suspended particles are accumulated during well exploitation and also calculated this size from the production and laboratory data close match of 23 field cases on the productivity decline due to fines migration and the common intervals of the tuned parameter variation validate the analytical model the structure of the text is as follows section 2 presents mechanical equilibrium conditions of fines mobilisation and introduces maximum retention concentration function as a model for particle detachment section 3 formulates one dimensional 1d equations for water flow towards well under fines migration section 4 derives an analytical model for the 1d inflow problem section 5 validates the analytical model by comparison with the numerical solution section 6 presents the inverse problem of determining the maximum retention function from fines concentration in the produced fluid section 7 performs the sensitivity study of the impedance history with respect to the model parameters section 8 presents the matching of 23 field cases by the analytical model sections 9 of discussions and 10 of conclusions finalise the paper 2 pore scale physics of particle detachment from a substrate in shear flows the particle detachment model used in this work is expressed by the maximum retention concentration as a function of velocity the maximum retention function is derived from the torque balance of the attaching and detaching forces in this section we describe the mechanical equilibrium conditions for a particle attached to a porous medium surface and the detachment upon the breach of those conditions fig 2a shows particle detachment from the pore throat migration in the flowing water and plugging of the pore which is smaller than the particle natural particles clays silica and sand fines are lined along the grain surface so the detachment causes insignificant increase in porosity and permeability corresponding to the increase in pore volume by the mobilised particle volume yet pore plugging by size exclusion yields closing the flow path resulting in significant permeability decline fig 3 shows sem image of the pore plugged by detached kaolinite fines the pore was open before the flux started this is a typical schematic for permeability damage due to fines detachment migration and straining fines rolling sliding and lifting are the main regimes of fines detachment and motion bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 johnson and tong 2006 the attached particle mobilizes and starts rolling along the rock surface if the detaching torque exceeds the attaching torque i e 3 t a t d f e f g l n f d l d f l l n 0 where fl fd fe fg are the lift drag electrostatic and gravitational forces respectively ld and ln are the lever arms for drag and electrostatic forces ta and td are the attaching and detaching torques of the above mentioned forces fig 2b this scenario corresponds to the hypothesis that the particle rolls around the neighbour particle or substrate asperity at the moment of detachment drag and lift are mostly velocity dependent and are calculated by the generalised stokes and saffman s formulae using the asymptotic models for viscous boundary layers around a particle in viscous shear flow polyanin and dil man 1990 polyanin and dilʹman 1994 electrostatic force in eq 3 corresponds to maximum attraction adhesion force over the overall separation distance interval appendix a which is shown in fig 4 as inflection points of the dlvo energy profiles if the detaching drag exceeds the friction force the mobilized fine slips along the rock surface 4 f y μ f f e f g f l f d 0 here μf is the coulomb friction coefficient the attached particle lifts from the rock surface if the vertical detaching lift exceeds attaching electrostatic and gravitational forces 5 f z f e f g f l 0 either of fines migration regime 3 4 or 5 can be determined using phase diagrams chequer et al 2021 the experimental results show that the most widely spread detachment regime is rolling bradford et al 2013 so in this work we focus on the mechanical equailibrium condition given by equality 3 the equivalence between the mathematical formulations of mechanical equilibrium criteria 3 and 4 is given by equality ln ld μf the lifting occurs at high velocities which are unrealistic even near wellbores in natural reservoirs therefore further in the text we concentrate on rolling criterion 3 in the case of two phase flow in porous media air and water or gas and water capillary force must be accounted for in the torque balance 3 yuan and shapiro 2011b lazouskaya et al 2013 aramrak et al 2013 consider the particle ensemble attached to the rock surface non uniform particle and pore shapes heterogeneous surface charge distribution for pores and particles and distributions of their sizes yield distribution of all components of eqs 3 and a1 however each particle is detached if the conditions 3 and 4 are fulfilled consider a continuous increase in water velocity keeping water composition constant for a fixed pore space and attached fines geometry drag and lift in eq 3 are functions of velocity for a given velocity eq 3 determines which particles are mobilised and which remain attached the velocity dependence of the attached concentration σa 6 σ a σ cr u is called the maximum retention function bedrikovetsky et al 2011 bedrikovetsky et al 2012 here the attached concentration is the volumetric fraction of the particles per unit of rock volume the plot of dependency 6 is presented in fig 5 the higher is the darcy s velocity u the higher are drag and lift the higher is the detaching torque and the lower is the concentration of attached particles at maximum velocity um the drag is so high that inequality 3 is fulfilled for all the particles so no particles remain attached at u um fig 5 also shows how maximum retention function can be determined experimentally by measurement of the amount of mobilised particles δσn by the velocity increase from un to un 1 the critical velocity ui is the maximum velocity where fines detachment does not occur 7 σ ai σ cr u i where σai is the initial concentration of the attached movable fines maximum retention function 7 is a mathematical model for fines detachment with velocity increase numerous works have validated this model by comparison with the laboratory coreflooding data bedrikovetsky et al 2011 bedrikovetsky et al 2012 russell et al 2017 russell et al 2018 yang et al 2016 in the next section this function will be used to close the system of governing equations for fines mobilisation detachment and capture by the porous rock 3 governing equations for radial fines migration toward well in this section we present model assumptions section 3 1 and system of governing equations section 3 2 formulate initial and boundary conditions section 3 3 and present the system in dimensionless form appendix b 3 1 model assumptions we assume incompressibility of suspension colloidal fluid in porous media i e 8 u q 2 π r where the production rate per unit length of the well q is constant we also assume constant production rate i e velocity 8 is a function of radius only consequently impedance in eq 2 is the ratio between the current and initial pressure drawdowns eq 8 assumes incompressible carrier fluid and small suspended concentration so adding the colloid does not affect the fluid density assuming additivity of fluids and suspended solids amagat s law yields the same assumption for large suspension concentrations bedrikovetsky 2013 it is also assumed that the attached reservoir fines are mobilized if their attached concentration exceeds the maximum retention function 6 the relationship between the critical retained concentration and flow velocity is obtained from the conditions of mechanical equilibrium of the attached particles on the rock surface given by eq 3 the most wide spread condition of mechanical equilibrium in porous media is the equality of attaching and detaching torques of drag lift and electrostatic forces eq 3 and fig 2b here we use the expression for maximum retention function derived for porous media with cylindrical pores and single sized particles which deposit in poly layers on the pore walls bedrikovetsky et al 2012 zeinijahromi et al 2012 9 σ a σ cr u σ a 0 1 u u m 2 where σa0 is the maximum concentration of movable fines in the rock at u 0 and um is the minimum velocity above which all particles are detached the values of σa0 and um correspond to points 0 σa0 and um 0 in the plane u σ which are the top and bottom points of the quadratic parabola in fig 5 as it follows from eq 7 the fines are not lifted at velocities lower than ui the critical velocity ui corresponds to mobilization of the first fine particle during the velocity increase the higher is the velocity at u ui the lower is the attached concentration for velocities higher than the maximum velocity no particles can be secured on the rock surface and maximum retention function is equal zero considering filtration of multicomponent colloids with distributed properties we use the suspension function f c instead of suspension concentration c in the capture rate equation bedrikovetsky et al 2019 3 2 system of governing equations for radial suspension colloidal transport the continuity equation accounts for suspended attached and strained particles and also for drift delay factor α which reflects the suspended particle flow that is slower than that of the carrier water james et al 2018 chequer et al 2018

α 1 is the drift delay factor the suspension concentration is defined as volumetric particle fraction in unitary pore volume while the attached and strained concentrations are volumetric particle fractions per unit volume of the rock maximum retention function 6 determines the attached concentration the kinetics equation for size exclusion retention rate for the particles with distributed property values contains the suspension function f c 11 σ s t α λ f c u here λ is the filtration coefficient bedrikovetsky et al 2003 guedes et al 2009 suspension function incorporates the probabilistic distributions of particle size shape surface charge and micro heterogeneity bedrikovetsky et al 2019 malgaresi et al 2019 malgaresi et al 2020 in the case of mono suspension with identical particle properties f c c modified darcy s law for suspension flux accounts for the permeability decline due to size excluded particles 12 u k μ 1 β σ s p r where β is the formation damage coefficient 3 3 1d radial problem of inflow well performance eqs 6 8 determine radii ri and rm where the velocities are equal to ui and um respectively consequently all attached reservoir fines are lifted from well vicinity between rw and rm no particles will be lifted outside the zone where r ri in the intermediate zone rm r ri the excess of the attach particles over the maximum retention function are lifted by definition of attached and suspended concentrations the detached concentration and consequent suspended concentration are linked by the relationship δc δσϕ consequently the initial conditions that correspond to instant establishment of steady state velocity profile given by eq 8 and instant mobilization of attach particles by drag and lift forces is 13 t 0 c r 0 σ ai ϕ r

analytical solution for fines migration towards production well this section derives exact solution for well inflow performance under migration of the suspension with size distributed particles and describes approximate solutions for more general cases section 4 1 the analytical model allows structuring the flow domain and distinguishing different hydrodynamic zones section 4 2 calculation of well impedance section 4 3 and definition of the damaged zone size section 4 4 4 1 derivation of exact solution for 1d colloid inflow combining equations in system b3 b4 yields the following non linear partial differential equation 16 c t α c x α λ f c 2 x however the characteristic lines for eq 16 are straight so the cauchy s problem b6 can be solved exactly several exact solutions for similar non linear problems of reactive flows are presented in polyanin and zaitsev 2012 the conditions on characteristics are 17 x x 0 α t 18 dc dt α λ f c 2 x 0 α t initial conditions for ode 18 are inherited from initial conditions of pde b6 and are taken at point x0 x αt separation of variables in ode 18 yields 19 c x α t 0 c x t dc f c α λ x x α t which is an implicit expression for suspended concentration c x t for known c x t strained concentration is determined from eq b4 20 s s x t α λ 2 x 0 t f c x y d y solution 19 determines suspension concentration in zones i ii and iii using initial data b6 for x xi fig 6 a initial suspension concentration at x xi is equal zero so eq 18 yields zero suspension concentration in zones 0 iv and v in zones i and iii solution 19 uses initial data from interval xm xi suspended concentration in zone ii is determined by eq 19 using initial data from interval xw xm the above determines the solution for suspended concentration c x t in the overall domain x 0 t 0 for known suspended concentration c x t strained concentration ss x t is determined by integration in t using eq 20 in zone ii and i ss x t is determined by eq 20 using expression 19 for suspended concentration integration 20 for larger times results in expressions for ss x t in zones iv and v in zones 0 v and iv suspended concentration is equal zero therefore strained concentration in those zones is steady state in zone 0 strained concentration is equal zero for the cases where suspension function f c is either quadratic polynomial or linear the integral on the left hand side of eq 19 can be expressed explicitly explicit formulae for c x t and ss x t are presented in table 1 for the linear suspension function f c c which corresponds to small size variation of the fine particles the algorithm for incorporation of probabilistic distributions of particle size shape surface charge and micro heterogeneity into suspension function is presented by malgaresi et al 2019 malgaresi et al 2020 in the case of low particle size variation f c c but large strained concentration the filtration function is strained concentration dependent λ λ ss table 2 expressing c from eq b4 and substitution into eq b3 yields scalar equation for unknown ss x t integration of the resulting equation in t decreases its order yielding first order hyperbolic equation the characteristics 17 remain straight but ode along the characteristics does not have an exact solution the approximate analytical solution can be found by a few iterations of contraction mapping with high accuracy polyanin and zaitsev 2012 polyanin and nazaikinskii 2015 the same approximate method is applicable to 1d problem with linear blocking function λ λ ss and any arbitrary suspension function f c in all above mentioned cases characteristics remain straight 17 and structure of the flow zone in x t plane fig 6 remains the same the model assumptions are explained in table 2 the hydrodynamic interpretation of the exact solution 19 20 presented in the next section is based on the facts that characteristics of the hyperbolic mass balance equation 16 corresponds to particle trajectories and eq 16 captures the propagation of concentration profile along the particle trajectories accounting for the particle capture barenblatt et al 1991 bedrikovetsky 2013 4 2 structure of the flow domain exact solution 19 20 allows distinguishing between the flow zones 0 v with different structure of retained suspension and strained particle ensembles fig 6 shows three zones of instant fines detachment at t 0 that correspond to conditions 13 zone ii all the attached particles are removed by high drag force under high velocity in wellbore vicinity xw x xm zone i the particles are mobilised according to the maximum retention function 6 in the intermediate zone xm x xi zone 0 no attached particles are mobilised in the remote zone of low velocities xi x 1 here suspension concentration is zero initial profiles of attached suspended and strained concentrations correspond to curves 0 in fig 6b d respectively at the moment t1 production of water occurs with the particles which initially have been detached in zone ii production of water with the particles which have been detached in zone i occurs at the moment t2 at the moment t3 production of particle free water occurs the corresponding profiles are marked by 1 2 and 3 maximum attached concentration is velocity dependent eq 6 the velocity for incompressible carrier fluid is radius dependent eq 8 therefore fines detachment does not occur during production the detachment occurs at the initial moment only and attached concentration profiles 0 1 2 and 3 in fig 6b coincide suspended concentration in the produced colloidal suspension decreases with time because particles arrive from more remote areas and the probability of straining increases strained particles accumulate in each point so their concentration increases with time deep bed filtration of detached particles occurs in zones ii and i a suspension particle in zone ii is either strained or produced at x xw a suspension particle in zone i is either strained or reaches the boundary x xm and enters zone iii with no attached particles in zone iii the particles continue performing deep bed filtration here the flow occurs at the absence of attached particles the higher is the distance from the production well the lower is the velocity the lower is the detaching torque and the lower is the suspended concentration of the detached fines so the initial profile 0 in zone i in fig 6c is flat in zone ii and decreases with x in zone i the higher is the distance from the production well the lower is the particle capture rate right hand side of eq 18 increases as x0 increases this explains the increasing suspension concentration profile 1 in zone ii at the moment t1 the decreasing profile 1 in zone iii is explained by the declining initial profile 0 now we discuss the suspension concentration profile 2 in fig 6c on the one hand the higher is the distance from the production well the lower is the particle capture rate yielding the rising suspension concentration profile on the other hand the higher is the distance from the production well the lower is the initial suspension concentration profile 0 in zone i resulting in the declining profile in zone iii competition between those two factors explains non monotonic suspension concentration profile 2 the attached particles are not mobilised at low velocities in remote domain 0 the particle free water flows in zone 0 afterwards in zone v and then in zone iv the strained concentrations in zones v and iv are inherited from suspension flows in zones i and iii respectively and remain steady state at the final moment tf 21 t f x i x w α the last mobilised particle reaches the production well afterwards the well produces only particle free water and well index remains the same 4 3 calculations of well impedance the relationship between initial pressure drop and rate corresponds to σs 0 22 δ p 0 q 0 μ 2 π k ln r e r w for dimensionless

well x xw in this case eq 24 provides different formulae for impedance in three time periods 0 t xm xw α 1 when integration 24 in x is performed consequently in zones ii i v and 0 xm xw α 1 t xi xm α

xw up to zero at the boundary x xi fig 6d lower values of strained particle concentration at a large distance from the well insignificantly contribute to the well index we define the size of formation damage zone in such a way that the strained particles outside the damaged zone contribute to impedance less than given by accuracy ε 1 nunes et al 2010 as it follows from formula for well impedance 24 the damage zone size xd is defined as 25 x w 1 s s x t x d x x w x d s s x t x d x x w 1 s s x t x d x ε as it follows from definition 25 after the removal of all strained particles in well neighbourhood with size xd only ε th fraction of well impedance remains the small parameter ε is the accuracy of the assumption that the overall skin is concentrated in the damaged zone with the size xd for practical use ε can be set as 0 1 or 0 01 simplification of numerator in ratio 25 allows calculating the damaged zone size along with impedance calculations by eq 24 26 x d 1 s s x t x d x x w 1 s s x t x d x ε consider equality of left and right hand sides in 26 the damaged zone size xd is determined from equality 26 by numerical solution of transcendental equation the damaged radius rd is time dependent with time straining occurs in the zone with decreasing radius so rd t decreases damaged radius depends on filtration coefficient and the form of maximum retention function it is independent of formation damage coefficient 5 comparison between the analytical and numerical models the validation of exact solution 19 20 by numerical modelling is performed using the hyperbolic pde solver by shampine 2005 the algorithm is implemented in software package matlab the detailed description of the algorithm numerical schema and the underlying theory is presented in website http faculty smu edu shampine current html the two step lax friedrichs finite difference method is used for the numerical solution of eqs b2 b3 the time and areal steps used for the finite difference solution are δt 0 0009 and δx 0 001 during the overall stabilisation period and over the areal interval xw 1 the relative difference between the numerical and analytical data does not exceed 10 4 for suspension concentration and 10 5 for strained concentration the high accuracy result is expected since the solution 19 20 is continuous it does not contain concentration shocks the analytical model 19 20 can be used as a benchmark for optimisation of numerical schema the improvement of the numerical method accuracy convergence and the computation time is important for history matching of well productivity where the iterative minimisation algorithm includes multiple direct runs 6 treatment of produced suspension concentration the mathematical model in the case of quadratic maximum retention function 9 contains six model constants σai ui λ um α and β typical impedance curves can be one parametric where the initial state of well exploitation where j t is linear two parametric corresponding to developed stage of well exploitation where j t that is already non linear and three parametric where the impedance curve already shows the tendency of stabilization depending on the degree of freedom of the production curve j t 3 4 or 5 from 6 model parameters must be determined from the laboratory data monitoring the suspended concentration c rw t in the produced fluid allows decreasing the number of unknown model coefficients by three in the case of three parametric impedance curve the history of suspended concentration c rw t provides all six model parameters here we assume constant filtration coefficient λ and mono sized suspension f c c assume that the drift delay factor α and initial detached suspension concentration of movable fines σai ϕ are known as it follows from the expression of suspension concentration in zone ii 4th row and 3rd column in table 1 27 x w 1 λ ln c t ϕ σ ai x w α t slope of straight line 27 determines the filtration coefficient λ time xm xw α of deviation of left hand side of eq 27 from the straight line determines maximum velocity um the moment when suspended concentration becomes zero xi xw α determines critical velocity ui three values of σai ui and um fully determine quadratic maximum retention function 9 yet the overall form of the maximum retention function σcr u can be determined from c rw t using the formula for suspended concentration in zone iii 5th line and 3rd column in table 1 then three model parameters σai ϕ β and α and can be determined by tuning three parametric impedance history j t for two and mono parametric j t one or two model parameters must be taken from the laboratory data 7 sensitivity study fig 7 presents the results of impedance sensitivity with respect to six model coefficients comparison between continuous blue dashed brown and dashed yellow curves in fig 7a shows that the higher is the drift delay factor the higher is straining rate and the faster is impedance growth yet as it follows from dimensionless form b3 b4 those three curves can be scaled into each other by the change of independent variable t αt indeed these impedance curves coincide after stretching in t axes comparison between dotted green continuous blue and dotted brown curves in fig 7a shows non monotonic impedance dependency of the filtration coefficient eq b4 shows that the particle capture rate is proportional to the product λc on the one hand the higher is the filtration coefficient the larger is the retained concentration causing permeability decline on the other hand the higher is the filtration coefficient the lower is the suspended concentration and the lower is the retention rate the above mentioned competitive factors yield non monotonic dependency high values of filtration coefficient yield fast impedance growth at the beginning of well exploitation followed by fast impedance stabilisation fig 7b shows that impedance is mostly sensitive to formation damage coefficient initial concentration of movable fines also affects j t an increase in both parameters yield j growth fig 7c shows that the higher is either critical velocity ui or maximum velocity um under constant σai the higher is the maximum retention function σcr u the lower is the mobilized fines concentration and the lower is the impedance also increase in either ui or um decreases radii ri and rm yielding decrease in the travel time and the stabilization period 8 treatment of well production histories in this section we present the results of production history matching for 23 wells upon the thorough analysis of the production data and reservoir mineralogy the publications that cover 23 field cases claim that the reason for formation damage is fines migration we assume quadratic maximum retention function given by eq 9 the model contains six independent parameters initial concentration of attached movable fines σai critical velocity ui filtration coefficient λ maximum velocity for attachment um drift delay factor α and formation damage coefficient β in the case where the maximum retention concentration corresponding to u 0 is given σa0 the parameters σai and ui become dependent so either of them should be given typical values of those model fines migration parameters as obtained from the laboratory tests are presented in table 3 with corresponding references table 4 presents the literature references for 23 wells and their numbers names since the produced fines concentration is unavailable in all 23 cases the parameters σa0 σai and um in table 5 are assumed critical velocity ui is calculated from eq 7 the cases 1 13 correspond to developed stages of the wells the impedance already stabilises for some of those therefore impedance curves for those cases are three parametric three parameters delay drift factor α formation damage coefficient β and filtration coefficient λ have been determined by tuning the impedance curves table 5 impedance curves for cases 14 19 does not enter the stabilization stage during production period but are non linear and have two degrees of freedom so only two constants delay drift factor α and formation damage coefficient β are determined from the impedance curve the impedance growth versus time for cases 20 23 exhibit linear trend which correspond to short production periods so just one parameter formation damage coefficient β is determined from the impedance curves table 3 presents the assumed typical values of the model fines migration parameters for 23 wells those values are obtained from laboratory corefloods the results of well behaviour prediction based on matched production history along with assumed parameters are given in table 6 fig 1a c 8a c e and g present the production history of the wells and the matching results fig 1b d 8b d f and h show the long term well impedance prediction including the stabilization the impedance stabilization corresponds to the finite time of particle arrival from the boundary of mobilized fines x xi fig 6 at the moment xi xw α case 1 by you et al 2015 fig 1 a presents impedance growth in production well from field salamander which is located in otway basin australia the rock fragments show a high percentage of illite chlorite flakes and kaolinite platelets several laboratory tests exhibit significant permeability decrease along with high concentrations of kaolinite and illite particles in the produced water time in fig 1 a is dimensionalised by the pore volume that was drained during the discharge period fig 1 a shows that during the production well index decreases 3 times clay particles have been detected in produced water calculation of electrostatic potential at room temperature shows the existence of two energy minima that deepen as salinity increases fig 4 c and d increase of temperature fig 4 a and b as well as decrease in salinity yield disappearance of first deep energy well so the attached particles at the reservoir conditions are attached in the second shallow energy well the particles attached in second shallow energy minimum are easily removable by drag force from the produced water long term prediction in fig 1 b shows that the impedance stabilization occurs after production of 6 discharge volumes and well index decreases 3 7 times case 8 by dev burman and das 1990 the aquifer saprolite in the kasai subarnarekha basin india is formed by the precambrian granitic rock chotanagpur granite containing different groups of sediments such as quartzite mica phyllite and chlorite biotite muscovite the vertical open hole well produces from the layer with thickness h 18 m fig 1 c shows that well index decreases 3 1 times during the production period the well data yield almost stabilized impedance curve allowing determining three model coefficients α β and λ impedance increases up to 3 2 during the stabilization period which is equal to 0 73 10 6 of pore volumes of the drainage areas case 16 by dev burman and das 1990 corresponds to the same basin as the previous case the vertical open hole well produces from the layer with thickness h 45 m fig 8 a shows that well index decrease 5 3 times during the production period the impedance stabilizes at 2 5 pv of the drained area yielding further impedance decrease up to 5 8 case 17 by barrash et al 2006 the boise hydrogeophysical research site is adjacent to the boise river 15 km east of downtown boise idaho usa it is formed by a shallow unconsolidated coarse grained fluvial aquifer underlined by clay the mobilization of fines was determined to be the cause of the well productivity decline fig 8 c and d show that well index decrease 8 4 times during the production period stabilization occurs at 2 5 pv when impedance reaches value 8 7 case 21 by van halem et al 2011 the production wells are located in the water treatment plant de put in the netherlands the cause of well clogging was determined to be the mobilization of particles and their capture in the well screen fig 8 e and f show that well index decrease 2 1 times after 15 months 0 08 pv of production impedance reaches 5 8 at 0 5 pv case 23 by barrash et al 2006 also exhibits linear impedance growth the well drains the same reservoir as described in case 17 the mobilization of fines was also determined to be the cause of the well skin effect fig 8 g and h show that well index decreases 9 8 times after production of 6 8 10 6 pv the impedance stabilizes at the moment of production of 2 1 pvs reaching value 110 table 5 shows that in the majority of cases coefficient of determination exceeds 0 8 i e the results of field and modelling data are in close agreement 9th column in table 5 three model parameters determined by matching the impedance history delay drift factor α formation damage coefficient β and filtration coefficient λ vary in common intervals sixths seventh and eights columns in table 5 shows the data that have the same order of magnitude as those obtained in

2017 yuan and moghanloo 2019 russell et al 2017 russell et al 2018 bai et al 2019 bai et al 2021 loi et al 2020 9 discussion production history and laboratory based well behaviour prediction using the analytical model the analytical model for well inflow performance under migration of natural reservoir fines presented in table 1 contains six parameters three of them determine the maximum concentration of attached fines as a function of velocity initial concentration of movable fine particles in the rock σai critical velocity ui at which the first attached particle is detached and maximum velocity um at which all movable fines are detached from the rock sometimes instead of maximum velocity um the maximum retained concentration σa0 at u 0 is taken three other coefficients correspond to mobilised fines migration filtration coefficient λ formation damage coefficient β and drift delay factor α the skin versus time curve which is calculated from the production history is one parametric at the beginning of the well exploitation two parametric at the developed stage and three parametric for the well that enters the commencement of stabilisation stage consequently only up to three model parameters can be determined from the production curve other three to five parameters must be obtained from the history of particle concentration in the produced water or taken from the coreflood tests if neither of the above mentioned data are available typical values of the model coefficients can be taken from the literature like in table 3 the explicit formulae for the analytical model presented in table 1 and implicit expressions for well impedance 24 and pressure drawdown can be directly implemented in excel or matlab without going through the mathematical derivations accounting for probabilistic particle property distributions requires solving transcendental equation 19 and using integration in time eq 20 the reliable prediction for impedance and well index can be used for planning well stimulation procedures for the damaged well acidizing re perforation etc if the model parameters are known for similar wells and reservoirs the prediction of productivity decline can be used for the planning and design of a new project the filtration coefficient determines the size of damaged zone rd which defines the necessary volume of injected acid πϕ rd 2 per unit length of the well and the period of the well intervention to produce from undamaged zone the perforation length must exceed the radius of the damaged zone nunes et al 2010 the essence of tuning drift delay factor α let us calculate the time of capture free run of the reservoir fines the capture free run of the mobilised fine particle is 1 λ so the time of capture free run is equal to λu 1 after the time of capture free run a particle is either strained in the rock or produced with the inflow water so the well productivity index stabilises to make an upper estimate let us chose minimum filtration coefficient λ 10 2 1 m from table 5 and maximum velocity in well vicinity which is u 10 4 m s barenblatt et al 1991 the corresponding time of capture free run is equal to 12 days for mean typical values of λ 10 1 m and u 10 5 m s the time of capture free run is equal to 3 h yet production wells are losing their productivity throughout the overall life period i e during years the paradox is resolved by introduction of the drift delay factor α so the particle speed is αu yang et al 2016 the concept is based on the observation that the particles attached in the secondary shallow energy minimum fig 4c are rolling or sliding along the rock surface while the lifted particles are carried in the bulk of fluid with velocity u li et al 2005 johnson and tong 2006 yuan and shapiro 2011a bradford et al 2012 short period of particle exchange between the rolling sliding and suspended populations which is equal to flow time through a single pore determines the mean particle transport velocity αu yang et al 2016 minimum laboratory based α value is 10 4 table 5 shows the minimum of 10 5 extending the above estimated time of capture free run 1 α times resolves the paradox explaining well productivity decline during the overall life period application of the analytical model the analytical model 19 20 allows matching well productivity decline due to fines migration and induced formation damage however practical application of the model must be accompanied by rigorous verification of the model assumptions the model assumes particle rock attraction which can be confirmed by dlvo theory it is important to notice that particles can be detached from the secondary minimum at significantly lower flow velocity than from the primary minimum the energy potentials presented in fig 4 correspond to the reservoir condition of case 1 at the reservoir temperature primary minimum disappears all particles are attached in the shallow secondary minimum at high salinity secondary minimum disappears all particles are attached in the deep primary minimum the geothermal reservoirs with low salinity water are highly susceptible to fines migration for complete characterisation of the fines migration system from well production data the particle size distribution in the produced water must be periodically determined during the well exploitation the threshold value of jamming ratio particle size divided by pore size allows determining whether the produced particle was detached inside the reservoir and travelled to the wellbore or was detached from the well wall during well erosion the filtration theory provides the rule of 1 3rd i e the produced particles that are smaller than 1 3rd of the mean pore size are the migrating reservoir fines the well productivity decline can be described by the analytical model 19 20 24 otherwise productivity declines due to sand production and rock re compaction in the drainage zone more sophisticated calculations of the threshold jamming ratio that use pore size distribution and pore space geometry can be performed using percolation and effective medium theory by the analogy with rock conductivity prediction carlier et al 2007 cvetkovic et al 2016 rabinovich et al 2016 2017 zhang et al 2019 babadagli 2020 application of the notion of the damaged zone size the analytical model 19 20 allows determining the size of formation damage zone rd given by eq 26 the practical applications of this notion are estimates of acid volume for well acidizing and sizing of perforation length it is important to accurately define the amount of injected acid that removes the strained particles causing formation damage the reasons are the high cost of acid during acidizing of long production well and also the high cost of production interruption which is proportional to the acid injection period the volume v of acid per unit well length height that sweeps the damaged zone is 28 v π r d 2 ϕ another well stimulation option is casing of an open hole well with further perforation or re perforation of the well with damaged perforation holes the perforation hole must go through the overall damage zone and exit it in order to drain the undamaged formation nunes et al 2010 therefore the criterion for perforation length is that it must exceed rd the same speculations correspond to micro fracturing of well vicinity using micro sized proppant placement keshavarz et al 2016 table 6 presents the values of damaged radius for 23 cases at the moment of stabilisation in the majority of the cases rd is limited to 1 m it rarely exceeds 3 m extensions of the model during flow in unsaturated porous media the attached fines are detached by capillary menisci under the interfacial force dominance yuan and shapiro 2011b lazouskaya et al 2013 aramrak et al 2013 the mathematical model includes equations for movement of the interfacial water air surface and fines detachment by capillary force shapiro 2015 shapiro 2016 rabinovich 2019 here the upscaling of governing equations from pore to core scale must be performed which is feasible for only some displacement regimes rabinovich 2017 rabinovich 2018 the relative permeability is affected by strained fines le hussain et al 2010 kamali and hussain 2017 the above also includes fines migration during co2 storage zhang et al 2020 in single phase nano colloidal suspension transport particle adsorption can dominate over attachment bai et al 2019 the adsorption gibbs energy dominates for particles of nano sizes and below while the attachment and detachment of colloidal fines is determined by electrostatic dlvo energy given by eq a1 bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 elimelech et al 2013 for the cases of high ionic strength and low separation distance where the hydration repulsion force has the same order of magnitude as dlvo forces an extended dlvo xdlvo theory is used to calculate adhesion in eqs 3 5 a1 a2 li et al 2020 fines dispersion can significantly contribute to advective particle transport polyanin and dil man 1990 polyanin and dilʹman 1994 the linear 1d problems accounting for adsorption capture and diffusion allow for analytical modelling bai et al 2015 polyanin and nazaikinskii 2015 to account for rock micro heterogeneity surface asperity complex particle and pore geometry micro scale modelling like computational fluid dynamics and molecular modelling can be applied here the hydrodynamic forces in eqs 3 5 a1 a2 are obtained by navier stokes equations and electrostatic forces are calculated by the surface element integration method li et al 2020 shen et al 2020 10 conclusions the present work derives an analytical model for radial flow towards wells under migration of natural reservoir fines allowing for well clogging prediction prediction of well behaviour for 23 field cases by the analytical model has been performed based on well history and laboratory data the work yields the following conclusions the flow domain at the moment of switching the well on consists of three zones well vicinity where all movable attached fines are lifted under large velocities intermediate zone where the remaining concentration monotonically increases from zero up to maximum at the boundary of fines mobilisation zone and suspended particle free flow zone behind the fines mobilisation boundary the radial inflow performance problem under mobilisation migration and straining of size distributed fines allows for exact solution the solution allows for explicit formulae of suspended and strained particle concentrations the impedance skin factor as derived from the analytical model stabilises at the moment when the characteristic line that starts at the fines mobilisation boundary r ri at t 0 arrives at the wellbore r rw the analytical impedance formulae yields the expressions for stabilisation time maximum impedance radii of the damage and fines mobilisation areas the mathematical model for fines migration contains six constants initial concentration of movable fines drift delay factor filtration and formation damage coefficients and two constants characterising the maximum retention function for example critical and maximum velocities determination of these constants from laboratory corefloods is well established however depending on the form of well impedance curve only one two or three parameters can be determined from well data to predict well behaviour the remaining parameters must be taken either from the coreflood data or from fines concentration in the produced fluid the period of particle capture free run after which the well index stabilises does not exceed weeks while the productivity index declining due to fines migration occurs during the overall well life period i e during years the paradox is resolved by introduction of the drift delay factor α which is the ratio between the rolling sliding speed of the particles attached in the secondary energy minimum and the carrier fluid velocity this prolongs the stabilisation tperiod 1 α times which can vary from 102 to 105 and resolves the paradox other high sensitivity parameters for well impedance are formation damage coefficient critical and maximum velocities the analytical model closely matches 23 production well histories the values of tuned coefficients vary in common intervals the analytical model derived allows defining the formation damage size the size is determined by an implicit formula using the strained concentration profile assuming that the production data have been matched up to some moment by the laboratory based analytical model the strained concentration profile is known at this moment this allows calculating the size of the formation damage zone the formation damage size allows estimating the amount of acid that removes the strained particles from fines migration up to a small predetermined fraction of the initial skin factor it also determines the perforation lengths for perforation of a new well or re perforation of the damaged well credit authorship contribution statement l chequer investigation methodology c

energy minimum fig 4b under no flow the particles are attached in the energy minimum which corresponds to zero electrostatic force inequality 3 degenerates into equality under the particle mechanical

geothermal and oil gas production wells due to migration of natural reservoir fines has been widely reported in the literature khilar and fogler 1998 the reason is drastic permeability decline due to mobilisation migration and straining of natural reservoir fines by the flowing fluid water oil or gas the effect of permeability decline well impairment during well exploitation is revealed by either rate decline q t under fixed pressure drawdown 1 δ p t p res p w or by the increase in pressure drawdown during the maintenance of a constant production rate this formation damage effect is expressed

constant production rate discussed in this work the impedance is a dimensionless pressure drawdown fig 1 a shows impedance growth i e well productivity decline during hot water production from geothermal reservoir you et al 2015 well index decreased 2 2 times during the well exploitation fig 1c and 1d present well productivity decline during exploitation of an artesian well burman and das 1990 during the reported exploitation period well index decreased 3 1 times both papers indicate migration of natural reservoir fines followed by the rock clogging as a main cause for the formation damage the particles that are attached to the rock coat the rock surface therefore the detachment of these particles does not significantly increase rock permeability however plugging of thin pores during fines migration cuts off a flow path yielding significant permeability decline fig 2 a fig 2b presents the schematic for fines detachment by the drag and lifting forces exerting attached particles from the flowing fluid while the particles are attached by the electrostatic and gravitational forces these speculations explain why the detached particles migrate and clog the pores causing permeability impairment civan 2007 russell et al 2017 muneer et al 2020 fig 3 shows scanning electron microscopy sem images of detaching and migrating kaolinite fines the most widely spread minerals generating migrating fines are clays mostly kaolinite illite and chlorite however often silica silts or unconsolidated sand can be also detached yielding significant permeability damage fig 3a presents the kaolinite booklets attached to the sand grains electrostatic attraction joins thin and large kaolinite platelets into thick booklets khilar and fogler 1998 russell et al 2018 being detached from the booklet the kaolinite platelet can plug even large pores fig 3b shows the pore plugging by the set of kaolinite booklets after their detachment and migration the pore was open before the flow started fines migration is one of the most important physics phenomena causing productivity decline in aquifers and oil reservoirs which explains an intensive current theoretical and experimental research of colloidal suspension transport in porous media khilar and fogler 1998 variety of pore and particle sizes and shapes non uniform pore space geometry and micro heterogeneity on the pore scale are reflected by stochastic models of random walks bolztmann s equation and population balance models shapiro 2007 shapiro and wesselingh 2008 shapiro and yuan 2012 bedrikovetsky et al 2019 wang et al 2020 yosri et al 2020 the mechanical equilibrium conditions for a particle on a plane substrate or rock surface are given by bergendahl and grasso 2000 freitas and sharma 2001 bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 li et al 2005 johnson and tong 2006 these conditions allow predicting a fine particle mobilisation by the flow under a change in velocity salinity ph temperature etc the kinetic equation for detachment rate is proportional to the difference between the current and critical equilibrium values of velocity salinity ph temperature etc the relaxation times are empirical constants and do not reflect the mechanical equilibrium conditions of attached particles zheng et al 2014 bai et al 2015 bai et al 2019 an alternative model for particle detachment is the maximum retention concentration function of velocity salinity ph temperature etc which is derived directly from the mechanical equilibrium conditions and reflects pore and particle sizes and geometry bedrikovetsky et al 2011 bedrikovetsky et al 2012 maximum retention function closes the system of governing equations which are used for modelling of fines migration and suspension colloidal flows in porous media yuan and shapiro 2011b you et al 2015 2016 yuan and moghanloo 2017 yuan and moghanloo 2019 several analytical solutions have been derived polyanin and zaitsev 2012 loi et al 2020 and are used for interpretation of the laboratory data russell et al 2017 russell et al 2018 and field cases zeinijahromi et al 2012 the above mentioned models assume uniform colloids while variation of the particle properties size form zeta potential etc can highly affect the suspension colloidal transport in natural rocks using discrete values for those properties yields significant increase in the number of equations and corresponding computational difficulties yuan and shapiro 2010 probabilistic averaging of the transport equations that accounts for probabilistic distributions of the particle properties introduces the so called suspension function into the capture rate equation instead of suspension concentration keeping the same number of governing equations bedrikovetsky et al 2019 the model with suspension function was validated by comparison with numerous laboratory tests on multicomponent colloidal suspension flow malgaresi et al 2020 long term well productivity prediction from the production history is extremely important for production forecast and also for planning well stimulation acidizing fracturing and re fracturing re perforation etc however a method for history matching and model tuning using the laboratory data is unavailable an analytical model for well inflow performance accounting for fines migration of the particles with distributed properties is also not available the present work fills the gap we derived an exact solution for radial flow towards well for size distributed fine particles the analytical model for fluid production under fines migration allows matching well production history using the laboratory data we introduced a notion of formation damage zone size around the production well where the suspended particles are accumulated during well exploitation and also calculated this size from the production and laboratory data close match of 23 field cases on the productivity decline due to fines migration and the common intervals of the tuned parameter variation validate the analytical model the structure of the text is as follows section 2 presents mechanical equilibrium conditions of fines mobilisation and introduces maximum retention concentration function as a model for particle detachment section 3 formulates one dimensional 1d equations for water flow towards well under fines migration section 4 derives an analytical model for the 1d inflow problem section 5 validates the analytical model by comparison with the numerical solution section 6 presents the inverse problem of determining the maximum retention function from fines concentration in the produced fluid section 7 performs the sensitivity study of the impedance history with respect to the model parameters section 8 presents the matching of 23 field cases by the analytical model sections 9 of discussions and 10 of conclusions finalise the paper 2 pore scale physics of particle detachment from a substrate in shear flows the particle detachment model used in this work is expressed by the maximum retention concentration as a function of velocity the maximum retention function is derived from the torque balance of the attaching and detaching forces in this section we describe the mechanical equilibrium conditions for a particle attached to a porous medium surface and the detachment upon the breach of those conditions fig 2a shows particle detachment from the pore throat migration in the flowing water and plugging of the pore which is smaller than the particle natural particles clays silica and sand fines are lined along the grain surface so the detachment causes insignificant increase in porosity and permeability corresponding to the increase in pore volume by the mobilised particle volume yet pore plugging by size exclusion yields closing the flow path resulting in significant permeability decline fig 3 shows sem image of the pore plugged by detached kaolinite fines the pore was open before the flux started this is a typical schematic for permeability damage due to fines detachment migration and straining fines rolling sliding and lifting are the main regimes of fines detachment and motion bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 johnson and tong 2006 the attached particle mobilizes and starts rolling along the rock surface if the detaching torque exceeds the attaching torque i e 3 t a t d f e f g l n f d l d f l l n 0 where fl fd fe fg are the lift drag electrostatic and gravitational forces respectively ld and ln are the lever arms for drag and electrostatic forces ta and td are the attaching and detaching torques of the above mentioned forces fig 2b this scenario corresponds to the hypothesis that the particle rolls around the neighbour particle or substrate asperity at the moment of detachment drag and lift are mostly velocity dependent and are calculated by the generalised stokes and saffman s formulae using the asymptotic models for viscous boundary layers around a particle in viscous shear flow polyanin and dil man 1990 polyanin and dilʹman 1994 electrostatic force in eq 3 corresponds to maximum attraction adhesion force over the overall separation distance interval appendix a which is shown in fig 4 as inflection points of the dlvo energy profiles if the detaching drag exceeds the friction force the mobilized fine slips along the rock surface 4 f y μ f f e f g f l f d 0 here μf is the coulomb friction coefficient the attached particle lifts from the rock surface if the vertical detaching lift exceeds attaching electrostatic and gravitational forces 5 f z f e f g f l 0 either of fines migration regime 3 4 or 5 can be determined using phase diagrams chequer et al 2021 the experimental results show that the most widely spread detachment regime is rolling bradford et al 2013 so in this work we focus on the mechanical equailibrium condition given by equality 3 the equivalence between the mathematical formulations of mechanical equilibrium criteria 3 and 4 is given by equality ln ld μf the lifting occurs at high velocities which are unrealistic even near wellbores in natural reservoirs therefore further in the text we concentrate on rolling criterion 3 in the case of two phase flow in porous media air and water or gas and water capillary force must be accounted for in the torque balance 3 yuan and shapiro 2011b lazouskaya et al 2013 aramrak et al 2013 consider the particle ensemble attached to the rock surface non uniform particle and pore shapes heterogeneous surface charge distribution for pores and particles and distributions of their sizes yield distribution of all components of eqs 3 and a1 however each particle is detached if the conditions 3 and 4 are fulfilled consider a continuous increase in water velocity keeping water composition constant for a fixed pore space and attached fines geometry drag and lift in eq 3 are functions of velocity for a given velocity eq 3 determines which particles are mobilised and which remain attached the velocity dependence of the attached concentration σa 6 σ a σ cr u is called the maximum retention function bedrikovetsky et al 2011 bedrikovetsky et al 2012 here the attached concentration is the volumetric fraction of the particles per unit of rock volume the plot of dependency 6 is presented in fig 5 the higher is the darcy s velocity u the higher are drag and lift the higher is the detaching torque and the lower is the concentration of attached particles at maximum velocity um the drag is so high that inequality 3 is fulfilled for all the particles so no particles remain attached at u um fig 5 also shows how maximum retention function can be determined experimentally by measurement of the amount of mobilised particles δσn by the velocity increase from un to un 1 the critical velocity ui is the maximum velocity where fines detachment does not occur 7 σ ai σ cr u i where σai is the initial concentration of the attached movable fines maximum retention function 7 is a mathematical model for fines detachment with velocity increase numerous works have validated this model by comparison with the laboratory coreflooding data bedrikovetsky et al 2011 bedrikovetsky et al 2012 russell et al 2017 russell et al 2018 yang et al 2016 in the next section this function will be used to close the system of governing equations for fines mobilisation detachment and capture by the porous rock 3 governing equations for radial fines migration toward well in this section we present model assumptions section 3 1 and system of governing equations section 3 2 formulate initial and boundary conditions section 3 3 and present the system in dimensionless form appendix b 3 1 model assumptions we assume incompressibility of suspension colloidal fluid in porous media i e 8 u q 2 π r where the production rate per unit length of the well q is constant we also assume constant production rate i e velocity 8 is a function of radius only consequently impedance in eq 2 is the ratio between the current and initial pressure drawdowns eq 8 assumes incompressible carrier fluid and small suspended concentration so adding the colloid does not affect the fluid density assuming additivity of fluids and suspended solids amagat s law yields the same assumption for large suspension concentrations bedrikovetsky 2013 it is also assumed that the attached reservoir fines are mobilized if their attached concentration exceeds the maximum retention function 6 the relationship between the critical retained concentration and flow velocity is obtained from the conditions of mechanical equilibrium of the attached particles on the rock surface given by eq 3 the most wide spread condition of mechanical equilibrium in porous media is the equality of attaching and detaching torques of drag lift and electrostatic forces eq 3 and fig 2b here we use the expression for maximum retention function derived for porous media with cylindrical pores and single sized particles which deposit in poly layers on the pore walls bedrikovetsky et al 2012 zeinijahromi et al 2012 9 σ a σ cr u σ a 0 1 u u m 2 where σa0 is the maximum concentration of movable fines in the rock at u 0 and um is the minimum velocity above which all particles are detached the values of σa0 and um correspond to points 0 σa0 and um 0 in the plane u σ which are the top and bottom points of the quadratic parabola in fig 5 as it follows from eq 7 the fines are not lifted at velocities lower than ui the critical velocity ui corresponds to mobilization of the first fine particle during the velocity increase the higher is the velocity at u ui the lower is the attached concentration for velocities higher than the maximum velocity no particles can be secured on the rock surface and maximum retention function is equal zero considering filtration of multicomponent colloids with distributed properties we use the suspension function f c instead of suspension concentration c in the capture rate equation bedrikovetsky et al 2019 3 2 system of governing equations for radial suspension colloidal transport the continuity equation accounts for suspended attached and strained particles and also for drift delay factor α which reflects the suspended particle flow that is slower than that of the carrier water james et al 2018 chequer et al 2018

α 1 is the drift delay factor the suspension concentration is defined as volumetric particle fraction in unitary pore volume while the attached and strained concentrations are volumetric particle fractions per unit volume of the rock maximum retention function 6 determines the attached concentration the kinetics equation for size exclusion retention rate for the particles with distributed

identical particle properties f c c modified darcy s law for suspension flux accounts for the permeability decline due to size excluded particles 12 u k μ 1 β σ s p r where β is the formation damage coefficient 3 3 1d radial problem of inflow well performance eqs 6 8 determine radii ri and rm where the velocities are equal to ui and um respectively consequently all attached reservoir fines are lifted from well vicinity between rw and rm no particles will be lifted outside the zone where r ri in the intermediate zone rm r ri the excess of the attach particles over the maximum retention function are lifted by definition of attached and suspended concentrations the detached concentration and consequent suspended concentration are linked by the relationship δc δσϕ consequently the

strained concentration in those zones is steady state in zone 0 strained concentration is equal zero for the cases where suspension function f c is either quadratic polynomial or linear the integral

with high accuracy polyanin and zaitsev 2012 polyanin and nazaikinskii 2015 the same approximate method is applicable to 1d problem with linear blocking function λ λ ss and any arbitrary suspension function f c in all above mentioned cases characteristics remain straight 17 and structure of the flow zone in x t plane fig 6 remains the same the model assumptions are explained in table 2 the hydrodynamic interpretation of the exact solution 19 20 presented in the next section is based on the facts that characteristics of the hyperbolic mass balance equation 16 corresponds to particle trajectories and eq 16 captures the propagation of concentration profile along the particle trajectories accounting for the particle capture barenblatt et al 1991 bedrikovetsky 2013 4 2 structure of the flow domain exact solution 19 20 allows distinguishing between the flow zones 0 v with different structure of retained suspension and strained particle ensembles fig 6 shows three zones of instant fines detachment at t 0 that correspond to conditions 13 zone ii all the attached particles are removed by high drag force under high velocity in wellbore vicinity xw x xm zone i the particles are mobilised according to the maximum retention function 6 in the intermediate zone xm x xi zone 0 no attached particles are mobilised in the remote zone of low velocities xi x 1 here suspension concentration is zero initial profiles of attached suspended and strained concentrations correspond to curves 0 in fig 6b d respectively at the moment t1 production of water occurs with the particles which initially have been detached in zone ii production of water with the particles which have been detached in zone i occurs at the moment t2 at the moment t3 production of particle free water occurs the corresponding profiles are marked by 1 2 and 3 maximum attached concentration is velocity dependent eq 6 the velocity for incompressible carrier fluid is radius dependent eq 8 therefore fines detachment does not occur during production the detachment occurs at the initial moment only and attached concentration profiles 0 1 2 and 3 in fig 6b coincide suspended concentration in the produced colloidal suspension decreases with time because particles arrive from more remote areas and the probability of straining increases strained particles accumulate in each point so their concentration increases with time deep bed filtration of detached particles occurs in zones ii and i a suspension particle in zone ii is either strained or produced at x xw a suspension particle in zone i is either strained or reaches the boundary x xm and enters zone iii with no attached particles in zone iii the particles continue performing deep bed filtration here the flow occurs at the absence of attached particles the higher is the distance from the production well the lower is the velocity the lower is the detaching torque and the lower is the suspended concentration of the detached fines so the initial profile 0 in zone i in fig 6c is flat in zone ii and decreases with x in zone i the higher is the distance from the production well the lower is the particle capture rate right hand side of eq 18 increases as x0 increases this explains the increasing suspension concentration profile 1 in zone ii at the moment t1 the decreasing profile 1 in zone iii is explained by the declining initial profile 0 now we discuss the suspension concentration profile 2 in fig 6c on the one hand the higher is the distance from the production well the lower is the particle capture rate yielding the rising suspension concentration profile on the other hand the higher is the distance from the production well the lower is the initial suspension concentration profile 0 in zone i resulting in the declining profile in zone iii competition between those two factors explains non monotonic suspension concentration profile 2 the attached particles are not mobilised at low velocities in remote domain 0 the particle free water flows in zone 0 afterwards in zone v and then in zone iv the strained concentrations in zones v and iv are inherited from suspension flows in zones i and iii respectively and remain steady state at the final moment tf 21 t f x i x w α the last mobilised particle reaches the production well afterwards the well produces only particle free water and well index remains the same 4 3 calculations of well impedance the relationship between initial pressure drop and rate corresponds to σs 0 22 δ p 0 q 0 μ 2 π k ln r e r w for dimensionless

xw up to zero at the boundary x xi fig 6d lower values of strained particle concentration at a large distance from the well insignificantly contribute to the well index we define the size of formation damage zone in such a way that the strained particles outside the damaged zone contribute to impedance less than given by accuracy ε 1 nunes et al 2010 as it follows from formula for well impedance 24 the damage zone size xd is defined as 25 x w 1 s s x t x d x x w x d s s x t x d x x w 1 s s x t x d x ε as it follows from definition 25 after the removal of all strained particles in well neighbourhood with size xd only ε th fraction of well impedance remains the small parameter ε is the accuracy of the assumption that the overall skin is concentrated in the damaged zone with the size xd for practical use ε can be set as 0 1 or 0 01 simplification of numerator in ratio 25 allows calculating the damaged zone size along with impedance calculations by eq 24 26 x d 1 s s x t x d x x w 1 s s x t x d x ε consider equality of left and right hand sides in 26 the damaged zone size xd is determined from equality 26 by numerical solution of transcendental equation the damaged radius rd is time dependent with time straining occurs in the zone with decreasing radius so rd t decreases damaged radius depends on filtration coefficient and the form of maximum retention function it is independent of formation damage coefficient 5 comparison between the analytical and numerical models the validation of exact solution 19 20 by numerical modelling is performed using the hyperbolic pde solver by shampine 2005 the algorithm is implemented in software package matlab the detailed description of the algorithm numerical schema and the underlying theory is presented in website http faculty smu edu shampine current html the two step lax friedrichs finite difference method is used for the numerical solution of eqs b2 b3 the time and areal steps used for the finite difference solution are δt 0 0009 and δx 0 001 during the overall stabilisation period and over the areal interval xw 1 the relative difference between the numerical and analytical data does not exceed 10 4 for suspension concentration and 10 5 for strained concentration the high accuracy result is expected since the solution 19 20 is continuous it does not contain concentration shocks the analytical model 19 20 can be used as a benchmark for optimisation of numerical schema the improvement of the numerical method accuracy convergence and the computation time is important for history matching of well productivity where the iterative minimisation algorithm includes multiple direct runs 6 treatment of produced suspension concentration the mathematical model in the case of quadratic maximum retention function 9 contains six model constants σai ui λ um α and β typical impedance curves can be one parametric where the initial state of well exploitation where j t is linear two parametric corresponding to developed stage of well exploitation where j t that is already non linear and three parametric where the impedance curve already shows the tendency of stabilization depending on the degree of freedom of the production curve j t 3 4 or 5 from 6 model parameters must be determined from the laboratory data monitoring the suspended concentration c rw t in the produced fluid allows decreasing the number of unknown model coefficients by three in the case of three parametric impedance curve the history of suspended concentration c rw t provides all six model parameters here we assume constant filtration coefficient λ and mono sized suspension f c c assume that the drift delay factor α and initial detached suspension concentration of movable fines σai ϕ are known as it follows from the expression of suspension concentration in zone ii 4th row and 3rd column in table 1 27 x w 1 λ ln c t ϕ σ ai x w α t slope of straight line 27 determines the filtration coefficient λ time xm xw α of deviation of left hand side of eq 27 from the straight line determines maximum velocity um the moment when suspended concentration becomes zero xi xw α determines critical velocity ui three values of σai ui and um fully determine quadratic maximum retention function 9 yet the overall form of the maximum retention function σcr u can be determined from c rw t using the formula for suspended concentration in zone iii 5th line and 3rd column in table 1 then three model parameters σai ϕ β and α and can be determined by tuning three parametric impedance history j t for two and mono parametric j t one or two model parameters must be taken from the laboratory data 7 sensitivity study fig 7 presents the results of impedance sensitivity with respect to six model coefficients comparison between continuous blue dashed brown and dashed yellow curves in fig 7a shows that the higher is the drift delay factor the higher is straining rate and the faster is impedance growth yet as it follows from dimensionless form b3 b4 those three curves can be scaled into each other by the change of independent variable t αt indeed these impedance curves coincide after stretching in t axes comparison between dotted green continuous blue and dotted brown curves in fig 7a shows non monotonic impedance dependency of the filtration coefficient eq b4 shows that the particle capture rate is proportional to the product λc on the one hand the higher is the filtration coefficient the larger is the retained concentration causing permeability decline on the other hand the higher is the filtration coefficient the lower is the suspended concentration and the lower is the retention rate the above mentioned competitive factors yield non monotonic dependency high values of filtration coefficient yield fast impedance growth at the beginning of well exploitation followed by fast impedance stabilisation fig 7b shows that impedance is mostly sensitive to formation damage coefficient initial concentration of movable fines also affects j t an increase in both parameters yield j growth fig 7c shows that the higher is either critical velocity ui or maximum velocity um under constant σai the higher is the maximum retention function σcr u the lower is the mobilized fines concentration and the lower is the impedance also increase in either ui or um decreases radii ri and rm yielding decrease in the travel time and the stabilization period 8 treatment of well production histories in this section we present the results of production history matching for 23 wells upon the thorough analysis of the production data and reservoir mineralogy the publications that cover 23 field cases claim that the reason for formation damage is fines migration we assume quadratic maximum retention function given by eq 9 the model contains six independent parameters initial concentration of attached movable fines σai critical velocity ui filtration coefficient λ maximum velocity for attachment um drift delay factor α and formation damage coefficient β in the case where the maximum retention concentration corresponding to u 0 is given σa0 the parameters σai and ui become dependent so either of them should be given typical values of those model fines migration parameters as obtained from the laboratory tests are presented in table 3 with corresponding references table 4 presents the literature references for 23 wells and their numbers names since the produced fines concentration is unavailable in all 23 cases the parameters σa0 σai and um in table 5 are assumed critical velocity ui is calculated from eq 7 the cases 1 13 correspond to developed stages of the wells the impedance already stabilises for some of those therefore impedance curves for those cases are three parametric three parameters delay drift factor α formation damage coefficient β and filtration coefficient λ have been determined by tuning the impedance curves table 5 impedance curves for cases 14 19 does not enter the stabilization stage during production period but are non linear and have two degrees of freedom so only two constants delay drift factor α and formation damage coefficient β are determined from the impedance curve the impedance growth versus time for cases 20 23 exhibit linear trend which correspond to short production periods so just one parameter formation damage coefficient β is determined from the impedance curves table 3 presents the assumed typical values of the model fines migration parameters for 23 wells those values are obtained from laboratory corefloods the results of well behaviour prediction based on matched production history along with assumed parameters are given in table 6 fig 1a c 8a c e and g present the production history of the wells and the matching results fig 1b d 8b d f and h show the long term well impedance prediction including the stabilization the impedance stabilization corresponds to the finite time of particle arrival from the boundary of mobilized fines x xi fig 6 at the moment xi xw α case 1 by you et al 2015 fig 1 a presents impedance growth in production well from field salamander which is located in otway basin australia the rock fragments show a high percentage of illite chlorite flakes and kaolinite platelets several laboratory tests exhibit significant permeability decrease along with high concentrations of kaolinite and illite particles in the produced water time in fig 1 a is dimensionalised by the pore volume that was drained during the discharge period fig 1 a shows that during the production well index decreases 3 times clay particles have been detected in produced water calculation of electrostatic potential at room temperature shows the existence of two energy minima that deepen as salinity increases fig 4 c and d increase of temperature fig 4 a and b as well as decrease in salinity yield disappearance of first deep energy well so the attached particles at the reservoir conditions are attached in the second shallow energy well the particles attached in second shallow energy minimum are easily removable by drag force from the produced water long term prediction in fig 1 b shows that the impedance stabilization occurs after production of 6 discharge volumes and well index decreases 3 7 times case 8 by dev burman and das 1990 the aquifer saprolite in the kasai subarnarekha basin india is formed by the precambrian granitic rock chotanagpur granite containing different groups of sediments such as quartzite mica phyllite and chlorite biotite muscovite the vertical open hole well produces from the layer with thickness h 18 m fig 1 c shows that well index decreases 3 1 times during the production period the well data yield almost stabilized impedance curve allowing determining three model coefficients α β and λ impedance increases up to 3 2 during the stabilization period which is equal to 0 73 10 6 of pore volumes of the drainage areas case 16 by dev burman and das 1990 corresponds to the same basin as the previous case the vertical open hole well produces from the layer with thickness h 45 m fig 8 a shows that well index decrease 5 3 times during the production period the impedance stabilizes at 2 5 pv of the drained area yielding further impedance decrease up to 5 8 case 17 by barrash et al 2006 the boise hydrogeophysical research site is adjacent to the boise river 15 km east of downtown boise idaho usa it is formed by a shallow unconsolidated coarse grained fluvial aquifer underlined by clay the mobilization of fines was determined to be the cause of the well productivity decline fig 8 c and d show that well index decrease 8 4 times during the production period stabilization occurs at 2 5 pv when impedance reaches value 8 7 case 21 by van halem et al 2011 the production wells are located in the water treatment plant de put in the netherlands the cause of well clogging was determined to be the mobilization of particles and their capture in the well screen fig 8 e and f show that well index decrease 2 1 times after 15 months 0 08 pv of production impedance reaches 5 8 at 0 5 pv case 23 by barrash et al 2006 also exhibits linear impedance growth the well drains the same reservoir as described in case 17 the mobilization of fines was also determined to be the cause of the well skin effect fig 8 g and h show that well index decreases 9 8 times after production of 6 8 10 6 pv the impedance stabilizes at the moment of production of 2 1 pvs reaching value 110 table 5 shows that in the majority of cases coefficient of determination exceeds 0 8 i e the results of field and modelling data are in close agreement 9th column in table 5 three model parameters determined by matching the impedance history delay drift factor α formation damage coefficient β and filtration coefficient λ vary in common intervals sixths seventh and eights columns in table 5 shows the data that have the same order of magnitude as those obtained in laboratory experiments bedrikovetsky et al 2003 bedrikovetsky and caruso 2014 guedes et al 2009 nunes et al 2010 yuan and shapiro 2011a yuan and shapiro 2011b marquez et al 2014 yuan and moghanloo 2017 yuan and moghanloo 2019 russell et al 2017 russell et al 2018 bai et al 2019 bai et al 2021 loi et al 2020 9 discussion production history and laboratory based well behaviour prediction using the analytical model the analytical model for well inflow performance under migration of natural reservoir fines presented in table 1 contains six parameters three of them determine the maximum concentration of attached fines as a function of velocity initial concentration of movable fine particles in the rock σai critical velocity ui at which the first attached particle is detached and maximum velocity um at which all movable fines are detached from the rock sometimes instead of maximum velocity um the maximum retained concentration σa0 at u 0 is taken three other coefficients correspond to mobilised fines migration filtration coefficient λ formation damage coefficient β and drift delay factor α the skin versus time curve which is calculated from the production history is one parametric at the beginning of the well exploitation two parametric at the developed stage and three parametric for the well that enters the commencement of stabilisation stage consequently only up to three model parameters can be determined from the production curve other three to five parameters must be obtained from the history of particle concentration in the produced water or taken from the coreflood tests if neither of the above mentioned data are available typical values of the model coefficients can be taken from the literature like in table 3 the explicit formulae for the analytical model presented in table 1 and implicit expressions for well impedance 24 and pressure drawdown can be directly implemented in excel or matlab without going through the mathematical derivations accounting for probabilistic particle property distributions requires solving transcendental equation 19 and using integration in time eq 20 the reliable prediction for impedance and well index can be used for planning well stimulation procedures for the damaged well acidizing re perforation etc if the model parameters are known for similar wells and reservoirs the prediction of productivity decline can be used for the planning and design of a new project the filtration coefficient determines the size of damaged zone rd which defines the necessary volume of injected acid πϕ rd 2 per unit length of the well and the period of the well intervention to produce from undamaged zone the perforation length must exceed the radius of the damaged zone nunes et al 2010 the essence of tuning drift delay factor α let us calculate the time of capture free run of the reservoir fines the capture free run of the mobilised fine particle is 1 λ so the time of capture free run is equal to λu 1 after the time of capture free run a particle is either strained in the rock or produced with the inflow water so the well productivity index stabilises to make an upper estimate let us chose minimum filtration coefficient λ 10 2 1 m from table 5 and maximum velocity in well vicinity which is u 10 4 m s barenblatt et al 1991 the corresponding time of capture free run is equal to 12 days for mean typical values of λ 10 1 m and u 10 5 m s the time of capture free run is equal to 3 h yet production wells are losing their productivity throughout the overall life period i e during years the paradox is resolved by introduction of the drift delay factor α so the particle speed is αu yang et al 2016 the concept is based on the observation that the particles attached in the secondary shallow energy minimum fig 4c are rolling or sliding along the rock surface while the lifted particles are carried in the bulk of fluid with velocity u li et al 2005 johnson and tong 2006 yuan and shapiro 2011a bradford et al 2012 short period of particle exchange between the rolling sliding and suspended populations which is equal to flow time through a single pore determines the mean particle transport velocity αu yang et al 2016 minimum laboratory based α value is 10 4 table 5 shows the minimum of 10 5 extending the above estimated time of capture free run 1 α times resolves the paradox explaining well productivity decline during the overall life period application of the analytical model the analytical model 19 20 allows matching well productivity decline due to fines migration and induced formation damage however practical application of the model must be accompanied by rigorous verification of the model assumptions the model assumes particle rock attraction which can be confirmed by dlvo theory it is important to notice that particles can be detached from the secondary minimum at significantly lower flow velocity than from the primary minimum the energy potentials presented in fig 4 correspond to the reservoir condition of case 1 at the reservoir temperature primary minimum disappears all particles are attached in the shallow secondary minimum at high salinity secondary minimum disappears all particles are attached in the deep primary minimum the geothermal reservoirs with low salinity water are highly susceptible to fines migration for complete characterisation of the fines migration system from well production data the particle size distribution in the produced water must be periodically determined during the well exploitation the threshold value of jamming ratio particle size divided by pore size allows determining whether the produced particle was detached inside the reservoir and travelled to the wellbore or was detached from the well wall during well erosion the filtration theory provides the rule of 1 3rd i e the produced particles that are smaller than 1 3rd of the mean pore size are the migrating reservoir fines the well productivity decline can be described by the analytical model 19 20 24 otherwise productivity declines due to sand production and rock re compaction in the drainage zone more sophisticated calculations of the threshold jamming ratio that use pore size distribution and pore space geometry can be performed using percolation and effective medium theory by the analogy with rock conductivity prediction carlier et al 2007 cvetkovic et al 2016 rabinovich et al 2016 2017 zhang et al 2019 babadagli 2020 application of the notion of the damaged zone size the analytical model 19 20 allows determining the size of formation damage zone rd given by eq 26 the practical applications of this notion are estimates of acid volume for well acidizing and sizing of perforation length it is important to accurately define the amount of injected acid that removes the strained particles causing formation damage the reasons are the high cost of acid during acidizing of long production well and also the high cost of production interruption which is proportional to the acid injection period the volume v of acid per unit well length height that sweeps the damaged zone is 28 v π r d 2 ϕ another well stimulation option is casing of an open hole well with further perforation or re perforation of the well with damaged perforation holes the perforation hole must go through the overall damage zone and exit it in order to drain the undamaged formation nunes et al 2010 therefore the criterion for perforation length is that it must exceed rd the same speculations correspond to micro fracturing of well vicinity using micro sized proppant placement keshavarz et al 2016 table 6 presents the values of damaged radius for 23 cases at the moment of stabilisation in the majority of the cases rd is limited to 1 m it rarely exceeds 3 m extensions of the model during flow in unsaturated porous media the attached fines are detached by capillary menisci under the interfacial force dominance yuan and shapiro 2011b lazouskaya et al 2013 aramrak et al 2013 the mathematical model includes equations for movement of the interfacial water air surface and fines detachment by capillary force shapiro 2015 shapiro 2016 rabinovich 2019 here the upscaling of governing equations from pore to core scale must be performed which is feasible for only some displacement regimes rabinovich 2017 rabinovich 2018 the relative permeability is affected by strained fines le hussain et al 2010 kamali and hussain 2017 the above also includes fines migration during co2 storage zhang et al 2020 in single phase nano colloidal suspension transport particle adsorption can dominate over attachment bai et al 2019 the adsorption gibbs energy dominates for particles of nano sizes and below while the attachment and detachment of colloidal fines is determined by electrostatic dlvo energy given by eq a1 bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 elimelech et al 2013 for the cases of high ionic strength and low separation distance where the hydration repulsion force has the same order of magnitude as dlvo forces an extended dlvo xdlvo theory is used to calculate adhesion in eqs 3 5 a1 a2 li et al 2020 fines dispersion can significantly contribute to advective particle transport polyanin and dil man 1990 polyanin and dilʹman 1994 the linear 1d problems accounting for adsorption capture and diffusion allow for analytical modelling bai et al 2015 polyanin and nazaikinskii 2015 to account for rock micro heterogeneity surface asperity complex particle and pore geometry micro scale modelling like computational fluid dynamics and molecular modelling can be applied here the hydrodynamic forces in eqs 3 5 a1 a2 are obtained by navier stokes equations and electrostatic forces are calculated by the surface element integration method li et al 2020 shen et al 2020 10 conclusions the present work derives an analytical model for radial flow towards wells under migration of natural reservoir fines allowing for well clogging prediction prediction of well behaviour for 23 field cases by the analytical model has been performed based on well history and laboratory data the work yields the following conclusions the flow domain at the moment of switching the well on consists of three zones well vicinity where all movable attached fines are lifted under large velocities intermediate zone where the remaining concentration monotonically increases from zero up to maximum at the boundary of fines mobilisation zone and suspended particle free flow zone behind the fines mobilisation boundary the radial inflow performance problem under mobilisation migration and straining of size distributed fines allows for exact solution the solution allows for explicit formulae of suspended and strained particle concentrations the impedance skin factor as derived from the analytical model stabilises at the moment when the characteristic line that starts at the fines mobilisation boundary r ri at t 0 arrives at the wellbore r rw the analytical impedance formulae yields the expressions for stabilisation time maximum impedance radii of the damage and fines mobilisation areas the mathematical model for fines migration contains six constants initial concentration of movable fines drift delay factor filtration and formation damage coefficients and two constants characterising the maximum retention function for example critical and maximum velocities determination of these constants from laboratory corefloods is well established however depending on the form of well impedance curve only one two or three parameters can be determined from well data to predict well behaviour the remaining parameters must be taken either from the coreflood data or from fines concentration in the produced fluid the period of particle capture free run after which the well index stabilises does not exceed weeks while the productivity index declining due to fines migration occurs during the overall well life period i e during years the paradox is resolved by introduction of the drift delay factor α which is the ratio between the rolling sliding speed of the particles attached in the secondary energy minimum and the carrier fluid velocity this prolongs the stabilisation tperiod 1 α times which can vary from 102 to 105 and resolves the paradox other high sensitivity parameters for well impedance are formation damage coefficient critical and maximum velocities the analytical model closely matches 23 production well histories the values of tuned coefficients vary in common intervals the analytical model derived allows defining the formation damage size the size is determined by an implicit formula using the strained concentration profile assuming that the production data have been matched up to some moment by the laboratory based analytical model the strained concentration profile is known at this moment this allows calculating the size of the formation damage zone the formation damage size allows estimating the amount of acid that removes the strained particles from fines migration up to a small predetermined fraction of the initial skin factor it also determines the perforation lengths for perforation of a new well or re perforation of the damaged well credit authorship contribution statement l chequer investigation methodology c

the inability of point measurements for large scale spatial representation it is very challenging to monitor sm at large spatial resolution using in situ sensors al shrafany et al 2012 anav et al 2018 however microwave remote sensing mrs techniques both active and passive approaches have offered unique opportunities for global sm monitoring with their advantages and limitations the retrieval process using passive mrs depends mostly on the parameters involved such as dielectric mixing model land surface temperature lst vegetation water content vwc etc among these parameters dielectric mixing model is a vital part of the retrieval process mironov et al 2004 a dielectric constant is a complex number which represents the electrical property of the soil and is highly dependent on the moisture content at microwave frequencies several studies cites soil dielectric mixing models based on soil properties such as wensink 1993 knoll and knight 1994 heimovaara et al 1994 curtis 2001 nguyen et al 1997 hallikainen et al 1985 wang and schmugge 1980 dobson et al 1985 mironov et al 2004 these models are broadly categorized as 1 phenomenological cole and cole model 1941 debye relaxation model 1929 2 volumetric complex refractive index cri model 1974 maxwell de loor model 1968 3 empirical wang and schmugge 1980 4 semi empirical dobson et al model 1985 mironov model and 5 volumetric based on the input data requirement srivastava et al 2014 van dam 2014 van dam et al 2005 for passive only l band frequency based sm retrieval approaches dielectric models given by mironov et al dobson et al wang schmugge et al and hallikainen et al are reported to have the best performances due to their easy implementation and requirement of relatively fewer input parameters for calculation of various soil properties such as bulk density and sand and clay fractions compared to other models to retrieve sm using smap l1c brightness temperature product single channel algorithm sca using horizontal polarization is preferred in this study sca is an inverse based single parameter model mladenova et al 2014 the algorithm uses single frequency polarization data preferably the one sensitive to the sm jackson 1993 sca has a good heritage in sm retrieval under varying ground conditions in different climate regimes jackson 1993 jackson et al 2002 the algorithm requires reliable ancillary data to estimate key parameters such as surface temperature vegetation opacity surface roughness and soil texture using local data which makes it most suitable for accurate sm retrieval at local scale than the global satellite sm products sca is also used as a baseline algorithm for developing sm products in smap mission and thus to present a comparative analysis on the performance of smap l3 radiometer product developed on similar retrieval approach the sca algorithm was selected for this analysis as well a detail description of the algorithm and a list various ancillary data and their sources is presented in the later section of this paper similarly microwave polarization difference index mpdi is also the most widely applied index used in the sm retrieval that links the effect of vegetation structure and cloud cover in the retrieval process felde 1998 variation in mpdi with the surface vegetation condition at all the selected sites is also discussed in detail in the result section of this paper in this study four state of the art soil dielectric mixing models were tested for indian conditions where sm researches are often limited due to complex topographic features extremely varying climatological and vegetation conditions and limited in situ sm network the four soil dielectric mixing model most suitable for sm retrieval using passive microwave l band brightness temperature are further explained in terms of the performances 2 study site and data set description 2 1 study site characteristics for this analysis we selected three experimental sites located in india anand from gujarat hoshangabad from madhya pradesh and varanasi from uttar pradesh these sites were selected mostly due to the easily accessible ground based data

space applications center sac india space research organization isro including daily measurement of sm and other physical and electrical properties of soil such as soil temperature and electric conductivity at different soil depths 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 15 cm using hydra probe sensors ground measured sm estimates at the selected validation sites concurrent to smap overpass timings were preferred to be compared with retrieved sm data set using the selected dielectric models and smap radiometer sm product among the nine validation sites established across india by the isro s pan india network we selected the 03 locations having hydra probe installed and continuous in situ sm data are available to maintain data uniformity thehydra probe is a rugged sm sensor which operates at 50 mhz frequency when this sensor is installed in soil it evaluates the amplitude ratio of reflected waves within its probes and uses maxwell s numerical equation to compute the real dielectric permittivity of the surrounding soil the volumetric water content of the soil is then empirically correlated to the real dielectric permittivity this method makes the probe immune to changes in soil texture salinity and temperature the measurement zone of the sensor is 3 cm in diameter the sensor s accuracy in all soil types is approx 3 the hydra probe has also been used as a reliable instrument for measuring sm and other soil properties in different studies chen et al 2016 2017 colliander et al 2017 cosh et al 2016 wu and margulis 2013 2 3 satellite data description 2 3 1 smap l3 sm and lic

study viz wang schmugge model hallikainen model dobson model and mironov model wang schmugge model 1980 is an empirical dielectric mixing model that show effects of texture on the soil water dielectric constant this model was developed using the variation of soil dielectric characteristics as a function of soil moisture content in various soil types and used the known dielectric constants or refraction indices of air water and ice as well as the volume percent of each ingredient to compute the dielectric constant of the soil hallikainen et al 1985 dielectric model is an empirical mixing model that estimates the dielectric constant of soil water mixture more precisely and accurately over frequency 1 18 ghz for different soil types based on specified soil physical characteristics the microwave dielectric constant of the soil in this model is represented as functions of sm content physical temperature and soil texture dobson et al model 1985 is a semi empirical dielectric mixing model based on the refractive index requiring readily available soil physical parameter s information such as volumetric sm content mv bulk density ρb and percentage of sand s and

assess the performance of the dielectric models used in this study we used 3 performance statistics widely used to compare the model performance such as root mean square error rmse square of correlation r2 and percentage bias pbias based on the results performance of these models for each site is presented in detail the rmse estimates the standard deviation of the model prediction error and measures the average magnitude of the error a small rmse value indicates better model performance whereas a higher value indicates a poor performance of the model the formula for calculating rmse is shown as 8 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n where x and y are the observed and simulated data set respectively and n is total number of observations square of correlation r2 represents the strength of the linear association between two variables and its value ranges between 1 and 1 representing a prefect a negative and positive correlation respectively values near to 1 represents strong correlation the formula for calculating correlation can be represented as 9 r 2 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 where x and y are the observed and simulated data set respectively n is the total number of observations and x is the mean of x the pbias is used to estimate the average bias in the simulated values and its optimal value is 0 0 which indicates the ideal model simulation pbias value greater than 0 represents an overestimation whereas lesser value indicates an underestimation bias the equation for pbias is written as 10 pbias 100 i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i where x and y are the observed and simulated data set respectively and n is the total number of observations 4 result and discussion in this section a detailed description about the behavior of sm retrieval parameters lst tb lai mpdi and performance of the sm retrieval algorithm in estimating sm for each experimental site is presented for studying the seasonal variation in the retrieval parameters especially for the lst and tb we selected the four seasons defined by the indian meteorological department imd government of india winter december february summer march may monsoon june september and post monsoon october november also to understand the variation in the vegetation parameters vwc and mpdi we considered the two cropping seasons used for agriculture in india i e kharif or monsoon crops july october and rabi or winter crops october march indian meteorological department imd government of india 4 1 anand gujarat 4 1 1 temporal behavior of tb and sm retrieval parameters at the station anand has a tropical type of climate where average temperature rises at peak during months of april may and precipitation here is influenced by the monsoon climate of india to study the variation in lst and tb at h polarization tbh and v polarization tbv we used a temporal plot as shown in fig 3 the average lst during the whole study period june 2017 may 2018 was reported to be around 298 k and not much variation can be noticed unlike the tbv av 250 k and tbh av 221 k where a significant decrease was noted during monsoon season july september was observed from fig 4 an increasing trend in vwc can be noticed during the starting phase of the study period during june july 2017 and reaching its maximum value during august september could be related to sowing growing and maturing phases of the kharif crops such as rice millet and groundnuts predominantly grown in the regions a decreasing trend was observed during october november may be due to harvesting of the crops again an increasing trend can be observed in vwc during winter months i e january february 2018 due to growth of rabi crops wheat barley and cereals decreasing post march indicating harvesting of the rabi crops and end of the agricultural year at the site mpdi can also be noticed increasing during june august 2017 and reaching at its maximum during september with high sm content during monsoon and low vwc during early growing stage of crops a constant trend postmarch indicating harvesting of the rabi crops and end of the agricultural year at the site 4 1 2 performance comparison at the anand station at anand

sm ret sm d over anand between june 2017 may 2018 heavy rainfall can be seen during july september 2017 and also few days of significant downpour during january and february 2018 during these days in situ sm reached at its maximum values due rainfall and resulting increased sm content smap sm can be seen overestimating the in situ sm but responding well to the sudden moisture change at the site during the entire study period ret sm m overestimated the in situ sm but can be seen in close approximation to the observed sm compared to the smap sm a gap in the retrieved sm can be observed during the days of heavy rainfall due to limitation of these models in capturing this sudden change on local environment and extreme weather conditions resulting repeated value at the upper value of sm range considered for the analysis in fig 6 b dobson retrieved sm ret sm d can also be seen producing sm estimates close to the in situ sm but can also be noticed to be underestimating the observed sm during

and tbh was 243 k tb could be noticed lowest from june to september 2017 probably due to rainfall during monsoon season temperature was marked gradually increasing and getting its peak during april 2018 due to summer season fig 9 presents temporal variation in vwc and mpdi over hoshangabad vwc can be seen gradually increasing during sowing and growth stages for both the seasons kharif during july september and rabi crops during november 2017 january 2018 highest vwc is evident at their mature stage i e between september 2017 and february 2018 respectively low values can be noticed during the end of both the cropping seasons indicating harvesting of the crops mpdi was recorded highest during starting stage and prevailing monsoon at the site while gradually decreasing with the increase in vwc during the rest of the time period 4 2 2 performance comparison at the station results of the statistical tests show the best performance by mironov rmse 0 10 and wang schmugge model rmse 0 10 with less error compared to hallikainen model rmse 0 11 and dobson model rmse 0 13 but based on the correlation between the retrieved sm and in situ sm wang schmugge model r2 0 78 performed slightly better than dobson model r2 0 76 followed by hallikainen model r2 0 74 and mironov model r2 0 70 smap sm rmse 0 13 r2 0 84 pbias 28 10 marginally performed better in retrieving the sm estimates at the

winter months december 2017 march 2018 a decreasing trend in tbv and tbh was noticed during the monsoon and winter months the temporal plot between tbv tbh and lst for varanasi site is presented in fig 13 vwc can be noticed increasing during june and reaching at its peak during july september 2017 due to maturing of the kharif crops at the site and slowly decreasing during october november 2017 with the harvesting of the crop s indicating less agricultural activities at the site an increasing vwc can be noted again during december 2017 and reaching its peak during december 2017 february 2018 mpdi can also be seen as varying in a similar pattern with vwc an increasing trend in mpdi can be seen with the sowing and growth of crops and maximum during its mature stage in the both the cropping seasons a temporal plot between vwc and mpdi for the varanasi is presented in fig 14 4 3 2 performance comparison at the station at varanasi mironov model rmse 0 08 r2 0 82 pbias 19 60 performed

it s interesting to notice a similar pattern of all the simulated sm variation in natural environmental condition using passive microwave approaches especially under prevailing climatic extremes although all the dielectric models performed better the smap sm mironov marginally had better performance than the other models dobson model hallikainein model wang schmugge model with better

presents the overall performance of the dielectric models selected for this study at all the sites results of the statistical tests are summarized in table 5 based on rmse scores for all the dielectric models used in this analysis the mironov model rmse 0 07 m3 m3 showed best performance than the wang schmugge model rmse 0 08 m3 m3 hallikainen model rmse 0 09 m3 m3 and dobson model rmse 0 10 m3 m3 at the validation sites smap radiometer sm product also performed well rmse 0 12 m3 m3 at these sites also sm estimates derived using mironov model showed the highest correlation with the in situ data set r2 0 80 followed by the wang schmugge model r2 0 74 dobson model r2 0 72 hallikainen model r2 0 67 and smap sm r2 0 57 smap sm showed the least bias when compared with ground measured sm pbias 11 8 at the sites followed by mironov model pbias 16 3 wang model pbias 18 8 hallikainen pbias 21 8 and highest by dobson model pbias 32 9 however all the retrieved and satellite sm showed an underestimating pattern for the entire span of this analysis at all the sites 5 conclusion accurate and efficient retrieval of sm using passive microwave data depends mainly on careful selection of retrieval parameter such as soil dielectric mixing models vwc lst etc this study provides a detail analysis of the behavior of these parameters and also their role in sm retrieval many dielectric mixing models have been reported previously but their practical application was often limited due their complex methodologies site specific applicability and lack of continuous in situ data set to assess their performance as such this study presents a detailed summary of some of the most widely used dielectric mixing models and present their performances in sm retrieval and reports first of a kind of analysis over indian agricultural sites results of this analysis shows promising performance of mironov dielectric model in sm retrieval at all selected sites and also exhibit comparatively better performances of all the dielectric models selected in this study than the global smap l3 sm product in accurately predicting the surface sm content this study also highlights limitation and performance of satellite sm product and passive microwave retrieval approaches for widely varying climatic and vegetation condition prevailing in tropical countries like india this study underlines the significance of long term in situ sm data in satellite measurement of surface sm the ground based or in situ sm networks are believed to play an essential role in this study as they are the mainstay in calibration and validation land surface models and vital in the assessment of the quality of sm products from spaceborne sm missions since accurate sm measurements are believed to play a crucial role in minimizing the economic and social losses due to extreme weather events like flood and drought losses due to crop failures minimizing wastage of freshwater resources through irrigation scheduling and many more advantages including a better understanding of significant hydrological and environmental processes this study also recommends framing a roadmap for establishing more dense ground based sm network as developed at some of the study sites of this investigation in terms of sm retrieval the mpdi has a lot of potential especially for sparse or moderate vegetation surface conditions it is one of the most often used vegetation indicators because of its crucial role in assessing surface structure moisture content and roughness in various terrain types with sm mpdi increases while with vwc it decreases we noticed a similar pattern of fluctuation in these three parameters at all of our chosen sites surface temperature variations can also have a significant impact on mpdi as a result this study demonstrates use mpdi to determine the prevailing vegetation conditions for precise sm retrievals although in this study we used sca algorithm for the sm retrieval process more robust and efficient approaches can be developed by testing efficiency of other retrieval algorithms such as dual channel or microwave polarization ration algorithm mpra based on land parameter retrieval model lprm and other dielectric mixing models for better results results of this would be useful in developing high performance finer resolution sm product credit authorship

m3 followed by wang schmugge model rmse 0 08 m3 m3 hallikainen model rmse 0 09 m3 m3 dobson model rmse 0 10 m3 m3 and original smap radiometer sm rmse 0 12 m3 m3 findings of this study provides important insights into application and performance of dielectric mixing models in mapping surface sm variations this study also underlines the pivotal role of local conditions for sm retrieval which should be carefully included in the algorithms keywords dielectric mixing models single channel algorithm soil moisture active passive soil moisture 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a significant component of the natural hydrological cycle it was declared the essential climate variable ecv in the year 2010 by the global climate observing system sm has extensive application in numerous hydro meteorological studies including climate change weather evolution hydrological modelling and agricultural forecasting mladenova et al 2011 jackson 1993 due to its large spatial temporal variations and the inability of point measurements for large scale spatial representation it is very challenging to monitor sm at large spatial resolution using in situ sensors al shrafany et al 2012 anav et al 2018 however microwave remote sensing mrs techniques both active and passive approaches have offered unique opportunities for global sm monitoring with their advantages and limitations the retrieval process using passive mrs depends mostly on the parameters involved such as dielectric mixing model land surface temperature lst vegetation water content vwc etc among these parameters dielectric mixing model is a vital part of the retrieval process mironov et al 2004 a dielectric constant is a complex number which represents the electrical property of the soil and is highly dependent on the moisture content at microwave frequencies several studies cites soil dielectric mixing models based on soil properties such as wensink 1993 knoll and knight 1994 heimovaara et al 1994 curtis 2001 nguyen et al 1997 hallikainen et al 1985 wang and schmugge 1980 dobson et al 1985 mironov et al 2004 these models are broadly categorized as 1 phenomenological cole and cole model 1941 debye relaxation model 1929 2 volumetric complex refractive index cri model 1974 maxwell de loor model 1968 3 empirical wang and schmugge 1980 4 semi empirical dobson et al model 1985 mironov model and 5 volumetric based on the input data requirement srivastava et al 2014 van dam 2014 van dam et al 2005 for passive only l band frequency based sm retrieval approaches dielectric models given by mironov et al dobson et al wang schmugge et al and hallikainen et al are reported to have the best performances due to their easy implementation and requirement of relatively fewer input parameters for calculation of various soil properties such as bulk density and sand and clay fractions compared to other models to retrieve sm using smap l1c brightness temperature product single channel algorithm sca using horizontal polarization is preferred in this study sca is an inverse based single parameter model mladenova et al 2014 the algorithm uses single frequency polarization data preferably the one sensitive to the sm jackson 1993 sca has a good heritage in sm retrieval under varying ground conditions in different climate regimes jackson 1993 jackson et al 2002 the algorithm requires reliable ancillary data to estimate key parameters such as surface temperature vegetation opacity surface roughness and soil texture using local data which makes it most suitable for accurate sm retrieval at local scale than the global satellite sm products sca is also used as a baseline algorithm for developing sm products in smap mission and thus to present a comparative analysis on the performance of smap l3 radiometer product developed on similar retrieval approach the sca algorithm was selected for this analysis as well a detail description of the algorithm and a list various ancillary data and their sources is presented in the later section of this paper similarly microwave polarization difference index mpdi is also the most widely applied index used in the sm retrieval that links the effect of vegetation structure and cloud cover in the retrieval process felde 1998 variation in mpdi with the surface vegetation condition at all the selected sites is also discussed in detail in the result section of this paper in this study four state of the art soil dielectric mixing models were tested for indian conditions where sm researches are often limited due to complex topographic features extremely varying climatological and vegetation conditions and limited in situ sm network the four soil dielectric mixing model most suitable for sm retrieval using passive microwave l band brightness temperature are further explained in terms of the performances 2 study site and data set description 2 1 study site characteristics for this analysis we selected three experimental sites located in india anand from gujarat hoshangabad from madhya pradesh and varanasi from uttar pradesh these sites were selected mostly due to the easily accessible ground based data

space applications center sac india space research organization isro including daily measurement of sm and other physical and electrical properties of soil such as soil temperature and electric conductivity at different soil depths 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 15 cm using hydra probe sensors ground measured sm estimates at the selected validation sites concurrent to smap overpass timings were preferred to be compared with retrieved sm data set using the selected dielectric models and smap radiometer sm product among the nine validation sites established across india by the isro s pan india network we selected the 03 locations having hydra probe installed and continuous in situ sm data are available to maintain data uniformity thehydra probe is a rugged sm sensor which operates at 50 mhz frequency when this sensor is installed in soil it evaluates the amplitude ratio of reflected waves within its probes and uses maxwell s numerical equation to compute the real dielectric permittivity of the surrounding soil the volumetric water content of the soil is then empirically correlated to the real dielectric permittivity this method makes the probe immune to changes in soil texture salinity and temperature the measurement zone of the sensor is 3 cm in diameter the sensor s accuracy in all soil types is approx 3 the hydra probe has also been used as a reliable instrument for measuring sm and other soil properties in different studies chen et al 2016 2017 colliander et al 2017 cosh et al 2016 wu and margulis 2013 2 3 satellite data description 2 3 1 smap l3 sm and lic

software version 10 1 3 methodology 3 1 soil dielectric mixing models this sub section presents a small review of the widely used soil dielectric mixing models for l band sm retrieval and used in this study viz wang schmugge model hallikainen model dobson model and mironov model wang schmugge model 1980 is an empirical dielectric mixing model that show effects of texture on the soil water dielectric constant this model was developed using the variation of soil dielectric characteristics as a function of soil moisture content in various soil types and used the known dielectric constants or refraction indices of air water and ice as well as the volume percent of each ingredient to compute the dielectric constant of the soil hallikainen et al 1985 dielectric model is an empirical mixing model that estimates the dielectric constant of soil water mixture more precisely and accurately over frequency 1 18 ghz for different soil types based on specified soil physical characteristics the microwave dielectric constant of the soil in this model is represented as functions of sm content physical temperature and soil texture dobson et al model 1985 is a semi empirical dielectric mixing model based on the refractive index requiring readily available soil physical parameter s information such as volumetric sm content mv bulk density ρb and percentage of sand s and clay c fraction mironov mixing model is a generalized refractive dielectric mixing model grmdm suitable for a comprehensive range sm soil type and frequency mironov et al 2004 this model introduced

et al 2020 3 2 single channel algorithm for sm retrieval for correction of vegetation parameters such as vegetation water content vwc the sca algorithm uses ancillary information such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or leaf area index lai and other data such as land cover lst soil information table 1 enlists all the ancillary data and their source for sm retrieval used in this analysis sca assumes the single scattering albedo ῳ 0 and minimal atmospheric contribution the expression for tb is presented as 1 t b f p t s 1 1 e s r o u g h e τ cos θ 2 where tb brightness

omega τ ω is considered as the approximate form of radiative transfer equation which is based on two parameters the vegetation optical depth τ and the vegetation scattering albedo ω these two variables are used to parametrize the vegetation attenuation properties and the scattering effects low vegetation τ ω model is expressed as 3 tb p 1 ω 1 γ p 1 γ p r gp t c 1 r gp γ p t g where tg and

assess the performance of the dielectric models used in this study we used 3 performance statistics widely used to compare the model performance such as root mean square error rmse square of correlation r2 and percentage bias pbias based on the results performance of these models for each site is presented in detail the rmse estimates the standard deviation of the model prediction error and measures the average magnitude of the error a small rmse value indicates better model performance whereas a higher value indicates a poor performance of the model the formula for calculating rmse is shown as 8 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n where x and y are the observed and simulated data set respectively and n is total number of observations square of correlation r2 represents the strength of the linear association between two variables and its value ranges between 1 and 1 representing a prefect a negative and positive correlation respectively values near to 1 represents strong correlation the formula for calculating correlation can be represented as 9 r 2 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 where x and y are the observed and simulated data set respectively n is the total number of observations and x is the mean of x the pbias is used to estimate the average bias in the simulated values and its optimal value is 0 0 which indicates the ideal model simulation pbias value greater than 0 represents an overestimation whereas lesser value indicates an underestimation bias the equation for pbias is written as 10 pbias 100 i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i where x and y are the observed and simulated data set respectively and n is the total number of observations 4 result and discussion in this section a detailed description about the behavior of sm retrieval parameters lst tb lai mpdi and performance of the sm retrieval algorithm in estimating sm for each experimental site is presented for studying the seasonal variation in the retrieval parameters especially for the lst and tb we selected the four seasons defined by the indian meteorological department imd government of india winter december february summer march may monsoon june september and post monsoon october november also to understand the variation in the vegetation parameters vwc and mpdi we considered the two cropping seasons used for agriculture in india i e kharif or monsoon crops july october and rabi or winter crops october march indian meteorological department imd government of india 4 1 anand gujarat 4 1 1 temporal behavior of tb and sm retrieval parameters at the station anand has a tropical type of climate where average temperature rises at peak during months of april may and precipitation here is influenced by the monsoon climate of india to study the variation in lst and tb at h polarization tbh and v polarization tbv we used a temporal plot as shown in fig 3 the average lst during the whole study period june 2017 may 2018 was reported to be around 298 k and not much variation can be noticed unlike the tbv av 250 k and tbh av 221 k where a significant decrease was noted during monsoon season july september was observed from fig 4 an increasing trend in vwc can be noticed during the starting phase of the study period during june july 2017 and reaching its maximum value during august september could be related to sowing growing and maturing phases of the kharif crops such as rice millet and groundnuts predominantly grown in the regions a decreasing trend was observed during october november may be due to harvesting of the crops again an increasing trend can be observed in vwc during winter months i e january february 2018 due to growth of rabi crops wheat barley and cereals decreasing post march indicating harvesting of the rabi crops and end of the agricultural year at the site mpdi can also be noticed increasing during june august 2017 and reaching at its maximum during september with high sm content during monsoon and low vwc during early growing stage of crops a constant trend postmarch indicating harvesting of the rabi crops and end of the agricultural year at the site 4 1 2 performance comparison at the anand station at anand mironov model rmse 0 03 r2 0 68 pbias 5 0 performed best in retrieving sm estimates than dobson model rmse 0 03 r2 0 63 pbias 5 40 wang schmugge rmse 0 04 r2 0 61 pbias 4 80 and hallikainen model rmse

sm ret sm d over anand between june 2017 may 2018 heavy rainfall can be seen during july september 2017 and also few days of significant downpour during january and february 2018 during these days in situ sm reached at its maximum values due rainfall and resulting increased sm content smap sm can be seen overestimating the in situ sm but responding well to the sudden moisture change at the site during the entire study period ret sm m overestimated the in situ sm but can be seen in close approximation to the observed sm compared to the smap sm a gap in the retrieved sm can be observed during the days of heavy rainfall due to limitation of these models in capturing this sudden change on local environment and extreme weather conditions resulting repeated value at the upper value of sm range considered for the analysis in fig 6 b dobson retrieved sm ret sm d can also be seen producing sm estimates close to the in situ sm but can also be noticed to be underestimating the observed sm during

respectively the hallikainen retrieved sm overestimated the in situ sm for a significant period from august 2017 to february 2018 and during the few days of march and april 2018 wang schmugge model also overestimated the ground measured sm during august 2017 to february 2018 and few days during march 2018 and then limited to the lowest sm limit during april may 2018 at anand mironov and hallikainen models were more efficient in mapping sm variation under natural condition than dobson and wang schmugge 4 2 hoshangabad madhya pradesh 4 2 1 temporal behavior of tb and sm retrieval parameters at the hoshangabad station the temporal plot between tbv tbh and lst for the hoshangabad is shown in fig 8 the average lst from july 2017 to april 2018 was 298 k whereas for tbv was 267 k and tbh was 243 k tb could be noticed lowest from june to september 2017 probably due to rainfall during monsoon season temperature was marked gradually increasing and getting its peak during april 2018 due to summer season fig 9 presents temporal variation in vwc and mpdi over hoshangabad vwc can be seen gradually increasing during sowing and growth stages for both the seasons kharif during july september and rabi crops during november 2017 january 2018 highest vwc is evident at their mature stage i e between september 2017 and february 2018 respectively low values can be noticed during the end of both the cropping seasons indicating harvesting of the crops mpdi was recorded highest during starting stage and prevailing monsoon at the site while gradually decreasing with the increase in vwc during the rest of the time period 4 2 2 performance comparison at the station results of the statistical tests show the best performance by mironov rmse 0 10 and wang schmugge model rmse 0 10 with less error compared to hallikainen model rmse 0 11 and dobson model rmse 0 13 but based on the correlation between the retrieved sm and in situ sm wang schmugge model r2 0 78 performed slightly better than dobson model r2 0 76 followed by hallikainen model r2 0 74 and mironov model r2 0 70 smap sm rmse 0 13 r2 0 84 pbias 28 10 marginally performed better in retrieving the sm estimates at the

varanasi station the average tbv recorded at varanasi was 268 k whereas for tbh it was 233 k and lst 300 k during june 2017 may 2018 lst at the site looks uniform except a slight decrease during winter months december 2017 march 2018 a decreasing trend in tbv and tbh was noticed during the monsoon and winter months the temporal plot between tbv tbh and lst for varanasi site is presented in fig 13 vwc can be noticed increasing during june and reaching at its peak during july september 2017 due to maturing of the kharif crops at the site and slowly decreasing during october november 2017 with the harvesting of the crop s indicating less agricultural activities at the site an increasing vwc can be noted again during december 2017 and reaching its peak during december 2017 february 2018 mpdi can also be seen as varying in a similar pattern with vwc an increasing trend in mpdi can be seen with the sowing and growth of crops and maximum during its mature stage in the both the cropping seasons a temporal plot between vwc and mpdi for the varanasi is presented in fig 14 4 3 2 performance comparison at the station at varanasi mironov model rmse 0 08 r2 0 82 pbias 19 60 performed

it s interesting to notice a similar pattern of all the simulated sm variation in natural environmental condition using passive microwave approaches especially under prevailing climatic extremes although all the dielectric models performed better the smap sm mironov marginally had better performance than the other models dobson model hallikainein model wang schmugge model with better

while fig 17 b shows plot between in situ sm wang schmugge retrieved sm ret sm ws smap sm and gpm rainfall estimates 4 4 performance of pooled data sets of all the three sites this sub section presents the overall performance of the dielectric models selected for this study at all the sites results of the statistical tests are summarized in table 5 based on rmse scores for all the dielectric models used in this analysis the mironov model rmse 0 07 m3 m3 showed best performance than the wang schmugge model rmse 0 08 m3 m3 hallikainen model rmse 0 09 m3 m3 and dobson model rmse 0 10 m3 m3 at the validation sites smap radiometer sm product also performed well rmse 0 12 m3 m3 at these sites also sm estimates derived using mironov model showed the highest correlation with the in situ data set r2 0 80 followed by the wang schmugge model r2 0 74 dobson model r2 0 72 hallikainen model r2 0 67 and smap sm r2 0 57 smap sm showed the least bias when compared with ground measured sm pbias 11 8 at the sites followed by mironov model pbias 16 3 wang model pbias 18 8 hallikainen pbias 21 8 and highest by dobson model pbias 32 9 however all the retrieved and satellite sm showed an underestimating pattern for the entire span of this analysis at all the sites 5 conclusion accurate and efficient retrieval of sm using passive microwave data depends mainly on careful selection of retrieval parameter such as soil dielectric mixing models vwc lst etc this study provides a detail analysis of the behavior of these parameters and also their role in sm retrieval many dielectric mixing models have been reported previously but their practical application was often limited due their complex methodologies site specific applicability and lack of continuous in situ data set to assess their performance as such this study presents a detailed summary of some of the most widely used dielectric mixing models and present their performances in sm retrieval and reports first of a kind of analysis over indian agricultural sites results of this analysis shows promising performance of mironov dielectric model in sm retrieval at all selected sites and also exhibit comparatively better performances of all the dielectric models selected in this study than the global smap l3 sm product in accurately predicting the surface sm content this study also highlights limitation and performance of satellite sm product and passive microwave retrieval approaches for widely varying climatic and vegetation condition prevailing in tropical countries like india this study underlines the significance of long term in situ sm data in satellite measurement of surface sm the ground based or in situ sm networks are believed to play an essential role in this study as they are the mainstay in calibration and validation land surface models and vital in the assessment of the quality of sm products from spaceborne sm missions since accurate sm measurements are believed to play a crucial role in minimizing the economic and social losses due to extreme weather events like flood and drought losses due to crop failures minimizing wastage of freshwater resources through irrigation scheduling and many more advantages including a better understanding of significant hydrological and environmental processes this study also recommends framing a roadmap for establishing more dense ground based sm network as developed at some of the study sites of this investigation in terms of sm retrieval the mpdi has a lot of potential especially for sparse or moderate vegetation surface conditions it is one of the most often used vegetation indicators because of its crucial role in assessing surface structure moisture content and roughness in various terrain types with sm mpdi increases while with vwc it decreases we noticed a similar pattern of fluctuation in these three parameters at all of our chosen sites surface temperature variations can also have a significant impact on mpdi as a result this study demonstrates use mpdi to determine the prevailing vegetation conditions for precise sm retrievals although in this study we used sca algorithm for the sm retrieval process more robust and efficient approaches can be developed by testing efficiency of other retrieval algorithms such as dual channel or microwave polarization ration algorithm mpra based on land parameter retrieval model lprm and other dielectric mixing models for better results results of this would be useful in developing high performance finer resolution sm product credit authorship

4214,it is generally assumed that in humid climates the groundwater table is a subdued copy of the surface topography however the general groundwater table is unlikely to be affected by the microtopography as seen in high resolution digital elevation models dems so far there has been little guidance on the best resolution dem to use to determine the shape of the water table or the direction of shallow groundwater flow in headwater catchments we therefore looked at the effects of dem smoothing and aggregation on the calculated flow directions and derived catchment boundaries and identified areas and landscape features for which the calculated flow directions are particularly sensitive to dem smoothing or aggregation for 40 of the area of the krycklan study catchment the calculated flow directions depend strongly on the degree of smoothing or aggregation of the dem the four main landscape features for which dem smoothing or aggregation strongly affected the calculated flow directions were local slopes in the opposite direction of the general slope flat areas ridges and incised streambanks to determine the effects of the changing flow directions on the derived catchment boundaries for the smoothed and aggregated dems we calculated the drainage area for 40 locations representing the outlets of catchments of varying sizes the shape and size of the catchments of first order streams were most affected by the processing of the dem these streams were often almost completely smoothed out during the dem preprocessing steps these shifts in catchment boundaries and drainage area would have a large effect on the water balance this study thus highlights the need to carefully consider the effects of dem smoothing or aggregation on the calculated flow directions and drainage areas keywords terrain analysis dem resolution groundwater table flow directions catchment hydrology boreal catchment 1 introduction in humid climates the groundwater table is often assumed to be a subdued replicate of the surface topography condon and maxwell 2015 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 tóth 1962 winter 1999 digital elevation models dems can therefore be used to estimate the direction of groundwater flow haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 wörman et al 2006 these flow directions are in turn used to calculate topographic indices such as the topographic wetness index twi beven and kirkby 1979 that are widely used to describe the topographic controls on the spatial variation in wetness conditions the topographically based flow directions also allow the determination of the catchment boundaries based on the assumption that groundwater flow is predominantly parallel to the surface topography even though it is well known that the groundwater catchment boundaries may not be the same as the surface topography based catchment boundaries the surface topography based drainage divide is usually used to determine the drainage area i e catchment area because data on the location of the groundwater divide is usually not available high resolution elevation data also include many small scale features that are unlikely to affect the direction of groundwater flow in areas where the groundwater table is close to the surface the flow pathways are highly affected by this microtopography e g bresciani et al 2016b frei et al 2010 o loughlin and resources 1986 van der ploeg et al 2012 but at better drained hillslope sites the general flow direction at the hillslope or catchment scale is unlikely to be affected by the microtopography marklund and wörman 2011 zijl 1999 for the identification of the direction of slope parallel groundwater flow and the delineation of the catchment boundaries preprocessing of high resolution dems has therefore become a common practice it includes smoothing aggregation or resampling of the dem as well as the removal of sinks leach et al 2017 lidberg et al 2017 lindsay and creed 2005 o neil et al 2019 for example it has been shown that smoothing improves the performance of a wetland classification model by effectively removing topographic noise and small landscape features that would incorrectly be classified as wetlands o neil et al 2019 aggregation i e the use of a lower resolution dem can disturb the delineation of the stream network e g dehvari and heck 2013 goulden et al 2014 lidberg et al 2017 mcmaster 2002 but can also lead to more realistic groundwater flow directions e g gyasi agyei et al 1995 quinn et al 1991 walker and willgoose 1999 wolock and price 1994 zhang and montgomery 1994 similarly we expect that smoothing of small scale topographic features that are unlikely to affect the groundwater table either through actual smoothing or aggregation of the elevation data can improve the simulation of the shape of the groundwater table and slope parallel groundwater flow directions previous studies have looked at the effects of dem resolution on the hydrological indices that are used for the characterization of surface and groundwater flow but they mostly used grid resolutions from 30 m 1 arcsec upwards le coz et al 2009 stenta et al 2017 vieux 1993 these resolutions are apt for large catchments but are often too coarse to capture the large variability in groundwater levels in small headwater catchments rinderer van meerveld and seibert 2014 compared dems with a 2 4 6 8 and 10 m resolution and considered the 6 m dem most adequate because it reflected the main ridges and depressions but smoothed out the microtopography that they assumed had little effect on shallow groundwater flow directions they therefore used this dem to determine the topographic indices e g twi curvature that they related to the observed groundwater levels rinderer et al 2014 and used to predict the groundwater level at unmonitored locations rinderer et al 2019 dehvari and heck 2013 used 1 2 3 4 5 8 and 10 m resolution dems to study the effect of dem resolution on landscape attributes such as ridges and flat areas and concluded that the used coarser resolution strongly affected the extraction of streams similarly woodrow et al 2016 used a 1 5 and 10 m dem and showed that contributing areas and stream lengths were significantly impacted by the choice of the dem however no study has systematically investigated how the smoothing or aggregation of a dem affects the estimated shallow groundwater flow directions or where in the landscape the calculated groundwater flow directions are most impacted by dem smoothing or aggregation if the resolution of the dem significantly affects the calculated groundwater flow directions this also affects the location of the derived catchment boundaries previous studies have shown that catchment delineation based on almost unaltered i e only minimal smoothing aggregation sink filling or channel burning for sink removal topographic data can lead to either an overestimation or underestimation of the catchment area the degree of error depends on the topography and geology of the catchment condon and maxwell 2015 as well as the resolution of the elevation data used for the delineation hinton et al 1993 woodrow et al 2016 in this study we therefore focus on the effects of dem smoothing and aggregation on the calculated directions of shallow groundwater flow in small headwater catchments and the derived catchment boundaries although groundwater flow is a three dimensional phenomenon toth 1963 winter et al 1999 and the deeper flow pathways of the nested groundwater system are important for the water balance and baseflow generation fan and schaller 2009 oda et al 2013 welch et al 2012 we focus here on the shallow groundwater flow pathways typically within 6 m of the soil surface in small 1 km2 headwater catchments we assume that the groundwater table is a subdued copy of the topography and the main direction of shallow groundwater flow is parallel to the surface we systematically smoothed high resolution elevation data for the krycklan catchment in northern sweden to eliminate small scale features from the dem this procedure corresponds in principle to reducing the resolution of the dem the idea is that after some degree of smoothing the dem of the surface topography better represents the groundwater table and flow directions cf rinderer et al 2014 if the dem resolution has a significant impact on the calculated flow directions the obvious follow up question which we do not address in this study is whether there is an optimal resolution however as a first step and in the absence of observed groundwater level data to determine the location of the groundwater table and flow directions we focus here on quantifying the impact of dem resolution and thus information content on the calculated groundwater flow directions and catchment areas for an area where shallow groundwater is the main source of runoff more specifically we address the following questions how much does the dem resolution or dem smoothing influence the calculated flow directions where in the landscape are the calculated flow directions most sensitive to the dem resolution and information content how much does the preprocessing of the dem affect the estimation of catchment areas 2 study catchment the 67 8 km2 krycklan catchment is located about 100 km northwest of umeå in sweden see fig 1 it is located in the boreal zone and has a typical glaciated terrain we selected the krycklan catchment for this study because of the availability of a high resolution 2 m dem and the relatively simple hydrogeological situation due to the deep till soils lindqvist et al 1989 the groundwater tables are generally shallow 6 m from the surface and in most locations 2 m subsurface flow pathways to the stream can be predicted based on the surface topography leach et al 2017 ploum et al 2020 shallow groundwater flow is the dominant source of streamflow lyon et al 2012 in the riparian zone the groundwater level fluctuations are highly correlated with streamflow seibert et al 2003 the long term annual average precipitation is about 614 mm yr the mean annual temperature is 1 8 c 9 5 c in january 14 7 c in july the mean annual runoff is 311 mm yr which means that about half of the precipitation goes to evapotranspiration laudon et al 2013 the landscape consists mainly of forests peatlands and lakes the slopes in the catchment are not very steep except for some incised stream banks up to 10 m in the glacio fluvial sediments human made ditches can be up to 1 m deep and are primarily located in the headwater catchments with till soils for more information on the krycklan catchment see laudon et al 2013 for more detailed analyses and visualization of the results we focused on a small area within the krycklan catchment named c6 in other studies in the krycklan catchment this focus area includes many characteristics and small scale topographical features that are typical for the larger krycklan catchment this area is well known to the authors from field visits which allowed for a better interpretation of the topographic features and the impact of smoothing or aggregation on the calculated flow directions 3 methods 3 1 general approach the high resolution dem was modified in two different ways to obtain a lower resolution dem smoothing and aggregation while the first approach assumes that the smoothed dem might be a better representation of the groundwater table the latter aggregation represents the situation where only coarser dems with a lower information content are available we smoothed the dem with two moving window filters gaussian and mean both methods employ a window of a defined pixel width that moves over the raster the center pixel of the window is assigned a new value that is calculated either by weighing the values of the pixels in the window based on their distance according to a gaussian curve with a defined standard deviation gaussian smoothing or by taking the mean of all the pixels in the window mean smoothing we also aggregated the dem i e assigned the average value of all aggregated pixels to the new pixel to obtain dems with a different information content aggregation can to a certain degree be considered a form of smoothing as it also leads to small scale features being averaged out for the different dems we determined the slope for each pixel we assumed that this slope represents the direction of groundwater flow we did this to determine where in the catchment the calculated flow directions are most sensitive to modifications of the topographic data and to determine how the catchment boundaries change when different dems are used most steps of the workflow for the processing of the dems fig 2 were implemented in whitebox gat version 3 4 montreal lindsay 2016a the main steps and individual tools for these procedures are described below additional references to the tools are provided in the supplementary material table s1 3 2 digital elevation models 3 2 1 original dem the original 2 m dem for the krycklan catchment was based on lidar data obtained in august 2015 the lidar data has an average pulse density of 20 pulses m2 the dem was created by gudrun norstedt norstedt 2017 and has been partially tested against ground observations during field visits personal communication william lidberg thomas grabs slu this dem is referred to as the original dem orig from here on 3 2 2 smoothed dems for the smoothing of the original dem we used a gaussian filter whitebox gaussian filter lindsay 2016a and a moving window arithmetic mean filter with different window sizes whitebox mean filter lindsay 2016a the window sizes were chosen to represent different degrees of smoothing of the surface see example in fig 3 and therefore the assumed groundwater table for the gaussian filter we derived dems based on a weighted mean of the surrounding pixels with the weights assigned by the gaussian curve with a standard deviation of either 2 2 pixel 3 3 pixel 5 5 pixel 10 10 pixel or 20 20 pixels we refer to these dems as gaussn where n refers to the number of pixels used for the calculation of the standard deviation that was used for the smoothing 2 3 5 10 or 20 for the mean filter we used the 3 3 pixel 5 5 pixel 9 9 pixel 21 21 pixel window sizes because of the requirement for an odd number of pixels these dems are named meann where n again refers to the number of pixels used for the smoothing 3 5 9 and 21 3 2 3 aggregated dem we used aggregation to obtain lower resolution data whitebox aggregate lindsay 2016a for this we aggregated the pixels 2 2 pixel 3 3 pixel 5 5 pixel 10 10 pixel 20 20 pixel of the original dem and assigned the mean value to all resultant pixels note that this aggregation differs from mean smoothing for which the mean is calculated for the center pixel of the window without changing the resolution of the raster see fig 3 the aggregated dems are referred to as aggrgn where n refers to the aggregated number of pixels 2 3 5 10 or 20 the number of pixels used for the aggregation was chosen to obtain data representing commonly available high resolution dems such as 5 m 10 m 25 m and 30 m 1 arcsec for example rinderer et al 2017 used a 6 by 6 m dem which would represent a smoothing of 3 3 pixels if applied to our original dem to determine the flow directions and topographic indices that were correlated to the variation in groundwater levels in a pre alpine catchment leach et al 2017 resampled the dem to 5 and 10 m which would be a 2 5 2 5 and 5 5 pixel aggregation if applied to our original dem resolution to investigate where the groundwater table is close to the surface and the land is susceptible to damage by heavy machinery after calculating the flow direction and accumulated area see below for more details the aggregated rasters were resampled to match the extent and pixel size of the original and the smoothed dems this means that the rasters resulting from the aggregation process nominally had the same resolution but a lower information content than the original dem in other words the lower resolution rasters allowed for pixel by pixel comparison with the other rasters while de facto still having a lower resolution 3 3 hydrological conditioning of the dems the original smoothed and aggregated dems were hydrological conditioned prior to the calculation of the flow directions hydrological conditioning of a dem means that the dem is modified to remove any sinks i e to ensure that for every pixel there is a flow pathway to an outlet pixel with a strictly monotonically decreasing elevation this conditioning is needed to ensure a realistic prediction of the locations of streams and channels lidberg et al 2017 as well as wetland identification o neil et al 2019 the conditioning generally includes filling and or breaching of depressions lindsay 2016a to avoid problems with drainage area delineation due to small residual sinks and dams band 1986 lindsay 2016b that either naturally occur in the landscape or are created in the process of smoothing and aggregating the dem lidberg et al 2017 concluded that for the krycklan area a breaching algorithm leads to the most realistic results for stream and channel locations we therefore used a breaching algorithm fast breaching algorithm in whitebox lindsay 2016a soille 2004 wang and liu 2006 for all the dems i e original smoothed and aggregated dem 3 4 flow direction analysis for each of the 15 conditioned dems one original five gaussian smoothed dems four mean filter smoothed dems and five aggregated dems we calculated for each pixel the direction of the surface we assumed that these surface gradients represent the shallow groundwater flow directions and thus refer to them as flow directions from hereon we used three different methods to derive the flow direction for each pixel and each dem the slope aspect the d8 o callaghan and mark 1984 and dinf tarboton 1997 algorithms this resulted in 45 different flow directions for each pixel 15 dems multiplied by three different flow direction algorithms although algorithms that allow for multi directional flow e g quinn et al 1991 seibert and mcglynn 2007 are considered superior in certain situations we decided not to use them here because of the difficulty in comparing the results when there are several directions per pixel the 45 flow directions for each pixel were compared using the circular variance cv to determine the sensitivity of the calculated flow direction to the choice of dem and flow direction algorithm for this we converted the flow directions from all 2x2 m dems i e the original dem and the outputs of the smoothing and aggregation steps to radians we then calculated the circular variance for each pixel using the raster package hijmans 2019 in r software r core team 2019 the circular variance cv is 1 minus the length of the mean resultant vector ρ see eq 1 and indicates the clustering of the calculated flow directions or a lack thereof 1 c v 1 ρ the mean resultant length ρ was calculated using eqs 2 4 after pewsey neuhäuser and ruxton 2013 where x is the angle for the individual flow direction vectors i in radians and n is the total number of flow direction vectors 45 in this case 2 ρ 1 n x 2 y 2 2 3 x i 1 n cos x i 4 y i 1 n sin x i the value of the mean resultant length is one if all flow directions are similar and zero if they point in all directions kutil 2012 pewsey et al 2013 for a more intuitive interpretation of the results i e a larger value indicates more variation we used the circular variance cv eq 1 instead of the resultant mean length kutil 2012 small cv values indicate small variations in the flow directions and large values indicate a large variation for examples see fig 4 and figure s1 for the interpretation of the results we defined four classes of circular variance low cv 0 026 middle 0 026 cv 0 104 high 0 104 cv 0 378 and very high cv 0 378 these classes represent an approximately even distribution of flow directions within a range of 0 45 low 45 90 middle 90 180 high and 180 very high fig 4 these ranges were calculated based on a synthetic dataset of 45 evenly distributed flow directions over a range of 1 to 360 figure s1 a drawback of the resultant vector length and thus also the use of the circular variance cv is that it does not provide clear information on the distribution of the flow directions a value close to zero can for example indicate that the flow directions are evenly split in two opposite directions or that the flow directions are evenly spread into all directions pewsey et al 2013 however visual inspection of the calculated flow directions suggested that switches between two opposite directions were rare the variability in the flow directions and thus the value of cv is affected by both the dem and the flow direction algorithm the differences in the calculated flow directions for a pixel for the three different flow direction algorithms were however almost always smaller than 45 and generally smaller than 20 i e within the low and middle variability category figure s2 the differences in the flow directions calculated for the three algorithms were furthermore larger for the original dem than for the smoothed or aggregated dems and not surprisingly differences in the flow directions calculated with the d8 and dinf algorithms were smaller than the differences in the flow directions calculated with either the d8 or dinf algorithm and the slope aspect algorithm see figure s2 in other words the differences in flow directions due to the choice of the flow direction algorithm were small and changes in the flow directions in the high and very high variability category are mainly caused by the choice of the dem i e due to the effects of smoothing or aggregation to determine the characteristics of the areas where the flow directions are highly sensitive to the choice of the dem we determined the spearman rank correlation rs between the circular variance and several topographic indices that were calculated for the original dem accumulated area topographic wetness index twi beven and kirkby 1979 distance to stream downslope distance to stream lindsay 2016a downslope index hjerdt et al 2004 and roughness index riley et al 1999 different landscape elements can have a similar topographic characteristic e g both ridges and incised streambanks in the study area are steep therefore we also determined the fraction of pixels with a particular combination of topographic index values with a high or very high circular variance if a larger fraction of pixels with a certain combination of topographic index values e g steep slope and large distance to stream for the ridges and steep slope but small distance to stream for the incised streambanks has a high or very high circular variance then the flow directions in this type of area are considered to be sensitive to the choice of the dem 3 5 determination of the location of the drainage divides and accumulated areas we also assessed the impacts of dem smoothing and aggregation on the inferred position of the drainage divides to assess the combined effect of potential shifts in the location of the drainage divides we calculated the accumulated area i e drainage area for 40 points in the krycklan catchment see fig 1 for the selection of these 40 points a ground truthed stream network was combined with a map of the d8 based flow accumulation for the original dem the 40 points were chosen to represent the outlets of sub catchments with accumulated areas of 10 12 ha 120 140 ha and 300 320 ha we refer to these points as the outlets of the small medium and large catchments respectively we calculated the d8 flow accumulation for all dems and determined the pixel with the largest accumulated area within a 10 m radius from the original outlet position to consider potential shifts in the location of the simulated stream network for the smoothed and aggregated dems more specifically we used a snapping algorithm based on lindsay et al 2008 to adjust the outlet position to avoid that the snapping leads to a class jump i e a point where the outlet no longer represents the original sub catchment but is moved to a stream that drains a larger catchment we chose only points for which there was no other stream with a similar or larger accumulated area within a 40 m radius for the original dem even though the outlets were chosen based on the original dem the snapping process was applied for all dems including the original dem for the comparison of the size of the calculated accumulated areas for the different dems for each outlet we determined the relative area which is the ratio of the accumulated area calculated for the smoothed or aggregated dem and the accumulated area calculated for the original dem the smoothing and aggregation process can result in unrealistic stream networks and catchment boundaries particularly for small catchments e g goulden et al 2014 with the snapping we tried to account for small shifts in the stream network caused by the smoothing and aggregating especially in cases where the stream position is on the border of two pixels still there were cases where the smoothing and aggregation process caused the original stream to be shifted rather far away or to no longer exist at all this was particularly the case for the small catchments for which the stream was sometimes smoothed over and the drainage area became part of a larger stream we included these catchments in the analyses even if their form and size clearly indicated that the smoothing or aggregation had resulted in an unrealistic catchment area excluding these cases would have been subjective in many cases because the changes were often gradual as the degree of smoothing aggregation increased although all catchments were included in the statistics we focused on the accumulated areas that were at least half but less than twice the size of the accumulated area derived for the original dem i e 0 50 normalized accumulated area 2 0 because larger differences reflect larger structural changes in the stream channel network and a shift in the derived stream channel further away from the original outlet than the 10 m snapping distance such extreme changes in drainage area are more likely to be noticed by researchers working in these areas although this is likely not the case when the algorithms are used for many catchments in a region and could be filtered out by looking at the variation in the areas for each catchment for the differently smoothed dems e g a very large variation could indicate a stream jump smaller changes due to the preprocessing of the dem will be more difficult to detect but can still significantly influence water balance calculations 4 results 4 1 variation in flow directions for the majority of pixels the calculated flow directions differed for the different dems and flow accumulation algorithms fig 5 the flow directions tended to differ more from those calculated for the original dem when the degree of smoothing or aggregation increased see fig 6 c and fig 7 the circular variance was low cv 0 029 for only 28 of the whole krycklan catchment fig 5 for almost 24 of the pixels the circular variance was high and for about 6 of the pixels the variance was very high cv 0 408 the calculated flow directions for the 0 2 km2 focus area varied slightly more than for the entire 67 km2 krycklan catchment but the distribution of cv was overall similar fig 5 the spearman rank correlation rs between slope based on the original dem and the circular variance was 0 50 for the entire krycklan catchment and 0 41 for the focus study area the correlations between either the downslope index or the roughness index and the circular variance was also relatively high table 1 for most steep and very steep slopes 40 based on the original dem the calculated flow directions were relatively stable see figure s4 for moderately steep slopes up to 40 and flatter areas the probability of a high circular variance was larger still the variation in flow directions could be either small or large fig 8 for some moderate to steep slope areas with high twi values i e large accumulated area however the circular variance was very high see fig 8c and d these areas mainly represent the steeper incised streambanks where the flow directions were impacted by a shift in the location of the stream channel due to the smoothing or aggregation for the focus area where the streams are less incised we did not find this effect see fig 8a and b the calculated flow directions for pixels near local water divides low twi and varying slope fig 6a also tended to vary more for the different dems fig 8 4 2 catchment boundaries and accumulated areas the smoothing and aggregation also affected the derived location of the drainage divides and thus the calculated accumulated areas for the selected outlet points fig 9 more smoothing and aggregation generally led to smaller or larger accumulated areas see fig 10 and table s2 the accumulated areas of smaller catchments as determined from the original dem were generally more impacted by the smoothing or aggregation than those of bigger ones see fig 11 the most extremely smoothed dems tended to result in very small accumulated areas fig 10 for the outlets of some of the small catchments this was especially the case for gaussian smoothing but can also be seen for mean smoothing in some cases the shape of the accumulated area for an outlet was so different for the smoothed dem that there was barely any overlap with the accumulated area calculated for the original dem fig 9a aggregation tended to lead to larger catchments fig 10 but there was no clear relation with catchment size fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 effect of dem smoothing and aggregation on the calculated flow directions dem smoothing or aggregation significantly affected the calculated flow directions for many pixels high values of circular variance were mainly found in four different types of areas i areas where the local slope gradient differs from the main slope gradient ii flat areas iii ridges and iv the banks of incised streams for areas where the local slope gradient differed from the general direction of the slope gradient the flow directions shifted with increasing smoothing towards the regional trend fig 12 a because smoothing and aggregation make the topography more uniform and cause a flattening of these smaller local features examples of these types of areas are the esker and other small hills or bumps in the landscape see 1 in fig 6a for flat areas small changes in the elevation due to smoothing or aggregation can easily result in a change of the slope aspect fig 12b the circular variance values for these flat areas were usually medium to high see for example 2 in fig 6a this was particularly the case for larger flat areas in the valley bottom high twi and low slope gradient fig 8c and d but also for flatter areas near the ridges large distance to stream and low slope gradient fig 8a and b the circular variance values were generally also high for areas near the ridge even for relatively steep slopes low twi or large distance to stream and steep slope fig 8c on the map these ridges are often clearly visible as lines with high circular variance e g 3 in fig 6a the smoothing and aggregation of pixels at a ridge can cause a small shift in the location of the highest points and thus the drainage divide and a dramatic change in the calculated local flow direction i e a shift from one side to the other fig 12c this effect was also observed for the incised streambanks fig 8a small distance to stream and steep slopes where the smoothing could cause the stream to shift to a neighboring pixel fig 12d we do not know which degree of smoothing or aggregation leads to the most suitable dem to determine the groundwater table and groundwater flow directions field observations or modeling studies are needed to confirm which dem and thus which smoothed surface most closely resembles the actual groundwater table still this study highlights that smoothing of the dem affects the calculated flow directions and the types of areas where the calculated flow directions are most affected by the smoothing the results thus highlight the need to carefully consider the impacts of smoothing on the calculated flow directions and derived topographic indices as well as the catchment area most likely there is not one single best dem to describe the groundwater table as the groundwater level drops the groundwater table will not only be lower but also smoother i e more subdued than the surface topography bresciani et al 2016a gleeson et al 2011 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 marklund and wörman 2011 winter 2001 the systematic shift in the calculated flow directions for some areas particularly areas where local features created a slope gradient away from the main hillslope gradient could indicate that groundwater flow directions depend on the groundwater level several previous studies have shown that flow directions on hillslopes and in riparian zones can change dramatically as the groundwater level rises or falls rodhe and seibert 2011 van meerveld et al 2015 von freyberg et al 2014 if the degree of smoothing is a function of the depth to the water table then at least for some locations in the catchment different types of smoothing may be needed for different wetness conditions or seasons 5 2 effect of dem smoothing and aggregation on the location of drainage divides the change in the calculated flow directions with smoothing or aggregation of the dems for the ridge sites causes a change in the location of the water divide and thus the surface topography based catchment boundaries our results show that particularly for small headwater catchments the calculated drainage area depends strongly on how much the dem is smoothed for some dems and outlets the drainage areas changed considerably by much more than a factor of two from those determined for the original dem this was most often the case for the outlets of the smaller headwater catchments but was for some dems also observed for the outlets of the medium and large catchments fig 10 it was challenging to determine what caused these substantial changes in the drainage area still visual inspection of the catchment boundaries and the dems suggested that in these cases the dem derived stream network changed considerably so that either a much larger area drained to the chosen outlet point or more frequently there was no longer a stream that drained to the original outlet point because the stream channel had been smoothed out this tendency for the streams of the smallest catchments to disappear when smoothing with the gaussian or mean method should be taken into account when determining catchment areas because it could lead to an underrepresentation of the catchment size of small headwater streams the effects of the aggregation on the relative catchment sizes are interesting because these results most closely emulate the impact of lower resolution elevation data e g gyasi agyei et al 1995 quinn et al 1991 walker and willgoose 1999 wolock and price 1994 zhang and montgomery 1994 for the more aggregated dems there was a tendency for overestimation of the drainage areas but this effect did not seem to depend on the original catchment size smoothing led to some very small left over catchments as parts of the catchment were smoothed out and became part of other catchments aggregation did not lead to as many of these left over catchments because of the larger cell size however in some cases it led to the merging of catchments and thus the frequency of large catchment areas increased the differences in the derived catchment areas are important especially when considering how they will affect the water balance for these catchments while field knowledge will help spot a very incorrect location of the drainage divide small changes in its location and the derived catchment areas will be more difficult to detect and correct the results from this study suggest that without any field confirmation the computed catchment areas for small catchments have to be considered as very uncertain a plausibility check is not possible when dems are used to automatically delineate many headwater catchments water balance data are usually not available for these cases either so that it will be difficult to detect the incorrect catchment areas potentially the methodology used here i e calculating the drainage area for different dems could provide information on the uncertainty of the calculated catchment areas a shift in the location of specific landscape features such as ridges with increasing smoothing of the surface could also be an indication of groundwater subsidies to or from other catchments tóth 1962 indeed systematic water balance differences have been observed between adjacent catchments in this landscape karlsen et al 2016 as well as elsewhere e g oda et al 2013 our methodology can be helpful to identify areas of particular interest when deciding on the placement of wells for calculating groundwater gradients which can be used to gain more insights into runoff generation or to determine the boundary of the groundwater divide 5 3 applicability for other regions our study focused on the groundwater table and assumed that groundwater flow is predominantly parallel to this surface or horizontal cf the dupuit forcheimer assumption we furthermore assumed that the glacial till soils are laterally homogeneous in terms of hydraulic properties and the groundwater system is topography driven gleeson et al 2011 so that the smoothed surface topography can be used to approximate the shape of the groundwater table more sophisticated methods for the calculation of the groundwater table exist e g wörman et al 2006 zijl 1999 but they are also often much more complex and require more in depth knowledge of the investigated system although the shallow groundwater flow pathways are most

2020 shook et al 2021 the focus in this study was on small scale boreal headwater catchments with shallow groundwater in relatively homogeneous till soils but the results of this study are assumed to be applicable for other landscapes with relatively uniform and deep unconsolidated material and a water table that is relatively close to the surface we assume that our approach and results are also applicable for landscapes with a more pronounced i e steeper topography as long as the unconfined aquifer is still relatively homogeneous in mountainous terrain and larger scales the regional flow pathways may be more significant e g gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2012 so that the assumption of flow parallel to the surface is no longer valid however even in mountainous terrain the near surface flow component generally dominates unless the anisotropy is very large gleeson and manning 2008 direct extrapolation to very flat areas may be problematic because the smoothing of local topographic features such as the esker fig 12a is less likely where these features are not present but the sensitivity of flow directions to changes in the topographic information fig 12b is likely similar however for flat areas and wetlands where the groundwater table is very close to the surface groundwater flow may be driven by the microtopography frei et al 2010 van der ploeg et al 2012 so that the smoothing would not lead to a better representation of the groundwater table and flow directions the results are most likely not applicable for areas where the depth of the soil or unconsolidated material is more variable or where bedrock fractures or impermeable layers have a large effect on the groundwater flow directions where the soils are shallow but a lower permeability layer is located close to the surface the topography of this layer may determine the direction of groundwater flow for example van meerveld et al 2015 showed that in the panola catchment in georgia u s the groundwater flow directions were more similar to the direction of the bedrock surface than the ground surface when the water levels were low but more closely resembled the ground surface when the water levels were high 6 conclusions in humid climates the groundwater table is often assumed to be a replicate of the surface topography this allows the use of digital elevation data to estimate the shape of the water table and the groundwater flow directions however some smoothing of high resolution elevation data is needed to represent the groundwater table as small scale topographic features probably do not affect the groundwater flow to investigate how the degree of smoothing of digital elevation data affects the calculated flow directions and where in the catchment the calculated flow directions are most affected by the chosen degree of smoothing we generated different dems representing different degrees of smoothing and aggregation for each pixel we then determined how the degree of smoothing affects the direction of the surface and therefore the assumed groundwater flow direction for almost a third of the study catchment the calculated flow directions varied considerably for the different dems and the circular variance was either high or very high for 70 of the catchment the circular variance was at least as high as in a situation where the flow directions are uniformly spread over a 45 range medium circular variance the calculated flow directions were most affected by smoothing in areas where the slope gradient was 40 smoothing or aggregation caused the flow directions to change particularly much for flatter areas with a high twi and areas with local slopes in the opposite direction of the dominant slope gradient these changes or uncertainties in the calculated groundwater flow directions also impact the derived locations of the drainage divides and the calculated accumulated areas the effect was particularly larger for small headwater catchments 12 ha for which the smoothing often led to an underestimation of the catchment area while the concept of the groundwater table in humid climates being a subdued copy of the surface topography is well established the question remains how subdued this copy is and which degree of smoothing or aggregation best reflects the actual groundwater table two approaches could be used to address this question groundwater flow modelling or field observations of groundwater levels and thus gradients our results demonstrate the need for such studies to determine the degree of

4214,it is generally assumed that in humid climates the groundwater table is a subdued copy of the surface topography however the general groundwater table is unlikely to be affected by the microtopography as seen in high resolution digital elevation models dems so far there has been little guidance on the best resolution dem to use to determine the shape of the water table or the direction of shallow groundwater flow in headwater catchments we therefore looked at the effects of dem smoothing and aggregation on the calculated flow directions and derived catchment boundaries and identified areas and landscape features for which the calculated flow directions are particularly sensitive to dem smoothing or aggregation for 40 of the area of the krycklan study catchment the calculated flow directions depend strongly on the degree of smoothing or aggregation of the dem the four main landscape features for which dem smoothing or aggregation strongly affected the calculated flow directions were local slopes in the opposite direction of the general slope flat areas ridges and incised streambanks to determine the effects of the changing flow directions on the derived catchment boundaries for the smoothed and aggregated dems we calculated the drainage area for 40 locations representing the outlets of catchments of varying sizes the shape and size of the catchments of first order streams were most affected by the processing of the dem these streams were often almost completely smoothed out during the dem preprocessing steps these shifts in catchment boundaries and drainage area would have a large effect on the water balance this study thus highlights the need to carefully consider the effects of dem smoothing or aggregation on the calculated flow directions and drainage areas keywords terrain analysis dem resolution groundwater table flow directions catchment hydrology boreal catchment 1 introduction in humid climates the groundwater table is often assumed to be a subdued replicate of the surface topography condon and maxwell 2015 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 tóth 1962 winter 1999 digital elevation models dems can therefore be used to estimate the direction of groundwater flow haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 wörman et al 2006 these flow directions are in turn used to calculate topographic indices such as the topographic wetness index twi beven and kirkby 1979 that are widely used to describe the topographic controls on the spatial variation in wetness conditions the topographically based flow directions also allow the determination of the catchment boundaries based on the assumption that groundwater flow is predominantly parallel to the surface topography even though it is well known that the groundwater catchment boundaries may not be the same as the surface topography based catchment boundaries the surface topography based drainage divide is usually used to determine the drainage area i e catchment area because data on the location of the groundwater divide is usually not available high resolution elevation data also include many small scale features that are unlikely to affect the direction of groundwater flow in areas where the groundwater table is close to the surface the flow pathways are highly affected by this microtopography e g bresciani et al 2016b frei et al 2010 o loughlin and resources 1986 van der ploeg et al 2012 but at better drained hillslope sites the general flow direction at the hillslope or catchment scale is unlikely to be affected by the microtopography marklund and wörman 2011 zijl 1999 for the identification of the direction of slope parallel groundwater flow and the delineation of the catchment boundaries preprocessing of high resolution dems has therefore become a common practice it includes smoothing aggregation or resampling of the dem as well as the removal of sinks leach et al 2017 lidberg et al 2017 lindsay and creed 2005 o neil et al 2019 for example it has been shown that smoothing improves the performance of a wetland classification model by effectively removing topographic noise and small landscape features that would incorrectly be classified as wetlands o neil et al 2019 aggregation i e the use of a lower resolution dem can disturb the delineation of the stream network e g dehvari and heck 2013 goulden et al 2014 lidberg et al 2017 mcmaster 2002 but can also lead to more realistic groundwater flow directions e g gyasi agyei et al 1995 quinn et al 1991 walker and willgoose 1999 wolock and price 1994 zhang and montgomery 1994 similarly we expect that smoothing of small scale topographic features that are unlikely to affect the groundwater table either through actual smoothing or aggregation of the elevation data can improve the simulation of the shape of the groundwater table and slope parallel groundwater flow directions previous studies have looked at the effects of dem resolution on the hydrological indices that are used for the characterization of surface and groundwater flow but they mostly used grid resolutions from 30 m 1 arcsec upwards le coz et al 2009 stenta et al 2017 vieux 1993 these resolutions are apt for large catchments but are often too coarse to capture the large variability in groundwater levels in small headwater catchments rinderer van meerveld and seibert 2014 compared dems with a 2 4 6 8 and 10 m resolution and considered the 6 m dem most adequate because it reflected the main ridges and depressions but smoothed out the microtopography that they assumed had little effect on shallow groundwater flow directions they therefore used this dem to determine the topographic indices e g twi curvature that they related to the observed groundwater levels rinderer et al 2014 and used to predict the groundwater level at unmonitored locations rinderer et al 2019 dehvari and heck 2013 used 1 2 3 4 5 8 and 10 m resolution dems to study the effect of dem resolution on landscape attributes such as ridges and flat areas and concluded that the used coarser resolution strongly affected the extraction of streams similarly woodrow et al 2016 used a 1 5 and 10 m dem and showed that contributing areas and stream lengths were significantly impacted by the choice of the dem however no study has systematically investigated how the smoothing or aggregation of a dem affects the estimated shallow groundwater flow directions or where in the landscape the calculated groundwater flow directions are most impacted by dem smoothing or aggregation if the resolution of the dem significantly affects the calculated groundwater flow directions this also affects the location of the derived catchment boundaries previous studies have shown that catchment delineation based on almost unaltered i e only minimal smoothing aggregation sink filling or channel burning for sink removal topographic data can lead to either an overestimation or underestimation of the catchment area the degree of error depends on the topography and geology of the catchment condon and maxwell 2015 as well as the resolution of the elevation data used for the delineation hinton et al 1993 woodrow et al 2016 in this study we therefore focus on the effects of dem smoothing and aggregation on the calculated directions of shallow groundwater flow in small headwater catchments and the derived catchment boundaries although groundwater flow is a three dimensional phenomenon toth 1963 winter et al 1999 and the deeper flow pathways of the nested groundwater system are important for the water balance and baseflow generation fan and schaller 2009 oda et al 2013 welch et al 2012 we focus here on the shallow groundwater flow pathways typically within 6 m of the soil surface in small 1 km2 headwater catchments we assume that the groundwater table is a subdued copy of the topography and the main direction of shallow groundwater flow is parallel to the surface we systematically smoothed high resolution elevation data for the krycklan catchment in northern sweden to eliminate small scale features from the dem this procedure corresponds in principle to reducing the resolution of the dem the idea is that after some degree of smoothing the dem of the surface topography better represents the groundwater table and flow directions cf rinderer et al 2014 if the dem resolution has a significant impact on the calculated flow directions the obvious follow up question which we do not address in this study is whether there is an optimal resolution however as a first step and in the absence of observed groundwater level data to determine the location of the groundwater table and flow directions we focus here on quantifying the impact of dem resolution and thus information content on the calculated groundwater flow directions and catchment areas for an area where shallow groundwater is the main source of runoff more specifically we address the following questions how much does the dem resolution or dem smoothing influence the calculated flow directions where in the landscape are the calculated flow directions most sensitive to the dem resolution and information content how much does the preprocessing of the dem affect the estimation of catchment areas 2 study catchment the 67 8 km2 krycklan catchment is located about 100 km northwest of umeå in sweden see fig 1 it is located in the boreal zone and has a typical glaciated terrain we selected the krycklan catchment for this study because of the availability of a high resolution 2 m dem and the relatively simple hydrogeological situation due to the deep till soils lindqvist et al 1989 the groundwater tables are generally shallow 6 m from the surface and in most locations 2 m subsurface flow pathways to the stream can be predicted based on the surface topography leach et al 2017 ploum et al 2020 shallow groundwater flow is the dominant source of streamflow lyon et al 2012 in the riparian zone the groundwater level fluctuations are highly correlated with streamflow seibert et al 2003 the long term annual average precipitation is about 614 mm yr the mean annual temperature is 1 8 c 9 5 c in january 14 7 c in july the mean annual runoff is 311 mm yr which means that about half of the precipitation goes to evapotranspiration laudon et al 2013 the landscape consists mainly of forests peatlands and lakes the slopes in the catchment are not very steep except for some incised stream banks up to 10 m in the glacio fluvial sediments human made ditches can be up to 1 m deep and are primarily located in the headwater catchments with till soils for more information on the krycklan catchment see laudon et al 2013 for more detailed analyses and visualization of the results we focused on a small area within the krycklan catchment named c6 in other studies in the krycklan catchment this focus area includes many characteristics and small scale topographical features that are typical for the larger krycklan catchment this area is well known to the authors from field visits which allowed for a better interpretation of the topographic features and the impact of smoothing or aggregation on the calculated flow directions 3 methods 3 1 general approach the high resolution dem was modified in two different ways to obtain a lower resolution dem smoothing and aggregation while the first approach assumes that the smoothed dem might be a better representation of the groundwater table the latter aggregation represents the situation where only coarser dems with a lower information content are available we smoothed the dem with two moving window filters gaussian and mean both methods employ a window of a defined pixel width that moves over the raster the center pixel of the window is assigned a new value that is calculated either by weighing the values of the pixels in the window based on their distance according to a gaussian curve with a defined standard deviation gaussian smoothing or by taking the mean of all the pixels in the window mean smoothing we also aggregated the dem i e assigned the average value of all aggregated pixels to the new pixel to obtain dems with a different information content aggregation can to a certain degree be considered a form of smoothing as it also leads to small scale features being averaged out for the different dems we determined the slope for each pixel we assumed that this slope represents the direction of groundwater flow we did this to determine where in the catchment the calculated flow directions are most sensitive to modifications of the topographic data and to determine how the catchment boundaries change when different dems are used most steps of the workflow for the processing of the dems fig 2 were implemented in whitebox gat version 3 4 montreal lindsay 2016a the main steps and individual tools for these procedures are described below additional references to the tools are provided in the supplementary material table s1 3 2 digital elevation models 3 2 1 original dem the original 2 m dem for the krycklan catchment was based on lidar data obtained in august 2015 the lidar data has an average pulse density of 20 pulses m2 the dem was created by gudrun norstedt norstedt 2017 and has been partially tested against ground observations during field visits personal communication william lidberg thomas grabs slu this dem is referred to as the original dem orig from here on 3 2 2 smoothed dems for the smoothing of the original dem we used a gaussian filter whitebox gaussian filter lindsay 2016a and a moving window arithmetic mean filter with different window sizes whitebox mean filter lindsay 2016a the window sizes were chosen to represent different degrees of smoothing of the surface see example in fig 3 and therefore the assumed groundwater table for the gaussian filter we derived dems based on a weighted mean of the surrounding pixels with the weights assigned by the gaussian curve with a standard deviation of either 2 2 pixel 3 3 pixel 5 5 pixel 10 10 pixel or 20 20 pixels we refer to these dems as gaussn where n refers to the number of pixels used for the calculation of the standard deviation that was used for the smoothing 2 3 5 10 or 20 for the mean filter we used the 3 3 pixel 5 5 pixel 9 9 pixel 21 21 pixel window sizes because of the requirement for an odd number of pixels these dems are named meann where n again refers to the number of pixels used for the smoothing 3 5 9 and 21 3 2 3 aggregated dem we used aggregation to obtain lower resolution data whitebox aggregate lindsay 2016a for this we aggregated the pixels 2 2 pixel 3 3 pixel 5 5 pixel 10 10 pixel 20 20 pixel of the original dem and assigned the mean value to all resultant pixels note that this aggregation differs from mean smoothing for which the mean is calculated for the center pixel of the window without changing the resolution of the raster see fig 3 the aggregated dems are referred to as aggrgn where n refers to the aggregated number of pixels 2 3 5 10 or 20 the number of pixels used for the aggregation was chosen to obtain data representing commonly available high resolution dems such as 5 m 10 m 25 m and 30 m 1 arcsec for example rinderer et al 2017 used a 6 by 6 m dem which would represent a smoothing of 3 3 pixels if applied to our original dem to determine the flow directions and topographic indices that were correlated to the variation in groundwater levels in a pre alpine catchment leach et al 2017 resampled the dem to 5 and 10 m which would be a 2 5 2 5 and 5 5 pixel aggregation if applied to our original dem resolution to investigate where the groundwater table is close to the surface and the land is susceptible to damage by heavy machinery after calculating the flow direction and accumulated area see below for more details the aggregated rasters were resampled to match the extent and pixel size of the original and the smoothed dems this means that the rasters resulting from the aggregation process nominally had the same resolution but a lower information content than the original dem in other words the lower resolution rasters allowed for pixel by pixel comparison with the other rasters while de facto still having a lower resolution 3 3 hydrological conditioning of the dems the original smoothed and aggregated dems were hydrological conditioned prior to the calculation of the flow directions hydrological conditioning of a dem means that the dem is modified to remove any sinks i e to ensure that for every pixel there is a flow pathway to an outlet pixel with a strictly monotonically decreasing elevation this conditioning is needed to ensure a realistic prediction of the locations of streams and channels lidberg et al 2017 as well as wetland identification o neil et al 2019 the conditioning generally includes filling and or breaching of depressions lindsay 2016a to avoid problems with drainage area delineation due to small residual sinks and dams band 1986 lindsay 2016b that either naturally occur in the landscape or are created in the process of smoothing and aggregating the dem lidberg et al 2017 concluded that for the krycklan area a breaching algorithm leads to the most realistic results for stream and channel locations we therefore used a breaching algorithm fast breaching algorithm in whitebox lindsay 2016a soille 2004 wang and liu 2006 for all the dems i e original smoothed and aggregated dem 3 4 flow direction analysis for each of the 15 conditioned dems one original five gaussian smoothed dems four mean filter smoothed dems and five aggregated dems we calculated for each pixel the direction of the surface we assumed that these surface gradients represent the shallow groundwater flow directions and thus refer to them as flow directions from hereon we used three different methods to derive the flow direction for each pixel and each dem the slope aspect the d8 o callaghan and mark 1984 and dinf tarboton 1997 algorithms this resulted in 45 different flow directions for each pixel 15 dems multiplied by three different flow direction algorithms although algorithms that allow for multi directional flow e g quinn et al 1991 seibert and mcglynn 2007 are considered superior in certain situations we decided not to use them here because of the difficulty in comparing the results when there are several directions per pixel the 45 flow directions for each pixel were compared using the circular variance cv to determine the sensitivity of the calculated flow direction to the choice of dem and flow direction algorithm for this we converted the flow directions from all 2x2 m dems i e the original dem and the outputs of the smoothing and aggregation steps to radians we then calculated the circular variance for each pixel using the raster package hijmans 2019 in r software r core team 2019 the circular variance cv is 1 minus the length of the mean resultant vector ρ see eq 1 and indicates the clustering of the calculated flow directions or a lack thereof 1 c v 1 ρ the mean resultant length ρ was calculated using eqs 2 4 after pewsey neuhäuser and ruxton 2013 where x is the angle for the individual flow direction vectors i in radians and n is the total number of flow direction vectors 45 in this case 2 ρ 1 n x 2 y 2 2 3 x i 1 n cos x i 4 y i 1 n sin x i the value of the mean resultant length is one if all flow directions are similar and zero if they point in all directions kutil 2012 pewsey et al 2013 for a more intuitive interpretation of the results i e a larger value indicates more variation we used the circular variance cv eq 1 instead of the resultant mean length kutil 2012 small cv values indicate small variations in the flow directions and large values indicate a large variation for examples see fig 4 and figure s1 for the interpretation of the results we defined four classes of circular variance low cv 0 026 middle 0 026 cv 0 104 high 0 104 cv 0 378 and very high cv 0 378 these classes represent an approximately even distribution of flow directions within a range of 0 45 low 45 90 middle 90 180 high and 180 very high fig 4 these ranges were calculated based on a synthetic dataset of 45 evenly distributed flow directions over a range of 1 to 360 figure s1 a drawback of the resultant vector length and thus also the use of the circular variance cv is that it does not provide clear information on the distribution of the flow directions a value close to zero can for example indicate that the flow directions are evenly split in two opposite directions or that the flow directions are evenly spread into all directions pewsey et al 2013 however visual inspection of the calculated flow directions suggested that switches between two opposite directions were rare the variability in the flow directions and thus the value of cv is affected by both the dem and the flow direction algorithm the differences in the calculated flow directions for a pixel for the three different flow direction algorithms were however almost always smaller than 45 and generally smaller than 20 i e within the low and middle variability category figure s2 the differences in the flow directions calculated for the three algorithms were furthermore larger for the original dem than for the smoothed or aggregated dems and not surprisingly differences in the flow directions calculated with the d8 and dinf algorithms were smaller than the differences in the flow directions calculated with either the d8 or dinf algorithm and the slope aspect algorithm see figure s2 in other words the differences in flow directions due to the choice of the flow direction algorithm were small and changes in the flow directions in the high and very high variability category are mainly caused by the choice of the dem i e due to the effects of smoothing or aggregation to determine the characteristics of the areas where the flow directions are highly sensitive to the choice of the dem we determined the spearman rank correlation rs between the circular variance and several topographic indices that were calculated for the original dem accumulated area topographic wetness index twi beven and kirkby 1979 distance to stream downslope distance to stream lindsay 2016a downslope index hjerdt et al 2004 and roughness index riley et al 1999 different landscape elements can have a similar topographic characteristic e g both ridges and incised streambanks in the study area are steep therefore we also determined the fraction of pixels with a particular combination of topographic index values with a high or very high circular variance if a larger fraction of pixels with a certain combination of topographic index values e g steep slope and large distance to stream for the ridges and steep slope but small distance to stream for the incised streambanks has a high or very high circular variance then the flow directions in this type of area are considered to be sensitive to the choice of the dem 3 5 determination of the location of the drainage divides and accumulated areas we also assessed the impacts of dem smoothing and aggregation on the inferred position of the drainage divides to assess the combined effect of potential shifts in the location of the drainage divides we calculated the accumulated area i e drainage area for 40 points in the krycklan catchment see fig 1 for the selection of these 40 points a ground truthed stream network was combined with a map of the d8 based flow accumulation for the original dem the 40 points were chosen to represent the outlets of sub catchments with accumulated areas of 10 12 ha 120 140 ha and 300 320 ha we refer to these points as the outlets of the small medium and large catchments respectively we calculated the d8 flow accumulation for all dems and determined the pixel with the largest accumulated area within a 10 m radius from the original outlet position to consider potential shifts in the location of the simulated stream network for the smoothed and aggregated dems more specifically we used a snapping algorithm based on lindsay et al 2008 to adjust the outlet position to avoid that the snapping leads to a class jump i e a point where the outlet no longer represents the original sub catchment but is moved to a stream that drains a larger catchment we chose only points for which there was no other stream with a similar or larger accumulated area within a 40 m radius for the original dem even though the outlets were chosen based on the original dem the snapping process was applied for all dems including the original dem for the comparison of the size of the calculated accumulated areas for the different dems for each outlet we determined the relative area which is the ratio of the accumulated area calculated for the smoothed or aggregated dem and the accumulated area calculated for the original dem the smoothing and aggregation process can result in unrealistic stream networks and catchment boundaries particularly for small catchments e g goulden et al 2014 with the snapping we tried to account for small shifts in the stream network caused by the smoothing and aggregating especially in cases where the stream position is on the border of two pixels still there were cases where the smoothing and aggregation process caused the original stream to be shifted rather far away or to no longer exist at all this was particularly the case for the small catchments for which the stream was sometimes smoothed over and the drainage area became part of a larger stream we included these catchments in the analyses even if their form and size clearly indicated that the smoothing or aggregation had resulted in an unrealistic catchment area excluding these cases would have been subjective in many cases because the changes were often gradual as the degree of smoothing aggregation increased although all catchments were included in the statistics we focused on the accumulated areas that were at least half but less than twice the size of the accumulated area derived for the original dem i e 0 50 normalized accumulated area 2 0 because larger differences reflect larger structural changes in the stream channel network and a shift in the derived stream channel further away from the original outlet than the 10 m snapping distance such extreme changes in drainage area are more likely to be noticed by researchers working in these areas although this is likely not the case when the algorithms are used for many catchments in a region and could be filtered out by looking at the variation in the areas for each catchment for the differently smoothed dems e g a very large variation could indicate a stream jump smaller changes due to the preprocessing of the dem will be more difficult to detect but can still significantly influence water balance calculations 4 results 4 1 variation in flow directions for the majority of pixels the calculated flow directions differed for the different dems and flow accumulation algorithms fig 5 the flow directions tended to differ more from those calculated for the original dem when the degree of smoothing or aggregation increased see fig 6 c and fig 7 the circular variance was low cv 0 029 for only 28 of the whole krycklan catchment fig 5 for almost 24 of the pixels the circular variance was high and for about 6 of the pixels the variance was very high cv 0 408 the calculated flow directions for the 0 2 km2 focus area varied slightly more than for the entire 67 km2 krycklan catchment but the distribution of cv was overall similar fig 5 the spearman rank correlation rs between slope based on the original dem and the circular variance was 0 50 for the entire krycklan catchment and 0 41 for the focus study area the correlations between either the downslope index or the roughness index and the circular variance was also relatively high table 1 for most steep and very steep slopes 40 based on the original dem the calculated flow directions were relatively stable see figure s4 for moderately steep slopes up to 40 and flatter areas the probability of a high circular variance was larger still the variation in flow directions could be either small or large fig 8 for some moderate to steep slope areas with high twi values i e large accumulated area however the circular variance was very high see fig 8c and d these areas mainly represent the steeper incised streambanks where the flow directions were impacted by a shift in the location of the stream channel due to the smoothing or aggregation for the focus area where the streams are less incised we did not find this effect see fig 8a and b the calculated flow directions for pixels near local water divides low twi and varying slope fig 6a also tended to vary more for the different dems fig 8 4 2 catchment boundaries and accumulated areas the smoothing and aggregation also affected the derived location of the drainage divides and thus the calculated accumulated areas for the selected outlet points fig 9 more smoothing and aggregation generally led to smaller or larger accumulated areas see fig 10 and table s2 the accumulated areas of smaller catchments as determined from the original dem were generally more impacted by the smoothing or aggregation than those of bigger ones see fig 11 the most extremely smoothed dems tended to result in very small accumulated areas fig 10 for the outlets of some of the small catchments this was especially the case for gaussian smoothing but can also be seen for mean smoothing in some cases the shape of the accumulated area for an outlet was so different for the smoothed dem that there was barely any overlap with the accumulated area calculated for the original dem fig 9a aggregation tended to lead to larger catchments fig 10 but there was no clear relation with catchment size fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 effect of dem smoothing and aggregation on the calculated flow directions dem smoothing or aggregation significantly affected the calculated flow directions for many pixels high values of circular variance were mainly found in four different types of areas i areas where the local slope gradient differs from the main slope gradient ii flat areas iii ridges and iv the banks of incised streams for areas where the local slope gradient differed from the general direction of the slope gradient the flow directions shifted with increasing smoothing towards the regional trend fig 12 a because smoothing and aggregation make the topography more uniform and cause a flattening of these smaller local features examples of these types of areas are the esker and other small hills or bumps in the landscape see 1 in fig 6a for flat areas small changes in the elevation due to smoothing or aggregation can easily result in a change of the slope aspect fig 12b the circular variance values for these flat areas were usually medium to high see for example 2 in fig 6a this was particularly the case for larger flat areas in the valley bottom high twi and low slope gradient fig 8c and d but also for flatter areas near the ridges large distance to stream and low slope gradient fig 8a and b the circular variance values were generally also high for areas near the ridge even for relatively steep slopes low twi or large distance to stream and steep slope fig 8c on the map these ridges are often clearly visible as lines with high circular variance e g 3 in fig 6a the smoothing and aggregation of pixels at a ridge can cause a small shift in the location of the highest points and thus the drainage divide and a dramatic change in the calculated local flow direction i e a shift from one side to the other fig 12c this effect was also observed for the incised streambanks fig 8a small distance to stream and steep slopes where the smoothing could cause the stream to shift to a neighboring pixel fig 12d we do not know which degree of smoothing or aggregation leads to the most suitable dem to determine the groundwater table and groundwater flow directions field observations or modeling studies are needed to confirm which dem and thus which smoothed surface most closely resembles the actual groundwater table still this study highlights that smoothing of the dem affects the calculated flow directions and the types of areas where the calculated flow directions are most affected by the smoothing the results thus highlight the need to carefully consider the impacts of smoothing on the calculated flow directions and derived topographic indices as well as the catchment area most likely there is not one single best dem to describe the groundwater table as the groundwater level drops the groundwater table will not only be lower but also smoother i e more subdued than the surface topography bresciani et al 2016a gleeson et al 2011 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 marklund and wörman 2011 winter 2001 the systematic shift in the calculated flow directions for some areas particularly areas where local features created a slope gradient away from the main hillslope gradient could indicate that groundwater flow directions depend on the groundwater level several previous studies have shown that flow directions on hillslopes and in riparian zones can change dramatically as the groundwater level rises or falls rodhe and seibert 2011 van meerveld et al 2015 von freyberg et al 2014 if the degree of smoothing is a function of the depth to the water table then at least for some locations in the catchment different types of smoothing may be needed for different wetness conditions or seasons 5 2 effect of dem smoothing and aggregation on the location of drainage divides the change in the calculated flow directions with smoothing or aggregation of the dems for the ridge sites causes a change in the location of the water divide and thus the surface topography based catchment boundaries our results show that particularly for small headwater catchments the calculated drainage area depends strongly on how much the dem is smoothed for some dems and outlets the drainage areas changed considerably by much more than a factor of two from those determined for the original dem this was most often the case for the outlets of the smaller headwater catchments but was for some dems also observed for the outlets of the medium and large catchments fig 10 it was challenging to determine what caused these substantial changes in the drainage area still visual inspection of the catchment boundaries and the dems suggested that in these cases the dem derived stream network changed considerably so that either a much larger area drained to the chosen outlet point or more frequently there was no longer a stream that drained to the original outlet point because the stream channel had been smoothed out this tendency for the streams of the smallest catchments to disappear when smoothing with the gaussian or mean method should be taken into account when determining catchment areas because it could lead to an underrepresentation of the catchment size of small headwater streams the effects of the aggregation on the relative catchment sizes are interesting because these results most closely emulate the impact of lower resolution elevation data e g gyasi agyei et al 1995 quinn et al 1991 walker and willgoose 1999 wolock and price 1994 zhang and montgomery 1994 for the more aggregated dems there was a tendency for overestimation of the drainage areas but this effect did not seem to depend on the original catchment size smoothing led to some very small left over catchments as parts of the catchment were smoothed out and became part of other catchments aggregation did not lead to as many of these left over catchments because of the larger cell size however in some cases it led to the merging of catchments and thus the frequency of large catchment areas increased the differences in the derived catchment areas are important especially when considering how they will affect the water balance for these catchments while field knowledge will help spot a very incorrect location of the drainage divide small changes in its location and the derived catchment areas will be more difficult to detect and correct the results from this study suggest that without any field confirmation the computed catchment areas for small catchments have to be considered as very uncertain a plausibility check is not possible when dems are used to automatically delineate many headwater catchments water balance data are usually not available for these cases either so that it will be difficult to detect the incorrect catchment areas potentially the methodology used here i e calculating the drainage area for different dems could provide information on the uncertainty of the calculated catchment areas a shift in the location of specific landscape features such as ridges with increasing smoothing of the surface could also be an indication of groundwater subsidies to or from other catchments tóth 1962 indeed systematic water balance differences have been observed between adjacent catchments in this landscape karlsen et al 2016 as well as elsewhere e g oda et al 2013 our methodology can be helpful to identify areas of particular interest when deciding on the placement of wells for calculating groundwater gradients which can be used to gain more insights into runoff generation or to determine the boundary of the groundwater divide 5 3 applicability for other regions our study focused on the groundwater table and assumed that groundwater flow is predominantly parallel to this surface or horizontal cf the dupuit forcheimer assumption we furthermore assumed that the glacial till soils are laterally homogeneous in terms of hydraulic properties and the groundwater system is topography driven gleeson et al 2011 so that the smoothed surface topography can be used to approximate the shape of the groundwater table more sophisticated methods for the calculation of the groundwater table exist e g wörman et al 2006 zijl 1999 but they are also often much more complex and require more in depth knowledge of the investigated system although the shallow groundwater flow pathways are most important for runoff generation during rainfall or snow melt events in small catchments e g lyon et al 2012 deeper non slope parallel flow occurs as well and can be important for the generation of baseflow tóth 1962 winter et al 1999 even at krycklan the groundwater system is a nested system with shallow and deeper groundwater flow pathways kolbe et al 2020 these deeper pathways can also cause inter catchment groundwater flow fan and schaller 2009 the use of surface topography based estimates of groundwater flow directions and the drainage area is problematic if inter catchment groundwater flow is important fan 2019 käser and hunkeler 2016 oda et al 2013 welch et al 2012 in other cases only a part of the surface catchment may contribute to streamflow e g godwin and martin 1975 liu et al 2020 shook et al 2021 the focus in this study was on small scale boreal headwater catchments with shallow groundwater in relatively homogeneous till soils but the results of this study are assumed to be applicable for other landscapes with relatively uniform and deep unconsolidated material and a water table that is relatively close to the surface we assume that our approach and results are also applicable for landscapes with a more pronounced i e steeper topography as long as the unconfined aquifer is still relatively homogeneous in mountainous terrain and larger scales the regional flow pathways may be more significant e g gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2012 so that the assumption of flow parallel to the surface is no longer valid however even in mountainous terrain the near surface flow component generally dominates unless the anisotropy is very large gleeson and manning 2008 direct extrapolation to very flat areas may be problematic because the smoothing of local topographic features such as the esker fig 12a is less likely where these features are not present but the sensitivity of flow directions to changes in the topographic information fig 12b is likely similar however for flat areas and wetlands where the groundwater table is very close to the surface groundwater flow may be driven by the microtopography frei et al 2010 van der ploeg et al 2012 so that the smoothing would not lead to a better representation of the groundwater table and flow directions the results are most likely not applicable for areas where the depth of the soil or unconsolidated material is more variable or where bedrock fractures or impermeable layers have a large effect on the groundwater flow directions where the soils are shallow but a lower permeability layer is located close to the surface the topography of this layer may determine the direction of groundwater flow for example van meerveld et al 2015 showed that in the panola catchment in georgia u s the groundwater flow directions were more similar to the direction of the bedrock surface than the ground surface when the water levels were low but more closely resembled the ground surface when the water levels were high 6 conclusions in humid climates the groundwater table is often assumed to be a replicate of the surface topography this allows the use of digital elevation data to estimate the shape of the water table and the groundwater flow directions however some smoothing of high resolution elevation data is needed to represent the groundwater table as small scale topographic features probably do not affect the groundwater flow to investigate how the degree of smoothing of digital elevation data affects the calculated flow directions and where in the catchment the calculated flow directions are most affected by the chosen degree of smoothing we generated different dems representing different degrees of smoothing and aggregation for each pixel we then determined how the degree of smoothing affects the direction of the surface and therefore the assumed groundwater flow direction for almost a third of the study catchment the calculated flow directions varied considerably for the different dems and the circular variance was either high or very high for 70 of the catchment the circular variance was at least as high as in a situation where the flow directions are uniformly spread over a 45 range medium circular variance the calculated flow directions were most affected by smoothing in areas where the slope gradient was 40 smoothing or aggregation caused the flow directions to change particularly much for flatter areas with a high twi and areas with local slopes in the opposite direction of the dominant slope gradient these changes or uncertainties in the calculated groundwater flow directions also impact the derived locations of the drainage divides and the calculated accumulated areas the effect was particularly larger for small headwater catchments 12 ha for which the smoothing often led to an underestimation of the catchment area while the concept of the groundwater table in humid climates being a subdued copy of the surface topography is well established the question remains how subdued this copy is and which degree of smoothing or aggregation best reflects the actual groundwater table two approaches could be used to address this question groundwater flow modelling or field observations of groundwater levels and thus gradients our results demonstrate the need for such studies to determine the degree of smoothing of the dem that yields the best approximation of the groundwater table credit authorship contribution statement jana erdbrügger conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation
