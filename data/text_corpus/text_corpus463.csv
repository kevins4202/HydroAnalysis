2315,monthly water balance models are valuable tools in water resources management unfortunately most of these models suffer from structure complexity large data requirements occasionally low performance in simulating runoff high seasonality of model residuals and or limited application in snow climates by adding a seasonal component sc this study aims 1 to enhance the performance of the parsimonious gr2m monthly model with only two free parameters and 2 to increase its applicability in snow climates without any further data requirements as only precipitation and potential evapotranspiration monthly series are required to predict monthly runoff the proposed model is examined at the catchment scale using 710 stations from the hydro climatic data network selected to cover various climatic conditions across the continental united states various performance criteria are calculated to compare the proposed gr2m sc model with the original gr2m such as the nash sutcliffe and kling gupta efficiencies the coefficient of determination root mean square error and bias two split sample sets are used to calibrate and validate the models the calibration process is applied once using the first two thirds of the dataset and again using the last two thirds and each time the remaining sub set is used for validation purposes furthermore a seasonality measure is calculated to estimate the strength of seasonality in model residuals the proposed gr2m sc model clearly outperforms the original gr2m model as well as gr2m which is an improved 4 parameter version of the gr2m model with capabilities for handling snow accumulation and snowmelt the seasonality of the proposed model residuals was also reduced keywords gr2m gr2m sc snow model seasonality of model residuals k√∂ppen geiger climate classification hydro climatic data network usa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water balance models wbm have been developed and improved to increase hydrological knowledge at the catchment scale such models have been proved efficient for many basic and advanced applications jarboe and haan 1974 schaake and liu 1989 maier and dandy 2000 leta et al 2016 abdollahi et al 2018 tian et al 2018 jiang and wang 2019 at various temporal timescales from hourly to annual xu and singh 1998 among them monthly wbms have recently received increasing attention due to the limited requirement for input data and the long history of development spanning decades bai et al 2015 the comparison between these models is usually based on two factors overall behavior in simulating monthly runoff which may be represented using performance criteria and model complexity this complexity varies from very complex models such as wilk and hughes 2002 model with twelve parameters to simple two parameter models such as xm and gr2m models xiong and guo 1999 mouelhi et al 2006 it should be noted that over parameterized models are not recommended due to over fitting and prediction deviation issues whittaker et al 2010 beven 1993 introduced the concept of equifinality in hydrological research which refers to the complex models with a high number of parameters reproducing the same outputs based on different combinations of model parameters khatami et al 2019 one of the most efficient wbms is the parent scheme which was re introduced and known as the gr5m model mouelhi et al 2006 gr5m is a two storage model with five calibrated parameters from x1 to x5 where x1 represents the maximum capacity of soil moisture storage x2 is a time step factor to represent the new soil moisture storage based on its value of the previous month x3 is a component for partitioning the precipitation to routing storage and direct runoff x4 is the routing storage capacity and x5 is a water exchange term in order to develop a more parsimonious model mouelhi et al 2006 succeeded to reduce the complexity of the gr5m by identifying the most effective parameters as a result a two parameter model was developed with only x1 and x5 it should be noted that there were previous versions of gr2m developed by kabouya 1990 kabouya and michel 1991 makhlouf 1994 makhlouf and michel 1994 and mouelhi 2003 the version modified in this research is that of mouelhi et al 2006 which appears to be the latest and most efficient when compared to other versions ditthakit et al 2021 another key component in reviewing wbms is their capability to account for snow accumulation and to represent snowmelt in fact several wbms give poor results in snowy regions motoyama 1983 martinez and gupta 2010 as a result many wbms have been modeled with a snow component using different measures of temperature a snowmelt rate and a snow accumulation reservoir ishii et al 2004 mccabe and markstrom 2007 martinez and gupta 2010 tayefeh neskili et al 2017 martinez and gupta 2010 extended the abcd model which was initially developed by thomas 1981 with four calibrated parameters to take snow into account by adding three additional calibrated parameters the results of the abcd snow model based on seven calibrated parameters show high performance especially for basins where snow is a major contributor within the hydrological cycle wagner et al 2017 also extended the gr2m model with a snow component developed by xu et al 1996 the proposed model known as gr2m was developed by introducing an additional snow storage with two additional calibrated parameters making the gr2m a four parameter model the gr2m was successfully applied on 101 catchments within the greater alpine region with an average nash sutcliff efficiency nse of almost 0 75 however in this research as will be presented later the gr2m showed lower performance based on a larger scale dataset of 710 stations covering various climatic conditions across the united states thus the gr2m may still suffer some of the shortcomings of the gr2m model upon which it was based further discussion is elaborated in the results and discussion section a comprehensive comparative study by bai et al 2015 focused on evaluating twelve previously published monthly wbms with 2 3 4 and 5 parameters in different climatic regions in china both gr5m and gr2m models were among the models examined and the results showed that gr5m performed best followed by gr2m ahead of all 12 models the gr2m model performed better than models with three four and five calibrated parameters consequently the gr2m is considered as the benchmark for many studies due to its simplicity and performance in capturing monthly runoff the gr2m model was also applied in basins in south america lavado casimiro et al 2011 asia lyon et al 2017 ma et al 2019 europe lespinas et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 africa lacombe et al 2016 fathi et al 2019 north america huard and mailhot 2008 and finally in australia fathi et al 2019 using a dataset of six rivers worldwide fathi et al 2019 recently compared the gr2m model to one based on an extension of the budyko equation using time series the results showed that the gr2m performance was lower than the extended budyko framework furthermore the residuals of the gr2m model had a strong seasonal behavior it should be noted that the comparison between the hybrid sarimax budyko model with six free parameters and the gr2m model with only two parameters is not reasonable from a parsimony of parameters point of view because a simple model such as the gr2m remains extremely valuable for applications involving climate change especially if the seasonality of the model residuals is minimized and its performance improved the objective of the present study is therefore to improve the gr2m model focusing on 1 increasing its performance in simulating monthly runoff 2 improving its applicability in snowy regions and 3 decreasing the seasonality of the residuals these objectives need to be achieved while conserving the simplicity and parsimony of the model which is the novel approach of this study 2 methodology and model evaluation discussion of the methodology starts by presenting the two parameter gr2m model and the four parameters gr2m model next we focus on the proposed additional parameter that is introduced to the original gr2m to achieve the study objectives lastly model evaluation criteria are introduced as is a method to evaluate the seasonality of the model residuals 2 1 the original gr2m and gr2m models the gr2m water balance model uses two different reservoirs to represent the monthly rainfall runoff transformation within each basin fig 1 a the first reservoir represents a soil moisture reservoir with maximum capacity of x1 calibrated parameter in mm while the second is a quadratic routing reservoir with a maximum capacity of 60 mm the relationship between the routing reservoir with the groundwater or the outside environment of the catchment is governed by a second calibrated parameter x5 a positive non dimensional parameter fig 1a presents the main flow diagram of the gr2m model with all its governing equations the model starts by partitioning the precipitation into a precipitation depth that enters into the soil to increase the initial moisture storage from s to s1 with a maximum capacity for this production store of x1 and the remaining precipitation is considered as an excess precipitation p1 part of the water storage is lost due to evapotranspiration reducing the soil moisture production storage from s1 to s2 the soil moisture remaining in the production store is calculated as a function of s2 and x1 to help determine whether it remains within the soil moisture production store or is released from the soil as p2 p2 then combines with p1 forming the flow input p3 that goes into the routing store increasing the level of routing store from r to r1 which is an intermediate value of routing store used for calculation purposes only this later storage has a maximum limit of 60 mm r1 is then multiplied by x5 to obtain another intermediate value of routing store also for calibrating purposes the value of x5 plays an important role in simulating the relationship between the studied basin and its neighbors if x5 is less than 1 the basin loses water otherwise it gains water from its surrounding basins x5 in the original gr2m model configuration which is a loss or gain constant parameter averaged using the entire record span of the basin is used to modify the level of routing store from r1 to r2 q the produced runoff is a function of the routing store r2 fig 1a the final routing store r propagated in the next monthly time step is calculated as r2 q the gr2m model a version of the original gr2m incorporating a snow component has four calibrated parameters x1 and x5 of the original gr2m in addition to two parameters similar to xu et al 1996 a1 and a2 where a1 a2 fig 1b a1 is the temperature limit above which the cumulative snow in the additional snow reservoir starts to melt while a2 is the temperature limit below which the precipitation falls as snow the model starts by separating the falling total precipitation tp to snowfall sn and direct rainfall rd based on comparing monthly mean temperature t with a1 the snowfall is added to a snow reservoir which may release a portion of its storage as snowmelt m according to the snowmelt formula which compares the monthly mean temperature t with a2 the available water p which is the combination of direct rainfall rd and snowmelt m represents the available water input to the original gr2m with the same flow diagram as described previously 2 2 the proposed gr2m with seasonal component gr2m sc the new modifications to the original gr2m model are described hereafter the main reason behind the proposed modification is driven by the conclusions of fathi et al 2019 that showed that the gr2m s residuals suffer from seasonality with very high errors during the peak flow months and relatively smaller errors in the base flow months this might appear logical as errors are usually proportional to the recorded values however if this modification helps improve the overall model performance then it is justified the gr2m model is modified by extending it with a seasonal component sc and the model is hereafter termed gr2m sc the seasonal component is introduced by allowing x5 to vary from month to month instead of retaining a fixed value throughout the year in order to avoid twelve x5 parameters a proposed modification of the x5 parameter named monthly x5 mx5 is calculated to take the same seasonal pattern of the average monthly hydrograph as described below first the mean monthly hydrograph is estimated from the calibration stage of the dataset the standardized monthly hydrograph smh represents some kind of standardization that is a modified version of the hydrograph commonly standardization of a series aims to have a mean of zero but it was found to be better to have the mx5 with a mean close to the original gr2m x5 in order to compare with previous values of gr2m x5 similar approaches could be found in hedrick 2005 mohamad and usman 2013 smh can be estimated in two steps first the average monthly hydrograph is estimated from the long term observed monthly runoff values based on the calibration portion which is then divided by the value of the monthly peak runoff to ensure a constant range between 0 and 1 for all stations second the mean of the resulting curve is shifted to have a mean of unity refer to smh curve in fig 2 further discussion about the aim to retain the mean as one is elaborated in the discussion section in order to provide further flexibility to the gr2m sc model a new parameter h is introduced which is an exponent parameter for the smh mx5 a vector of twelve values is then obtained by multiplying the smh raised to the h exponent by the calibrated parameter x5n fig 2 it should also be noted that the new calibrated value of x5n is close to x5 in the original gr2m model as the mean of the smh is equal to one in fact the h exponent parameter adjusts mx5 relative to the smh ratios if mx5 exaggerates the smh h will take values greater than 1 on the other hand if mx5 is constant like it is with the original x5 h will take a value of zero this configuration has the advantage of having one parameter only to calibrate instead of calibrating a vector of twelve x5 parameter the mx5 is therefore formulated as follows 1 mx 5 smh h x 5 n where mx5 is a vector of twelve values smh is also a vector of twelve values representing the standardized monthly hydrograph h is the exponent parameter and x5n is a new parameter equivalent to the second calibrated parameter x5 of the gr2m model 2 3 model evaluation a split sampling technique is used to evaluate the performance of the model dobbin and simon 2011 developed a non parametric algorithm for determining optimal splitting that can be applied with a specific dataset and classifier algorithm they found that the commonly used strategy of allocating two thirds of cases for training was close to optimal for reasonable sized datasets n 100 therefore a portion of 66 of the dataset is used to calibrate model parameters while the remaining 34 portion is used for validation several performance criteria are used in this study to compare between the simulated and observed monthly runoffs the criteria include the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 krause and boyle 2005 the bias and the root mean squared error rmse legates and mccabe 1999 given by the equations in table 1 all coding is done in python 3 7 6 using scipy for optimization processes deily 2019 the slsqp solver which uses the sequential least squares programming kraft 1988 is used to minimize the objective function of the performance criteria with the ability to add boundary constrains for each variable maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency one of the most commonly used criteria for model evaluation is the objective function used to calibrate model parameters moriasi et al 2007 delimiting the model performance to four different categories according to nse values classified it into unsatisfactory nse 0 50 acceptable 0 50 nse 0 65 good 0 65 nse 0 75 and very good 0 75 nse 1 00 2 4 seasonality evaluation it is known that most hydrological variables are subject to significant seasonality which usually leads to seasonal dependence between model residuals li et al 2013 from a time series approach perspective the residuals of a perfect model should be uncorrelated and follow white noise the autocorrelation function acf is a powerful tool with which to examine the correlation between residuals although it does not provide a formal measure of seasonality various quantitative approaches assess the degree of seasonality magno et al 2017 one of these is to decompose the residuals series into three different components trend t seasonal s and residual res components using the classical decomposition method the measure of seasonality fs provided in eq 2 provides the amplitude of seasonal strength for a given series wang et al 2006 2 fs m a x 0 1 var r e s v a r s r e s fs ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 refers to a series with a very strong seasonality the variable s represents the repeated cyclic behavior of a series it could be estimated as the repeated seasonal here monthly average i e the same twelve values of monthly average repeated for the number of available years of record kalekar 2004 the residuals res are the remaining values after subtracting the previously estimated seasonal component from the original series 3 study area and data sources to confidently evaluate the performance of a hydrological model an extensive dataset with different climates and hydrological conditions is required a monthly climate dataset which provides monthly minimum and maximum temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration was derived for 1469 catchments in the united states from the hydro climatic data network hcdn compiled by vogel and sankarasubramanian 2015 temperature and precipitation data were estimated using the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1997 while the potential evapotranspiration data were obtained using the method introduced by hargreaves and samani 1982 prism was originally developed to generate gridded maps of climatic parameters such as temperature precipitation and snowfall at the annual and monthly time scales taking terrain slopes into account for further description about prism method refer to daly et al 1994 for each catchment from the hcdn the natural streamflow measurements without any human influences are obtained from the usgs slack et al 1993 the hcdn is a valuable database which was previously used for various hydrological research studies over the continental usa e g martinez and gupta 2010 chinnayakanahalli et al 2011 petersen et al 2012 for this study 710 stations were selected for which the data cover a consecutive 40 years period from 1951 to 1990 fig 3 the selection mainly aims to cover various climatic conditions and different catchment criteria table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the catchments dataset the aridity index œÜ which is the ratio between potential evapotranspiration to precipitation ranges from 0 33 to 5 9 ponce et al 2000 introduced a classification for catchment climatic regimes based on the value of the aridity index where hyper humid humid sub humid semi arid and arid regions are defined by the aridity index ranges of 0 1875 œÜ 0 375 0 375 œÜ 0 75 0 75 œÜ 2 2 œÜ 5 and 5 œÜ 12 respectively mean annual precipitation ranges from 310 mm to 2550 mm with a runoff to precipitation ratio of 0 01 to 0 96 snow has a significant effect on a substantial proportion of the studied catchments with 50 having an annual cumulative snow depth of more than 1017 mm 4 results results are presented in four main sub sections the first describes the evaluation of the original gr2m and gr2m models to be a benchmark for the gr2m sc model the second the main contribution of this study illustrates the modifications introduced to gr2m in detail and gives a full description of its performance the third sub section presents a comparison between the results of the gr2m sc model and the original gr2m and gr2m used as benchmark models the last sub section summarizes how the h exponent for the gr2m sc model is estimated using regression analysis 4 1 application of the original gr2m model data are monthly precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff series two initial values are defined for both reservoirs 200 mm and 30 mm for the soil moisture reservoir and routing reservoir respectively to eliminate any impact associated with these initial values huard and mailhot 2008 recommended to introduce a warm up period of 12 months consequently the dataset is divided into three subsets i the warm up period from january 1951 to december 1951 ii the calibration period from january 1952 to may 1977 and iii the validation period from june 1977 to december 1990 the calibration procedure is applied based on maximizing the nse criterion between the simulated and observed monthly runoff series this dataset division is applied to the calibration processes of other models as well x1 and x5 are allowed to vary in the range of 10 10000 and 0 05 2 respectively the spatial distribution of the nse of the calibration dataset for the gr2m is presented in fig 4 more than 50 of the stations are classified as exhibiting good to very good performance while almost 35 produced unsatisfactory results fig 4 shows that stations with very good performance are located within the eastern mountains and the atlantic coastal plains as well as the narrow western costal area while the stations with unsatisfactory performance are concentrated in the drier central regions and across the entire northern snowy regions the poorest performance in the snowy climates is justified because the gr2m was not originally developed for such conditions the maximum capacity of the soil moisture reservoir x1 parameter ranges between 175 mm and 3800 mm for the 5 and the 95 percentiles respectively with a median value of 417 mm fig 5 a the water exchange term x5 parameter ranges between 0 65 and 1 4 for the 5 and the 95 percentiles fig 5b more than 30 of basins with x5 1 are considered leaky basins the central drier regions are subject to extensive variation of both x1 and x5 while the east half of the usa show more homogeneity and less variability 4 2 application of the gr2m in addition to the data required for the original gr2m model monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration mean monthly temperature is required to apply the gr2m model with snow capability the mean monthly temperature data which are not readily available from hcdn are approximated to be the average of maximum and minimum temperature series the initial values for the three reservoirs are set to be 200 mm 30 mm 40 mm for soil moisture reservoir routing reservoir and snow reservoir respectively to increase the speed of the optimization process the initial values of x1 and x5 were set with their calibrated values of the original gr2m model x1 x5 a1 and a2 are allowed to vary in the range of 10 to 10000 0 05 to 2 0 to 6 and 8 to 0 respectively during the calibration process an additional condition was introduced to constrain a1 to be greater than a2 the spatial distribution of the nse of the calibration data for the gr2m is presented in fig 6 almost 65 of the stations nse values are classified as good to very good while almost 20 give unsatisfactory results from fig 6 one can notice that the stations with very good results are located within the eastern mountains and the atlantic coastal plains in the east as well as the western narrow costal area the drier central regions show generally acceptable to good performance although the gr2m is a model with snow capabilities the results show unsatisfactory behavior in some snowy climates especially within northwest corner i e washington and northern midwest i e north dakota south dakota minnesota iowa and wisconsin 4 3 proposed gr2m with seasonal component the gr2m sc model was calibrated using the same procedure as the original gr2m the main difference is that the calibrated parameters are three x1 and x5n in addition to h which is allowed to vary in the range of 1 3 to expedite the optimization process the initial values of x1 and x5n were set to their calibrated values from the original gr2m model the spatial distribution of the calibrated nse for the gr2m sc is presented in fig 7 almost 80 of these are classified as good to very good compared to 60 in gr2m model while only 9 of total stations produced unsatisfactory results in general stations with good and very good results are spread across the usa while approximately 60 with unsatisfactory nse values are concentrated in the northern midwest states including minnesota and north and south dakota this area was subject to ice jam flooding events that led to fluctuations in the runoff hydrograph peak timing various historic ice jam events occurred in north dakota in 1952 1972 1975 1976 1978 and 1986 wuebben and gagnon 1995 and in south dakota in 1952 1962 1969 and 1979 south dakota state 2014 minnesota river which is a tributary of the mississippi river was stricken with several ice jam floods especially in 1971 and 1972 elmer 1972 it is known that water balance models are not developed to simulate hydraulic triggered phenomenon of ice cover breakup floods the freedom of the h exponent parameter is constrained during the calibration process between 1 to 3 h values ranged from 0 14 to 2 3 for the 5 and the 95 percentiles respectively with a median value of 0 5 stations with high h values of 3 or more are found in the region where the model shows unsatisfactory results especially north dakota fig 8 a relatively high values are common in the northern snowy climates as well as on the tops of mountains within the drier central regions small negative h values concentrate in the west narrow coastal region in addition a limited number of stations with low negative h values are located at the piedmont of the appalachian mountains low lands the east half of the usa except the northern snowy parts shows low positive h values with spatial consistency it should be noted that there is a strong relationship between the h exponent parameter and the annual cumulative snow to obtain reliable indication of this relationship only stations with good and very good nse values 0 65 are shown in the scatterplot there is a correlation of 0 71 between the h exponent parameter and the annual cumulative snow fig 8b one of the main advantages of the gr2m sc model is its ability to use any type of seasonal hydrologic series other than the standardized monthly hydrograph smh which produced the highest performance in our current research a further alternative the mean precipitation series was investigated using the same procedure but the results showed a worse performance than using the hydrograph judging by the average of the 710 stations the average nse of the calibration portion for the gr2m sc using the average monthly flow hydrograph and the average monthly precipitation are 0 72 and 0 60 respectively the same conclusion was also obtained using different series such as mean monthly temperature and the soil moisture storage it should be noted that for a number of stations the model using the standardized soil moisture storage gave higher performance than using the smh however the latter performs better on the average for the entire dataset 4 4 estimation of the h exponent parameter the gr2m sc model which shows high performance in simulating monthly runoff across all 710 stations is having 3 calibrated parameters x1 x5n and the h exponent to reduce the number of parameters of the model back to 2 the following procedure is used to estimate the h exponent to obtain reliable indication and eliminate the effects of unsatisfactory stations only stations with at least acceptable performance nse 0 50 were further investigated recent hydrological studies have shown that there is an influence of climatic classification on the overall catchment runoff behavior berghuijs et al 2014 knoben et al 2018 k√∂ppen geiger climate classification developed by wladimir k√∂ppen is the first and most widely used climate classification kottek et al 2006 this classification was constructed based on three different levels climate zones according to vegetation type precipitation and temperature there are five climate zones a equatorial b arid c warm temperate d snow and e polar the following level represents the precipitation with six classes which range from w desert to f fully humid the third level is about temperature with eight classes from h hot arid to t polar kottek et al 2006 the k√∂ppen geiger climate classification map fig 9 a is introduced as a categorical predictor along with the annual cumulative snow variable nevertheless it is cumbersome to investigate the original k√∂ppen geiger with 31 zones in the usa which means 33 parameters in the regression model consequently we opted to reduce the number of zones via merging similar zones together which leads to the modified version of the map with only 6 climate zones fig 9b in this study we used a regression equation with continuous and categorical explanatory variables to estimate the h exponent continuous exogenous variables such as the annual cumulative snow the annual precipitation and the aridity index were tested as potential explanatory variables the climatic classification was added to the model in the form of a categorical variable the different climatic classifications were embedded in the regression equation as dummy variables in which a binary variable 0 or 1 represents each category of the six regions of the k√∂ppen geiger classification g1 g6 relative to the first one g1 as reference category plackett 1974 anderson 1984 allen 2004 shown in the following equation 3 y Œ± j 1 j Œ≤ j x j k 1 k 1 Œ≥ k d k Œµ where y is the dependent variable which represents the parameter h exponent j represents the number of continuous independent variables x k is the total number of clusters of the explanatory categorical variable d k refers to the k th dummy variable categorical regions of the k√∂ppen geiger classification Œµ is the error term and Œ± Œ≤ a n d Œ≥ are the regression coefficients for the intercept the continuous variable and the categorical independent variable respectively as previously concluded there is a clear relationship between the h exponent and the annual cumulative snow a regression model was tested to predict the h exponent based on the annual cumulative snow as the only explanatory variable the model had a low r2 of 0 43 various variables other than the annual cumulative snow such as runoff to precipitation r p ratio annual precipitation and aridity index are also introduced however the model performance is marginally increased for all trials with a maximum r2 of 0 51 for each catchment the k√∂ppen geiger classification g1 g6 and the mean annual cumulative snow in mm were input to a regression model with categorical variables the results of which are summarized in table 3 the incorporation of the k√∂ppen geiger classification is valuable to the regression model as r2 increased to 0 66 based on the p values the coefficients relative to annual snow cumulative the intercept variable and all six classifications of the modified k√∂ppen geiger map are statistically significant the results confirm the previous conclusions about the strong relationship between climate classification and catchment runoff responses to evaluate the overall accuracy of the regression model applications it was the developed regression model is used to estimate the h exponent values for all stations which are then used as fixed values in the gr2m sc model the advantage of this step is that the estimation of h conserves the simplicity of the developed model by calibrating only two parameters x1 and x5n fig 10 shows the performance nse values using the h values estimated by regression against the model with h as a free parameter to calibrate the performance slightly decreases from 0 76 to 0 75 for the mean nse in the calibration portion on the contrary the mean value of the nse of the validation portion is the same and there is a very limited number of stations where the nse values significantly decreased the overall accuracy of this step is adequate to maintain the simplicity of the gr2m sc applicability in the usa 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between the gr2m sc with previous gr2m models the comparison is presented in three steps in the first step the calibrated parameters x1 and x5 x5n are compared to investigate the impact of the inclusion of the new h exponent on the main two parameters of the original model the second step aims to illustrate the performance of each model based on the five investigated criteria kge nse r2 bias and rmse the number of stations in each classification unsatisfactory acceptable good and very good is also presented in the third step the seasonal dependence between model residuals is used to assess the gr2m sc model relative to the original model fig 11 shows scatterplots for x1 and x5 x5n where the gr2m sc model tends to slightly overestimate the small values of x1 parameter less than 2500 on the contrary the values of x5n parameter of the gr2m sc model are slightly lower than the x5 values of the original model the large differences occurred in a very limited number of stations compared to the total number of 710 stations the standardized monthly hydrograph with a mean equal to unity is the main reason for the values of x5n being very similar to their x5 values in the original gr2m model without this step it would be expected to have significant differences between the x5 and x5n values in both models the values of x1 and x5 of the gr2m were also compared relative to their values of the original gr2m model the values of x1 parameter are very similar in both models while gr2m model tends to slightly overestimate the values of x5 parameter compared to the original gr2m model table 4 shows the evaluation statistics for all three models the values are estimated as the average of the 710 stations for both calibration and validation stages the gr2m sc model shows improvements in the five investigated performance criteria compared to both the original gr2m and gr2m models in the validation stage the kge increased from 0 57 for the original gr2m model to 0 67 and 0 73 for the gr2m and gr2m sc models respectively for the calibration stage the nse increased from 0 56 for the original gr2m model to 0 65 and 0 72 for the gr2m and gr2m sc models respectively furthermore calibrated r2 values improved from 0 58 to 0 73 for gr2m and gr2m sc respectively the gr2m model gives negative bias of 1 55 higher than both gr2m and gr2m sc whereas the latter shows the least bias 0 09 there are obvious improvements in both calibration and validation according to rmse for the gr2m sc compared to the original gr2m and gr2m models the nse and r2 values of both gr2m and gr2m sc are similar for the validation dataset these improvements are also reflected in the classification of nse values according to figs 4 6 and 7 the number of stations with very good performance increased from 240 with the gr2m model to 304 and 400 for the gr2m and gr2m sc respectively the stations with unsatisfactory nse values decreased from almost 35 to 19 and to 9 for thegr2m gr2m and gr2m sc models respectively as previously mentioned a large percentage of stations with unsatisfactory results from the gr2m sc are concentrated in a region with frequent ice jams which should not be considered a disadvantage for the gr2m sc model fig 12 shows a boxplot and a scatterplot representing of strengths of seasonality of the residuals of the three models in general the residuals of gr2m sc show lower seasonality compared to those of the gr2m and gr2m models this was one of the main objectives of this study the median of the gr2m sc values is 0 127 which is smaller than the 25 percentile of the original gr2m model with value of 0 144 the average of fs values for gr2m is twice the corresponding value for the gr2m sc model the scatterplot shows also that gr2m generally reduces the seasonality of the stations that show high seasonality in the original gr2m model however gr2m sc obviously reduces the strength of seasonality for almost all stations 5 2 strengths and limitations of the gr2m sc model the comparison between the gr2m sc and the gr2m models according to various hydrological variables that are not included in the model is valuable in enhancing our knowledge of the proposed model and it clearly produces higher performance compared to the original gr2m model fig 13 compares the nse of the calibrated portion for both models according to the aridity index the annual cumulative snow depth and the r p ratio the charts are plotted with a restricted range of nse between 0 50 to 1 0 from the comparison it will be noticed that the gr2m sc model clearly shows a better performance compared to the gr2m model especially for the sub humid catchments where the aridity index ranges between 0 75 and 2 there are no clear differences between the gr2m and gr2m sc models for aridity index values higher than 3 5 there is clear improvement in the nse for stations with annual cumulative snow depth higher than 200 cm year using the gr2m sc model and the gr2m sc model still suffers from low performance for very low r p ratios less than 0 1 yet still performs better than the original gr2m model 5 3 effects of different calibration and validation split samplings it is acceptable to evaluate the performance of hydrological models through splitting the available dataset into two sub sets for calibration and validation various studies have defined different techniques for calibration and validation split sampling li et al 2012 shen et al 2022 however there is no widely acknowledged technique for such splitting biondi et al 2012 liu et al 2018 one of the early techniques was introduced by kleme≈° 1986 who recommended to split the dataset into two split sample sets where the calibration process is applied twice with each split sample and the remaining sub set is used for validation as shown by li et al 2012 this method can be used to evaluate models under non stationary conditions where the model is judged robust under non stationarity if it shows acceptable performance for both validation processes li et al 2012 in the same line merz et al 2011 recommended to evaluate the stability of the calibrated parameters based on different split sampling consequently the gr2m and gr2m sc models were retested using the last 26 years for warm up and calibration and the first 14 years for validation sub split ‚Ö± fig 14 shows the scatterplots of the calibrated parameters based on both split samples along with the nse values as a performance criterion for gr2m and gr2m sc in the second split sampling setting the majority of the investigated stations show robust behavior of the parameters in both gr2m and gr2m sc while only a limited number of stations less than 5 exhibit deviations in the estimated values calibrated and validated nse values show similar patterns in both gr2m and gr2m sc although the validated nse values show larger spread the mean validated nse is almost the same based on both split samples with variation of less than 2 5 4 a new meaning of the mx5 parameter the x5 parameter of the original gr2m model was defined as a single fixed value representing an estimate of the water exchange with the outside environment mouelhi et al 2006 this fixed value prevents the gr2m model from modelling the inter annual behavior of the catchment and does not allow the catchment to modify throughout the year its gain or loss from or to its neighboring environments whether there is an unaccounted for hydrological component such as groundwater storage or other catchments this fixed value may be one of the reasons for the high seasonality of the monthly residuals of the model on the contrary with the introduction of the seasonally variable water exchange mx5 values this study provides a new and more flexible concept by allowing the catchment to gain water in some seasons and lose water during others this helped to reduce the seasonality of the model residuals at the same time these twelve values of mx5 are obtained by multiplying the smh raised to the h exponent by the calibrated parameter x5n without an increase of the model parameters to twelve independent ones 6 conclusions the main aim of this study was to improve the monthly water balance gr2m model while maintaining its simplicity a dataset consisting of 710 catchments across different climates in the usa was used to test the proposed new model by applying split sampling calibration validation dataset division first the gr2m model with two free parameters x1 and x5 was applied to the usa dataset the results showed high seasonality in model residuals and low performance statistics in almost 35 of the stations especially in snowy climates furthermore a four parameter variant of the gr2m gr2m with snow capabilities was also tested on the same dataset the gr2m performance increased in many regions in the usa with a percentage of stations with unsatisfactory performance decreasing to 19 however the strength of seasonality of model residuals decreased only slightly compared to the original gr2m model to overcome this seasonality issue to maintain the original gr2m number of parameters and to improve the overall performance behavior the current research extended the gr2m model with a seasonal component instead of using a fixed value of the water exchange x5 parameter throughout the year a vector of twelve values mx5 was introduced linked to the standardized monthly flow hydrograph to allow the gr2m sc model to simulate a catchment with different gain and or loss components during specific months of the year to conserve the parsimony of the gr2m the gr2m sc was developed using only one additional h exponent parameter the gr2m sc model reduced the strength of seasonality compared to both gr2m and gr2m models the percentage of stations with unsatisfactory performance also dropped to only 9 where most of these stations were subject to frequent ice jams with high performance in most of the climatic zones the benefits of our proposed gr2m sc model depicted from spatial diagnostic analysis of model performance and parameters include the gr2m sc model clearly outperforms both gr2m and gr2m models in all performance criteria with reduced seasonality of the model residuals the gr2m sc model is generally robust with comparable evaluation statistics in calibration and validation data portions there is a clear improvement in the nse for stations with annual cumulative snow depths higher than 200 cm year using the gr2m sc model the gr2m sc model still suffers from low performance for very low r p ratios less than 0 1 however it still performs slightly better than the original gr2m model a regression model is developed using as inputs the cumulative annual sow depth and the k√∂ppen geiger climate classification and can be used to infer the value of the additional h exponent parameter to revert back to a two free parameter model with almost no reduction in overall performance statistics the calibrated x1 and x5n parameters of the gr2m sc model are very similar to their values in the original gr2m which indicates that the h exponent does not alter the essence of the model structure the proposed model does not require a snow classification identification process while many other snow models require a classification technique to differentiate between snowy and non snowy catchments to initiate the application of the snow component furthermore no substantial rarely available data are required such as snowmelt rate and or detailed temperature data this allows the possibility to use the gr2m sc model in climate change studies credit authorship contribution

2315,monthly water balance models are valuable tools in water resources management unfortunately most of these models suffer from structure complexity large data requirements occasionally low performance in simulating runoff high seasonality of model residuals and or limited application in snow climates by adding a seasonal component sc this study aims 1 to enhance the performance of the parsimonious gr2m monthly model with only two free parameters and 2 to increase its applicability in snow climates without any further data requirements as only precipitation and potential evapotranspiration monthly series are required to predict monthly runoff the proposed model is examined at the catchment scale using 710 stations from the hydro climatic data network selected to cover various climatic conditions across the continental united states various performance criteria are calculated to compare the proposed gr2m sc model with the original gr2m such as the nash sutcliffe and kling gupta efficiencies the coefficient of determination root mean square error and bias two split sample sets are used to calibrate and validate the models the calibration process is applied once using the first two thirds of the dataset and again using the last two thirds and each time the remaining sub set is used for validation purposes furthermore a seasonality measure is calculated to estimate the strength of seasonality in model residuals the proposed gr2m sc model clearly outperforms the original gr2m model as well as gr2m which is an improved 4 parameter version of the gr2m model with capabilities for handling snow accumulation and snowmelt the seasonality of the proposed model residuals was also reduced keywords gr2m gr2m sc snow model seasonality of model residuals k√∂ppen geiger climate classification hydro climatic data network usa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water balance models wbm have been developed and improved to increase hydrological knowledge at the catchment scale such models have been proved efficient for many basic and advanced applications jarboe and haan 1974 schaake and liu 1989 maier and dandy 2000 leta et al 2016 abdollahi et al 2018 tian et al 2018 jiang and wang 2019 at various temporal timescales from hourly to annual xu and singh 1998 among them monthly wbms have recently received increasing attention due to the limited requirement for input data and the long history of development spanning decades bai et al 2015 the comparison between these models is usually based on two factors overall behavior in simulating monthly runoff which may be represented using performance criteria and model complexity this complexity varies from very complex models such as wilk and hughes 2002 model with twelve parameters to simple two parameter models such as xm and gr2m models xiong and guo 1999 mouelhi et al 2006 it should be noted that over parameterized models are not recommended due to over fitting and prediction deviation issues whittaker et al 2010 beven 1993 introduced the concept of equifinality in hydrological research which refers to the complex models with a high number of parameters reproducing the same outputs based on different combinations of model parameters khatami et al 2019 one of the most efficient wbms is the parent scheme which was re introduced and known as the gr5m model mouelhi et al 2006 gr5m is a two storage model with five calibrated parameters from x1 to x5 where x1 represents the maximum capacity of soil moisture storage x2 is a time step factor to represent the new soil moisture storage based on its value of the previous month x3 is a component for partitioning the precipitation to routing storage and direct runoff x4 is the routing storage capacity and x5 is a water exchange term in order to develop a more parsimonious model mouelhi et al 2006 succeeded to reduce the complexity of the gr5m by identifying the most effective parameters as a result a two parameter model was developed with only x1 and x5 it should be noted that there were previous versions of gr2m developed by kabouya 1990 kabouya and michel 1991 makhlouf 1994 makhlouf and michel 1994 and mouelhi 2003 the version modified in this research is that of mouelhi et al 2006 which appears to be the latest and most efficient when compared to other versions ditthakit et al 2021 another key component in reviewing wbms is their capability to account for snow accumulation and to represent snowmelt in fact several wbms give poor results in snowy regions motoyama 1983 martinez and gupta 2010 as a result many wbms have been modeled with a snow component using different measures of temperature a snowmelt rate and a snow accumulation reservoir ishii et al 2004 mccabe and markstrom 2007 martinez and gupta 2010 tayefeh neskili et al 2017 martinez and gupta 2010 extended the abcd model which was initially developed by thomas 1981 with four calibrated parameters to take snow into account by adding three additional calibrated parameters the results of the abcd snow model based on seven calibrated parameters show high performance especially for basins where snow is a major contributor within the hydrological cycle wagner et al 2017 also extended the gr2m model with a snow component developed by xu et al 1996 the proposed model known as gr2m was developed by introducing an additional snow storage with two additional calibrated parameters making the gr2m a four parameter model the gr2m was successfully applied on 101 catchments within the greater alpine region with an average nash sutcliff efficiency nse of almost 0 75 however in this research as will be presented later the gr2m showed lower performance based on a larger scale dataset of 710 stations covering various climatic conditions across the united states thus the gr2m may still suffer some of the shortcomings of the gr2m model upon which it was based further discussion is elaborated in the results and discussion section a comprehensive comparative study by bai et al 2015 focused on evaluating twelve previously published monthly wbms with 2 3 4 and 5 parameters in different climatic regions in china both gr5m and gr2m models were among the models examined and the results showed that gr5m performed best followed by gr2m ahead of all 12 models the gr2m model performed better than models with three four and five calibrated parameters consequently the gr2m is considered as the benchmark for many studies due to its simplicity and performance in capturing monthly runoff the gr2m model was also applied in basins in south america lavado casimiro et al 2011 asia lyon et al 2017 ma et al 2019 europe lespinas et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 africa lacombe et al 2016 fathi et al 2019 north america huard and mailhot 2008 and finally in australia fathi et al 2019 using a dataset of six rivers worldwide fathi et al 2019 recently compared the gr2m model to one based on an extension of the budyko equation using time series the results showed that the gr2m performance was lower than the extended budyko framework furthermore the residuals of the gr2m model had a strong seasonal behavior it should be noted that the comparison between the hybrid sarimax budyko model with six free parameters and the gr2m model with only two parameters is not reasonable from a parsimony of parameters point of view because a simple model such as the gr2m remains extremely valuable for applications involving climate change especially if the seasonality of the model residuals is minimized and its performance improved the objective of the present study is therefore to improve the gr2m model focusing on 1 increasing its performance in simulating monthly runoff 2 improving its applicability in snowy regions and 3 decreasing the seasonality of the residuals these objectives need to be achieved while conserving the simplicity and parsimony of the model which is the novel approach of this study 2 methodology and model evaluation discussion of the methodology starts by presenting the two parameter gr2m model and the four parameters gr2m model next we focus on the proposed additional parameter that is introduced to the original gr2m to achieve the study objectives lastly model evaluation criteria are introduced as is a method to evaluate the seasonality of the model residuals 2 1 the original gr2m and gr2m models the gr2m water balance model uses two different reservoirs to represent the monthly rainfall runoff transformation within each basin fig 1 a the first reservoir represents a soil moisture reservoir with maximum capacity of x1 calibrated parameter in mm while the second is a quadratic routing reservoir with a maximum capacity of 60 mm the relationship between the routing reservoir with the groundwater or the outside environment of the catchment is governed by a second calibrated parameter x5 a positive non dimensional parameter fig 1a presents the main flow diagram of the gr2m model with all its governing equations the model starts by partitioning the precipitation into a precipitation depth that enters into the soil to increase the initial moisture storage from s to s1 with a maximum capacity for this production store of x1 and the remaining precipitation is considered as an excess precipitation p1 part of the water storage is lost due to evapotranspiration reducing the soil moisture production storage from s1 to s2 the soil moisture remaining in the production store is calculated as a function of s2 and x1 to help determine whether it remains within the soil moisture production store or is released from the soil as p2 p2 then combines with p1 forming the flow input p3 that goes into the routing store increasing the level of routing store from r to r1 which is an intermediate value of routing store used for calculation purposes only this later storage has a maximum limit of 60 mm r1 is then multiplied by x5 to obtain another intermediate value of routing store also for calibrating purposes the value of x5 plays an important role in simulating the relationship between the studied basin and its neighbors if x5 is less than 1 the basin loses water otherwise it gains water from its surrounding basins x5 in the original gr2m model configuration which is a loss or gain constant parameter averaged using the entire record span of the basin is used to modify the level of routing store from r1 to r2 q the produced runoff is a function of the routing store r2 fig 1a the final routing store r propagated in the next monthly time step is calculated as r2 q the gr2m model a version of the original gr2m incorporating a snow component has four calibrated parameters x1 and x5 of the original gr2m in addition to two parameters similar to xu et al 1996 a1 and a2 where a1 a2 fig 1b a1 is the temperature limit above which the cumulative snow in the additional snow reservoir starts to melt while a2 is the temperature limit below which the precipitation falls as snow the model starts by separating the falling total precipitation tp to snowfall sn and direct rainfall rd based on comparing monthly mean temperature t with a1 the snowfall is added to a snow reservoir which may release a portion of its storage as snowmelt m according to the snowmelt formula which compares the monthly mean temperature t with a2 the available water p which is the combination of direct rainfall rd and snowmelt m represents the available water input to the original gr2m with the same flow diagram as described previously 2 2 the proposed gr2m with seasonal component gr2m sc the new modifications to the original gr2m model are described hereafter the main reason behind the proposed modification is driven by the conclusions of fathi et al 2019 that showed that the gr2m s residuals suffer from seasonality with very high errors during the peak flow months and relatively smaller errors in the base flow months this might appear logical as errors are usually proportional to the recorded values however if this modification helps improve the overall model performance then it is justified the gr2m model is modified by extending it with a seasonal component sc and the model is hereafter termed gr2m sc the seasonal component is introduced by allowing x5 to vary from month to month instead of retaining a fixed value throughout the year in order to avoid twelve x5 parameters a proposed modification of the x5 parameter named monthly x5 mx5 is calculated to take the same seasonal pattern of the average monthly hydrograph as described below first the mean monthly hydrograph is estimated from the calibration stage of the dataset the standardized monthly hydrograph smh represents some kind of standardization that is a modified version of the hydrograph commonly standardization of a series aims to have a mean of zero but it was found to be better to have the mx5 with a mean close to the original gr2m x5 in order to compare with previous values of gr2m x5 similar approaches could be found in hedrick 2005 mohamad and usman 2013 smh can be estimated in two steps first the average monthly hydrograph is estimated from the long term observed monthly runoff values based on the calibration portion which is then divided by the value of the monthly peak runoff to ensure a constant range between 0 and 1 for all stations second the mean of the resulting curve is shifted to have a mean of unity refer to smh curve in fig 2 further discussion about the aim to retain the mean as one is elaborated in the discussion section in order to provide further flexibility to the gr2m sc model a new parameter h is introduced which is an exponent parameter for the smh mx5 a vector of twelve values is then obtained by multiplying the smh raised to the h exponent by the calibrated parameter x5n fig 2 it should also be noted that the new calibrated value of x5n is close to x5 in the original gr2m model as the mean of the smh is equal to one in fact the h exponent parameter adjusts mx5 relative to the smh ratios if mx5 exaggerates the smh h will take values greater than 1 on the other hand if mx5 is constant like it is with the original x5 h will take a value of zero this configuration has the advantage of having one parameter only to calibrate instead of calibrating a vector of twelve x5 parameter the mx5 is therefore formulated as follows 1 mx 5 smh h x 5 n where mx5 is a vector of twelve values smh is also a vector of twelve values representing the standardized monthly hydrograph h is the exponent parameter and x5n is a new parameter equivalent to the second calibrated parameter x5 of the gr2m model 2 3 model evaluation a split sampling technique is used to evaluate the performance of the model dobbin and simon 2011 developed a non parametric algorithm for determining optimal splitting that can be applied with a specific dataset and classifier algorithm they found that the commonly used strategy of allocating two thirds of cases for training was close to optimal for reasonable sized datasets n 100 therefore a portion of 66 of the dataset is used to calibrate model parameters while the remaining 34 portion is used for validation several performance criteria are used in this study to compare between the simulated and observed monthly runoffs the criteria include the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 krause and boyle 2005 the bias and the root mean squared error rmse legates and mccabe 1999 given by the equations in table 1 all coding is done in python 3 7 6 using scipy for optimization processes deily 2019 the slsqp solver which uses the sequential least squares programming kraft 1988 is used to minimize the objective function of the performance criteria with the ability to add boundary constrains for each variable maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency one of the most commonly used criteria for model evaluation is the objective function used to calibrate model parameters moriasi et al 2007 delimiting the model performance to four different categories according to nse values classified it into unsatisfactory nse 0 50 acceptable 0 50 nse 0 65 good 0 65 nse 0 75 and very good 0 75 nse 1 00 2 4 seasonality evaluation it is known that most hydrological variables are subject to significant seasonality which usually leads to seasonal dependence between model residuals li et al 2013 from a time series approach perspective the residuals of a perfect model should be uncorrelated and follow white noise the autocorrelation function acf is a powerful tool with which to examine the correlation between residuals although it does not provide a formal measure of seasonality various quantitative approaches assess the degree of seasonality magno et al 2017 one of these is to decompose the residuals series into three different components trend t seasonal s and residual res components using the classical decomposition method the measure of seasonality fs provided in eq 2 provides the amplitude of seasonal strength for a given series wang et al 2006 2 fs m a x 0 1 var r e s v a r s r e s fs ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 refers to a series with a very strong seasonality the variable s represents the repeated cyclic behavior of a series it could be estimated as the repeated seasonal here monthly average i e the same twelve values of monthly average repeated for the number of available years of record kalekar 2004 the residuals res are the remaining values after subtracting the previously estimated seasonal component from the original series 3 study area and data sources to confidently evaluate the performance of a hydrological model an extensive dataset with different climates and hydrological conditions is required a monthly climate dataset which provides monthly minimum and maximum temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration was derived for 1469 catchments in the united states from the hydro climatic data network hcdn compiled by vogel and sankarasubramanian 2015 temperature and precipitation data were estimated using the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1997 while the potential evapotranspiration data were obtained using the method introduced by hargreaves and samani 1982 prism was originally developed to generate gridded maps of climatic parameters such as temperature precipitation and snowfall at the annual and monthly time scales taking terrain slopes into account for further description about prism method refer to daly et al 1994 for each catchment from the hcdn the natural streamflow measurements without any human influences are obtained from the usgs slack et al 1993 the hcdn is a valuable database which was previously used for various hydrological research studies over the continental usa e g martinez and gupta 2010 chinnayakanahalli et al 2011 petersen et al 2012 for this study 710 stations were selected for which the data cover a consecutive 40 years period from 1951 to 1990 fig 3 the selection mainly aims to cover various climatic conditions and different catchment criteria table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the catchments dataset the aridity index œÜ which is the ratio between potential evapotranspiration to precipitation ranges from 0 33 to 5 9 ponce et al 2000 introduced a classification for catchment climatic regimes based on the value of the aridity index where hyper humid humid sub humid semi arid and arid regions are defined by the aridity index ranges of 0 1875 œÜ 0 375 0 375 œÜ 0 75 0 75 œÜ 2 2 œÜ 5 and 5 œÜ 12 respectively mean annual precipitation ranges from 310 mm to 2550 mm with a runoff to precipitation ratio of 0 01 to 0 96 snow has a significant effect on a substantial proportion of the studied catchments with 50 having an annual cumulative snow depth of more than 1017 mm 4 results results are presented in four main sub sections the first describes the evaluation of the original gr2m and gr2m models to be a benchmark for the gr2m sc model the second the main contribution of this study illustrates the modifications introduced to gr2m in detail and gives a full description of its performance the third sub section presents a comparison between the results of the gr2m sc model and the original gr2m and gr2m used as benchmark models the last sub section summarizes how the h exponent for the gr2m sc model is estimated using regression analysis 4 1 application of the original gr2m model data are monthly precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff series two initial values are defined for both reservoirs 200 mm and 30 mm for the soil moisture reservoir and routing reservoir respectively to eliminate any impact associated with these initial values huard and mailhot 2008 recommended to introduce a warm up period of 12 months consequently the dataset is divided into three subsets i the warm up period from january 1951 to december 1951 ii the calibration period from january 1952 to may 1977 and iii the validation period from june 1977 to december 1990 the calibration procedure is applied based on maximizing the nse criterion between the simulated and observed monthly runoff series this dataset division is applied to the calibration processes of other models as well x1 and x5 are allowed to vary in the range of 10 10000 and 0 05 2 respectively the spatial distribution of the nse of the calibration dataset for the gr2m is presented in fig 4 more than 50 of the stations are classified as exhibiting good to very good performance while almost 35 produced unsatisfactory results fig 4 shows that stations with very good performance are located within the eastern mountains and the atlantic coastal plains as well as the narrow western costal area while the stations with unsatisfactory performance are concentrated in the drier central regions and across the entire northern snowy regions the poorest performance in the snowy climates is justified because the gr2m was not originally developed for such conditions the maximum capacity of the soil moisture reservoir x1 parameter ranges between 175 mm and 3800 mm for the 5 and the 95 percentiles respectively with a median value of 417 mm fig 5 a the water exchange term x5 parameter ranges between 0 65 and 1 4 for the 5 and the 95 percentiles fig 5b more than 30 of basins with x5 1 are considered leaky basins the central drier regions are subject to extensive variation of both x1 and x5 while the east half of the usa show more homogeneity and less variability 4 2 application of the gr2m in addition to the data required for the original gr2m model monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration mean monthly temperature is required to apply the gr2m model with snow capability the mean monthly temperature data which are not readily available from hcdn are approximated to be the average of maximum and minimum temperature series the initial values for the three reservoirs are set to be 200 mm 30 mm 40 mm for soil moisture reservoir routing reservoir and snow reservoir respectively to increase the speed of the optimization process the initial values of x1 and x5 were set with their calibrated values of the original gr2m model x1 x5 a1 and a2 are allowed to vary in the range of 10 to 10000 0 05 to 2 0 to 6 and 8 to 0 respectively during the calibration process an additional condition was introduced to constrain a1 to be greater than a2 the spatial distribution of the nse of the calibration data for the gr2m is presented in fig 6 almost 65 of the stations nse values are classified as good to very good while almost 20 give unsatisfactory results from fig 6 one can notice that the stations with very good results are located within the eastern mountains and the atlantic coastal plains in the east as well as the western narrow costal area the drier central regions show generally acceptable to good performance although the gr2m is a model with snow capabilities the results show unsatisfactory behavior in some snowy climates especially within northwest corner i e washington and northern midwest i e north dakota south dakota minnesota iowa and wisconsin 4 3 proposed gr2m with seasonal component the gr2m sc model was calibrated using the same procedure as the original gr2m the main difference is that the calibrated parameters are three x1 and x5n in addition to h which is allowed to vary in the range of 1 3 to expedite the optimization process the initial values of x1 and x5n were set to their calibrated values from the original gr2m model the spatial distribution of the calibrated nse for the gr2m sc is presented in fig 7 almost 80 of these are classified as good to very good compared to 60 in gr2m model while only 9 of total stations produced unsatisfactory results in general stations with good and very good results are spread across the usa while approximately 60 with unsatisfactory nse values are concentrated in the northern midwest states including minnesota and north and south dakota this area was subject to ice jam flooding events that led to fluctuations in the runoff hydrograph peak timing various historic ice jam events occurred in north dakota in 1952 1972 1975 1976 1978 and 1986 wuebben and gagnon 1995 and in south dakota in 1952 1962 1969 and 1979 south dakota state 2014 minnesota river which is a tributary of the mississippi river was stricken with several ice jam floods especially in 1971 and 1972 elmer 1972 it is known that water balance models are not developed to simulate hydraulic triggered phenomenon of ice cover breakup floods the freedom of the h exponent parameter is constrained during the calibration process between 1 to 3 h values ranged from 0 14 to 2 3 for the 5 and the 95 percentiles respectively with a median value of 0 5 stations with high h values of 3 or more are found in the region where the model shows unsatisfactory results especially north dakota fig 8 a relatively high values are common in the northern snowy climates as well as on the tops of mountains within the drier central regions small negative h values concentrate in the west narrow coastal region in addition a limited number of stations with low negative h values are located at the piedmont of the appalachian mountains low lands the east half of the usa except the northern snowy parts shows low positive h values with spatial consistency it should be noted that there is a strong relationship between the h exponent parameter and the annual cumulative snow to obtain reliable indication of this relationship only stations with good and very good nse values 0 65 are shown in the scatterplot there is a correlation of 0 71 between the h exponent parameter and the annual cumulative snow fig 8b one of the main advantages of the gr2m sc model is its ability to use any type of seasonal hydrologic series other than the standardized monthly hydrograph smh which produced the highest performance in our current research a further alternative the mean precipitation series was investigated using the same procedure but the results showed a worse performance than using the hydrograph judging by the average of the 710 stations the average nse of the calibration portion for the gr2m sc using the average monthly flow hydrograph and the average monthly precipitation are 0 72 and 0 60 respectively the same conclusion was also obtained using different series such as mean monthly temperature and the soil moisture storage it should be noted that for a number of stations the model using the standardized soil moisture storage gave higher performance than using the smh however the latter performs better on the average for the entire dataset 4 4 estimation of the h exponent parameter the gr2m sc model which shows high performance in simulating monthly runoff across all 710 stations is having 3 calibrated parameters x1 x5n and the h exponent to reduce the number of parameters of the model back to 2 the following procedure is used to estimate the h exponent to obtain reliable indication and eliminate the effects of unsatisfactory stations only stations with at least acceptable performance nse 0 50 were further investigated recent hydrological studies have shown that there is an influence of climatic classification on the overall catchment runoff behavior berghuijs et al 2014 knoben et al 2018 k√∂ppen geiger climate classification developed by wladimir k√∂ppen is the first and most widely used climate classification kottek et al 2006 this classification was constructed based on three different levels climate zones according to vegetation type precipitation and temperature there are five climate zones a equatorial b arid c warm temperate d snow and e polar the following level represents the precipitation with six classes which range from w desert to f fully humid the third level is about temperature with eight classes from h hot arid to t polar kottek et al 2006 the k√∂ppen geiger climate classification map fig 9 a is introduced as a categorical predictor along with the annual cumulative snow variable nevertheless it is cumbersome to investigate the original k√∂ppen geiger with 31 zones in the usa which means 33 parameters in the regression model consequently we opted to reduce the number of zones via merging similar zones together which leads to the modified version of the map with only 6 climate zones fig 9b in this study we used a regression equation with continuous and categorical explanatory variables to estimate the h exponent continuous exogenous variables such as the annual cumulative snow the annual precipitation and the aridity index were tested as potential explanatory variables the climatic classification was added to the model in the form of a categorical variable the different climatic classifications were embedded in the regression equation as dummy variables in which a binary variable 0 or 1 represents each category of the six regions of the k√∂ppen geiger classification g1 g6 relative to the first one g1 as reference category plackett 1974 anderson 1984 allen 2004 shown in the following equation 3 y Œ± j 1 j Œ≤ j x j k 1 k 1 Œ≥ k d k Œµ where y is the dependent variable which represents the parameter h exponent j represents the number of continuous independent variables x k is the total number of clusters of the explanatory categorical variable d k refers to the k th dummy variable categorical regions of the k√∂ppen geiger classification Œµ is the error term and Œ± Œ≤ a n d Œ≥ are the regression coefficients for the intercept the continuous variable and the categorical independent variable respectively as previously concluded there is a clear relationship between the h exponent and the annual cumulative snow a regression model was tested to predict the h exponent based on the annual cumulative snow as the only explanatory variable the model had a low r2 of 0 43 various variables other than the annual cumulative snow such as runoff to precipitation r p ratio annual precipitation and aridity index are also introduced however the model performance is marginally increased for all trials with a maximum r2 of 0 51 for each catchment the k√∂ppen geiger classification g1 g6 and the mean annual cumulative snow in mm were input to a regression model with categorical variables the results of which are summarized in table 3 the incorporation of the k√∂ppen geiger classification is valuable to the regression model as r2 increased to 0 66 based on the p values the coefficients relative to annual snow cumulative the intercept variable and all six classifications of the modified k√∂ppen geiger map are statistically significant the results confirm the previous conclusions about the strong relationship between climate classification and catchment runoff responses to evaluate the overall accuracy of the regression model applications it was the developed regression model is used to estimate the h exponent values for all stations which are then used as fixed values in the gr2m sc model the advantage of this step is that the estimation of h conserves the simplicity of the developed model by calibrating only two parameters x1 and x5n fig 10 shows the performance nse values using the h values estimated by regression against the model with h as a free parameter to calibrate the performance slightly decreases from 0 76 to 0 75 for the mean nse in the calibration portion on the contrary the mean value of the nse of the validation portion is the same and there is a very limited number of stations where the nse values significantly decreased the overall accuracy of this step is adequate to maintain the simplicity of the gr2m sc applicability in the usa 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between the gr2m sc with previous gr2m models the comparison is presented in three steps in the first step the calibrated parameters x1 and x5 x5n are compared to investigate the impact of the inclusion of the new h exponent on the main two parameters of the original model the second step aims to illustrate the performance of each model based on the five investigated criteria kge nse r2 bias and rmse the number of stations in each classification unsatisfactory acceptable good and very good is also presented in the third step the seasonal dependence between model residuals is used to assess the gr2m sc model relative to the original model fig 11 shows scatterplots for x1 and x5 x5n where the gr2m sc model tends to slightly overestimate the small values of x1 parameter less than 2500 on the contrary the values of x5n parameter of the gr2m sc model are slightly lower than the x5 values of the original model the large differences occurred in a very limited number of stations compared to the total number of 710 stations the standardized monthly hydrograph with a mean equal to unity is the main reason for the values of x5n being very similar to their x5 values in the original gr2m model without this step it would be expected to have significant differences between the x5 and x5n values in both models the values of x1 and x5 of the gr2m were also compared relative to their values of the original gr2m model the values of x1 parameter are very similar in both models while gr2m model tends to slightly overestimate the values of x5 parameter compared to the original gr2m model table 4 shows the evaluation statistics for all three models the values are estimated as the average of the 710 stations for both calibration and validation stages the gr2m sc model shows improvements in the five investigated performance criteria compared to both the original gr2m and gr2m models in the validation stage the kge increased from 0 57 for the original gr2m model to 0 67 and 0 73 for the gr2m and gr2m sc models respectively for the calibration stage the nse increased from 0 56 for the original gr2m model to 0 65 and 0 72 for the gr2m and gr2m sc models respectively furthermore calibrated r2 values improved from 0 58 to 0 73 for gr2m and gr2m sc respectively the gr2m model gives negative bias of 1 55 higher than both gr2m and gr2m sc whereas the latter shows the least bias 0 09 there are obvious improvements in both calibration and validation according to rmse for the gr2m sc compared to the original gr2m and gr2m models the nse and r2 values of both gr2m and gr2m sc are similar for the validation dataset these improvements are also reflected in the classification of nse values according to figs 4 6 and 7 the number of stations with very good performance increased from 240 with the gr2m model to 304 and 400 for the gr2m and gr2m sc respectively the stations with unsatisfactory nse values decreased from almost 35 to 19 and to 9 for thegr2m gr2m and gr2m sc models respectively as previously mentioned a large percentage of stations with unsatisfactory results from the gr2m sc are concentrated in a region with frequent ice jams which should not be considered a disadvantage for the gr2m sc model fig 12 shows a boxplot and a scatterplot representing of strengths of seasonality of the residuals of the three models in general the residuals of gr2m sc show lower seasonality compared to those of the gr2m and gr2m models this was one of the main objectives of this study the median of the gr2m sc values is 0 127 which is smaller than the 25 percentile of the original gr2m model with value of 0 144 the average of fs values for gr2m is twice the corresponding value for the gr2m sc model the scatterplot shows also that gr2m generally reduces the seasonality of the stations that show high seasonality in the original gr2m model however gr2m sc obviously reduces the strength of seasonality for almost all stations 5 2 strengths and limitations of the gr2m sc model the comparison between the gr2m sc and the gr2m models according to various hydrological variables that are not included in the model is valuable in enhancing our knowledge of the proposed model and it clearly produces higher performance compared to the original gr2m model fig 13 compares the nse of the calibrated portion for both models according to the aridity index the annual cumulative snow depth and the r p ratio the charts are plotted with a restricted range of nse between 0 50 to 1 0 from the comparison it will be noticed that the gr2m sc model clearly shows a better performance compared to the gr2m model especially for the sub humid catchments where the aridity index ranges between 0 75 and 2 there are no clear differences between the gr2m and gr2m sc models for aridity index values higher than 3 5 there is clear improvement in the nse for stations with annual cumulative snow depth higher than 200 cm year using the gr2m sc model and the gr2m sc model still suffers from low performance for very low r p ratios less than 0 1 yet still performs better than the original gr2m model 5 3 effects of different calibration and validation split samplings it is acceptable to evaluate the performance of hydrological models through splitting the available dataset into two sub sets for calibration and validation various studies have defined different techniques for calibration and validation split sampling li et al 2012 shen et al 2022 however there is no widely acknowledged technique for such splitting biondi et al 2012 liu et al 2018 one of the early techniques was introduced by kleme≈° 1986 who recommended to split the dataset into two split sample sets where the calibration process is applied twice with each split sample and the remaining sub set is used for validation as shown by li et al 2012 this method can be used to evaluate models under non stationary conditions where the model is judged robust under non stationarity if it shows acceptable performance for both validation processes li et al 2012 in the same line merz et al 2011 recommended to evaluate the stability of the calibrated parameters based on different split sampling consequently the gr2m and gr2m sc models were retested using the last 26 years for warm up and calibration and the first 14 years for validation sub split ‚Ö± fig 14 shows the scatterplots of the calibrated parameters based on both split samples along with the nse values as a performance criterion for gr2m and gr2m sc in the second split sampling setting the majority of the investigated stations show robust behavior of the parameters in both gr2m and gr2m sc while only a limited number of stations less than 5 exhibit deviations in the estimated values calibrated and validated nse values show similar patterns in both gr2m and gr2m sc although the validated nse values show larger spread the mean validated nse is almost the same based on both split samples with variation of less than 2 5 4 a new meaning of the mx5 parameter the x5 parameter of the original gr2m model was defined as a single fixed value representing an estimate of the water exchange with the outside environment mouelhi et al 2006 this fixed value prevents the gr2m model from modelling the inter annual behavior of the catchment and does not allow the catchment to modify throughout the year its gain or loss from or to its neighboring environments whether there is an unaccounted for hydrological component such as groundwater storage or other catchments this fixed value may be one of the reasons for the high seasonality of the monthly residuals of the model on the contrary with the introduction of the seasonally variable water exchange mx5 values this study provides a new and more flexible concept by allowing the catchment to gain water in some seasons and lose water during others this helped to reduce the seasonality of the model residuals at the same time these twelve values of mx5 are obtained by multiplying the smh raised to the h exponent by the calibrated parameter x5n without an increase of the model parameters to twelve independent ones 6 conclusions the main aim of this study was to improve the monthly water balance gr2m model while maintaining its simplicity a dataset consisting of 710 catchments across different climates in the usa was used to test the proposed new model by applying split sampling calibration validation dataset division first the gr2m model with two free parameters x1 and x5 was applied to the usa dataset the results showed high seasonality in model residuals and low performance statistics in almost 35 of the stations especially in snowy climates furthermore a four parameter variant of the gr2m gr2m with snow capabilities was also tested on the same dataset the gr2m performance increased in many regions in the usa with a percentage of stations with unsatisfactory performance decreasing to 19 however the strength of seasonality of model residuals decreased only slightly compared to the original gr2m model to overcome this seasonality issue to maintain the original gr2m number of parameters and to improve the overall performance behavior the current research extended the gr2m model with a seasonal component instead of using a fixed value of the water exchange x5 parameter throughout the year a vector of twelve values mx5 was introduced linked to the standardized monthly flow hydrograph to allow the gr2m sc model to simulate a catchment with different gain and or loss components during specific months of the year to conserve the parsimony of the gr2m the gr2m sc was developed using only one additional h exponent parameter the gr2m sc model reduced the strength of seasonality compared to both gr2m and gr2m models the percentage of stations with unsatisfactory performance also dropped to only 9 where most of these stations were subject to frequent ice jams with high performance in most of the climatic zones the benefits of our proposed gr2m sc model depicted from spatial diagnostic analysis of model performance and parameters include the gr2m sc model clearly outperforms both gr2m and gr2m models in all performance criteria with reduced seasonality of the model residuals the gr2m sc model is generally robust with comparable evaluation statistics in calibration and validation data portions there is a clear improvement in the nse for stations with annual cumulative snow depths higher than 200 cm year using the gr2m sc model the gr2m sc model still suffers from low performance for very low r p ratios less than 0 1 however it still performs slightly better than the original gr2m model a regression model is developed using as inputs the cumulative annual sow depth and the k√∂ppen geiger climate classification and can be used to infer the value of the additional h exponent parameter to revert back to a two free parameter model with almost no reduction in overall performance statistics the calibrated x1 and x5n parameters of the gr2m sc model are very similar to their values in the original gr2m which indicates that the h exponent does not alter the essence of the model structure the proposed model does not require a snow classification identification process while many other snow models require a classification technique to differentiate between snowy and non snowy catchments to initiate the application of the snow component furthermore no substantial rarely available data are required such as snowmelt rate and or detailed temperature data this allows the possibility to use the gr2m sc model in climate change studies credit authorship contribution

2316,in recent years a great amount of research has been done towards evaluating precipitation data generated by satellites but less has focused on how these estimates and their uncertainties manifest further into the water cycle in this study ten years of satellite based and ground based radar data are used as forcings for a distributed hydrologic model across the continental united states they are compared using a methodology designed to assess the flood signals and characteristics generated by the model by focusing on how well the model reproduces flood characteristics rather than fits traditional bulk statistics this research provides robust insights into satellite precipitation deficiencies it is found that satellite data has greater success at resolving lower magnitude flood events while tending to generate floods of longer durations additionally flood managers should note that satellites tend to generate floods that characteristically both begin earlier and end later than the ground radar reference subsequent research is recommended into other satellite data products in order to better understand these discrepancies and mitigate or plan for them in the future plain language summary in recent years satellites have been increasingly used to provide valuable insights on rainfall across the globe especially in locations where radars are unable to be installed on the ground by nature however the rainfall data provided by satellites has uncertainties large amounts of research has gone into the difference in accuracy between satellite radar and ground references but less has focused on how these differences impact flood simulations respectively in this study it was found that the rainfall data from satellites tends to predict floods that are more severe have higher magnitudes last longer have longer durations and have different timings start earlier and end later than the reference it is also found that satellites struggle with predictions involving extreme rainfall values further research is suggested to better understand these issues as well as compare against other forms of satellite rainfall data keywords satellite precipitation integrated validation hydrologic modeling flood modeling flood peak discharge flood duration flood timing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods have always been a devastating force to reckon with across the world in the continental united states conus alone increasing precipitation totals and precipitation extremes have contributed to more than 73 billion dollars in damages davenport et al 2021 the occurrence of extreme precipitation events over the conus are also projected to increase nonlinearly subsequently increasing the exposure of more and more of the population to flood hazards swain et al 2020 even more concerning is that these increasing precipitation extremes will naturally lead to not only increased flooding but an increase in the number of flash floods as well assessment and prediction of these events will be critical through the 21st century saharia et al 2017 a key tool for hydrologists in understanding the physical processes of floods and basins remains to be hydrologic models the ensemble framework for flash flood forecasting flamig et al 2020 more commonly known as ef5 is a premiere example of this ef5 is an open source distributed hydrologic modeling framework that allows the user to utilize several different water balance models and routing schemes to generate hydrologic output data such as discharge specific discharge i e discharge at each pixel normalized by upstream basin area also referred to as unit discharge and return periods all while offering flexibility in the usable format of precipitation input data in recent years ef5 has been combined with the multi radar multi sensor mrms system zhang et al 2016 to create the flooded locations and simulated hydrographs flash operational flash flood forecasting network over the conus gourley et al 2017 using 176 operational radars mrms provides accurate high quality data at 1 km spatial resolution and 2 minute temporal resolution the rest of the world however does not have the luxury that the suite of mrms precipitation products can provide as such those areas with lacking radar coverage instead rely on data provided through satellite precipitation products the global precipitation measurement mission gpm has within its mission statement the explicit desire to not only improve our understanding of earth s water cycle but to also improve the forecasting capabilities for natural hazards such as floods gpm nasa gov 2020 this dream can be realized in the realm of hydrologic modeling through the use of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg algorithm huffman et al 2019 and associated global precipitation dataset half hourly temporal and 0 1 degree spatial resolution from 90 n to 90s latitude previous studies have shown that intercomparison of precipitation products i e satellite vs ground based is possible through the use of ground sensors for example gebregiorgis et al 2018 used the gauge validated mrms gv mrms as reference data kirstetter et al 2012 2020 yet there still remains much to learn about the accuracy of these products when dealing with flooding and their application in flood forecasting especially in order to address the call for integrated validation of hydrologic products put forward by hou et al 2014 a systematic statistical assessment is warranted previous studies in this realm have investigated hydrologic modeling using the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm and its associated multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa algorithm for singular or clusters of basins with favorable results towards the potential of using satellite precipitation for hydrologic applications su et al 2008 xue et al 2013 yong et al 2010 importantly these studies consistently found benefits while operating at the native tmpa resolutions of 0 25 degree 27 km spatial resolution and 3 hour temporal resolution and at a range of significantly different basin areas from the 3550 km2 wangchu basin in xue et al 2013 to the massive 3 2 106 km2 la plata basin in su et al 2008 all three studies however cited basin calibration issues with xue et al 2013 and yong et al 2010 adding that while better statistics were achieved through additional calibration this came at the cost of realistic basin parameters this sentiment of caution towards overcalibration extends into more recent single basin studies using gpm and imerg although all distinctly agree that the imerg suite of products perform better for hydrologic applications than trmm and tmpa jiang et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 these studies however lack the representativeness needed to draw robust conclusions on satellite precipitation products that cover a wide variety of watersheds with their global coverage all while both resampling imerg to the more coarse tmpa spatial resolution and using aggregated daily precipitation given the variability of precipitation and hydrologic processes at all scales it is key to perform hydrologic assessment at the native scale of precipitation products in order to draw more robust conclusions relevant to both algorithm developers and end users one final major caveat to establishing the level of integrated hydrologic validation desired by the gpm mission creators is that traditional assessment approaches become distinctly limited when dealing with diverse catchments and large sample sizes clark et al 2021 lamontagne et al 2020 nanding et al 2021 newman et al 2015 in order to truly begin to understand larger scale impacts of the use of satellite precipitation products a reliable region scale benchmark representing diverse basin characteristics and hydrological conditions is required this study addresses these limitations through a novel approach instead of looking at the behavior of imerg over a single basin cluster of basins or single region this research looks at the entire conus simultaneously using a quality controlled selection of over 3000 well documented gauged basins a robust variety of sizes shapes terrains and regimes are incorporated into one dataset additionally in place of only examining outputs generated through the use of one precipitation product results from imerg are compared directly against benchmark modeling results from the more accurate and higher resolution mrms an already established product used for operational flood forecasting comparing imerg and mrms through the same hydrologic model allows for the factoring out of model impacts thus providing a more direct comparison between precipitation products importantly this study is one of the few currently looking to perform integrated validation of imerg at its native resolution as a means to avoid undesired resampling effects on the assessment with both products operating at their native resolutions baseline assessments can be made about where modeling through imerg performs well where it performs poorly and what conditions are associated with both further novelty comes from the generated streamflow timeseries themselves traditionally hydrologic modeling studies focus on one or more bulk error metrics as a way to quantify and score the accuracy of one entire timeseries to another this extensive usage comes at the cost of substantially increased uncertainty in the calculation of these metrics themselves leading to potential contamination of conclusions and murkier definitions of what may be considered a good model clark et al 2021 in this study however instead of comparing streamflow values directly the precipitation products are assessed based on their ability to model distinct features of floods i e signals such as peak magnitude total duration and timing this approach not only circumvents the need for bulk metrics but provides a more unique robust and tangible assessment of the differences between the products and their ability to present meaningful flood characteristics the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the dataset generation and methodology section 3 provides the results for and immediate discussion of each of the three flood characteristics investigated and section 4 constitutes the final conclusions 2 data and methods for the past several years an mrms mosaic precipitation reanalysis over the conus between 2004 and 2011 has been used with ef5 as the basis of several large scale studies zhang and gourley 2018 flamig et al 2020 gourley et al 2017 not only have these studies shown that ef5 can effectively capture flood hydrographs when using the high resolution precipitation forcing from mrms but have led to the utilization of ef5 mrms operationally in real time as part of the flash network gourley et al 2017 extensively quality controlled a selection of over 3000 basins removing any deemed by the usgs to have any anthropogenic influence as well as any basins where snowmelt processes are dominant i e basins where snowfall contributes to 30 of annual precipitation this same selection of basins has been used in the current study and their locations can be seen in fig 1 with a general summary of basin characteristics provided in table 1 previous studies have also shown the capability of using gv mrms as a benchmark to assess the quality of satellite precipitation products derin kirstetter 2022 gebregiorgis et al 2017 gebregiorgis et al 2018 upadhyaya et al 2020 but a more in depth assessment has yet to be completed especially in the context of flood modeling this study focuses on the use of the version 06 imerg early run imerg e for the satellite forcing as it has the lowest data latency 4 h of the suite of imerg products giving it the highest potential to be used operationally for flood prediction in a similar way to mrms flash in the future each precipitation forcing runs with ef5 using the coupled routing and excess storage crest wang et al 2011 distributed hydrologic model combined with kinematic wave routing vergara et al 2016 the simulations span the same period of time and features the same gauges as those used in gourley et al 2017 in order to build an effective control and benchmark timeseries are composed of stream discharge values in cubic meters per second cms traditionally hydrologic modeling involves calibration and validation through the use of one or more bulk metrics such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or the kling gupta efficiency kge nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 2009 in order to assess the generated timeseries as a whole across diverse hydrologic conditions and processes despite being used extensively in hydrologic applications throughout the years these performance metrics have been scrutinized of late as their inherent sampling uncertainty cannot be overcome when modeling at large scales lamontagne et al 2020 newman et al 2015 bulk metrics also provide limited insight in hydrologic discrepancies first metrics such as correlation and the kling gupta efficiency are often applied without necessarily checking their applicability or relevance gupta et al 2009 liu 2020 for example the linear correlation generally insufficiently describes non linear and heteroscedastic dependence between the hydrologic estimates and reference second because model estimates are often assumed to display homogeneous properties over the domain of comparison bulk metrics are computed over samples that gather a variety of hydrologic situations for which the model is likely to behave differently through its assumptions bulk error metrics lack specificity and depict averaged properties hence the representativeness of these hydrologic assessments is confined to the domain over which they are performed with limited extension over other watersheds regimes regions seasons etc these issues are to an extent common to those of all geophysical variables see for instance kirstetter et al 2020 for a discussion on precipitation and radice et al 2022 for a discussion on atmospheric water vapor this is only exacerbated when dealing with the sheer volume of gauges available to be investigated simultaneously across an area as diverse as the conus where errors associated with precipitation across vastly different terrains can propagate even further into the modeling and provide a less robust analysis of the intricacies of the results nanding et al 2021 this was seen in a study by jiang bauer gottwein 2019 where over 300 basins in china were evaluated simultaneously between the entire suite of imerg products hydrologic simulations were shown to have satisfactory kge values median of 0 60 during calibration but these metrics plummeted to near zero or worse during validation commentary on these results was made at face value but due to the inherent nature of the bulk metric calculation little else can be gleamed from the timeseries moving away from the confines of bulk metric analysis in hydrologic modeling is a growing sentiment in the greater hydrologic community with a larger push for it coming after a recent paper by clark et al 2021 as such this study focuses on how well specific flood event characteristics are captured by the hydrologic simulations instead of analyzing the timeseries as a whole in order to extract a physically meaningful assessment on the ability of precipitation products to model distinct features of floods additionally the version of ef5 crest employed in this study uses the same configuration utilized by the flash system for flash flood warning operations in the united states national weather service although the system was not calibrated against time series of streamflow observations its parameters were estimated through a robust methodology based on geospatial datasets describing physiographic attributes such as soil types and land cover use a machine learning technique was also employed to estimate hydraulic parameters for the kinematic wave flow routing model comprehensive evaluations of this configuration have been presented in vergara et al 2016 gourley et al 2017 and flamig et al 2020 for this study every timeseries generated was post processed in order to isolate individual flood events each gauge has a designated action level discharge value set by the united states geological survey usgs and local stakeholders which was used to denote the start time i e the time point where discharge exceeded the threshold and end time i e the point where discharge fell back below the threshold of each event an example of how this may look graphically is provided in fig 2 with a zoomed in look at an arbitrary usgs gauge in indiana gauge 03358000 with each raw event logged by start and end time events were then procedurally matched one to one between the products using multiple levels of cross referencing criteria this new dataset of 63 000 matched events is the basis of this study since all the discharge information is retained for each event as well as each individual time step peak discharge values can be obtained as well as relative timings as such three aspects of these events will be evaluated in this study the flood magnitude peak discharge the flood duration total time elapsed from start to end and the flood timing the relative difference in start and end times between products with the idea being that agreement between products on these factors provides a more robust assessment of modeling quality across the study area than traditional methods 3 results discussion 3 1 magnitude peak discharge understanding how well a hydrologic simulation estimates the magnitude of any given flood is significantly important both operationally for emergency management and practically for the purposes of building engineered controls or mitigation strategies fig 3a shows the accuracy of imerg simulated peak discharge values plotted against the corresponding mrms simulated peak discharge values with a density scatterplot in order to assess both the structure of the scatter field as well as the underlying density of points note that peak discharge strongly depends on the basin size because the amount of collected water from the sky mechanically increases with size to filter out this dependence specific peak discharge i e the peak discharge at a gauge normalized by its associated basin area was also calculated and plotted to facilitate further depth of comparison between the products fig 3b the imerg e peak values show general agreement with mrms simulated peak discharges with the pairs gathering around the 1 1 line in both plots provided in fig 3 overestimation can be seen on the part of imerg with the bulk of the densities tending to fall higher above the 1 1 line using specific peak discharge however brings the data slightly closer to the 1 1 line overall and further centers the densities to further dissect the results from the density plots and make the investigation more robust the data was taken to generate plots of conditional distributions this particular style of plot examines an independent variable i e imerg simulated peak discharge through quantiles associated with bins of dependent variable values i e mrms simulated peak discharge quantile plots in fig 4 display conditional quantiles 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th highlighting the variability of the dependency of imerg e specific peak discharge conditioned on mrms specific peak discharge this exercise was once again performed on both peak discharge fig 4a and specific peak discharge values fig 4b the conditional median provides the first order trend of the dependency while the interquartile area 25th 75th estimates the uncertainty in the relationship and the 10th and 90th quantiles describe the extreme values of imerg e specific peak discharge for a given mrms value similar to what was seen in the density scatterplots the conditional distribution investigation shows that imerg tends to overestimate simulated values of peak discharge with most of the distribution of simulated peak discharges as well as the median and mean lines falling above the 1 1 line note that the conditional distribution of imerg simulated peaks grow broader as peak discharge increases showing noticeably greater uncertainties in capturing higher peak discharges also worth noting is a distinct plateau effect at the highest mrms values of specific peak discharge above 0 5 cms km 2 these extremely high values are associated with flash floods often caused by extreme levels of precipitation over small periods of time and over smaller basins such events are unlikely to be resolved by imerg both spatially at 0 1 resolution and temporally 30 min resolution this inability to resolve extreme values of precipitation may also be caused by limitations in the algorithm itself 3 2 flood duration the expected duration of any given flood is another important metric for emergency managers and planners alike following the same methodology as the magnitude investigation a density scatterplot of simulated imerg e and mrms duration values was created first fig 5 while the points tend to gather around the 1 1 line the scatter increases for lower duration events highlighting challenges for imerg e to capture short lived precipitation events causing floods the overall spread of the data does tend to reduce as durations increase but at much lower densities once again it can be seen that imerg e tends to overestimate its simulated flood durations with most of the density of values falling above the 1 1 line the conditional distribution of duration values was also assessed and can be seen in fig 6 the results behave similarly to the density plot with distinct overestimation being shown by imerg e especially at lower mrms event durations but this plotting method also yields additional features what can be seen more clearly in the conditional distribution plot is that imerg e shows distinct bias associated with overestimation of shorter flood durations 5h but this bias decreases as flood duration times increase fig 6a the spread of the quantiles also decreases as duration increases meaning increased agreement between products and decreased uncertainty between them this again could be a result of the imerg spatial resolution with potentially more rain falling within the confines of the larger imerg grids but this discrepancy is more likely caused by the coarser 30 min temporal resolution of imerg with respect to mrms which can be resolved as low as 5 min the longer the duration the less this temporal difference becomes a factor it is worth noting that all the exact same trends are seen in fig 6b in which durations were normalized by their respective basin area in the same way as peak discharge in order to remove any potential influence on the results 3 3 flood timing the ability to determine the difference in imerg e event timing with respect to mrms has also provided interesting insights especially some critical for the flood forecasting community since the dataset provides timestamps for both the start time and end time of each event the time differences between the products are computed and analyzed the absolute imerg e start and end times were subtracted from their associated absolute mrms start and end times giving either a positive or negative time difference value in hours a positive negative value indicates that the imerg e event occurs earlier later than its mrms absolute time counterpart fig 7 shows that overall imerg e tends to simulate floods that begin earlier and end later than those simulated by mrms this tracks with what was seen with event duration as one would expect to have longer duration floods if simulations are generating floods that both start earlier and end later like duration this is likely also caused by differences in both spatial and temporal resolutions once again conditional distribution plots were generated in order to better understand underlying associations of hydrologic conditions within the data the size of a basin naturally ties into flood timing so area was chosen to compare against start time fig 8a and end time fig 8b at their core both plots show the same results as seen in fig 7 with positive values associated with earlier imerg e start time in fig 8a and more negative values associated with later imerg e end times in fig 8b it can also be seen in both plots that these respective positive and negative features tend to be accentuated at the smallest and largest basin sizes with the latter being noticeably more severe these effects are once again likely due to the coarser resolutions of imerg e but for different reasons at smaller basin sizes 100 km2 the resolution of imerg e is simply too large to generate the more necessary precise precipitation flood responses specifically such basins are covered by a few imerg pixels given the nominal spatial resolution of imerg 0 1 for larger basins 100 km2 the impact of the smoothing of the precipitation fields by the imerg effective resolution guilloteau and foufoula georgiou 2020 is likely aggregated at the basin scale which translates into higher systematic departures and increased uncertainty in the flood timings as basin size increases the significance of the precipitation spatial distribution increases so by painting with a large brush so to speak more uncertainty is added into the system as seen by the increasing spread of the quantiles despite the uncertainty seen at larger basin sizes however the start time discrepancies in fig 8a remains well centered around zero end times fall farther away from the zero hour center line in fig 8b with approximately 75 of the total events ending later than mrms overall start time is the more accurate of the two parameters with the median line only slightly deviating from zero at larger basin sizes as well as maintaining tighter uncertainty

2316,in recent years a great amount of research has been done towards evaluating precipitation data generated by satellites but less has focused on how these estimates and their uncertainties manifest further into the water cycle in this study ten years of satellite based and ground based radar data are used as forcings for a distributed hydrologic model across the continental united states they are compared using a methodology designed to assess the flood signals and characteristics generated by the model by focusing on how well the model reproduces flood characteristics rather than fits traditional bulk statistics this research provides robust insights into satellite precipitation deficiencies it is found that satellite data has greater success at resolving lower magnitude flood events while tending to generate floods of longer durations additionally flood managers should note that satellites tend to generate floods that characteristically both begin earlier and end later than the ground radar reference subsequent research is recommended into other satellite data products in order to better understand these discrepancies and mitigate or plan for them in the future plain language summary in recent years satellites have been increasingly used to provide valuable insights on rainfall across the globe especially in locations where radars are unable to be installed on the ground by nature however the rainfall data provided by satellites has uncertainties large amounts of research has gone into the difference in accuracy between satellite radar and ground references but less has focused on how these differences impact flood simulations respectively in this study it was found that the rainfall data from satellites tends to predict floods that are more severe have higher magnitudes last longer have longer durations and have different timings start earlier and end later than the reference it is also found that satellites struggle with predictions involving extreme rainfall values further research is suggested to better understand these issues as well as compare against other forms of satellite rainfall data keywords satellite precipitation integrated validation hydrologic modeling flood modeling flood peak discharge flood duration flood timing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods have always been a devastating force to reckon with across the world in the continental united states conus alone increasing precipitation totals and precipitation extremes have contributed to more than 73 billion dollars in damages davenport et al 2021 the occurrence of extreme precipitation events over the conus are also projected to increase nonlinearly subsequently increasing the exposure of more and more of the population to flood hazards swain et al 2020 even more concerning is that these increasing precipitation extremes will naturally lead to not only increased flooding but an increase in the number of flash floods as well assessment and prediction of these events will be critical through the 21st century saharia et al 2017 a key tool for hydrologists in understanding the physical processes of floods and basins remains to be hydrologic models the ensemble framework for flash flood forecasting flamig et al 2020 more commonly known as ef5 is a premiere example of this ef5 is an open source distributed hydrologic modeling framework that allows the user to utilize several different water balance models and routing schemes to generate hydrologic output data such as discharge specific discharge i e discharge at each pixel normalized by upstream basin area also referred to as unit discharge and return periods all while offering flexibility in the usable format of precipitation input data in recent years ef5 has been combined with the multi radar multi sensor mrms system zhang et al 2016 to create the flooded locations and simulated hydrographs flash operational flash flood forecasting network over the conus gourley et al 2017 using 176 operational radars mrms provides accurate high quality data at 1 km spatial resolution and 2 minute temporal resolution the rest of the world however does not have the luxury that the suite of mrms precipitation products can provide as such those areas with lacking radar coverage instead rely on data provided through satellite precipitation products the global precipitation measurement mission gpm has within its mission statement the explicit desire to not only improve our understanding of earth s water cycle but to also improve the forecasting capabilities for natural hazards such as floods gpm nasa gov 2020 this dream can be realized in the realm of hydrologic modeling through the use of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg algorithm huffman et al 2019 and associated global precipitation dataset half hourly temporal and 0 1 degree spatial resolution from 90 n to 90s latitude previous studies have shown that intercomparison of precipitation products i e satellite vs ground based is possible through the use of ground sensors for example gebregiorgis et al 2018 used the gauge validated mrms gv mrms as reference data kirstetter et al 2012 2020 yet there still remains much to learn about the accuracy of these products when dealing with flooding and their application in flood forecasting especially in order to address the call for integrated validation of hydrologic products put forward by hou et al 2014 a systematic statistical assessment is warranted previous studies in this realm have investigated hydrologic modeling using the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm and its associated multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa algorithm for singular or clusters of basins with favorable results towards the potential of using satellite precipitation for hydrologic applications su et al 2008 xue et al 2013 yong et al 2010 importantly these studies consistently found benefits while operating at the native tmpa resolutions of 0 25 degree 27 km spatial resolution and 3 hour temporal resolution and at a range of significantly different basin areas from the 3550 km2 wangchu basin in xue et al 2013 to the massive 3 2 106 km2 la plata basin in su et al 2008 all three studies however cited basin calibration issues with xue et al 2013 and yong et al 2010 adding that while better statistics were achieved through additional calibration this came at the cost of realistic basin parameters this sentiment of caution towards overcalibration extends into more recent single basin studies using gpm and imerg although all distinctly agree that the imerg suite of products perform better for hydrologic applications than trmm and tmpa jiang et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 these studies however lack the representativeness needed to draw robust conclusions on satellite precipitation products that cover a wide variety of watersheds with their global coverage all while both resampling imerg to the more coarse tmpa spatial resolution and using aggregated daily precipitation given the variability of precipitation and hydrologic processes at all scales it is key to perform hydrologic assessment at the native scale of precipitation products in order to draw more robust conclusions relevant to both algorithm developers and end users one final major caveat to establishing the level of integrated hydrologic validation desired by the gpm mission creators is that traditional assessment approaches become distinctly limited when dealing with diverse catchments and large sample sizes clark et al 2021 lamontagne et al 2020 nanding et al 2021 newman et al 2015 in order to truly begin to understand larger scale impacts of the use of satellite precipitation products a reliable region scale benchmark representing diverse basin characteristics and hydrological conditions is required this study addresses these limitations through a novel approach instead of looking at the behavior of imerg over a single basin cluster of basins or single region this research looks at the entire conus simultaneously using a quality controlled selection of over 3000 well documented gauged basins a robust variety of sizes shapes terrains and regimes are incorporated into one dataset additionally in place of only examining outputs generated through the use of one precipitation product results from imerg are compared directly against benchmark modeling results from the more accurate and higher resolution mrms an already established product used for operational flood forecasting comparing imerg and mrms through the same hydrologic model allows for the factoring out of model impacts thus providing a more direct comparison between precipitation products importantly this study is one of the few currently looking to perform integrated validation of imerg at its native resolution as a means to avoid undesired resampling effects on the assessment with both products operating at their native resolutions baseline assessments can be made about where modeling through imerg performs well where it performs poorly and what conditions are associated with both further novelty comes from the generated streamflow timeseries themselves traditionally hydrologic modeling studies focus on one or more bulk error metrics as a way to quantify and score the accuracy of one entire timeseries to another this extensive usage comes at the cost of substantially increased uncertainty in the calculation of these metrics themselves leading to potential contamination of conclusions and murkier definitions of what may be considered a good model clark et al 2021 in this study however instead of comparing streamflow values directly the precipitation products are assessed based on their ability to model distinct features of floods i e signals such as peak magnitude total duration and timing this approach not only circumvents the need for bulk metrics but provides a more unique robust and tangible assessment of the differences between the products and their ability to present meaningful flood characteristics the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the dataset generation and methodology section 3 provides the results for and immediate discussion of each of the three flood characteristics investigated and section 4 constitutes the final conclusions 2 data and methods for the past several years an mrms mosaic precipitation reanalysis over the conus between 2004 and 2011 has been used with ef5 as the basis of several large scale studies zhang and gourley 2018 flamig et al 2020 gourley et al 2017 not only have these studies shown that ef5 can effectively capture flood hydrographs when using the high resolution precipitation forcing from mrms but have led to the utilization of ef5 mrms operationally in real time as part of the flash network gourley et al 2017 extensively quality controlled a selection of over 3000 basins removing any deemed by the usgs to have any anthropogenic influence as well as any basins where snowmelt processes are dominant i e basins where snowfall contributes to 30 of annual precipitation this same selection of basins has been used in the current study and their locations can be seen in fig 1 with a general summary of basin characteristics provided in table 1 previous studies have also shown the capability of using gv mrms as a benchmark to assess the quality of satellite precipitation products derin kirstetter 2022 gebregiorgis et al 2017 gebregiorgis et al 2018 upadhyaya et al 2020 but a more in depth assessment has yet to be completed especially in the context of flood modeling this study focuses on the use of the version 06 imerg early run imerg e for the satellite forcing as it has the lowest data latency 4 h of the suite of imerg products giving it the highest potential to be used operationally for flood prediction in a similar way to mrms flash in the future each precipitation forcing runs with ef5 using the coupled routing and excess storage crest wang et al 2011 distributed hydrologic model combined with kinematic wave routing vergara et al 2016 the simulations span the same period of time and features the same gauges as those used in gourley et al 2017 in order to build an effective control and benchmark timeseries are composed of stream discharge values in cubic meters per second cms traditionally hydrologic modeling involves calibration and validation through the use of one or more bulk metrics such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or the kling gupta efficiency kge nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 2009 in order to assess the generated timeseries as a whole across diverse hydrologic conditions and processes despite being used extensively in hydrologic applications throughout the years these performance metrics have been scrutinized of late as their inherent sampling uncertainty cannot be overcome when modeling at large scales lamontagne et al 2020 newman et al 2015 bulk metrics also provide limited insight in hydrologic discrepancies first metrics such as correlation and the kling gupta efficiency are often applied without necessarily checking their applicability or relevance gupta et al 2009 liu 2020 for example the linear correlation generally insufficiently describes non linear and heteroscedastic dependence between the hydrologic estimates and reference second because model estimates are often assumed to display homogeneous properties over the domain of comparison bulk metrics are computed over samples that gather a variety of hydrologic situations for which the model is likely to behave differently through its assumptions bulk error metrics lack specificity and depict averaged properties hence the representativeness of these hydrologic assessments is confined to the domain over which they are performed with limited extension over other watersheds regimes regions seasons etc these issues are to an extent common to those of all geophysical variables see for instance kirstetter et al 2020 for a discussion on precipitation and radice et al 2022 for a discussion on atmospheric water vapor this is only exacerbated when dealing with the sheer volume of gauges available to be investigated simultaneously across an area as diverse as the conus where errors associated with precipitation across vastly different terrains can propagate even further into the modeling and provide a less robust analysis of the intricacies of the results nanding et al 2021 this was seen in a study by jiang bauer gottwein 2019 where over 300 basins in china were evaluated simultaneously between the entire suite of imerg products hydrologic simulations were shown to have satisfactory kge values median of 0 60 during calibration but these metrics plummeted to near zero or worse during validation commentary on these results was made at face value but due to the inherent nature of the bulk metric calculation little else can be gleamed from the timeseries moving away from the confines of bulk metric analysis in hydrologic modeling is a growing sentiment in the greater hydrologic community with a larger push for it coming after a recent paper by clark et al 2021 as such this study focuses on how well specific flood event characteristics are captured by the hydrologic simulations instead of analyzing the timeseries as a whole in order to extract a physically meaningful assessment on the ability of precipitation products to model distinct features of floods additionally the version of ef5 crest employed in this study uses the same configuration utilized by the flash system for flash flood warning operations in the united states national weather service although the system was not calibrated against time series of streamflow observations its parameters were estimated through a robust methodology based on geospatial datasets describing physiographic attributes such as soil types and land cover use a machine learning technique was also employed to estimate hydraulic parameters for the kinematic wave flow routing model comprehensive evaluations of this configuration have been presented in vergara et al 2016 gourley et al 2017 and flamig et al 2020 for this study every timeseries generated was post processed in order to isolate individual flood events each gauge has a designated action level discharge value set by the united states geological survey usgs and local stakeholders which was used to denote the start time i e the time point where discharge exceeded the threshold and end time i e the point where discharge fell back below the threshold of each event an example of how this may look graphically is provided in fig 2 with a zoomed in look at an arbitrary usgs gauge in indiana gauge 03358000 with each raw event logged by start and end time events were then procedurally matched one to one between the products using multiple levels of cross referencing criteria this new dataset of 63 000 matched events is the basis of this study since all the discharge information is retained for each event as well as each individual time step peak discharge values can be obtained as well as relative timings as such three aspects of these events will be evaluated in this study the flood magnitude peak discharge the flood duration total time elapsed from start to end and the flood timing the relative difference in start and end times between products with the idea being that agreement between products on these factors provides a more robust assessment of modeling quality across the study area than traditional methods 3 results discussion 3 1 magnitude peak discharge understanding how well a hydrologic simulation estimates the magnitude of any given flood is significantly important both operationally for emergency management and practically for the purposes of building engineered controls or mitigation strategies fig 3a shows the accuracy of imerg simulated peak discharge values plotted against the corresponding mrms simulated peak discharge values with a density scatterplot in order to assess both the structure of the scatter field as well as the underlying density of points note that peak discharge strongly depends on the basin size because the amount of collected water from the sky mechanically increases with size to filter out this dependence specific peak discharge i e the peak discharge at a gauge normalized by its associated basin area was also calculated and plotted to facilitate further depth of comparison between the products fig 3b the imerg e peak values show general agreement with mrms simulated peak discharges with the pairs gathering around the 1 1 line in both plots provided in fig 3 overestimation can be seen on the part of imerg with the bulk of the densities tending to fall higher above the 1 1 line using specific peak discharge however brings the data slightly closer to the 1 1 line overall and further centers the densities to further dissect the results from the density plots and make the investigation more robust the data was taken to generate plots of conditional distributions this particular style of plot examines an independent variable i e imerg simulated peak discharge through quantiles associated with bins of dependent variable values i e mrms simulated peak discharge quantile plots in fig 4 display conditional quantiles 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th highlighting the variability of the dependency of imerg e specific peak discharge conditioned on mrms specific peak discharge this exercise was once again performed on both peak discharge fig 4a and specific peak discharge values fig 4b the conditional median provides the first order trend of the dependency while the interquartile area 25th 75th estimates the uncertainty in the relationship and the 10th and 90th quantiles describe the extreme values of imerg e specific peak discharge for a given mrms value similar to what was seen in the density scatterplots the conditional distribution investigation shows that imerg tends to overestimate simulated values of peak discharge with most of the distribution of simulated peak discharges as well as the median and mean lines falling above the 1 1 line note that the conditional distribution of imerg simulated peaks grow broader as peak discharge increases showing noticeably greater uncertainties in capturing higher peak discharges also worth noting is a distinct plateau effect at the highest mrms values of specific peak discharge above 0 5 cms km 2 these extremely high values are associated with flash floods often caused by extreme levels of precipitation over small periods of time and over smaller basins such events are unlikely to be resolved by imerg both spatially at 0 1 resolution and temporally 30 min resolution this inability to resolve extreme values of precipitation may also be caused by limitations in the algorithm itself 3 2 flood duration the expected duration of any given flood is another important metric for emergency managers and planners alike following the same methodology as the magnitude investigation a density scatterplot of simulated imerg e and mrms duration values was created first fig 5 while the points tend to gather around the 1 1 line the scatter increases for lower duration events highlighting challenges for imerg e to capture short lived precipitation events causing floods the overall spread of the data does tend to reduce as durations increase but at much lower densities once again it can be seen that imerg e tends to overestimate its simulated flood durations with most of the density of values falling above the 1 1 line the conditional distribution of duration values was also assessed and can be seen in fig 6 the results behave similarly to the density plot with distinct overestimation being shown by imerg e especially at lower mrms event durations but this plotting method also yields additional features what can be seen more clearly in the conditional distribution plot is that imerg e shows distinct bias associated with overestimation of shorter flood durations 5h but this bias decreases as flood duration times increase fig 6a the spread of the quantiles also decreases as duration increases meaning increased agreement between products and decreased uncertainty between them this again could be a result of the imerg spatial resolution with potentially more rain falling within the confines of the larger imerg grids but this discrepancy is more likely caused by the coarser 30 min temporal resolution of imerg with respect to mrms which can be resolved as low as 5 min the longer the duration the less this temporal difference becomes a factor it is worth noting that all the exact same trends are seen in fig 6b in which durations were normalized by their respective basin area in the same way as peak discharge in order to remove any potential influence on the results 3 3 flood timing the ability to determine the difference in imerg e event timing with respect to mrms has also provided interesting insights especially some critical for the flood forecasting community since the dataset provides timestamps for both the start time and end time of each event the time differences between the products are computed and analyzed the absolute imerg e start and end times were subtracted from their associated absolute mrms start and end times giving either a positive or negative time difference value in hours a positive negative value indicates that the imerg e event occurs earlier later than its mrms absolute time counterpart fig 7 shows that overall imerg e tends to simulate floods that begin earlier and end later than those simulated by mrms this tracks with what was seen with event duration as one would expect to have longer duration floods if simulations are generating floods that both start earlier and end later like duration this is likely also caused by differences in both spatial and temporal resolutions once again conditional distribution plots were generated in order to better understand underlying associations of hydrologic conditions within the data the size of a basin naturally ties into flood timing so area was chosen to compare against start time fig 8a and end time fig 8b at their core both plots show the same results as seen in fig 7 with positive values associated with earlier imerg e start time in fig 8a and more negative values associated with later imerg e end times in fig 8b it can also be seen in both plots that these respective positive and negative features tend to be accentuated at the smallest and largest basin sizes with the latter being noticeably more severe these effects are once again likely due to the coarser resolutions of imerg e but for different reasons at smaller basin sizes 100 km2 the resolution of imerg e is simply too large to generate the more necessary precise precipitation flood responses specifically such basins are covered by a few imerg pixels given the nominal spatial resolution of imerg 0 1 for larger basins 100 km2 the impact of the smoothing of the precipitation fields by the imerg effective resolution guilloteau and foufoula georgiou 2020 is likely aggregated at the basin scale which translates into higher systematic departures and increased uncertainty in the flood timings as basin size increases the significance of the precipitation spatial distribution increases so by painting with a large brush so to speak more uncertainty is added into the system as seen by the increasing spread of the quantiles despite the uncertainty seen at larger basin sizes

also a byproduct of the coarser and effective imerg e resolutions with potentially larger volumes of precipitation falling over larger periods of time generating longer receding limbs as the additional water works its way through the system 4 conclusions in this study imerg e satellite precipitation was used as a forcing in the ef5 hydrologic model framework in order to better understand its ability to accurately simulate and predict floods and flash floods characteristics through a nontraditional assessment of discrete flood characteristics magnitude duration and timing it was found

2317,daily and weekly rainfall stable isotopic data collected over a 9 year period for daily and 14 year period for weekly at lucas heights australia were compared small differences in the local meteoric water lines lmwls were seen when developed using daily weekly or monthly data where the effect of short term small atmospheric variability is reduced by the associated averaging although if a precipitation weighted least squares method was used to derive the lmwls the differences between the daily and weekly derived lmwls were lower a systematic analysis was then conducted of the impact on the isotopic composition of precipitation from environmental conditions at the sampling site and along the air mass trajectory the synoptic weather systems and finally large scale climate drivers e g el ni√±o southern oscillation the best correlation of Œ¥18o was with local temperature rainout of the air mass and rainfall amount at the site the correlation between precipitation amount and Œ¥18o values was higher when daily samples were used than when the precipitation weighted monthly values were considered 0 36 as opposed to 0 31 a good correlation was also seen between Œ¥18o and duration of the precipitation event r 0 42 the correlation between Œ¥18o and the fraction of convective rainfall was significant but low r 0 11 on a synoptic systems basis the lowest Œ¥ values were seen in rainfall from offshore low pressure systems located to the east or north east of the site although the largest rainfall was seen from low pressure systems arriving from the north east the influence of the large scale climate drivers on the isotopic composition of precipitation was insignificant at this coastal site when radon 222 was used to categorise the atmospheric mixing state rainfall amount was clearly negatively correlated with nocturnal stability with the lowest amount of rainfall occurring on days with the most stable nocturnal periods most of the convective rainfall occurred on these

isotopic 2h 1h and 18o 16o composition of precipitation is affected by a range of physical atmospheric and geographic influences originally these dependencies were largely investigated using data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip e g dansgaard 1964 aragu√°s aragu√°s et al 2000 physical influences include the characteristics of the moisture source rainout en route from the moisture source to the sampling site and the amount of precipitation at the sampling site dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 atmospheric influences include the temperature and relative humidity at the moisture source and post condensation isotope exchange either in the cloud or in the atmosphere where re evaporation of the raindrop can occur as it falls to the ground rozanski et al 1993 the degree of re evaporation is affected by local temperature and relative humidity combinations of these influences result in relationships by geographical location and have allowed for the development of regression models between the stable isotopes of precipitation and the temperature at the sampling site the elevation of the site the distance from the coast the latitude of the site and rainfall amount at the site dansgaard 1964 most commonly the temperature and rainfall amount at the sampling site have provided the basis for empirical models used to interpret paleoclimate records rozanski et

occurring inert radioactive gas t0 5 3 82 days with a predominantly terrestrial source over land the variability of radon both spatially and temporarily is small radon flux 16 26 mbqm 2 s 1 schery and wasiolek 1998 goto et al 2008 griffiths et al 2010 the radon classification approach isolates conditions of strong synoptic non stationarity category 0 and then groups conditions in four other categories 1 4 ranging from dominant cyclonic conditions to dominant anti cyclonic conditions overall rainfall amount typically reduces from category 0 to 4 e g kikaj et al 2019 kikaj et al 2020 with convective rainfall typically most likely to occur under category 0 1 or 4 conditions the sydney region of australia has a temperate climate with warm to hot summers whilst there is no distinct dry season the wettest months tend to be from january to march with moderate inter annual rainfall variability several meteorological patterns are associated with precipitation in the sydney region large heavy winter and autumn storms are commonly associated with east coast lows which are intense low pressure systems that form in the tasman sea speer et al 2009 throughout the year cold fronts and inland troughs are a significant contributor to precipitation during the summer convective thunderstorms are a frequent occurrence sometimes accompanied by hail occasionally large bands of precipitation that produce infrequent but large events in the north west of nsw reach the sydney region four large scale drivers can influence climate on annual to decadal time scales the inter decadal pacific oscillation ipo southern annular mode sam el ni√±o southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole the effect of these drivers on eastern australian rainfall is described by speer et al 2011 and verdon and franks 2005 the ipo in its negative phase brings moist onshore winds at low levels which are important for rain on the eastern side of the ranges and coast in its negative phase sam enables dynamic processes that help to create rain systems in southern australia but is more likely to have a positive correlation with winter and spring precipitation in the sydney region ho et al 2012 enso in the la ni√±a phase brings moist tropical air to the inland areas of nsw particularly in winter and spring verdon and franks 2005 showed that winter rainfall in eastern australia is higher during years with a negative dipole mean index dmi but that variability in sea surface temperature sst over indonesia influences rainfall even when no dipole exists historically the gnip database contained monthly data on 3h Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in precipitation for seven australian locations and this data has been analysed by liu et al 2010 originally sydney was not selected as a gnip site because of the presence of a nuclear research reactor at lucas heights which had the potential to influence regional tritium results the nearest long term gnip sites to sydney are found in brisbane 750 km to the north and melbourne 700 km to the southwest more recently hollins et al 2018 published the results of an extended gnip data set comprising a longer dataset for the seven original sites and data for eight new sites with data from 2006 to 2014 in which a sydney site which is located near the airport was included higher resolution data for this region is reported by hughes and crawford 2013 who published the results of a five year time series 2005 to 2009 for four sites in the sydney region crawford et al 2013 undertook a more detailed study for one of these four sites mt werong for the same five year period mt werong at an elevation of 1178 m above sea level is 97 km from the ocean an additional study of daily precipitation was undertaken by crawford et al 2017 where daily samples were collected over a 7 year period 2008 2014 at a semi arid site located at the macquarie marshes 153 m above sea level 505 km from nearest coast new south wales australia this study reports daily based time series of Œ¥18o Œ¥2h and d excess d excess Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o dansgaard 1964 in precipitation over a 9 year period february 2011 to february 2020 and a 14 year october 2005 to february 2020 weekly sampled timeseries at lucas heights sydney australia the proximity of this site to the coast 15 km and its low elevation 152 m above sea level asl provide spatially complementary information to previous high resolution rainfall isotopic studies conducted in this region a study of atmospheric water vapour isotopes at lucas heights crawford et al 2019 clearly showed that vapour equilibrium with rainfall only persisted for less than a day indicating that local moisture recycling and sources are not dominant at the site this long daily time series offered the opportunity to investigate the impact of meteorological conditions on the isotopic composition of precipitation at a coastal site as well as the isotopic patterns from different weather systems the impact on the local meteoric water line when developed from data with different resolution from daily to weekly and monthly is also investigated and will give researchers insights into its behaviour at coastal sites the local meteoric water line is compared against the local meteoric water lines of the semi arid site macquarie marshes and the higher altitude site mt werong illustrating the impacts of different processes finally we investigated the degree to which radon based mixing categories can be used to identify different weather systems the fraction of convective stratiform precipitation and their impact on the isotopic composition of the resulting precipitation 2 methods and data 2 1 study site the sampling site is in the sydney basin located at the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto at lucas heights 34 03 s 150 59 e the site is approximately 30 km southwest of sydney fig 1 2 2 on site measurements local meteorological conditions are monitored on a 50 m instrumented tower and reported as 15 min averages the following parameters are measured wind speed m s 1 and wind direction at 10 and 49 m above ground level agl air temperature c at three heights 2 10 and 49 m agl atmospheric pressure hpa and relative humidity at 2 m agl and rainfall mm at the surface for this study wind speed and direction at 49 m agl are used as the isotopic analysis was conducted on the daily precipitation a precipitation weighted daily average of temperature and relative humidity is determined aside from the daily precipitation amount precipitation amounts are also available on 15 min resolution and as such only the temperature and relative humidity values recorded corresponding to those 15 min intervals for which precipitation was recorded are used 2 3 precipitation sample collection and analysis the sample collection procedure was detailed in hughes and crawford 2013 in summary precipitation was collected using hdpe samplers following the submerged tube design of gr√∂ning et al 2012 to minimise fractionation of the sample by evaporation or atmospheric vapour exchange samples were transferred in duplicate to 30 ml hdpe bottles after collection two sets of samples were collected in one case 24 hour composite precipitation samples were collected daily at 9 am containing precipitation from 9 am the previous day to 9 am of the sampling day in the other case composite weekly samples were collected following the collection of each sample the sampler was dried before redeployment Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were determined for 847 daily samples and 520 weekly samples with results expressed in per mille using the conventional delta notation relative to vsmow Œ¥ 1000 r sample r s tan d a r d 1 where r represents the 2h 1h or 18o 16o for the sample and the standard samples collected prior to october 2010 were analysed using a picarro l1115 i cavity ring down spectroscopy crds method at alberta research council isotope hydrology and geochemistry laboratory all samples collected from october 2010 onwards were analysed at the ansto environmental isotope laboratory using a cavity ring down spectroscopy method on a picarro l2120 i water analyser laboratory standards were calibrated against vsmow2 and slap2 and are detailed in crawford et al 2019 results are accurate to 1 0 for Œ¥2h and 0 15 for Œ¥18o given that we have two time series of isotopic composition at this site i e one collected at a daily interval and the second collected at a weekly interval quality assurance of the isotopic data was undertaken by calculating weekly precipitation weighted values of the daily data and comparing it against the weekly collected data the daily collected isotope data was available from february 2011 to february 2020 the weekly collected isotope data was available from october 2005 to february 2020 out of the 847 daily samples 40 were removed due to poor agreement with the weekly data resulting in 807 samples for the remainder of the analysis out of the 520 weekly samples 16 were removed resulting in 504 weekly samples figure s1 shows the agreement between weekly samples and precipitation weighted weekly data which were made up from the daily samples 2 4 radon measurements and atmospheric stability categories direct hourly radon measurements have been made at lucas heights since september 2006 using a 1500 l dual flow loop two filter radon detector for which the principle of operation has previously been described by chambers et al 2011 2014 the radon time series was then used to identify the atmospheric mixing categories a thorough description of the technique used to determine and apply the atmospheric mixing state classification scheme is provided in chambers et al 2015 but the focus of that investigation was atmospheric pollution in the sydney basin region briefly though the first step involved estimating and removing the impact of airmass fetch on observed radon concentrations by subtracting the interpolated series connecting the afternoon minimum radon concentrations the residual series is indicative of daily mixing influences on the radon concentration assuming a well distributed constant local source function once the daily component of radon variability has been isolated in this way see chambers et al 2015 the mean radon concentration for each night calculated from shortly after sunset until shortly prior to sunrise 1900 h 0500 h can be directly related to the mean state of atmospheric mixing for that night a nocturnal stability classification was then determined by 1 any nocturnal mean radon values that were less than zero were assigned to stability category 0 and 2 all positive values of the nocturnal mean radon concentration were subdivided into quartiles by season following which each 24 hour period from 3 pm to 3 pm containing a single whole night was assigned a mixing classification number between 1 and 4 corresponding to radon quartiles 1 to 4 respectively having assigned a mixing category to each whole 24 hour period based on the nocturnal mean stability of each night whole daily cycles of radon measurements were then grouped according to their mixing category the same classification scheme was then applied to the corresponding 9 am to 9 am rainfall measurement i e 24 hour period containing the same whole night 2 5 back trajectory analysis hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory draxler et al 2016 was used to generate 10 day back trajectories for each hour of each day on which rainfall was recorded meteorological data generated by the global data assimilation system gdas available at ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov archives gdas1 was used gdas is run by the national weather service s nws national centre for environmental prediction ncep and data is at 1ox1o resolution to examine moisture sources and rainout we use the location of the back trajectories the altitude relative humidity planetary boundary layer height and precipitation along the back trajectory e g friedman et al 2002 iaea 2005 barras and simmonds 2008 sodemann et al 2008 sjostrom and welker 2009 vachon et al 2010 these variables are interpolated by hysplit for each output point along the back trajectory to determine the location of the moisture source the method of sodemann et al 2008 was implemented as a first step the altitude of the cloud base was determined by generating a vertical profile of the relative humidity above the sampling site from the gdas datafiles which is one of the options of the hysplit system on examination of the vertical profiles the lowest altitude at which the relative humidity was greater than 80 as used by sodemann et al 2008 was between 1500 m above mean sea level msl and 2000 m msl as a result a starting height of 1500 m msl was chosen for back trajectory calculations following the method of sodemann et al 2008 locations at which new moisture entered the air mass were determined at points along the back trajectory where absolute humidity increased by more than 0 04 g kg 1 hr 1 and when the air mass was within the planetary boundary layer pbl when the absolute humidity in the air mass dropped below 0 05 g kg 1 it was assumed that no previously sourced moisture contributed to the current precipitation event sodemann et al 2008 baldini et al 2010 hence the trajectory was not traced further back in time a maximum length of ten days was used which corresponds to a mean residence time of water in the atmosphere of about 10 days trenberth 1998 gat 1996 friedman et al 2002 at locations where moisture was evaporated from the surface the relative humidity and temperature at surface level were extracted from hysplit the total precipitation from the air mass prior to reaching the sampling site was calculated as the sum of precipitation along the back trajectory from the last point where moisture was sourced for the current event 2 6 synoptic classification of rainfall systems to determine the relationship between the stable isotope composition of precipitation and the synoptic weather systems a modified classification system to that described by matthews and geerts 1995 see also speer and geerts 1994 was used the synoptic systems were classified as east coast lows intense low pressure systems located off the east coast of the site ecl speer et al 2009 referred to as offshore lows in matthews and geerts 1995 their locations can vary in latitude and longitude to the east and southeast of the site we also identified less intense low pressure systems and if they appeared to the north east east or south east of the sampling site in addition cut off lows were identified which are low pressure systems which have broken away from the main belt of low pressure which lies to the south of australia offshore high an offshore high pressure system located to the e se of the site these synoptic systems can occur both in winter and summer and generally low rainfall amounts are recorded inland troughs inland lows occur throughout the year and their location varies across eastern australia low pressure systems appearing over land which contained non cyclonic low pressure centres were identified as inland lows pre frontal where precipitation occurs ahead of the passing of a front post frontal where precipitation occurs during and immediately after the passaging of a front the mean sea level pressure mslp bom 2021 was used to identify the weather systems resulting in precipitation at the site to generate average sea level pressure maps the ncep ncar reanalysis sea level pressure data was used kalnay et al 1996 2 7 classification of convective rainfall periods of convective rainfall were determined using the method of llasat 2001 separate rainfall events are determined as those occurring at least one hour apart the fraction of convective precipitation Œ≤ is then determined according to the equation llasat 2001 1 Œ≤ i 1 n i t i t i Œ¥ t Œ∏ i l i 1 n i t i t i Œ¥ t where Œ¥t is the time interval of accumulation of the rainfall 15 min in this case n is the total number of 15 min rainfall steps in the episode i ti ti Œ¥t is the precipitation measured between time interval ti and ti Œ¥t and is divided by Œ¥t the value of Œ∏ i l is 1 for i l and zero otherwise l is chosen as 25 mm h in addition convective and total precipitation amount was sourced from the era interim global atmospheric reanalysis at ecmwf era interim daily https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily levtype sfc data was available to august 2019 with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 75 by 0 75 given the convective precipitation amount and total precipitation amount the ratio of convective precipitation was determined and the stratiform fraction was assumed as 1 the convective fraction 2 8 correlation with large climate drivers pearson correlation analysis was conducted between the large climate drivers and the isotopic composition of precipitation for this analysis the monthly precipitation weighted averages of the isotopic composition was determined and correlated with the monthly indices of each climate driver the indices of the three climate drivers were selected as follows the monthly southern oscillation index soi was used to characterise enso soi is a measure of the anomalous pressure difference between tahiti and darwin and the monthly soi was obtained from ftp ftp bom gov au anon home ncc www sco soi soiplaintext html the monthly dipole mode index dmi which is a characterisation of the indian ocean dipole was obtained from https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries data dmi had long data the monthly sam index was calculated as the anomaly between the difference in measured pressure at 40 s and 65 s this was sourced from https www nerc bas ac uk icd gjma sam html the methodology used to calculate the index was as outlined by marshall 2003 3 results 3 1 local meteorological conditions prior investigations at this site e g chambers et al 2011 crawford et al 2019 have indicated a pronounced seasonality in wind direction throughout the warmer months of the year oct mar mean wind directions have a strong easterly component indicating an oceanic fetch but tend to swing from southeast at night to directly east in the day indicating the influence of sea breezes throughout the cooler months apr sep the wind direction is predominantly south westerly as illustrated by the lucas heights wind roses supplementary figure s2 south easterly and north easterly winds dominate in summer whereas south westerly winds dominate in winter the long term 1958 to 2020 bureau of meteorology station 066078 annual average rainfall is 1000 mm with corresponding monthly averages of 95 1 108 5 123 7 90 3 75 0 103 0 54 6 69 7 51 1 70 1 89 9 and 76 3 mm january to december the polar plots in fig 2 show the rainfall amount and radon concentrations by wind direction and wind speed concentrations in the inner circle correspond to concentrations for the lowest wind speed and the wind speed increases as the radius of the circles increases 3 2 precipitation stable isotope data the time series both composite daily and composite weekly each collected separately of Œ¥18o and d excess are presented in fig 3 the Œ¥18o varied from 15 4 to 6 5 mean value of 3 0 with a close to symmetric distribution as evidenced in the Œ¥18o histogram of figure s3 the d excess values varied between 9 9 and 29 36 with a mean value of 13 8 the Œ¥2h in the precipitation varied from 99 3 to 34 1 mean value of 10 6 with a close to symmetric distribution as evidenced in the Œ¥2h histogram of figure s3 aside from the influence of synoptic weather systems the regional weather is also influenced by several large scale processes the most dominant of which is the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso risbey et al 2009 the el ni√±o and la ni√±a periods of enso correspond to times of lower and higher observed rainfall respectively these periods are marked in fig 3 the behaviour in the precipitation weighted average Œ¥18o values for each of the of el ni√±o and la ni√±a periods was not consistent the precipitation weighted Œ¥18o values during the three el ni√±o periods left to right in fig 3 were 4 06 5 26 and 4 25 whereas during the four la ni√±a periods once again left to right in fig 3 they were 3 46 5 04 4 99 and 3 97 the seasonal variation in Œ¥18o Œ¥2h reflects that of temperature with high Œ¥ values in the warmer period and lower Œ¥ values in the cooler period more negative Œ¥18o Œ¥2h values correspond to periods of higher precipitation amounts fig 4 figure s4 3 3 local meteoric water line lmwl the local meteoric water line lmwl developed using ordinary least squares regression olsr which represents the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o covariance is presented in fig 5 if we re visit the lmwls derived in hollins et al 2018 for sydney Œ¥2h 7 77Œ¥18o 15 19 for brisbane which is located north of sydney Œ¥2h 8 05Œ¥18o 13 67 and for melbourne which is located south of sydney Œ¥2h 7 78Œ¥18o 10 69 there are small differences in the slopes however much larger differences are seen in the intercept indicating evaporation under different relative humidity and temperature conditions this is the effect of kinetic fractionation during evaporation dansgaard 1964 from fig 5 we see that some of the spring and summer values plot below the lmwl indicating possible sub cloud evaporation of the raindrops to determine the impact of these samples on the development of the lmwl lmwls were calculated using two regression models olsr and precipitation amount weighted methods pwlsr pwlsr reduces the impact of post precipitation processes either in the atmosphere or for small precipitation amounts during sample collection as described in hughes and crawford 2012 in addition to olsr and pwlsr major axis least squared regression ma where the orthogonal or perpendicular distance from the line to the measured points is minimised and reduced major axis rma regression where the area of the triangle formed by the line and the measured points is minimised were also used crawford et al 2014 the precipitation weighted counterparts of rma and ma were also used referred to pwrma and pwma respectively the difference in the slopes of the lmwl determined using the different methods is significant tables s1 and s2 a significant finding is that when the lmwls are determined using the precipitation weighted methods little difference exist between those determined using the weekly data and those determined using the daily data 3 4 relationships with environmental variables to determine the impact of environmental conditions on the stable isotope composition of precipitation person correlations of selected environmental variables with the Œ¥18o values were determined table 1 the best correlation of Œ¥18o was with local temperature rainout of the air mass relative humidity in the air mass and rainfall amount at the site table 1 and plots in figure s5 a good correlation was also seen between the Œ¥18o values and the duration of the precipitation event 0 42 fig 6 one contributing factor to this would be the reduced influence of sub cloud processes when the relative humidity below the cloud is high as would occur if rainfall has already been received at the site graf et al 2019 this is supported by the behaviour of d excess with increasing rainfall duration fig 6 where there is an initial increase indicating the reduced sub cloud evaporation as the rainfall duration increases this is followed by leveling off and then a decrease of d excess for long lasting events which is most likely due to moisture being sourced under higher relative humidity the correlation between precipitation amount and Œ¥18o values was higher when daily samples were used than when the precipitation weighted monthly values were considered 0 36 as opposed to 0 31 3 5 relationships with stratiform fraction synoptic weather systems and large climate drivers 3 5 1 stratiform fraction of rainfall in this study we used two techniques to determine the proportion of rainfall that was of convective stratiform nature see section 2 7 the spatial grid resolution of the era interim data is 0 75 by 0 75 thus the values are regional averages whereas equation 1 is based on the rainfall amount at the site and then the intensity of the rainfall at the site is used as an indicator the correlation between the convective fraction as determined by equation 1 and that from the era interim data was 0 42 and significant the correlation between the stratiform fraction of rainfall as determined from era interim and Œ¥2h is as specified in table 2 for various lengths of rainfall duration in hours using equation 1 to determine convective rainfall the correlation between the convective fraction and the Œ¥ values of the precipitation was low r 0 19 however due to the small number of events identified as convective n 22 the correlation was not significant using the era interim data the correlation was 0 11 and was significant 3 5 2 synoptic types the number of occurrences by season for each synoptic type is presented in table 3 and the mslp maps of selected types are shown in fig 7 inland lows and inland troughs were more frequent in summer whereas the offshore highs were more frequent in autumn the highest rainfall occurred from offshore low pressure systems located to the north east followed by low pressure systems to the east the lowest Œ¥ values were associated with rainfall from ecls cutoff lows and lows to the east and north east of the sampling site low Œ¥ values from ecls were also found in crawford et al 2013 for the mt werong sampling site the highest convective fraction as estimated by equation 1 was for inland lows and throughs followed by offshore high pressure systems the samples identified as having convective fraction greater than 0 5 i e using equation 1 were classified in the synoptic types inland lows inland throughs offshore highs offshore lows located to the east and pre frontal these are the systems for which higher median Œ¥ values were recorded fig 8 3 5 3 large climate drivers the pearson correlations between the isotopic composition of the monthly precipitation weighted average Œ¥18o values and the soi and sam indices were low and not significant the correlation between Œ¥18o and soi was 0 02 and between Œ¥18o and sam was 0 12 the correlation of Œ¥18o and the dmi was 0 04 and not significant the correlations were still insignificant when the correlations were undertaken after the data was separated into seasons 3 6 radon based classification of the atmospheric mixing state near surface nocturnal radon observations were used to assign each day of the measurement period to one of 5 atmospheric mixing categories these categories numbered 0 to 4 represent 24 hour periods 1500 h to 1400 h the next day for which the nocturnal portion was 0 synoptically non stationary 1 windy well mixed 2 weakly stable 3 moderately stable and 4 most stable category 0 events were typically associated with the passage of strong frontal systems or large rapid fetch changes category 1 events were often associated with predominantly overcast conditions consistent wind and frequent rainfall at the other extreme category 4 events were typically associated with anti cyclonic conditions and calm to light winds average mslp maps for each stability category in summer are shown in fig 9 the other seasons are reproduced in the supplementary material stability category 0 is seen to correspond to the passage of a front through the sampling site inland troughs inland lows offshore highs and 30 of the post frontal systems were the main synoptic systems associated with stability category 0 the largest number of inland troughs inland lows offshore highs and offshore lows located to the east of the site appeared in stability categories 1 and 2 the mslp map of stability category 3 has some resemblance to the mslp map of inland troughs and several the offshore high systems and inland troughs were allocated to this stability category the largest proportion of the ecls occurred under stability category 1 table 4 back trajectory density maps show the regions covered by the back trajectories before reaching the sampling site fig 10 due to the extent of the covered region one can conclude that the wind speeds were the highest for stability category 0 and the lowest for stability category 4 3 6 1 isotopic composition and its relationship with precipitation amount per stability category by season when the data is separated by season the main differences are for stability category 0 which we can analyse further figure s11 in summer we see a similar behaviour to when the whole dataset is used in autumn category 0 shows higher median Œ¥ values with higher d excess values looking at the back trajectories fig 12 more overland and n e fetch occurs under stability category 0 in autumn the offshore high pressure systems dominated and the rainfall amount was lower on the other hand lower Œ¥ values are seen under stability category 0 in winter when high rainfall amounts were recorded at the sampling site the large rainfall amounts were from offshore lows located east of the site which are associated with lower Œ¥ values fig 8 in spring higher isotopic Œ¥ values are seen with lower d excess and the back trajectories show overland fetch fig 12 high isotopic Œ¥ values were previously seen when the moisture was sourced overland crawford et al 2013 possibly due to the vapour source being previously evaporated moisture the dominant synoptic systems were inland troughs lows and post frontal systems while the relationship between rainfall amount and Œ¥18o was low when all the data was considered by season table 5 there were small improvements in some of the stability categories when the data was subdivided by stability category this was also true for the relationship between the stable isotopes of precipitation and the local temperature and the duration of the rainfall period table 5 radon based stability categories group together periods of similar meteorological conditions so within these groups other factors contributing to the isotopic variability would also be better constrained this means that relationships like rainfall amount with isotopic composition show up more clearly since a lot of the other noise is removed 4 discussion 4 1 general discussion at a particular site the variation of environmental and physical conditions will result in larger variability in rainfall isotope composition under higher resolution sampling it is expected that these differences will be averaged out when lower resolution sampling is undertaken however in this study the difference in the precipitation weighted means between the weekly and daily samples was not statistically significant p values were 0 1 and 0 15 for Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h respectively using the daily samples the lmwl was 7 39 Œ¥18o 11 89 whereas using the weekly samples it was 7 28 Œ¥18o 11 69 and when monthly precipitation weighted values were considered the lmwl was 7 26Œ¥18o 11 92 this shows small differences in the three lmwls indicating that the variability at this site is not significant these slopes and intercepts are lower than that reported by hughes and crawford 2013 for this site when 4 years of weekly sampled data were available 7 74 Œ¥18o 13 6 and the difference in the slopes was statistically significant the period of the weekly data in hughes and crawford 2013 was 2005 to 2009 in this study the weekly data has been extended to 2019 whereas the current daily data is for the years 2011 to 2019 in the 2005 to 2009 period the precipitation weighted mean values of the weekly data were 22 64 4 79 15 73 for Œ¥2h Œ¥18o and d excess respectively for the weekly samples from 2005 to 2019 the precipitation weighted mean values were 22 87 4 85 and 15 9 for Œ¥2h Œ¥18o and d excess respectively for the 2011 to 2019 period the precipitation weighted mean of the daily samples were 23 69 4 87 15 32 for Œ¥2h Œ¥18o and d excess respectively the differences are small however when a welch two sample t test was performed for the difference in the means between the weekly and the daily samples the p values were 0 03 0 09 and 0 05 for Œ¥18o Œ¥2h and d excess 4 2 impact of environmental variables from the polar plot fig 2 it is evident that for the high rainfall events in summer the moisture is sourced from the east in autumn from the south and it is more variable for winter and spring while the smoothed Œ¥18o values exhibit a seasonal trend a variation is evident within each season fig 3 the smoothed curve for d excess shows higher d excess values corresponding to lower Œ¥18o values during the colder months of the year and vice versa during the warmer months of the year this behaviour can broadly be explained by the conditions at the moisture source followed by conditions in the cloud and finally conditions at the site of precipitation the isotopic composition and d excess of precipitation is affected by the conditions at the moisture source where water vapour has higher Œ¥ values with higher sea surface temperature rahul et al 2018 and the d excess increases with temperature but decreases with relative humidity uemura et al 2008 higher Œ¥ values correspond to higher sea surface temperature which is reflected in this study with a significant correlation coefficient of 0 35 between Œ¥18o and the average sea surface temperature table 1 in cloud condensation is generally an equilibrium process and as the equilibrium fractionation factors are temperature dependant precipitation forming at higher air temperatures has higher Œ¥ values than precipitation forming at lower air temperatures beria et al 2018 this is reflected in our result where the correlation between Œ¥18o and the temperature in the back trajectory is 0 41 and significant table 1 another contributing factor to higher Œ¥ values and lower d excess values is sub cloud evaporation which is higher under higher temperatures and lower relative humidity jacob and sonntag 1991 froehlich et al 2008 peng et al 2010 in this study this is supported by the positive correlation of the Œ¥18o values with local temperature and the negative correlation with local relative humidity table 1 further small precipitation events experience more sub cloud evaporation this is evident in the plot of Œ¥2h against precipitation amount fig 4 which shows a sharper decrease for precipitation amount of up to 6 mm which is most likely because of the smaller precipitation experiencing more sub cloud evaporation this is supported by the lower d excess values when the precipitation amount was 6 mm the mean d excess value of the set of samples where the precipitation amount was 6 mm was 12 6 as opposed to 15 3 for the remaining set of samples the difference is statistically significant with a p value of 0 001 the sub cloud evaporation is also supported by fig 5 where several summer and spring samples plot to the top right of the lmwl sub cloud evaporation is reduced for long and widespread rainfall events due to the isotopic equilibration of rainfall with the surrounding air fig 6 shows decreasing Œ¥ values with increasing rainfall duration although previous rainfall from the air mass would also result in lower Œ¥ values this is supported by a significant correlation coefficient of 0 40 between the Œ¥18o and the total rainfall from the air mass in the last 24 h table 1 another factor that affects the d excess of precipitation is moisture recycling particularly higher d excess values are seen when moisture has evaporated over the land surface jacob and sonntag 1991 froehlich et al 2008 peng et al 2010 the impact of sub cloud evaporation and moisture recycling is illustrated by the intercepts of the lmwls at the macquarie marshes and mt werong respectively using olsr the lmwl for mt werong was Œ¥2h 7 81Œ¥18o 16 6 hughes and crawford 2013 for the macquarie marshes it was Œ¥2h 6 96 Œ¥18o 6 4 crawford et al 2017 and for lucas heights it is Œ¥2h 7 28Œ¥18o 11 69 rainfall at the macquarie marshes a semi arid region is subject to sub cloud evaporation leading to the lower slope and intercept although it was shown that at this site another contribution factor was that moisture could also be sourced from perviously evaporated water whereas at mt werong moisture re cycling leads to higher intercept putman et al 2019 crawford et al 2013 4 3 synoptic types synoptic weather systems group similar atmospheric conditions and as such the impacts described above would be reflected in the different synoptic weather systems during the warmer months of the year the subtropical ridge is further south leading to moist easterly winds and the formation of low pressure systems on the east coast also inland troughs and lows are more common in summer table 3 which result in higher Œ¥18o values fig 8 these events are generally of short duration and associated with convective precipitation both of which contribute to the higher Œ¥ values guan et al 2013 also identified inland troughs leading to precipitation at a coastal area in south australia they found that these systems sourced inland moisture and the d excess varied between 10 and 15 in this study the median d excess from inland troughs was 14 with the 25th percentile being 9 6 and the 75th percentile being 17 9 in the cooler months of the year the subtropical ridge is further north and hence rainfall tends to be associated with fronts from the southwest the lowest rainfall is received from westerlies in which case air masses would have travelled considerable distance over land over the dry interior of the continent before arriving at the sampling site lower Œ¥ values were observed at the lucas heights site in atmospheric vapour during westerly dominated fetch crawford et al 2019 these air masses also are likely to have experienced some rainout before reaching the sampling site which could be one of the contributing factors to the lower Œ¥ values in winter from table 1 the correlation between the Œ¥18o of precipitation and the total rainfall from the air mass in the last 24 h is 0 40 and is significant another factor explaining lower Œ¥ values in winter would be that sub cloud evaporation of raindrops would be expected to be lower in winter due to the lower temperature and higher relative humidity figure s4 in autumn and winter ecls are more common table 3 from fig 8 lower median Œ¥18o values are observed in rainfall from the low pressure systems located to the east and north east of the site consistent with previous studies for the south east coast of mainland australia crawford et al 2013 2017 and in tasmania treble et al 2005 4 4 stratiform fraction of rainfall the correlation between stratiform fraction of rainfall and Œ¥2h improved with increasing duration of rainfall table 2 for longer rainfall events the impact of sub cloud evaporation reduces resulting in the isotopic composition of the precipitation better reflecting the conditions at the moisture source and the in cloud processes this is consistent with the findings of zwart et al 2016 2018 who reported that the relationship between the stratiform fraction and the isotopic composition of the precipitation was improved when the horizontal extent of the raining area was large 4 5 radon based classification of atmospheric mixing state rainfall as a function of stability category fig 11 shows a clear trend with the highest median rainfall occurring during stability categories 0 and 1 and then a decreasing trend for stability categories 2 to 4 there is a slight increasing trend in the median Œ¥ values of precipitation up to stability category 3 fig 11 stability category 4 had the lowest rainfall amount and its highest occurrence was in summer and autumn table 4 and from fig 11 we see a large range in Œ¥ values in addition lower d excess values occur for category 4 rainfall days indicating that sub cloud evaporation might have altered the isotopic composition of the precipitation which is consistent with warm anti cyclonic conditions during the daytime of category 4 days one of the aims of this work was to investigate whether radon based mixing classification could assist in the identification of convective precipitation out of the 18 daily samples identified as having a convective rainfall fraction Œ≤ in equation 1 0 5 4 were in stability category 0 4 were in stability category 1 3 in stability category 2 1 in stability category 3 and 6 in stability category 4 however the rainfall and duration of rainfall was low for those events that were classified in stability category 4 a problem with the radon based classification scheme is that it is based on nocturnal observations and corresponding daytime conditions are inferred based on an assumption of short term atmospheric persistence consequently the edges of the 24 hour 3 pm to 2 pm classification window have the greatest uncertainty these edges which fall in the mid afternoon correspond with the time that convective rainfall also occurs under category 4 conditions stable nights and convective days blocking high pressure systems occur to the east of the site fig 9 and when the stagnant air warms up during the afternoon vertical mixing occurs and short duration convective rainfall can be experienced the radon based mixing classification method was developed for and has been successful in urban air quality studies e g chambers et al 2015 for which exceedance events typically happen when there is little active convective mixing however for stable isotope studies further investigations and possibly some refinement is necessary perrino et al 2001 for example suggest using the rate of change in radon concentration in the morning and evening bracketing the daytime to look at daytime mixing rather than in the evening and morning bracketing the night while the relationship between rainfall amount and Œ¥18o was low when all the data was considered by season table 5 there were notable improvements in some of the stability categories when the data was subdivided by stability category this was also true for the relationship between the stable isotopes of precipitation and the local temperature and the duration of the rainfall period table 5 radon based stability categories group together periods of similar meteorological conditions so within these groups other factors contributing to the isotopic variability would also be better constrained this means that relationships like rainfall amount with isotopic composition show up more clearly since a lot of the other noise is removed 5 conclusions nine years of daily based rainfall samples and 14 years of weekly based rainfall samples were analysed the impact of environmental conditions synoptic types and fraction of convective cloud on the isotopic composition of precipitation was investigated in addition the usefulness of radon classified state of the atmosphere was investigated to see if this will assist in the analysis of the stable isotope composition of precipitation small differences in the local meteoric water lines were seen when developed using daily weekly or monthly data the intention of these calculations was to progressively reduce the effect of short term small atmospheric variability by increasing the duration of averaging a significant finding is that when the lmwls are determined using the precipitation weighted methods little difference exist between those lmwls determined using the weekly data and those determined using the daily data factors affecting the isotopic composition of precipitation were investigated from the impact of environmental variables to the impact of synoptic weather systems and finally the impact of large scale climate drivers e g el ni√±o southern oscillation when environmental conditions were examined the best correlation of Œ¥18o was with local temperature rainout of the air mass and rainfall amount at the site a good correlation was also seen between the Œ¥18o values and the duration of the precipitation 0 42 the correlation between the fraction of convective rainfall and the Œ¥18o values was significant but low 0 11 however a trend was seen where the correlation with the stratiform fraction improved as the duration of rainfall increased indicating lower impact of sub cloud evaporation on a synoptic weather systems basis the lowest Œ¥ values were seen in rainfall from east coast lows however the largest rainfall was seen from low pressure systems arriving from the north east some of which would have been the tail end of ex tropical cyclones the influence of the large climate drivers on the isotopic composition of precipitation was insignificant at this coastal site when radon 222 was used the rainfall amount by stability category showed a clear trend with the lowest amount of rainfall during category 4 conditions most of the convective rainfall occurred for this same period consistent with strong convective events developing on the hottest days under low gradient wind conditions this type of convective rainfall however is very localised and spatially heterogeneous often leading to low rainfall amounts or events being missed while the radon based classification produced identifiable mean sea level patterns and a good indication of the rainfall amount it was less useful for the isotopic composition of precipitation other than the lower median d excess for stability category 4 analysing the data using stability categories improved the correlations with rainfall amount for some of the stability categories further investigation is needed to see whether the identification of convective rainfall events using radon can be improved such as by directly targeting daytime rather than nocturnal conditions as is the case for air quality studies credit authorship contribution statement j crawford conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology software validation

2317,daily and weekly rainfall stable isotopic data collected over a 9 year period for daily and 14 year period for weekly at lucas heights australia were compared small differences in the local meteoric water lines lmwls were seen when developed using daily weekly or monthly data where the effect of short term small atmospheric variability is reduced by the associated averaging although if a precipitation weighted least squares method was used to derive the lmwls the differences between the daily and weekly derived lmwls were lower a systematic analysis was then conducted of the impact on the isotopic composition of precipitation from environmental conditions at the sampling site and along the air mass trajectory the synoptic weather systems and finally large scale climate drivers e g el ni√±o southern oscillation the best correlation of Œ¥18o was with local temperature rainout of the air mass and rainfall amount at the site the correlation between precipitation amount and Œ¥18o values was higher when daily samples were used than when the precipitation weighted monthly values were considered 0 36 as opposed to 0 31 a good correlation was also seen between Œ¥18o and duration of the precipitation event r 0 42 the correlation between Œ¥18o and the fraction of convective rainfall was significant but low r 0 11 on a synoptic systems basis the lowest Œ¥ values were seen in rainfall from offshore low pressure systems located to the east or north east of the site although the largest rainfall was seen from low pressure systems arriving from the north east the influence of the large scale climate drivers on the isotopic composition of precipitation was insignificant at this coastal site when radon 222 was used to categorise the atmospheric mixing state rainfall amount was clearly negatively correlated with nocturnal stability with the lowest amount of rainfall occurring on days with the most stable nocturnal periods most of the convective rainfall occurred on these same days occurring after the warmer period of the day although the total rainfall amount was low analysing the data within the separate radon derived stability categories improved the correlations with rainfall amount for some of the stability categories keywords stable isotopes precipitation radon lmwl data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the stable isotopic 2h 1h and 18o 16o composition of precipitation is affected by a range of physical atmospheric and geographic influences originally these dependencies were largely investigated using data from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip e g dansgaard 1964 aragu√°s aragu√°s et al 2000 physical influences include the characteristics of the moisture source rainout en route from the moisture source to the sampling site and the amount of precipitation at the sampling site dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 atmospheric influences include the temperature and relative humidity at the moisture source and post condensation isotope exchange either in the cloud or in the atmosphere where re evaporation of the raindrop can occur as it falls to the ground rozanski et al 1993 the degree of re evaporation is affected by local temperature and relative humidity combinations of these influences result in relationships by geographical location and have allowed for the development of regression models between the stable isotopes of precipitation and the temperature at the sampling site the elevation of the site the distance from the coast the latitude of the site and rainfall amount at the site dansgaard 1964 most commonly the temperature and rainfall amount at the sampling site have provided the basis for empirical models used to interpret paleoclimate records rozanski et al 1993 mcdermott 2004 field 2010 vachon et al 2010 treble et al 2013 sun et al 2018 markowska et al 2020 more recently aggarwal et al 2012 showed that the 18o fraction of precipitation is positively correlated with the log of atmospheric moisture residence time rt where rt is defined as the ratio of total precipitable water to precipitation rate an association also exists between synoptic weather systems and stable isotopes of the corresponding precipitation e g scholl et al 2009 crawford et al 2013 2017 munksgaard et al 2015 zwart et al 2016 2018 most of the precipitation at mid latitudes and tropical locations has been associated with one of two basic cloud types convective or stratiform houze 1981 a negative relationship has been shown between the isotopic composition of precipitation and the stratiform fraction of the cloud aggarwal et al 2016 particularly when the horizontal extent of the raining areas was large zwart et al 2016 2018 if the range of variability in atmospheric conditions could be better constrained then physical relationships may become clearer classification of the atmospheric mixing state using near surface 222rn radon observations e g chambers et al 2019a chambers et al 2019b williams et al 2016 is an effective tool for grouping measurement days with broadly similar synoptic meteorological conditions chambers et al 2020 radon is a naturally occurring inert radioactive gas t0 5 3 82 days with a predominantly terrestrial source over land the variability of radon both spatially and temporarily is small radon flux 16 26 mbqm 2 s 1 schery and wasiolek 1998 goto et al 2008 griffiths et al 2010 the radon classification approach isolates conditions of strong synoptic non stationarity category 0 and then groups conditions in four other categories 1 4 ranging from dominant cyclonic conditions to dominant anti cyclonic conditions overall rainfall amount typically reduces from category 0 to 4 e g kikaj et al 2019 kikaj et al 2020 with convective rainfall typically most likely to occur under category 0 1 or 4 conditions the sydney region of australia has a temperate climate with warm to hot summers whilst there is no distinct dry season the wettest months tend to be from january to march with moderate inter annual rainfall variability several meteorological patterns are associated with precipitation in the sydney region large heavy winter and autumn storms are commonly associated with east coast lows which are intense low pressure systems that form in the tasman sea speer et al 2009 throughout the year cold fronts and inland troughs are a significant contributor to precipitation during the summer convective thunderstorms are a frequent occurrence sometimes accompanied by hail occasionally large bands of precipitation that produce infrequent but large events in the north west of nsw reach the sydney region four large scale drivers can influence climate on annual to decadal time scales the inter decadal pacific oscillation ipo southern annular mode sam el ni√±o southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole the effect of these drivers on eastern australian rainfall is described by speer et al 2011 and verdon and franks 2005 the ipo in its negative phase brings moist onshore winds at low levels which are important for rain on the eastern side of the ranges and coast in its negative phase sam enables dynamic processes that help to create rain systems in southern australia but is more likely to have a positive correlation with winter and spring precipitation in the sydney region ho et al 2012 enso in the la ni√±a phase brings moist tropical air to the inland areas of nsw particularly in winter and spring verdon and franks 2005 showed that winter rainfall in eastern australia is higher during years with a negative dipole mean index dmi but that variability in sea surface temperature sst over indonesia influences rainfall even when no dipole exists historically the gnip database contained monthly data on 3h Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in precipitation for seven australian locations and this data has been analysed by liu et al 2010 originally sydney was not selected as a gnip site because of the presence of a nuclear research reactor at lucas heights which had the potential to influence regional tritium results the nearest long term gnip sites to sydney are found in brisbane 750 km to the north and melbourne 700 km to the southwest more recently hollins et al 2018 published the results of an extended gnip data set comprising a longer dataset for the seven original sites and data for eight new sites with data from 2006 to 2014 in which a sydney site which is located near the airport was included higher resolution data for this region is reported by hughes and crawford 2013 who published the results of a five year time series 2005 to 2009 for four sites in the sydney region crawford et al 2013 undertook a more detailed study for one of these four sites mt werong for the same five year period mt werong at an elevation of 1178 m above sea level is 97 km from the ocean an additional study of daily precipitation was undertaken by crawford et al 2017 where daily samples were collected over a 7 year period 2008 2014 at a semi arid site located at the macquarie marshes 153 m above sea level 505 km from nearest coast new south wales australia this study reports daily based time series of Œ¥18o Œ¥2h and d excess d excess Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o dansgaard 1964 in precipitation over a 9 year period february 2011 to february 2020 and a 14 year october 2005 to february 2020 weekly sampled timeseries at lucas heights sydney australia the proximity of this site to the coast 15 km and its low elevation 152 m above sea level asl provide spatially complementary information to previous high resolution rainfall isotopic studies conducted in this region a study of atmospheric water vapour isotopes at lucas heights crawford et al 2019 clearly showed that vapour equilibrium with rainfall only persisted for less than a day indicating that local moisture recycling and sources are not dominant at the site this long daily time series offered the opportunity to investigate the impact of meteorological conditions on the isotopic composition of precipitation at a coastal site as well as the isotopic patterns from different weather systems the impact on the local meteoric water line when developed from data with different resolution from daily to weekly and monthly is also investigated and will give researchers insights into its behaviour at coastal sites the local meteoric water line is compared against the local meteoric water lines of the semi arid site macquarie marshes and the higher altitude site mt werong illustrating the impacts of different processes finally we investigated the degree to which radon based mixing categories can be used to identify different weather systems the fraction of convective stratiform precipitation and their impact on the isotopic composition of the resulting precipitation 2 methods and data 2 1 study site the sampling site is in the sydney basin located at the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto at lucas heights 34 03 s 150 59 e the site is approximately 30 km southwest of sydney fig 1 2 2 on site measurements local meteorological conditions are monitored on a 50 m instrumented tower and reported as 15 min averages the following parameters are measured wind speed m s 1 and wind direction at 10 and 49 m above ground level agl air temperature c at three heights 2 10 and 49 m agl atmospheric pressure hpa and relative humidity at 2 m agl and rainfall mm at the surface for this study wind speed and direction at 49 m agl are used as the isotopic analysis was conducted on the daily precipitation a precipitation weighted daily average of temperature and relative humidity is determined aside from the daily precipitation amount precipitation amounts are also available on 15 min resolution and as such only the temperature and relative humidity values recorded corresponding to those 15 min intervals for which precipitation was recorded are used 2 3 precipitation sample collection and analysis the sample collection procedure was detailed in hughes and crawford 2013 in summary precipitation was collected using hdpe samplers following the submerged tube design of gr√∂ning et al 2012 to minimise fractionation of the sample by evaporation or atmospheric vapour exchange samples were transferred in duplicate to 30 ml hdpe bottles after collection two sets of samples were collected in one case 24 hour composite precipitation samples were collected daily at 9 am containing precipitation from 9 am the previous day to 9 am of the sampling day in the other case composite weekly samples were collected following the collection of each sample the sampler was dried before redeployment Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were determined for 847 daily samples and 520 weekly samples with results expressed in per mille using the conventional delta notation relative to vsmow Œ¥ 1000 r sample r s tan d a r d 1 where r represents the 2h 1h or 18o 16o for the sample and the standard samples collected prior to october 2010 were analysed using a picarro l1115 i cavity ring down spectroscopy crds method at alberta research council isotope hydrology and geochemistry laboratory all samples collected from october 2010 onwards were analysed at the ansto environmental isotope laboratory using a cavity ring down spectroscopy method on a picarro l2120 i water analyser laboratory standards were calibrated against vsmow2 and slap2 and are detailed in crawford et al 2019 results are accurate to 1 0 for Œ¥2h and 0 15 for Œ¥18o given that we have two time series of isotopic composition at this site i e one collected at a daily interval and the second collected at a weekly interval quality assurance of the isotopic data was undertaken by calculating weekly precipitation weighted values of the daily data and comparing it against the weekly collected data the daily collected isotope data was available from february 2011 to february 2020 the weekly collected isotope data was available from october 2005 to february 2020 out of the 847 daily samples 40 were removed due to poor agreement with the weekly data resulting in 807 samples for the remainder of the analysis out of the 520 weekly samples 16 were removed resulting in 504 weekly samples figure s1 shows the agreement between weekly samples and precipitation weighted weekly data which were made up from the daily samples 2 4 radon measurements and atmospheric stability categories direct hourly radon measurements have been made at lucas heights since september 2006 using a 1500 l dual flow loop two filter radon detector for which the principle of operation has previously been described by chambers et al 2011 2014 the radon time series was then used to identify the atmospheric mixing categories a thorough description of the technique used to determine and apply the atmospheric mixing state classification scheme is provided in chambers et al 2015 but the focus of that investigation was atmospheric pollution in the sydney basin region briefly though the first step involved estimating and removing the impact of airmass fetch on observed radon concentrations by subtracting the interpolated series connecting the afternoon minimum radon concentrations the residual series is indicative of daily mixing influences on the radon concentration assuming a well distributed constant local source function once the daily component of radon variability has been isolated in this way see chambers et al 2015 the mean radon concentration for each night calculated from shortly after sunset until shortly prior to sunrise 1900 h 0500 h can be directly related to the mean state of atmospheric mixing for that night a nocturnal stability classification was then determined by 1 any nocturnal mean radon values that were less than zero were assigned to stability category 0 and 2 all positive values of the nocturnal mean radon concentration were subdivided into quartiles by season following which each 24 hour period from 3 pm to 3 pm containing a single whole night was assigned a mixing classification number between 1 and 4 corresponding to radon quartiles 1 to 4 respectively having assigned a mixing category to each whole 24 hour period based on the nocturnal mean stability of each night whole daily cycles of radon measurements were then grouped according to their mixing category the same classification scheme was then applied to the corresponding 9 am to 9 am rainfall measurement i e 24 hour period containing the same whole night 2 5 back trajectory analysis hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory draxler et al 2016 was used to generate 10 day back trajectories for each hour of each day on which rainfall was recorded meteorological data generated by the global data assimilation system gdas available at ftp arlftp arlhq noaa gov archives gdas1 was used gdas is run by the national weather service s nws national centre for environmental prediction ncep and data is at 1ox1o resolution to examine moisture sources and rainout we use the location of the back trajectories the altitude relative humidity planetary boundary layer height and precipitation along the back trajectory e g friedman et al 2002 iaea 2005 barras and simmonds 2008 sodemann et al 2008 sjostrom and welker 2009 vachon et al 2010 these variables are interpolated by hysplit for each output point along the back trajectory to determine the location of the moisture source the method of sodemann et al 2008 was implemented as a first step the altitude of the cloud base was determined by generating a vertical profile of the relative humidity above the sampling site from the gdas datafiles which is one of the options of the hysplit system on examination of the vertical profiles the lowest altitude at which the relative humidity was greater than 80 as used by sodemann et al 2008 was between 1500 m above mean sea level msl and 2000 m msl as a result a starting height of 1500 m msl was chosen for back trajectory calculations following the method of sodemann et al 2008 locations at which new moisture entered the air mass were determined at points along the back trajectory where absolute humidity increased by more than 0 04 g kg 1 hr 1 and when the air mass was within the planetary boundary layer pbl when the absolute humidity in the air mass dropped below 0 05 g kg 1 it was assumed that no previously sourced moisture contributed to the current precipitation event sodemann et al 2008 baldini et al 2010 hence the trajectory was not traced further back in time a maximum length of ten days was used which corresponds to a mean residence time of water in the atmosphere of about 10 days trenberth 1998 gat 1996 friedman et al 2002 at locations where moisture was evaporated from the surface the relative humidity and temperature at surface level were extracted from hysplit the total precipitation from the air mass prior to reaching the sampling site was calculated as the sum of precipitation along the back trajectory from the last point where moisture was sourced for the current event 2 6 synoptic classification of rainfall systems to determine the relationship between the stable isotope composition of precipitation and the synoptic weather systems a modified classification system to that described by matthews and geerts 1995 see also speer and geerts 1994 was used the synoptic systems were classified as east coast lows intense low pressure systems located off the east coast of the site ecl speer et al 2009 referred to as offshore lows in matthews and geerts 1995 their locations can vary in latitude and longitude to the east and southeast of the site we also identified less intense low pressure systems and if they appeared to the north east east or south east of the sampling site in addition cut off lows were identified which are low pressure systems which have broken away from the main belt of low pressure which lies to the south of australia offshore high an offshore high pressure system located to the e se of the site these synoptic systems can occur both in winter and summer and generally low rainfall amounts are recorded inland troughs inland lows occur throughout the year and their location varies across eastern australia low pressure systems appearing over land which contained non cyclonic low pressure centres were identified as inland lows pre frontal where precipitation occurs ahead of the passing of a front post frontal where precipitation occurs during and immediately after the passaging of a front the mean sea level pressure mslp bom 2021 was used to identify the weather systems resulting in precipitation at the site to generate average sea level pressure maps the ncep ncar reanalysis sea level pressure data was used kalnay et al 1996 2 7 classification of convective rainfall periods of convective rainfall were determined using the method of llasat 2001 separate rainfall events are determined as those occurring at least one hour apart the fraction of convective precipitation Œ≤ is then determined according to the equation llasat 2001 1 Œ≤ i 1 n i t i t i Œ¥ t Œ∏ i l i 1 n i t i t i Œ¥ t where Œ¥t is the time interval of accumulation of the rainfall 15 min in this case n is the total number of 15 min rainfall steps in the episode i ti ti Œ¥t is the precipitation measured between time interval ti and ti Œ¥t and is divided by Œ¥t the value of Œ∏ i l is 1 for i l and zero otherwise l is chosen as 25 mm h in addition convective and total precipitation amount was sourced from the era interim global atmospheric reanalysis at ecmwf era interim daily https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily levtype sfc data was available to august 2019 with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 75 by 0 75 given the convective precipitation amount and total precipitation amount the ratio of convective precipitation was determined and the stratiform fraction was assumed as 1 the convective fraction 2 8 correlation with large climate drivers pearson correlation analysis was conducted between the large climate drivers and the isotopic composition of precipitation for this analysis the monthly precipitation weighted averages of the isotopic composition was determined and correlated with the monthly indices of each climate driver the indices of the three climate drivers were selected as follows the monthly southern oscillation index soi was used to characterise enso soi is a measure of the anomalous pressure difference between tahiti and darwin and the monthly soi was obtained from ftp ftp bom gov au anon home ncc www sco soi soiplaintext html the monthly dipole mode index dmi which is a characterisation of the indian ocean dipole was obtained from https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries data dmi had long data the monthly sam index was calculated as the anomaly between the difference in measured pressure at 40 s and 65 s this was sourced from https www nerc bas ac uk icd gjma sam html the methodology used to calculate the index was as outlined by marshall 2003 3 results 3 1 local meteorological conditions prior investigations at this site e g chambers et al 2011 crawford et al 2019 have indicated a pronounced seasonality in wind direction throughout the warmer months of the year oct mar mean wind directions have a strong easterly component indicating an oceanic fetch but tend to swing from southeast at night to directly east in the day indicating the influence of sea breezes throughout the cooler months apr sep the wind direction is predominantly south westerly as illustrated by the lucas heights wind roses supplementary figure s2 south easterly and north easterly winds dominate in summer whereas south westerly winds dominate in winter the long term 1958 to 2020 bureau of meteorology station 066078 annual average rainfall is 1000 mm with corresponding monthly averages of 95 1 108 5 123 7 90 3 75 0 103 0 54 6 69 7 51 1 70 1 89 9 and 76 3 mm january to december the polar plots in fig 2 show the rainfall amount and radon concentrations by wind direction and wind speed concentrations in the inner circle correspond to concentrations for the lowest wind speed and the wind speed increases as the radius of the circles increases 3 2 precipitation stable isotope data the time series both composite daily and composite weekly each collected separately of Œ¥18o and d excess are presented in fig 3 the Œ¥18o varied from 15 4 to 6 5 mean value of 3 0 with a close to symmetric distribution as evidenced in the Œ¥18o histogram of figure s3 the d excess values varied between 9 9 and 29 36 with a mean value of 13 8 the Œ¥2h in the precipitation varied from 99 3 to 34 1 mean value of 10 6 with a close to symmetric distribution as evidenced in the Œ¥2h histogram of figure s3 aside from the influence of synoptic weather systems the regional weather is also influenced by several large scale processes the most dominant of which is the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso risbey et al 2009 the el ni√±o and la ni√±a periods of enso correspond to times of lower and higher observed rainfall respectively these periods are marked in fig 3 the behaviour in the precipitation weighted average Œ¥18o values for each of the of el ni√±o and la ni√±a periods was not consistent the precipitation weighted Œ¥18o values during the three el ni√±o periods left to right in fig 3 were 4 06 5 26 and 4 25 whereas during the four la ni√±a periods once again left to right in fig 3 they were 3 46 5 04 4 99 and 3 97 the seasonal variation in Œ¥18o Œ¥2h reflects that of temperature with high Œ¥ values in the warmer period and lower Œ¥ values in the cooler period more negative Œ¥18o Œ¥2h values correspond to periods of higher precipitation amounts fig 4 figure s4 3 3 local meteoric water line lmwl the local meteoric water line lmwl developed using ordinary least squares regression olsr which represents the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o covariance is presented in fig 5 if we re visit the lmwls derived in hollins et al 2018 for sydney Œ¥2h 7 77Œ¥18o 15 19 for brisbane which is located north of sydney Œ¥2h 8 05Œ¥18o 13 67 and for melbourne which is located south of sydney Œ¥2h 7 78Œ¥18o 10 69 there are small differences in the slopes however much larger differences are seen in the intercept indicating evaporation under different relative humidity and temperature conditions this is the effect of kinetic fractionation during evaporation dansgaard 1964 from fig 5 we see that some of the spring and summer values plot below the lmwl indicating possible sub cloud evaporation of the raindrops to determine the impact of these samples on the development of the lmwl lmwls were calculated using two regression models olsr and precipitation amount weighted methods pwlsr pwlsr reduces the impact of post precipitation processes either in the atmosphere or for small precipitation amounts during sample collection as described in hughes and crawford 2012 in addition to olsr and pwlsr major axis least squared regression ma where the orthogonal or perpendicular distance from the line to the measured points is minimised and reduced major axis rma regression where the area of the triangle formed by the line and the measured points is minimised were also used crawford et al 2014 the precipitation weighted counterparts of rma and ma were also used referred to pwrma and pwma respectively the difference in the slopes of the lmwl determined using the different methods is significant tables s1 and s2 a significant finding is that when the lmwls are determined using the precipitation weighted methods little difference exist between those determined using the weekly data and those determined using the daily data 3 4 relationships with environmental variables to determine the impact of environmental conditions on the stable isotope composition of precipitation person correlations of selected environmental variables with the Œ¥18o values were determined table 1 the best correlation of Œ¥18o was with local temperature rainout of the air mass relative humidity in the air mass and rainfall amount at the site table 1 and plots in figure s5 a good correlation was also seen between the Œ¥18o values and the duration of the precipitation event 0 42 fig 6 one contributing factor to this would be the reduced influence of sub cloud processes when the relative humidity below the cloud is high as would occur if rainfall has already been received at the site graf et al 2019 this is supported by the behaviour of d excess with increasing rainfall duration fig 6 where there is an initial increase indicating the reduced sub cloud evaporation as the rainfall duration increases this is followed by leveling off and then a decrease of d excess for long lasting events which is most likely due to moisture being sourced under higher relative humidity the correlation between precipitation amount and Œ¥18o values was higher when daily samples were used than when the precipitation weighted monthly values were considered 0 36 as opposed to 0 31 3 5 relationships with stratiform fraction synoptic weather systems and large climate drivers 3 5 1 stratiform fraction of rainfall in this study we used two techniques to determine the proportion of rainfall that was of convective stratiform nature see section 2 7 the spatial grid resolution of the era interim data is 0 75 by 0 75 thus the values are regional averages whereas equation 1 is based on the rainfall amount at the site and then the intensity of the rainfall at the site is used as an indicator the correlation between the convective fraction as determined by equation 1 and that from the era interim data was 0 42 and significant the correlation between the stratiform fraction of rainfall as determined from era interim and Œ¥2h is as specified in table 2 for various lengths of rainfall duration in hours using equation 1 to determine convective rainfall the correlation between the convective fraction and the Œ¥ values of the precipitation was low r 0 19 however due to the small number of events identified as convective n 22 the correlation was not significant using the era interim data the correlation was 0 11 and was significant 3 5 2 synoptic types the number of occurrences by season for each synoptic type is presented in table 3 and the mslp maps of selected types are shown in fig 7 inland lows and inland troughs were more frequent in summer whereas the offshore highs were more frequent in autumn the highest rainfall occurred from offshore low pressure systems located to the north east followed by low pressure systems to the east the lowest Œ¥ values were associated with rainfall from ecls cutoff lows and lows to the east and north east of the sampling site low Œ¥ values from ecls were also found in crawford et al 2013 for the mt werong sampling site the highest convective fraction as estimated by equation 1 was for inland lows and throughs followed by offshore high pressure systems the samples identified as having convective fraction greater than 0 5 i e using equation 1 were classified in the synoptic types inland lows inland throughs offshore highs offshore lows located to the east and pre frontal these are the systems for which higher median Œ¥ values were recorded fig 8 3 5 3 large climate drivers the pearson correlations between the isotopic composition of the monthly precipitation weighted average Œ¥18o values and the soi and sam indices were low and not significant the correlation between Œ¥18o and soi was 0 02 and between Œ¥18o and sam was 0 12 the correlation of Œ¥18o and the dmi was 0 04 and not significant the correlations were still insignificant when the correlations were undertaken after the data was separated into seasons 3 6 radon based classification of the atmospheric mixing state near surface nocturnal radon observations were used to assign each day of the measurement period to one of 5 atmospheric mixing categories these categories numbered 0 to 4 represent 24 hour periods 1500 h to 1400 h the next day for which the nocturnal portion was 0 synoptically non stationary 1 windy well mixed 2 weakly stable 3 moderately stable and 4 most stable category 0 events were typically associated with the passage of strong frontal systems or large rapid fetch changes category 1 events were often associated with predominantly overcast conditions consistent wind and frequent rainfall at the other extreme category 4 events were typically associated with anti cyclonic conditions and calm to light winds average mslp maps for each stability category in summer are shown in fig 9 the other seasons are reproduced in the supplementary material stability category 0 is seen to correspond to the passage of a front through the sampling site inland troughs inland lows offshore highs and 30 of the post frontal systems were the main synoptic systems associated with stability category 0 the largest number of inland troughs inland lows offshore highs and offshore lows located to the east of the site appeared in stability categories 1 and 2 the mslp map of stability category 3 has some resemblance to the mslp map of inland troughs and several the offshore high systems and inland troughs were allocated to this stability category the largest proportion of the ecls occurred under stability category 1 table 4 back trajectory density maps show the regions covered by the back trajectories before reaching the sampling site fig 10 due to the extent of the covered region one can conclude that the wind speeds were the highest for stability category 0 and the lowest for stability category 4 3 6 1 isotopic composition and its relationship with precipitation amount per stability category by season when the data is separated by season the main differences are for stability category 0 which we can analyse further figure s11 in summer we see a similar behaviour to when the whole dataset is used in autumn category 0 shows higher median Œ¥ values with higher d excess values looking at the back trajectories fig 12 more overland and n e fetch occurs under stability category 0 in autumn the offshore high pressure systems dominated and the rainfall amount was lower on the other hand lower Œ¥ values are seen under stability category 0 in winter when high rainfall amounts were recorded at the sampling site the large rainfall amounts were from offshore lows located east of the site which are associated with lower Œ¥ values fig 8 in spring higher isotopic Œ¥ values are seen with lower d excess and the back trajectories show overland fetch fig 12 high isotopic Œ¥ values were previously seen when the moisture was sourced overland crawford et al 2013 possibly due to the vapour source being previously evaporated moisture the dominant synoptic systems were inland troughs lows and post frontal systems while the relationship between rainfall amount and Œ¥18o was low when all the data was considered by season table 5 there were small improvements in some of the stability categories when the data was subdivided by stability category this was also true for the relationship between the stable isotopes of precipitation and the local temperature and the duration of the rainfall period table 5 radon based stability categories group together periods of similar meteorological conditions so within these groups other factors contributing to the isotopic variability would also be better constrained this means that relationships like rainfall amount with isotopic composition show up more clearly since a lot of the other noise is removed 4 discussion 4 1 general discussion at a particular site the variation of environmental and physical conditions will result in larger variability in rainfall isotope composition under higher resolution sampling it is expected that these differences will be averaged out when lower resolution sampling is undertaken however in this study the difference in the precipitation weighted means between the weekly and daily samples was not statistically significant p values were 0 1 and 0 15 for Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h respectively using the daily samples the lmwl was 7 39 Œ¥18o 11 89 whereas using the weekly samples it was 7 28 Œ¥18o 11 69 and when monthly precipitation weighted values were considered the lmwl was 7 26Œ¥18o 11 92 this shows small differences in the three lmwls indicating that the variability at this site is not significant these slopes and intercepts are lower than that reported by hughes and crawford 2013 for this site when 4 years of weekly sampled data were available 7 74 Œ¥18o 13 6 and the difference in the slopes was statistically significant the period of the weekly data in hughes and crawford 2013 was 2005 to 2009 in this study the weekly data has been extended to 2019 whereas the current daily data is for the years 2011 to 2019 in the 2005 to 2009 period the precipitation weighted mean values of the weekly data were 22 64 4 79 15 73 for Œ¥2h Œ¥18o and d excess respectively for the weekly samples from 2005 to 2019 the precipitation weighted mean values were 22 87 4 85 and 15 9 for Œ¥2h Œ¥18o and d excess respectively for the 2011 to 2019 period the precipitation weighted mean of the daily samples were 23 69 4 87 15 32 for Œ¥2h Œ¥18o and d excess respectively the differences are small however when a welch two sample t test was performed for the difference in the means between the weekly and the daily samples the p values were 0 03 0 09 and 0 05 for Œ¥18o Œ¥2h and d excess 4 2 impact of environmental variables from the polar plot fig 2 it is evident that for the high rainfall events in summer the moisture is sourced from the east in autumn from the south and it is more variable for winter and spring while the smoothed Œ¥18o values exhibit a seasonal trend a variation is evident within each season fig 3 the smoothed curve for d excess shows higher d excess values corresponding to lower Œ¥18o values during the colder months of the year and vice versa during the warmer months of the year this behaviour can broadly be explained by the conditions at the moisture source followed by conditions in the cloud and finally conditions at the site of precipitation the isotopic composition and d excess of precipitation is affected by the conditions at the moisture source where water vapour has higher Œ¥ values with higher sea surface temperature rahul et al 2018 and the d excess increases with temperature but decreases with relative humidity uemura et al 2008 higher Œ¥ values correspond to higher sea surface temperature which is reflected in this study with a significant correlation coefficient of 0 35 between Œ¥18o and the average sea surface temperature table 1 in cloud condensation is generally an equilibrium process and as the equilibrium fractionation factors are temperature dependant precipitation forming at higher air temperatures has higher Œ¥ values than precipitation forming at lower air temperatures beria et al 2018 this is reflected in our result where the correlation between Œ¥18o and the temperature in the back trajectory is 0 41 and significant table 1 another contributing factor to higher Œ¥ values and lower d excess values is sub cloud evaporation which is higher under higher temperatures and lower relative humidity jacob and sonntag 1991 froehlich et al 2008 peng et al 2010 in this study this is supported by the positive correlation of the Œ¥18o values with local temperature and the negative correlation with local relative humidity table 1 further small precipitation events experience more sub cloud evaporation this is evident in the plot of Œ¥2h against precipitation amount fig 4 which shows a sharper decrease for precipitation amount of up to 6 mm which is most likely because of the smaller precipitation experiencing more sub cloud evaporation this is supported by the lower d excess values when the precipitation amount was 6 mm the mean d excess value of the set of samples where the precipitation amount was 6 mm was 12 6 as opposed to 15 3 for the remaining set of samples the difference is statistically significant with a p value of 0 001 the sub cloud evaporation is also supported by fig 5 where several summer and spring samples plot to the top right of the lmwl sub cloud evaporation is reduced for long and widespread rainfall events due to the isotopic equilibration of rainfall with the surrounding air fig 6 shows decreasing Œ¥ values with increasing rainfall duration although previous rainfall from the air mass would also result in lower Œ¥ values this is supported by a significant correlation coefficient of 0 40 between the Œ¥18o and the total rainfall from the air mass in the last 24 h table 1 another factor that affects the d excess of precipitation is moisture recycling particularly higher d excess values are seen when moisture has evaporated over the land surface jacob and sonntag 1991 froehlich et al 2008 peng et al 2010 the impact of sub cloud evaporation and moisture recycling is illustrated by the intercepts of the lmwls at the macquarie marshes and mt werong respectively using olsr the lmwl for mt werong was Œ¥2h 7 81Œ¥18o 16 6 hughes and crawford 2013 for the macquarie marshes it was Œ¥2h 6 96 Œ¥18o 6 4 crawford et al 2017 and for lucas heights it is Œ¥2h 7 28Œ¥18o 11 69 rainfall at the macquarie marshes a semi arid region is subject to sub cloud evaporation leading to the lower slope and intercept although it was shown that at this site another contribution factor was that moisture could also be sourced from perviously evaporated water whereas at mt werong moisture re cycling leads to higher intercept putman et al 2019 crawford et al 2013 4 3 synoptic types synoptic weather systems group similar atmospheric conditions and as such the impacts described above would be reflected in the different synoptic weather systems during the warmer months of the year the subtropical ridge is further south leading to moist easterly winds and the formation of low pressure systems on the east coast also inland troughs and lows are more common in summer table 3 which result in higher Œ¥18o values fig 8 these events are generally of short duration and associated with convective precipitation both of which contribute to the higher Œ¥ values guan et al 2013 also identified inland troughs leading to precipitation at a coastal area in south australia they found that these systems sourced inland moisture and the d excess varied between 10 and 15 in this study the median d excess from inland troughs was 14 with the 25th percentile being 9 6 and the 75th percentile being 17 9 in the cooler months of the year the subtropical ridge is further north and hence rainfall tends to be associated with fronts from the southwest the lowest rainfall is received from westerlies in which case air masses would have travelled considerable distance over land over the dry interior of the continent before arriving at the sampling site lower Œ¥ values were observed at the lucas heights site in atmospheric vapour during westerly dominated fetch crawford et al 2019 these air masses also are likely to have experienced some rainout before reaching the sampling site which could be one of the contributing factors to the lower Œ¥ values in winter from table 1 the correlation between the Œ¥18o of precipitation and the total rainfall from the air mass in the last 24 h is 0 40 and is significant another factor explaining lower Œ¥ values in winter would be that sub cloud evaporation of raindrops would be expected to be lower in winter due to the lower temperature and higher relative humidity figure s4 in autumn and winter ecls are more common table 3 from fig 8 lower median Œ¥18o values are observed in rainfall from the low pressure systems located to the east and north east of the site consistent with previous studies for the south east coast of mainland australia crawford et al 2013 2017 and in tasmania treble et al 2005 4 4 stratiform fraction of rainfall the correlation between stratiform fraction of rainfall and Œ¥2h improved with increasing duration of rainfall table 2 for longer rainfall events the impact of sub cloud evaporation reduces resulting in the isotopic composition of the precipitation better reflecting the conditions at the moisture source and the in cloud processes this is consistent with the findings of zwart et al 2016 2018 who reported that the relationship between the stratiform fraction and the isotopic composition of the precipitation was improved when the horizontal extent of the raining area was large 4 5 radon based classification of atmospheric mixing state rainfall as a function of stability category fig 11 shows a clear trend with the highest median rainfall occurring during stability categories 0 and 1 and then a decreasing trend for stability categories 2 to 4 there is a slight increasing trend in the median Œ¥ values of precipitation up to stability category 3 fig 11 stability category 4 had the lowest rainfall amount and its highest occurrence was in summer and autumn table 4 and from fig 11 we see a large range in Œ¥ values in addition lower d excess values occur for category 4 rainfall days indicating that sub cloud evaporation might have altered the isotopic composition of the precipitation which is consistent with warm anti cyclonic conditions during the daytime of category 4 days one of the aims of this work was to investigate whether radon based mixing classification could assist in the identification of convective precipitation out of the 18 daily samples identified as having a convective rainfall fraction Œ≤ in equation 1 0 5 4 were in stability category 0 4 were in stability category 1 3 in stability category 2 1 in stability category 3 and 6 in stability category 4 however the rainfall and duration of rainfall was low for those events that were classified in stability category 4 a problem with the radon based classification scheme is that it is based on nocturnal observations and corresponding daytime conditions are inferred based on an assumption of short term atmospheric persistence consequently the edges of the 24 hour 3 pm to 2 pm classification window have the greatest uncertainty these edges which fall in the mid afternoon correspond with the time that convective rainfall also occurs under category 4 conditions stable nights and convective days blocking high pressure systems occur to the east of the site fig 9 and when the stagnant air warms up during the afternoon vertical mixing occurs and short duration convective rainfall can be experienced the radon based mixing classification method was developed for and has been successful in urban air quality studies e g chambers et al 2015 for which exceedance events typically happen when there is little active convective mixing however for stable isotope studies further investigations and possibly some refinement is necessary perrino et al 2001 for example suggest using the rate of change in radon concentration in the morning and evening bracketing the daytime to look at daytime mixing rather than in the evening and morning bracketing the night while the relationship between rainfall amount and Œ¥18o was low when all the data was considered by season table 5 there were notable improvements in some of the stability categories when the data was subdivided by stability category this was also true for the relationship between the stable isotopes of precipitation and the local temperature and the duration of the rainfall period table 5 radon based stability categories group together periods of similar meteorological conditions so within these groups other factors contributing to the isotopic variability would also be better constrained this means that relationships like rainfall amount with isotopic composition show up more clearly since a lot of the other noise is removed 5 conclusions nine years of daily based rainfall samples and 14 years of weekly based rainfall samples were analysed the impact of environmental conditions synoptic types and fraction of convective cloud on the isotopic composition of precipitation was investigated in addition the usefulness of radon classified state of the atmosphere was investigated to see if this will assist in the analysis of the stable isotope composition of precipitation small differences in the local meteoric water lines were seen when developed using daily weekly or monthly data the intention of these calculations was to progressively reduce the effect of short term small atmospheric variability by increasing the duration of averaging a significant finding is that when the lmwls are determined using the precipitation weighted methods little difference exist between those lmwls determined using the weekly data and those determined using the daily data factors affecting the isotopic composition of precipitation were investigated from the impact of environmental variables to the impact of synoptic weather systems and finally the impact of large scale climate drivers e g el ni√±o southern oscillation when environmental conditions were examined the best correlation of Œ¥18o was with local temperature rainout of the air mass and rainfall amount at the site a good correlation was also seen between the Œ¥18o values and the duration of the precipitation 0 42 the correlation between the fraction of convective rainfall and the Œ¥18o values was significant but low 0 11 however a trend was seen where the correlation with the stratiform fraction improved as the duration of rainfall increased indicating lower impact of sub cloud evaporation on a synoptic weather systems basis the lowest Œ¥ values were seen in rainfall from east coast lows however the largest rainfall was seen from low pressure systems arriving from the north east some of which would have been the tail end of ex tropical cyclones the influence of the large climate drivers on the isotopic composition of precipitation was insignificant at this coastal site when radon 222 was used the rainfall amount by stability category showed a clear trend with the lowest amount of rainfall during category 4 conditions most of the convective rainfall occurred for this same period consistent with strong convective events developing on the hottest days under low gradient wind conditions this type of convective rainfall however is very localised and spatially heterogeneous often leading to low rainfall amounts or events being missed while the radon based classification produced identifiable mean sea level patterns and a good indication of the rainfall amount it was less useful for the isotopic composition of precipitation other than the lower median d excess for stability category 4 analysing the data using stability categories improved the correlations with rainfall amount for some of the stability categories further investigation is needed to see whether the identification of convective rainfall events using radon can be improved such as by directly targeting daytime rather than nocturnal conditions as is the case for air quality studies credit authorship contribution statement j crawford conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology software validation

2318,the upper yellow river basin uyrb provides more than 50 of freshwater for the yellow river recent research reveals continuous climatic wetting and vegetation greening over the uyrb in a warming future but future hydrological drought changes remain unclear due to complex interactions between climate change land cover change and reservoir operations here we project hydrological drought changes at different global warming levels and quantify contributions from each driving factor the conjunctive surface subsurface process eco hydrological model is coupled with a reservoir module and the new csspv2 reservoir model is used to perform future projections driven by bias corrected meteorological forcings from 11 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 models the csspv2 reservoir model simulates monthly streamflow over the uyrb reasonably well with a kling gupta efficiency of 0 75 the increasing precipitation during dry seasons reduces hydrological drought duration by 9 12 19 at the 1 5 2 0 4 0 warming level while its impact on drought severity is limited the dramatic increase of leaf area index at the 4 0 warming level robustly exacerbates hydrological drought severity to 28 by intensifying evapotranspiration the reservoir operation designed to reduce seasonality in monthly releases to ensure stable hydropower generation further decreases drought duration but increases drought frequency and severity to 63 48 108 and 9 11 32 at the 1 5 2 0 4 0 warming levels respectively a mitigated operation rule which stores less water during wet seasons however can reduce hydrological drought severity and duration significantly thus future reservoir operations should pay more attention to the trade off between hydropower generation and hydrological drought mitigation

introduction hydrological drought which manifests itself in the abnormally low streamflow of rivers has vital impacts on public water supply navigation agriculture and river ecosystems stahl et al 2016 van loon 2015 hydrological drought has experienced significant changes globally during the last four decades and climate change induced by anthropogenic warming is identified as a major driver gudmundsson et al 2021 according to the recently released intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sixth assessment report ipcc 2021 global warming will continue in the future and there is a large probability for the global mean surface temperature to exceed the 1 5 and 2 warming goals compared with preindustrial levels proposed by the paris agreement ipcc 2021 numerous studies have investigated the changes of hydrological droughts in a warming future alfieri et al 2017 d√∂ll et al 2018 marx et al 2018 jiao and yuan 2019 naz et al 2018 although it is generally agreed upon that future warming will intensify the global hydrological cycle and induce more streamflow extremes droughts or floods results are region dependent due to the heterogeneity of regional response to global climate change in addition to climate change hydrological drought is also influenced by land cover changes cuo et al 2013 santos et al 2021 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2018a and human water

et al 2021 projected that reservoirs over the lancang mekong river basin would mitigate future dry extreme events by 100 while wan et al 2018 reported that irrigation reservoirs would increase the

operations while research on investigating the combined effects of climate change vegetation change and reservoir operations on hydrological drought under a warming future is lacking located over western china the upper yellow river basin uyrb contributes 62 of the total annual streamflow of the entire yellow river chen and qian 2019 and supports 114 million people over its downstream areas huang et al 2009 the regional climate and ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate warming kuang and jiao 2016 which consequently has a profound influence on hydrological processes in addition longyangxia the third largest reservoir in china is located over the uyrb causing significant changes in streamflow regimes and hydrological drought characteristics chen and qian 2019 cuo et al 2013 thus the uyrb is an ideal study region to investigate the combined impacts of climate change land cover change and reservoir operation on hydrological droughts numerous studies have explored the historical changes of hydrological droughts over the uyrb cuo et al 2013 ji et al 2020a omer et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 for example cui et al 2020 reported that climate change reduced the annual minimum flow over the uyrb during 1968 2004 while the dam construction had the opposite effects yuan et al 2017 found that reservoir operations increase the frequency of hydrological drought over the uyrb but reduce drought duration the latest research suggested that global warming will increase the interannual variability of precipitation over the uyrb in the future wang et al 2021 leading to a significant increase in hydrological drought frequency ji et al 2020b gusev et al 2019 however these studies ignore either reservoir operations or land cover changes in order to address this knowledge gap we coupled a conjunctive surface subsurface process land surface model with a reservoir module and projected the future changes of hydrological drought over the uyrb considering climate changes land cover changes and reservoir operations sensitivity experiments were performed to quantify the influence of each factor by gradually introducing them in the simulation potential influences of mitigation were also discussed by changing reservoir operation rules in future simulations the results will help to understand the role of land cover changes and reservoir operations in the uyrb and provide scientific support for stakeholders to make relevant adaptation plans 2 study area and model description 2 1 study area fig 1 depicts the study area the uyrb occupies 223 0000 km2 accounting for approximately 28 of the total area of the yellow river located over the eastern part of the tibetan plateau the upper reach of the uyrb has a cold alpine climate while the lower reach is a typical semiarid region regional mean annual precipitation and temperature are 500 mm and 0 7 respectively and the dominant vegetation cover is grassland cuo et al 2013 the elevation drops from the southwest

is the reservoir storage before its operation k c Œ± and Œ≤ are empirical parameters to be calibrated that determine reservoir operation rule generally multi year regulation reservoirs with a larger proportion of active storage capacity are more likely to have lower k c higher Œ± and lower Œ≤ values which indicates the monthly reservoir outflow is less dependent on the monthly inflow following liu et al 2016 the monthly outflow is adjusted as q m y max q m y 0 1 i m y 2 q m y min q m y s m y 0 1 s max Œ¥ t 3 q m y max q m y i m y s max s beg m y Œ¥ t 4 equation 2 assures an environmental flow which is no less than 10 of the mean monthly inflow equation 3 indicates that the reservoir cannot release water when the storage is below 10 dead storage equation 4 indicates water that exceeds the maximum storage will be released the water storage at the beginning of the next month s beg m 1 y m3 is calculated as s beg m 1 y s beg m y i m y q m y Œ¥ t note that the reservoir regulation rules in equations 1 4 do not consider human water consumption e g irrigation domestic and industrial water use this simplification is reasonable because the main function of the longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs over the uyrb is for hydropower generation and flood control by releasing storing water during the dry wet season cui et al 2020 liu et al 2016 2 4 model coupling and calibration following yun et al 2020 the reservoir scheme is coupled with the csspv2 model as follows first monthly reservoir inflows are extracted from the monthly streamflow simulation of csspv2 second reservoir outflows are calculated according to the operation rules in equations 1 4 third the above operation is developed sequentially from the upstream reservoir longyangxia down to the downstream reservoir liujiaxia for convenience the coupled model is denoted as csspv2 reservoir in the following analysis runoff parameters that were calibrated by trial and error over the uyrb according to the naturalized streamflow ji et al 2020a were used in the csspv2 model to generate natural streamflow according to the global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 the maximum storages of the longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs are 276 108 m3 and 61 108 m3 respectively we started the simulations in 1987 the time when longyangxia came into service cui et al 2020 other parameters Œ± Œ≤ and k c were calibrated according to the following two steps 1 by taking the kling gupta efficiency kge between the simulated and observed streamflow at lanzhou station during 1987 1999 as the objective function the enumeration method was used to search for suitable parameters the sampling ranges for Œ± Œ≤ and k c were 0 1 2 0 0 1 3 and 0 1 3 respectively with a sampling step of 0 1 a total of 749 parameter sets with a high kge greater than 0 7 were then selected 2 the root mean square errors rmses between the modeled and observed climatology of the reservoir monthly storage perturbations during 1987 2013 were calculated and the parameter setting with the lowest rmse was chosen i e Œ± 0 8 Œ≤ 1 3 and k c 1 9 3 data and methods 3 1 observational data monthly observed streamflow data during 1987 2010 measured at the lanzhou hydrological station red star in fig 1 was obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc ji et al 2020a in addition monthly naturalized streamflow which was estimated by adding human interventions e g reservoir operation agriculture irrigation domestic water uses back into the observation was also provided by the yrcc the naturalized streamflow was used to evaluate the model performance before coupling with the reservoir module the climatology of monthly water storage changes of longyangxia and liujiaxia during 1987 2013 was taken from yin et al 2021 observed meteorological forcings during 1979 2014 including the temperature precipitation humidity wind speed shortwave and longwave radiation came from the 3 hourly china meteorological forcing dataset at 0 1 spatial resolution cmfd he et al 2020 the monthly leaf area index lai during 1982 2014 was estimated from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies

intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 provides climate projections under different combinations of shared socio economic pathways ssp and representative concentration pathways rcp eyring et al 2016 for example the ssp5 rcp85 hereafter ssp585 scenario combines a fossil fueled development socioeconomic pathway with the 8 5 w m 2 concentration pathway representing a future that faces tough challenges for adaptation and mitigation to maintain the living standards for a fast growing population kriegler et al 2014 no significant differences in meteorological forcings have been reported between different ssp rcp scenarios under the same warming level dosio and fischer 2018 ji et al 2020b thus we selected a single ssp585 scenario where the 1 5 2 and 4 warming levels will be exceeded in the 21st century besides cmip6 all scenarios considering all historical forcings are also collected for model evaluation and baseline comparison table 1 lists the 11 cmip6 models selected in this study which provide daily meteorological forcings and can effectively represent the historical warming wetting and greening trends of the uyrb ji et al 2020b the land use harmonization 2 luh2 dataset used by the cmip6 models to represent land use change does not exhibit any significant transitions between different land use categories over the uyrb not shown hence only the monthly lai simulated by these models was adopted to represent land cover change systematic biases in the cmip6 models were corrected using the trend preserved bias correction method hempel et al 2013 which was described in detail in ji et al 2020b the global mean temperature during 1985 2014 the reference period in this research has increased by 0 66 compared with the preindustrial level thus the 1 5 2 4 warming levels were defined as the 30 year periods whose mean temperatures were 0 84 1 34 3 34 warmer than that in 1985 2014 table 1 lists the median years of the identified 30 year periods referred to as crossing years derived from different cmip6 models for example the access esm1 5 model would achieve the 2 0 warming level goal during the 2019 2048 with the crossing year being 2034 table 1 3 3 experimental design warming level determination and drought definition table 2 lists the experiments performed in this research the obs csspv2 and obs csspv2 reservoir represent the simulations forced by the observed cmfd meteorological forcings without and with the reservoir operation respectively cmip6 all csspv2 and cmip6 all csspv2 reservoir are similar but forced by cmip6 historical simulations cmip6 ssp585 csspv2 fixlai cmip6 ssp585 csspv2 and cmip6 ssp585 csspv2 reservoir gradually consider the effects of climate change land cover change and reservoirs for future projections note the fixlai means that the lai is fixed at the year of 1979 and only the monthly lai variation is considered during the simulation all simulations were performed at a 10 km resolution and half hourly time step the widely used standardized streamflow index ssi yuan et al 2017 yun et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2012 was employed to define hydrological droughts the ssi was calculated by normalizing the monthly streamflow according to a probability distribution fitted by the 30 year 1985 2014 monthly naturalized streamflow simulated by csspv2 here we used the gamma distribution to fit the monthly streamflow all fittings passed the kolmogorov smirnov test at the 0 05 confidence level the ssi at different warming levels was calculated based on the historical distribution streamflow drought occurs when the ssi is consistently below 0 8 for at least 3 continuous months yuan et al 2017 the drought onset month is the first month when the ssi falls below 0 8 drought duration the number of months of a drought event and drought severity i 1 n 0 8 s s i i where n is the drought duration were also determined note drought events and their characteristics at different warming levels were calculated based on 30 year time series for each cmip6 csspv2 simulation table 1 and the relative changes in drought characteristics e g frequency duration and severity under different warming levels were then determined separately the ensemble mean of 11 individual members was then calculated uncertainties of the multi model ensemble mean caused by choosing the cmip6 models were estimated by using the bootstrapping method following previous research ji et al 2020b yuan et al 2019 specifically the above calculation was repeated 10 000 times and the 11 cmip6 models were resampled with replacement during each bootstrap the 5 and 95 percentiles of the total 10 000 estimations were taken as the 5 95 uncertainty ranges paciorek et al 2018 4 results 4 1 model calibration and evaluation fig 2 a reveals the ability of the csspv2 model to reproduce the naturalized monthly streamflow the kge is 0 82 during 1987 2010 for the lanzhou station which indicates a satisfactory simulation according to the threshold kge greater than 0 5 proposed by moriasi et al 2007 fig 2b presents the modeled and observed monthly streamflow at lanzhou hydrological station the difference between the naturalized and observed streamflow black lines in fig 2 demonstrates that the reservoir operations modify the streamflow seasonality increasing decreasing the streamflow in the dry wet season and decrease the streamflow variations in general 24 39 of the water during the june october is stored in the reservoir and released during the dry seasons when driven by the observed meteorological forcings the csspv2 reservoir model reproduces this effect reasonably well with kge values of 0 74 and 0 63 during the calibration 1987 1999 and evaluation 2000 2010 periods respectively the performance of the cmip6 all csspv2 and cmip6 all csspv2 reservoir experiments are relatively poorer than the obs csspv2 kge 0 82 and obs csspv2 reservoir kge 0 71 with kges of 0 76 and 0 58 respectively blue lines in fig 2 this is attributed to the weaknesses of the cmip6 models in modeling the annual variations of meteorological forcings luo et al 2022 fig 3 compares the observed and simulated total monthly storage perturbations of longyangxia and liujiaxia during 1987 2013 both the obs csspv2 reservoir and cmip6 all csspv2 reservoir exhibit a good agreement with the observations by showing a discharge during november may and a recharge during june october the correlation coefficient between the simulations and observations is 0 96 0 97 and the relative rmse is lower than 30 4 2 climate and streamflow changes under different warming levels fig 4 a c present the historical and future changes of annual mean temperature precipitation and lai averaged over the uyrb the cmip6 simulations suggest a continued warming and wetting trend of the uyrb in the future fig 4a 4b which is consistent with recent research that uses a high resolution regional climate model wang et al 2021 vegetation greening also continues during 2015 2100 due to a favorable climatic condition that is identified as the dominant driver of lai change over the tibetan plateau zhu et al 2016 fig 4d 4f demonstrate a quasi linear response of the basin wide temperature precipitation and lai to global warming although the response magnitude differs among models the slope of the linear regression in fig 4d black line is 1 15 indicating that the warming rate over uyrb is 15 faster than the global mean speed the annual mean precipitation and lai over uyrb are projected to increase by 21 mm and 0 19 m2 m2 respectively with a global temperature increase of 1 fig 5 a depicts the simulated annual mean streamflow at the lanzhou hydrological station during 1987 2100 when only climate change is considered the annual streamflow blue line in fig 5a tends to increase during 2015 2100 with a speed of 18 3 m3 s decade 1 p value 0 when both climate change and land cover change are included however the annual streamflow decreases during 2030 2100 which consequently results in an insignificant increasing trend for the streamflow 1 7 m3 s decade 1 p value 0 3 moreover although reservoir operations tend to reduce increase the streamflow in wet dry years e g the small panel in fig 5a their relative influence is generally weak the limited influence of reservoir operations on annual streamflow is similar to the recent studies over the lancang mekong river basin yun et al 2020 2021 fig 5b compares the relative changes in the annual streamflow at different warming levels with those of the reference period 1985 2014 approximately 70 of the ensemble members exhibit an increasing trend in the annual streamflow and the ensemble means of all members are 1 5 5 0 3 9 at the 1 5 2 4 warming levels respectively land cover change has a small impact on the annual streamflow change at the 1 5 warming level but it reduces the increasing trend of annual streamflow from 5 0 3 9 to 3 2 4 0 at the 2 4 warming level in addition more than 75 of the ensemble members show a drying trend at the 4 warming level after considering the land cover change indicating the drying trend is generally robust the large impacts of land cover change can be inferred from the intensified evapotranspiration et induced by the increased lai which subsequently decreases the available water for runoff generation precipitation minus et fig 5c 5d fig 6 further presents the relative changes in the monthly streamflow the cmip6 all csspv2 which means monthly streamflow under natural conditions was used as the reference for all experiments significant increases 4 14 are observed for the monthly streamflow during the dry season december may at the 1 5 warming level when only climate change is considered this increase is larger at the 2 8 26 and 4 12 52 warming levels fig 6a and can be attributed to the increased precipitation during the winter and spring seasons not shown here the streamflow during july october however exhibits an insignificant increasing or even decreasing trend fig 6a when the land cover change is further considered minor differences are found for the monthly streamflow projections at the 1 5 and 2 warming levels fig 6a 6b however at the 4 warming level vegetation greening decreases the increasing monthly streamflow trend by 5 10 during november june pink bars in fig 6a 6b and leads to a significant decreasing streamflow in august when the reservoir operation is taken into account the increased monthly streamflow during the dry season at different warming levels is much larger while monthly streamflow in july september significantly decreases by 14 33 10 31 19 32 at the 1 5 2 4 warming levels respectively fig 6c 4 3 changes in hydrological droughts fig 7 shows the time series of the drought characteristics during 1999 2085 calculated based on a 30 year moving window e g values in 1999 are based on 1985 2014 together with their relative changes at different warming levels affected by climate change the drought frequency generally decreases in the future blue lines in fig 7a yet this is generally insignificant at different warming levels blue bars in fig 7b drought duration however significantly decreases by 9 12 19 at the 1 5 2 4 warming levels blue bars in fig 7d furthermore drought severity does not present significant changes at all warming levels land cover change does not greatly influence the drought projections at lower warming levels 1 5 and 2 however it generally enhances the drought frequency red line in fig 7a and causes a marked increase 28 in drought severity at the 4 warming level after considering reservoir operation drought frequency will increase by 63 48 and 108 at the 1 5 2 and 4 warming levels respectively although drought duration decreases at all warming levels due to reservoir operations the severity increases by 9 11 and 32 at the 1 5 2 and 4 warming levels respectively thus current reservoir operations will eliminate the drought alleviation effect of climate change and cannot mitigate the intensified drought induced by land cover change at the 4 warming level in order to better understand the changes in drought frequency and duration fig 8 presents the projected probability of each month experiencing drought during different decades drought events completely disappear during winter and spring from the 2030 s onwards around the time of the 2 warming level due to climate change fig 8a this is related to the robust increase in precipitation and streamflow fig 6 the wetting environment during the dry season prohibits long term drought that can span both the dry and wet seasons and thus the drought duration also decreases however there is a larger risk for the wet season e g august september to experience drought during 2070 s 2090 s around the time of the 4 warming level than that during the reference period thus drought frequency reductions induced by climate change become insignificant at the 4 warming level blue bars in fig 7b vegetation greening further increases the drought probability in the wet seasons during 2070 s 2090 s around the 4 warming level by 40 75 e g from 0 17 to 0 26 to 0 22 0 32 moreover the drying effects of vegetation greening propagate into november december when the lai is small and increases the drought frequency during that season the reservoir operation further intensifies the drought probability by 1 4 times during june october and reduces drought events during november may leading to more short period drought events in the future fig 8c and fig 7a b 5 discussion 5 1 mitigation of hydrological drought by changing reservoir operation rules we changed the reservoir operation rules for the future 2015 2100 period by perturbing parameters Œ± and Œ≤ both of which influence the release coefficient between the dynamic monthly inflow and the climatological annual mean inflow see sect 2 3 and equation 1 for detailed information fig 9 presents the relative changes in drought severity Œ¥severity at different warming levels when using different combinations of Œ± and Œ≤ parameters to be consistent with the above analysis the cmip6 all csspv2 is still taken as a reference in fig 9 a local optimal parameter setting that leads to a significant decrease in drought severity is masked out by the dashed box in fig 9 the Œ¥severity changes from 9 to 17 at the 1 5 2 0 warming level and from 32 to 8 at the 4 0 warming level when the optimal reservoir operation rule is used e g from the black solid box to the white dashed box in fig 9 compared with the scenario where only climate change and land cover change are considered red bars in fig 7f the optimal reservoir rule reduces drought severity significantly at low to mid warming levels e g 1 5 and 2 0 and alleviates the intensified drought severity at high the warming level e g 4 0 we also calculated the relative changes of drought severity using the cmip6 all csspv2 reservoir experiment as a baseline fig s1 the mitigation rule also helps relieve the drought severity compared with the current drought scenario fig s1 especially at 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels moreover the relative changes of drought frequency also decrease from 48 to 63 to 5 20 at the 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels and from 108 to 60 70 at the 4 0 warming level based on the optimal parameters in fig 9 fig s2 in addition under these conditions the relative changes in drought duration decrease from 22 27 to 22 30 fig s3 fig 10 compares the monthly reservoir storage fluctuations and monthly streamflow at lanzhou station under different warming levels based on the historical and optimized parameters the optimized parameters exhibit much higher Œ≤ values than those of the historical case which will decrease increase the first second term in the right side of equation 1 and thus enhance the monthly inflow weight when determining the reservoir outflow considering that the monthly inflow is larger smaller than the annual mean inflow during the wet dry seasons a higher monthly inflow weight will cause the reservoir to release more water during the wet season and less water during the dry season fig 10 note that although the dry season outflow is reduced by the optimal rule compared with the scenario using historical rules it is still larger than the values in natural condition therefore the optimal rule still prevents the existence of drought in dry seasons in addition an increased outflow during the wet season particularly july september in the mitigated rule will reduce the drought severity fig 10d and drought frequency over the downstream regions 5 2 necessity of considering land cover change in the projection although previous studies also pointed out the drying effect of vegetation greening climate change is found to have a stronger influence on streamflow and streamflow extremes than the vegetation greening during historical periods ji and yuan 2018 luan et al 2022 vicente serrano et al 2021 zhai and tao 2021 our findings however suggest that the importance of vegetation greening will increase in the future and may exceed climate change at high warming levels e g 4 0 for example there are no significant changes in annual streamflow and drought severity at the 4 0 warming level when just considering climate change however future vegetation greening will actually intensify the evapotranspiration and lead to a significant decreasing trend in the annual streamflow and an increasing trend in drought severity red bars in fig 5b and fig 7f this large difference subsequently propagates into the projection results causes large uncertainties and influence the subsequent judgements on future drought risks for example the drought frequency and severity will be underestimated by 40 50 when only climate change and reservoir operations are considered fig s4 thus research on future streamflow and hydrological drought projections should be conducted under an eco hydrological perspective instead of just considering temperature and precipitation changes and reservoir operations 5 3 limitations and perspective for future research this study also has several limitations first the current reservoir module is designed for hydropower generation and does not consider water consumption future climate warming is reported to increase the irrigation and domestic water demand guo and shen 2016 wada et al 2013 wang et al 2017 which will further decrease the streamflow and enhance hydrological droughts park et al 2021 thus the current projection may underestimate future hydrological drought second similar to previous studies we applied the same empirical parameters to the two reservoirs at the study site i e both reservoirs employ the same rule e g the release coefficient due to the lack of observation considering the reasonably good performance of the csspv2 reservoir model kge up to 0 75 the simplification will not influence the robustness of the current results however recent studies suggest that a collaborative operation between different reservoirs using different rules will be more efficient in generating energy and preventing hydrological extremes chang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 future research and more observational data are required to determine whether hydrological drought risk can be further decreased compared with the simple mitigated rules in section 5 1 by using optimal operation rules for the cascade reservoir system third although the cmip6 models improve hydroclimate simulations against the cmip5 models dong and dong 2021 they still exhibit deficiencies and uncertainties e g large bias overestimated annual variations in simulating the hydrological variables particularly the precipitation chen and yuan 2021 luo et al 2022 this subsequently causes uncertainties in the hydrological drought projection of the current study high resolution climate modeling at the convective permitting scale e g less than 4 km is reported to aid in decreasing model simulation errors slingo et al 2022 and is expected to advance future projection works zhou et al 2021 previous studies have demonstrated that permafrost degradation over the uyrb could exert impacts on streamflow variability ding et al 2019 ma et al 2019 niu et al 2011 wang et al 2018 both directly e g by altering the runoff generation processes and indirectly e g by influencing the ecosystem the csspv2 model directly solves the freeze thaw processes in its soil column and the thawing process will influence the runoff generation through changing the liquid water content and other soil hydraulic properties choi et al 2007 yuan et al 2018b in addition yuan et al 2018b suggest that the csspv2 can reasonably simulate the long term changes of frozen soils over the uyrb therefore the influence of permafrost degradation on streamflow changes has been partly considered during the simulations however the csspv2 model only simulates the soil thermal processes at 0 5 67 m without considering the permafrost at deeper depth moreover the indirect influences of permafrost degradation are still not considered in the model further efforts are needed to investigate and quantify the influence of permafrost degradation on the streamflow changes over the uyrb 6 conclusions by implementing a reservoir module into the csspv2 eco hydrological model this study developed a csspv2 reservoir model and used it to project the changes in hydrological drought over the uyrb at different warming levels climate change land cover change and reservoir operations are gradually considered in the projections to reveal their different contributions mitigation approaches to future drought changes were also investigated by perturbing the reservoir operation rules the key results are summarized in the following future climate change over the uyrb tends to increase the streamflow and alleviate hydrological drought without considering the influence of land cover changes compared with the natural condition during the reference period 1985 2014 annual streamflow at the uyrb outlet will increase by 1 5 5 2 3 9 at the 1 5 2 0 4 0 warming levels respectively moreover the increasing precipitation during the dry season november may has a much larger magnitude and is more significant than those during wet season which leads to a robust increasing trend in the monthly streamflow during november may 4 14 8 26 and 12 52 at 1 5 2 0 and 4 0 warming levels respectively under this background hydrological droughts that occur during the dry season are prohibited which consequently reduces drought frequency by 14 5 38 6 and drought duration by 9 1 18 5 limited changes however are observed for drought severity in the future vegetation greening induces minimal changes to the hydrological drought projection at the 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels but it has a strong impact at the 4 0 warming level by causing a significant annual streamflow reduction and drought severity intensification the dramatic increase in lai more than 50 compared with that during the reference period enhances evapotranspiration dries up the land and significantly reduces streamflow during the wet season the relative changes in the annual streamflow drought severity at the 4 0 warming level will change from 3 9 to 4 0 4 5 to 28 4 after considering vegetation greening current reservoir operations designed for hydropower generation will eliminate the drought alleviation influences of climate change at the 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels and cannot mitigate the intensified drought induced by vegetation greening at the 4 0 warming level this is because too much water is stored in reservoirs during the wet season which increases the drought frequency and severity in the downstream area during this period however when a mitigated reservoir operation rule is used in the future the drought severity will significantly reduce 17 compared with the reference period and the drought frequency exhibits insignificant changes at the 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels although the mitigation rule also alleviates drought severity from 28 4 to 5 6 at the 4 0 warming level the drought frequency is still 69 7 larger than that of the reference period thus controlling the global warming level below the ambitious goals 2 0 and even 1 5 proposed by the paris agreement is important for the reduction of drought risk over the uyrb this study provides comprehensive insights into the impacts of climate change land cover change and reservoir operations on the future changes of streamflow and hydrological drought over the uyrb the findings will provide a scientific reference for stakeholders to make relevant decisions and mitigation plans credit authorship

2318,the upper yellow river basin uyrb provides more than 50 of freshwater for the yellow river recent research reveals continuous climatic wetting and vegetation greening over the uyrb in a warming future but future hydrological drought changes remain unclear due to complex interactions between climate change land cover change and reservoir operations here we project hydrological drought changes at different global warming levels and quantify contributions from each driving factor the conjunctive surface subsurface process eco hydrological model is coupled with a reservoir module and the new csspv2 reservoir model is used to perform future projections driven by bias corrected meteorological forcings from 11 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 models the csspv2 reservoir model simulates monthly streamflow over the uyrb reasonably well with a kling gupta efficiency of 0 75 the increasing precipitation during dry seasons reduces hydrological drought duration by 9 12 19 at the 1 5 2 0 4 0 warming level while its impact on drought severity is limited the dramatic increase of leaf area index at the 4 0 warming level robustly exacerbates hydrological drought severity to 28 by intensifying evapotranspiration the reservoir operation designed to reduce seasonality in monthly releases to ensure stable hydropower generation further decreases drought duration but increases drought frequency and severity to 63 48 108 and 9 11 32 at the 1 5 2 0 4 0 warming levels respectively a mitigated operation rule which stores less water during wet seasons however can reduce hydrological drought severity and duration significantly thus future reservoir operations should pay more attention to the trade off between hydropower generation and hydrological drought mitigation

introduction hydrological drought which manifests itself in the abnormally low streamflow of rivers has vital impacts on public water supply navigation agriculture and river ecosystems stahl et al 2016 van loon 2015 hydrological drought has experienced significant changes globally during the last four decades and climate change induced by anthropogenic warming is identified as a major driver gudmundsson et al 2021 according to the recently released intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sixth assessment report ipcc 2021 global warming will continue in the future and there is a large probability for the global mean surface temperature to exceed the 1 5 and 2 warming goals compared with preindustrial levels proposed by the paris agreement ipcc 2021 numerous studies have investigated the changes of hydrological droughts in a warming future alfieri et al 2017 d√∂ll et al 2018 marx et al 2018 jiao and yuan 2019 naz et al 2018 although it is generally agreed upon that future warming will intensify the global hydrological cycle and induce more streamflow extremes droughts or floods results are region dependent due to the heterogeneity of regional response to global climate change in addition to climate change hydrological drought is also influenced by land cover changes cuo et al 2013 santos et al 2021 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2018a and human water interventions e g reservoir operation omer et al 2020 van loon et al 2022 yin et al 2021 yuan et al 2017 yun et al 2020 the vegetation greening induced by future climate change will enhance hydrological drought by intensifying transpiration and drying up the land surface ji et al 2020b mankin et al 2019 for example ji et al 2020b projected a significant increase in dry streamflow extreme events over the headwaters of the yellow river under a warming level from 1 5 to 3 0 with 43 52 of the increase attributed to vegetation greening reservoir operations directly change the hydrological droughts in the past van loon et al 2022 yuan et al 2017 but the impact of reservoir operations on future hydrological droughts is still under debate due to various reservoir functions e g hydropower generation flood control and irrigation and heterogeneous spatio temporal climate changes dobson et al 2020 liu et al 2020 padiyedath gopalan et al 2020 wan et al 2018 yun et al 2021 for example yun et al 2021 projected that reservoirs over the lancang mekong river basin would mitigate future dry extreme events by 100 while wan et al 2018 reported that irrigation reservoirs would increase the duration and intensity of hydrological drought by 50 globally during 2070 2099 moreover most previous studies consider limited driving factors e g only climate change or climate change and reservoir operations while research on investigating the combined effects of climate change vegetation change and reservoir operations on hydrological drought under a warming future is lacking located over western china the upper yellow river basin uyrb contributes 62 of the total annual streamflow of the entire yellow river chen and qian 2019 and supports 114 million people over its downstream areas huang et al 2009 the regional climate and ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate warming kuang and jiao 2016 which consequently has a profound influence on hydrological processes in addition longyangxia the third largest reservoir in china is located over the uyrb causing significant changes in streamflow regimes and hydrological drought characteristics chen and qian 2019 cuo et al 2013 thus the uyrb is an ideal study region to investigate the combined impacts of climate change land cover change and reservoir operation on hydrological droughts numerous studies have explored the historical changes of hydrological droughts over the uyrb cuo et al 2013 ji et al 2020a omer et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 for example cui et al 2020 reported that climate change reduced the annual minimum flow over the uyrb during 1968 2004 while the dam construction had the opposite effects yuan et al 2017 found that reservoir operations increase the frequency of hydrological drought over the uyrb but reduce drought duration the latest research suggested that global warming will increase the interannual variability of precipitation over the uyrb in the future wang et al 2021 leading to a significant increase in hydrological drought frequency ji et al 2020b gusev et al 2019 however these studies ignore either reservoir operations or land cover changes in order to address this knowledge gap we coupled a conjunctive surface subsurface process land surface model with a reservoir module and projected the future changes of hydrological drought over the uyrb considering climate changes land cover changes and reservoir operations sensitivity experiments were performed to quantify the influence of each factor by gradually introducing them in the simulation potential influences of mitigation were also discussed by changing reservoir operation rules in future simulations the results will help to understand the role of land cover changes and reservoir operations in the uyrb and provide scientific support for stakeholders to make relevant adaptation plans 2 study area and model description 2 1 study area fig 1 depicts the study area the uyrb occupies 223 0000 km2 accounting for approximately 28 of the total area of the yellow river located over the eastern part of the tibetan plateau the upper reach of the uyrb has a cold alpine climate while the lower reach is a typical semiarid region regional mean annual precipitation and temperature are 500 mm and 0 7 respectively and the dominant vegetation cover is grassland cuo et al 2013 the elevation drops from the southwest 6300 m to northeast 1400 m which provides large potential of hydropower energy 2 2 the conjunctive surface subsurface process version 2 csspv2 model the csspv2 model yuan and liang 2011 yuan et al

et al 2018b ji et al 2020a yuan et al 2018b ji et al 2020a b 2 3 reservoir operation model we employed the generic reservoir operation scheme proposed by hanasaki et al 2006 to consider the influence of reservoirs at the monthly scale the relationship between the inflow i m y m3 s and outflow q m y m3 s of a reservoir in a specific year y and month m is parameterized as q m y Œ∑ m y i mean c k c c k c Œ≤ Œ∑ m y i mean 1 c k c Œ≤ i m y 0 c k c where c s max i a represents the ratio between maximum reservoir storage capacity s max m3 to the mean total annual inflow i a m3 i mean m3 s is the multi year mean monthly inflow and is calculated by averaging all individual inflow i m y values during a historical period 1985 2014 in this study Œ∑ m y s beg m y Œ± c is the release coefficient s beg m y is the reservoir storage before its operation k c Œ± and Œ≤ are empirical parameters to be calibrated that determine reservoir operation rule generally multi year regulation reservoirs with a larger proportion of active storage capacity are more likely to have lower k c higher Œ± and lower Œ≤ values which indicates the monthly reservoir outflow is less dependent on the monthly inflow following liu et al 2016 the monthly outflow is adjusted as q m y max q m y 0 1 i m y 2 q m y min q m y s m y 0 1 s max Œ¥ t 3 q m y max q m y i m y s max s beg m y Œ¥ t 4 equation 2 assures an environmental flow which is no less than 10 of the mean monthly inflow equation 3 indicates that the reservoir cannot release water when the storage is below 10 dead storage equation 4 indicates water that exceeds the maximum storage will be released the water storage at the beginning of the next month s beg m 1 y m3 is calculated as s beg m 1 y s beg m y i m y q m y Œ¥ t note that the reservoir regulation rules in equations 1 4 do not consider human water consumption e g irrigation domestic and industrial water use this simplification is reasonable because the main function of the longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs over the uyrb is for hydropower generation and flood control by releasing storing water during the dry wet season cui et al 2020 liu et al 2016 2 4 model coupling and calibration following yun et al 2020 the reservoir scheme is coupled with the csspv2 model as follows first monthly reservoir inflows are extracted from the monthly streamflow simulation of csspv2 second reservoir outflows are calculated according to the operation rules in equations 1 4 third the above operation is developed sequentially from the upstream reservoir longyangxia down to the downstream reservoir liujiaxia for convenience the coupled model is denoted as csspv2 reservoir in the following analysis runoff parameters that were calibrated by trial and error over the uyrb according to the naturalized streamflow ji et al 2020a were used in the csspv2 model to generate natural streamflow according to the global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 the maximum storages of the longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs are 276 108 m3 and 61 108 m3 respectively we started the simulations in 1987 the time when longyangxia came into service cui et al 2020 other parameters Œ± Œ≤ and k c were calibrated according to the following two steps 1 by taking the kling gupta efficiency kge between the simulated and observed streamflow at lanzhou station during 1987 1999 as the objective function the enumeration method was used to search for suitable parameters the sampling ranges for Œ± Œ≤ and k c were 0 1 2 0 0 1 3 and 0 1 3 respectively with a sampling step of 0 1 a total of 749 parameter sets with a high kge greater than 0 7 were then selected 2 the root mean square errors rmses between the modeled and observed climatology of the reservoir monthly storage perturbations during 1987 2013 were calculated and the parameter setting with the lowest rmse was chosen i e Œ± 0 8 Œ≤ 1 3 and k c 1 9 3 data and methods 3 1 observational data monthly observed streamflow data during 1987 2010 measured at the lanzhou hydrological station red star in fig 1 was obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc ji et al 2020a in addition monthly naturalized streamflow which was estimated by adding human interventions e g reservoir operation agriculture irrigation domestic water uses back into the observation was also provided by the yrcc the naturalized streamflow was used to evaluate the model performance before coupling with the reservoir module the climatology of monthly water storage changes of longyangxia and liujiaxia during 1987 2013 was taken from yin et al 2021 observed meteorological forcings during 1979 2014 including the temperature precipitation humidity wind speed shortwave and longwave radiation came from the 3 hourly

intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 provides climate projections under different combinations of shared socio economic pathways ssp and representative concentration pathways rcp eyring et al 2016 for example the ssp5 rcp85 hereafter ssp585 scenario combines a fossil fueled development socioeconomic pathway with the 8 5 w m 2 concentration pathway representing a future that faces tough challenges for adaptation and mitigation to maintain the living standards for a fast growing population kriegler et al 2014 no significant differences in meteorological forcings have been reported between different ssp rcp scenarios under the same warming level dosio and fischer 2018 ji et al 2020b thus we selected a single ssp585 scenario where the 1 5 2 and 4 warming levels will be exceeded in the 21st century besides cmip6 all scenarios considering all historical forcings are also collected for model evaluation and baseline comparison table 1 lists the 11 cmip6 models selected in this study which provide daily meteorological forcings and can effectively represent the historical warming wetting and greening trends of the uyrb ji et al 2020b the land use harmonization 2 luh2 dataset used by the cmip6 models to represent land use change does not exhibit any significant transitions between different land use categories over the uyrb not shown hence only the monthly lai simulated by these models was adopted to represent land cover change systematic biases in the cmip6 models were corrected using the trend preserved bias correction method hempel et al 2013 which was described in detail in ji et al 2020b the global mean temperature during 1985 2014 the reference period in this research has increased by 0 66 compared with the preindustrial level thus the 1 5 2 4 warming levels were defined as the 30 year periods whose mean temperatures were 0 84 1 34 3 34 warmer than that in 1985 2014 table 1 lists the median years of the identified 30 year periods referred to as crossing years derived from different cmip6 models for example the access esm1 5 model would achieve the 2 0 warming level goal during the 2019 2048 with the crossing year being 2034 table 1 3 3 experimental design warming level determination and drought definition table 2 lists the experiments performed in this research the obs csspv2 and obs csspv2 reservoir represent the simulations forced by the observed cmfd meteorological forcings without and with the reservoir operation respectively cmip6 all csspv2 and cmip6 all csspv2 reservoir are similar but forced by cmip6 historical simulations cmip6 ssp585 csspv2 fixlai cmip6 ssp585 csspv2 and cmip6 ssp585 csspv2 reservoir gradually consider the effects of climate change land cover change and reservoirs for future projections note the fixlai means that the lai is fixed at the year of 1979 and only the monthly lai variation is considered during the simulation all simulations were performed at a 10 km resolution and half hourly time step the widely used standardized streamflow index ssi yuan et al 2017 yun et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2012 was employed to define hydrological droughts the ssi was calculated by normalizing the monthly streamflow according to a probability distribution fitted by the 30 year 1985 2014 monthly naturalized streamflow simulated by csspv2 here we used the gamma distribution to fit the monthly streamflow all fittings passed the kolmogorov smirnov test at the 0 05 confidence level the ssi at different warming levels was calculated based on the historical distribution streamflow drought occurs when the ssi is consistently below 0 8 for at least 3 continuous months yuan et al 2017 the drought onset month is the first month when the ssi falls below 0 8 drought duration the number of months of a drought event and drought severity i 1 n 0 8 s s i i where n is the drought duration were also determined note drought events and their characteristics at different warming levels were calculated based on 30 year time series for each cmip6 csspv2 simulation table 1 and the relative changes in drought characteristics e g frequency duration and severity under different warming levels were then determined separately the ensemble mean of 11 individual members was then calculated uncertainties of the multi model ensemble mean caused by choosing the cmip6 models were estimated by using the bootstrapping method following previous research ji et al 2020b yuan et al 2019 specifically the above calculation was repeated 10 000 times and the 11 cmip6 models were resampled with replacement during each bootstrap the 5 and 95 percentiles of the total 10 000 estimations were taken as the 5 95 uncertainty ranges paciorek et al 2018 4 results 4 1 model calibration and evaluation fig 2 a reveals the ability of the csspv2 model to reproduce the naturalized monthly streamflow the kge is 0 82 during 1987 2010 for the lanzhou station which indicates a satisfactory simulation according to the threshold kge greater than 0 5 proposed by moriasi et al 2007 fig 2b presents the modeled and observed monthly streamflow at lanzhou hydrological station the difference between the naturalized and observed streamflow black lines in fig 2 demonstrates that the reservoir operations modify the streamflow seasonality increasing decreasing the streamflow in the dry wet season and decrease the streamflow variations in general 24 39 of the water during the june october is stored in the reservoir and released during the dry seasons when driven by the observed meteorological forcings the csspv2 reservoir model reproduces this effect reasonably well with kge values of 0 74 and 0 63 during the calibration 1987 1999 and evaluation 2000 2010 periods respectively the performance of the cmip6 all csspv2 and cmip6 all csspv2 reservoir experiments are relatively poorer than the obs csspv2 kge 0 82 and obs csspv2 reservoir kge 0 71 with kges of 0 76 and 0 58 respectively blue lines in fig 2 this is attributed to the weaknesses of the cmip6 models in modeling the annual variations of meteorological forcings luo et al 2022 fig 3 compares the observed and simulated total monthly storage perturbations of longyangxia and liujiaxia during 1987 2013 both the obs csspv2 reservoir and cmip6 all csspv2 reservoir exhibit a good agreement with the observations by showing a discharge during november may and a recharge during june october the correlation coefficient between the simulations and observations is 0 96 0 97 and the relative rmse is lower than 30 4 2 climate and streamflow changes under different warming levels fig 4 a c present the historical and future changes of annual mean temperature precipitation and lai averaged over the uyrb the cmip6 simulations suggest a continued warming and wetting trend of the uyrb in the future fig 4a 4b which is consistent with recent research that uses a high resolution regional climate model wang et al 2021 vegetation greening also continues during 2015 2100 due to a favorable climatic condition that is identified as the dominant driver of lai change over the tibetan plateau zhu et al 2016 fig 4d 4f demonstrate a quasi linear response of the basin wide temperature precipitation and lai to global warming although the response magnitude differs among models the slope of the linear regression in fig 4d black line is 1 15 indicating that the warming rate over uyrb is 15 faster than the global mean speed the annual mean precipitation and lai over uyrb are projected to increase by 21 mm and 0 19 m2 m2 respectively with a global temperature increase of 1 fig 5 a depicts the simulated annual mean streamflow at the lanzhou hydrological station during 1987 2100 when only climate change is considered the annual streamflow blue line in fig 5a tends to increase during 2015 2100 with a speed of 18 3 m3 s decade 1 p value 0 when both climate change and land cover change are included however the annual streamflow decreases during 2030 2100 which consequently results in an insignificant increasing trend for the streamflow 1 7 m3 s decade 1 p value 0 3 moreover although reservoir operations tend to reduce increase the streamflow in wet dry years e g the small panel in fig 5a their relative influence is generally weak the limited influence of reservoir operations on annual streamflow is similar to the recent studies over the lancang mekong river basin yun et al 2020 2021 fig 5b compares the relative changes in the annual streamflow at different warming levels with those of the reference period 1985 2014 approximately 70 of the ensemble members exhibit an increasing trend in the annual streamflow and the ensemble means of all members are 1 5 5 0 3 9 at the 1 5 2 4 warming levels respectively land cover change has a small impact on the annual streamflow change at the 1 5 warming level but it reduces the increasing trend of annual streamflow from 5 0 3 9 to 3 2 4 0 at the 2 4 warming level in addition more than 75 of the ensemble members show a drying trend at the 4 warming level after considering the land cover change indicating the drying trend is generally robust the large impacts of land cover change can be inferred from the intensified evapotranspiration et induced by the increased lai which subsequently decreases the available water for runoff generation precipitation minus et fig 5c 5d fig 6 further presents the relative changes in the monthly streamflow the cmip6 all csspv2 which means monthly streamflow under natural conditions was used as the reference for all experiments significant increases 4 14 are observed for the monthly streamflow during the dry season december may at the 1 5 warming level when only climate change is considered this increase is larger at the 2 8 26 and 4 12 52 warming levels fig 6a and can be attributed to the increased precipitation during the winter and spring seasons not shown here the streamflow during july october however exhibits an insignificant increasing or even decreasing trend fig 6a when the land cover change is further considered minor differences are found for the monthly streamflow projections at the 1 5 and 2 warming levels fig 6a 6b however at the 4 warming level vegetation greening decreases the increasing monthly streamflow trend by 5 10 during november june pink bars in fig 6a 6b and leads to a significant decreasing streamflow in august when the reservoir operation is taken into account the increased monthly streamflow during the dry season at different warming levels is much larger while monthly streamflow in july september significantly decreases by 14 33 10 31 19 32 at the 1 5 2 4 warming levels respectively fig 6c 4 3 changes in hydrological droughts fig 7 shows the time series of the drought characteristics during 1999 2085 calculated based on a 30 year moving window e g values in 1999 are based on 1985 2014 together with their relative changes at different warming levels affected by climate change the drought frequency generally decreases in the future blue lines in fig 7a yet this is generally insignificant at different warming levels blue bars in fig 7b drought duration however significantly decreases by 9 12 19 at the 1 5 2 4 warming levels blue bars in fig 7d furthermore drought severity does not present significant changes at all warming levels land cover change does not greatly influence the drought projections at lower warming levels 1 5 and 2 however it generally enhances the drought frequency red line in fig 7a and causes a marked increase 28 in drought severity at the 4 warming level after considering reservoir operation drought frequency will increase by 63 48 and 108 at the 1 5 2 and 4 warming levels respectively although drought duration decreases at all warming levels due to reservoir operations the severity increases by 9 11 and 32 at the 1 5 2 and 4 warming levels respectively thus current reservoir operations will eliminate the drought alleviation effect of climate change and cannot mitigate the intensified drought induced by land cover change at the 4 warming level in order to better understand the changes in drought frequency and duration fig 8 presents the projected probability of each month experiencing drought during different decades drought events completely disappear during winter and spring from the 2030 s onwards around the time of the 2 warming level due to climate change fig 8a this is related to the robust increase in precipitation and streamflow fig 6 the wetting environment during the dry season prohibits long term drought that can span both the dry and wet seasons and thus the drought duration also decreases however there is a larger risk for the wet season e g august september to experience drought during 2070 s 2090 s around the time of the 4 warming level than that during the reference period thus drought frequency reductions induced by climate change become insignificant at the 4 warming level blue bars in fig 7b vegetation greening further increases the drought probability in the wet seasons during 2070 s 2090 s around the 4 warming level by 40 75 e g from 0 17 to 0 26 to 0 22 0 32 moreover the drying effects of vegetation greening propagate into november december when the lai is small and increases the drought frequency during that season the reservoir operation further intensifies the drought probability by 1 4 times during june october and reduces drought events during november may leading to more short period drought events in the future fig 8c and fig 7a b 5 discussion 5 1 mitigation of hydrological drought by changing reservoir operation rules we changed the reservoir operation rules for the future 2015 2100 period by perturbing parameters Œ± and Œ≤ both of which influence the release coefficient between the dynamic monthly inflow and the climatological annual mean inflow see sect 2 3 and equation 1 for detailed information fig 9 presents the relative changes in drought severity Œ¥severity at different warming levels when using different combinations of Œ± and Œ≤ parameters to be consistent with the above analysis the cmip6 all csspv2 is still taken as a reference in fig 9 a local optimal parameter setting that leads to a significant decrease in drought severity is masked out by the dashed box in fig 9 the Œ¥severity changes from 9 to 17 at the 1 5 2 0 warming level and from 32 to 8 at the 4 0 warming level when the optimal reservoir operation rule is used e g from the black solid box to the white dashed box in fig 9 compared with the scenario where only climate change and land cover change are considered red bars in fig 7f the optimal reservoir rule reduces drought severity significantly at low to mid warming levels e g 1 5 and 2 0 and alleviates the intensified drought severity at high the warming level e g 4 0 we also calculated the relative changes of drought severity using the cmip6 all csspv2 reservoir experiment as a baseline fig s1 the mitigation rule also helps relieve the drought severity compared with the current drought scenario fig s1 especially at 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels moreover the relative changes of drought frequency also decrease from 48 to 63 to 5 20 at the 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels and from 108 to 60 70 at the 4 0 warming level based on the optimal parameters in fig 9 fig s2 in addition under these conditions the relative changes in drought duration decrease from 22 27 to 22 30 fig s3 fig 10 compares the monthly reservoir storage fluctuations and monthly streamflow at lanzhou station under different warming levels based on the historical and optimized parameters the optimized parameters exhibit much higher Œ≤ values than those of the historical case which will decrease increase the first second term in the right side of equation 1 and thus enhance the monthly inflow weight when determining the reservoir outflow considering that the monthly inflow is larger smaller than the annual mean inflow during the wet dry seasons a higher monthly inflow weight will cause the reservoir to release more water during the wet season and less water during the dry season fig 10 note that although the dry season outflow is reduced by the optimal rule compared with the scenario using historical rules it is still larger than the values in natural condition therefore the optimal rule still prevents the existence of drought in dry seasons in addition an increased outflow during the wet season particularly july september in the mitigated rule will reduce the drought severity fig 10d and drought frequency over the downstream regions 5 2 necessity of considering land cover change in the projection although previous studies also pointed out the drying effect of vegetation greening climate change is found to have a stronger influence on streamflow and streamflow extremes than the vegetation greening during historical periods ji and yuan 2018 luan et al 2022 vicente serrano et al 2021 zhai and tao 2021 our findings however suggest that the importance of vegetation greening will increase in the future and may exceed climate change at high warming levels e g 4 0 for example there are no significant changes in annual streamflow and drought severity at the 4 0 warming level when just considering climate change however future vegetation greening will actually intensify the evapotranspiration and lead to a significant decreasing trend in the annual streamflow and an increasing trend in drought severity red bars in fig 5b and fig 7f this large difference subsequently propagates into the projection results causes large uncertainties and influence the subsequent judgements on future drought risks for example the drought frequency and severity will be underestimated by 40 50 when only climate change and reservoir operations are considered fig s4 thus research on future streamflow and hydrological drought projections should be conducted under an eco hydrological perspective instead of just considering temperature and precipitation changes and reservoir operations 5 3 limitations and perspective for future research this study also has several limitations first the current reservoir module is designed for hydropower generation and does not consider water consumption future climate warming is reported to increase the irrigation and domestic water demand guo and shen 2016 wada et al 2013 wang et al 2017 which will further decrease the streamflow and enhance hydrological droughts park et al 2021 thus the current projection may underestimate future hydrological drought second similar to previous studies we applied the same empirical parameters to the two reservoirs at the study site i e both reservoirs employ the same rule e g the release coefficient due to the lack of observation considering the reasonably good performance of the csspv2 reservoir model kge up to 0 75 the simplification will not influence the robustness of the current results however recent studies suggest that a collaborative operation between different reservoirs using different rules will be more efficient in generating energy and preventing hydrological extremes chang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 future research and more observational data are required to determine whether hydrological drought risk can be further decreased compared with the simple mitigated rules in section 5 1 by using optimal operation rules for the cascade reservoir system third although the cmip6 models improve hydroclimate simulations against the cmip5 models dong and dong 2021 they still exhibit deficiencies and uncertainties e g large bias overestimated annual variations in simulating the hydrological variables particularly the precipitation chen and yuan 2021 luo et al 2022 this subsequently causes uncertainties in the hydrological drought projection of the current study high resolution climate modeling at the convective permitting scale e g less than 4 km is reported to aid in decreasing model simulation errors slingo et al 2022 and is expected to advance future projection works zhou et al 2021 previous studies have demonstrated that permafrost degradation over the uyrb could exert impacts on streamflow variability ding et al 2019 ma et al 2019 niu et al 2011 wang et al 2018 both directly e g by altering the runoff generation processes and indirectly e g by influencing the ecosystem the csspv2 model directly solves the freeze thaw processes in its soil column and the thawing process will influence the runoff generation through changing the liquid water content and other soil hydraulic properties choi et al 2007 yuan et al 2018b in addition yuan et al 2018b suggest that the csspv2 can reasonably simulate the long term changes of frozen soils over the uyrb therefore the influence of permafrost degradation on streamflow changes has been partly considered during the simulations however the csspv2 model only simulates the soil thermal processes at 0 5 67 m without considering the permafrost at deeper depth moreover the indirect influences of permafrost degradation are still not considered in the model further efforts are needed to investigate and quantify the influence of permafrost degradation on the streamflow changes over the uyrb 6 conclusions by implementing a reservoir module into the csspv2 eco hydrological model this study developed a csspv2 reservoir model and used it to project the changes in hydrological drought over the uyrb at different warming levels climate change land cover change and reservoir operations are gradually considered in the projections to reveal their different contributions mitigation approaches to future drought changes were also investigated by perturbing the reservoir operation rules the key results are summarized in the following future climate change over the uyrb tends to increase the streamflow and alleviate hydrological drought without considering the influence of land cover changes compared with the natural condition during the reference period 1985 2014 annual streamflow at the uyrb outlet will increase by 1 5 5 2 3 9 at the 1 5 2 0 4 0 warming levels respectively moreover the increasing precipitation during the dry season november may has a much larger magnitude and is more significant than those during wet season which leads to a robust increasing trend in the monthly streamflow during november may 4 14 8 26 and 12 52 at 1 5 2 0 and 4 0 warming levels respectively under this background hydrological droughts that occur during the dry season are prohibited which consequently reduces drought frequency by 14 5 38 6 and drought duration by 9 1 18 5 limited changes however are observed for drought severity in the future vegetation greening induces minimal changes to the hydrological drought projection at the 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels but it has a strong impact at the 4 0 warming level by causing a significant annual streamflow reduction and drought severity intensification the dramatic increase in lai more than 50 compared with that during the reference period enhances evapotranspiration dries up the land and significantly reduces streamflow during the wet season the relative changes in the annual streamflow drought severity at the 4 0 warming level will change from 3 9 to 4 0 4 5 to 28 4 after considering vegetation greening current reservoir operations designed for hydropower generation will eliminate the drought alleviation influences of climate change at the 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels and cannot mitigate the intensified drought induced by vegetation greening at the 4 0 warming level this is because too much water is stored in reservoirs during the wet season which increases the drought frequency and severity in the downstream area during this period however when a mitigated reservoir operation rule is used in the future the drought severity will significantly reduce 17 compared with the reference period and the drought frequency exhibits insignificant changes at the 1 5 and 2 0 warming levels although the mitigation rule also alleviates drought severity from 28 4 to 5 6 at the 4 0 warming level the drought frequency is still 69 7 larger than that of the reference period thus controlling the global warming level below the ambitious goals 2 0 and even 1 5 proposed by the paris agreement is important for the reduction of drought risk over the uyrb this study provides comprehensive insights into the impacts of climate change land cover change and reservoir operations on the future changes of streamflow and hydrological drought over the uyrb the findings will provide a scientific reference for stakeholders to make relevant decisions and mitigation plans credit authorship

experiments or theoretical analyses is not always feasible to assess flooding logically conceptually and numerically methodological approaches algorithms models and procedures should be developed generally flood susceptibility modeling and mapping approaches have been developed based on two models i physically based models or knowledge driven models e g hec ras hec hms swat wetspa sobek etc

and perez 2022 in addition some studies to assess flood susceptibility employed multi criteria decision analysis mcda das 2020 nachappa et al 2020 yariyan et al 2020 the main shortcoming of the mcda based flood models is that they are prone to being skewed owing to their dependence on expert knowledge miles et al 1994 physically based models are based on complex mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior of a phenomenon or system solomatine and ostfeld 2008 physically based models are typically computationally challenging and necessitate a complete understanding of the underlying processes and extensive and accurate data sets data driven models on the other hand are based on mathematical equations derived from the investigation of contemporaneous inputs and outputs rather than physical processes solomatine and ostfeld 2008 the most prevalent data driven models are machine learning ml techniques jebur et al 2014 ml models have been widely utilized in natural disaster modeling such as landslide susceptibility modeling pham et al 2016 al najjar and pradhan 2021 chen and chen 2021 forest fire modeling bui et al 2018 pham et al 2020a pourghasemi et al 2020 and flood susceptibility modeling tehrany et al 2013 al abadi 2018 costache 2019 arabameri et al 2020 feng et al 2021 mahdizadeh gharakhanlou and perez 2022 the ann model as one of the prevalent ml models in natural hazard modeling chen et al 2004 pradhan et al 2010 falah et al 2019 is capable of accurately approximating intricate nonlinear input output relationships and uncovering hidden linkages in historical data multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn as one of the most efficient ann models has been utilized as a substitute model of hydrodynamic and hydrological models for flood susceptibility prediction kia et al 2012 janizadeh et al 2019 bui et al 2020 dodangeh et al 2020 mahdizadeh gharakhanlou and perez 2022 adaptive boosting adaboost is considered one of the most often used boosting algorithms which can be implemented without requiring prior knowledge about the functioning of the weak learning methodology the adaboost ensemble learning approach has a strong prediction capability and is not easily overfitted the adaboost approach has been used as one of the potential ml models in the flood susceptibility assessment madhuri et al 2021 balogun et al 2022 the dt and rf models are other predictive ml modeling approaches that have been demonstrated as potential methods in recognizing flooded regions with a much higher degree of accuracy lamovec et al 2013 tehrany et al 2013 lr another commonly used ml model predicts whether an attribute or outcome is present or absent regarding the values of a group of predictor variables ayalew and yamagishi 2005 yilmaz 2009 application of the lr model in recognizing the presence or absence of flood has been investigated in several studies based on various geo hydrological factors helsel and hirsch 2002 pradhan 2010 al juaidi et al 2018 chowdhuri et al 2020 likewise svm is another supervised learning binary classifier that has been commonly employed in flood susceptibility assessment tehrany et al 2014 tehrany et al 2015 sahana et al 2020 previous studies have typically assessed flood susceptibility with a single or very few ml techniques chau et al 2005 pradhan 2010 kia et al 2012 lee et al 2012 tehrany et al 2014 pham et al 2020b tang et al 2020 avand et al 2021 farhadi and najafzadeh 2021 the application of these different ml techniques to analyze flood susceptibility and its response to different methods is a relatively new contribution to literature accordingly the primary aim of this research concerns flood susceptibility assessment employing six various ml models e g dt rf mlp nn adaboost lr and svm while numerous meteorological hydrological and geospatial variables with a high spatial resolution i e 12 5 m were taken into account 2 materials and methods fig 1 depicts the flowchart of the research methodology the research process began with identifying and gathering a set of factors that could influence floods following the earlier studies see section 2 2 2 besides several flood and non flood locations were identified and randomly partitioned into training 70 and testing 30 datasets see section 2 2 1 next the correlation between the factors was assessed using the multi collinearity analysis to exclude the factors causing multi collinearity issues see section 2 3 having selected the flood conditioning factors and partitioned flood and non flood points the ml models were trained using the training datasets see section 2 4 the models were then validated against five accuracy criteria i e receiver operating characteristics area under the curve roc auc jaccard index f1 score overall accuracy oa and kappa coefficient Œ∫ using the testing datasets see section 2 5 following that the performance of six ml models was compared and the flood susceptibility map provided by the highest accuracy model was used in the following steps finally the fr method and the correlation matrix were used to determine the importance of each flood conditioning factor see section 2 6 2 1 study area this research was conducted in the lower nicola river sub watershed which has a drainage area of 376 064 ha and is part of the thompson drainage basin of the fraser river system in south central british columbia fig 2 mazany wright et al 2021 the lower nicola river sub watershed experienced a destructive flood on november 14 2021 due to heavy rains brought by an atmospheric river accordingly this sub watershed was selected as an appropriate application site for the mapping of flood susceptibility 2 2 data and preprocessing of the data 2 2 1 flood inventory mapping predicting future floods demands the use of an inventory map which depicts one or more flood events in a certain region bui et al 2012 the basic premise behind the inventory map is that future floods will most likely have comparable conditions to previous ones the flood inventory map was produced by reviewing maps and photos of the flooding that happened on november 14 2021 as well as using satellite images before and after that flooding topographic maps and google earth software 180 flood points in all were identified as well as 180 non flood points and a flood inventory map was provided using them it is worth noting that non flood sites were selected from places where flooding is unable to progress all flood and non flood sites identified throughout the study area were depicted in fig 3 2 2 2 flood conditioning factors the patterns of flooding are not readily predicted without adequate knowledge of the relationships of various meteorological hydrological and geospatial factors vojtek and vojtekov√° 2019 dodangeh et al 2020 despite the lack of a standardized procedure in identifying factors that foremost forecast future floods our approach in selecting the sets of factors mainly was based on previous studies having conducted a literature analysis flood conditioning data were gathered from various sources the data and their sources were summarized in table 1 in this study sixteen following factors were selected as prospective flood susceptibility model independent variables regarding a survey of the literature professional opinions and circumstances in the research region elevation slope aspect plan and profile curvature roughness topographic wetness index twi land cover rainfall distance from rivers drainage density lithology soil normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference moisture index ndmi prior to using all these factors as potential explanatory variables in predicting flood susceptibility it is required to assess the intensity of multiple correlations between factors and whether the factors have a significant role in predicting flood susceptibility to do so the spearman correlation and the multi collinearity analysis were performed and the significance role of thirteen variables in predicting flood susceptibility was confirmed concerning variance inflation factors vifs see section 2 3 the terrain has a significant impact on the direction and speed of surface runoff avand and moradi 2021 azareh et al 2021 in doing so the digital elevation model dem was acquired through the alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar and clipped to the boundary of the study area fig 4 a in hydrologic conditions the slope has an impact on surface infiltration runoff rates and subsurface drainage samanta et al 2018 besides the flow direction of surface runoff is determined by aspect slope and aspect maps fig 4b and fig 4c were derived from the dem layer using slope and aspect tools respectively plan and profile curvature represent the flow convergence and diversion as it changes aspect along a contour and the slope variation along the flow path respectively plan and profile curvatures fig 4d and fig 4e were prepared using the curvature tool on dem rainfall intensity and frequency are among the most crucial factors that lead to floods h√∂lting and coldewey 2019 in this study first annual rainfall was collected at ten climatological stations from 1987 to 2006 i e 20 years both inside and beyond the watershed next the coefficient of variation cv of annual rainfall at each climatological station was calculated then the kriging interpolation method was applied to provide a continuous layer fig 4i following previous studies avand and moradi 2021a janizadeh et al 2021 river flows are the principal paths for amplifying flood discharges as a result regions near rivers are particularly exposed to flooding the euclidean distance tool was employed on the rivers in the research region to provide distance from rivers map fig 4j drainage density is a metric for describing the physical characteristics of a drainage basin to provide the drainage density map in the study area fig 4k the line density tool was applied to streams the roughness is the difference in elevation between neighboring pixels in a dem this is a measure for determining surface runoff and it is calculated according to eq 1 evans 2019 the roughness measure was calculated for each pixel in the study area and depicted in fig 4f 1 roughness f s mean fs min f s max fs min here fs mean fs min and fs max represent the mean minimum and maximum focal statistical layer respectively topographic wetness index twi a physical characteristic of a watershed area measures the impact of topography on the saturation levels of the terrain on runoff generation and the geographical distribution of wetness conditions avand et al 2021 twi for each pixel in the study area fig 4g was calculated according to eq 2 hong et al 2018 2 twi ln Œ± tan Œ≤ here Œ± denotes the cumulative upstream discharge at one point or flow accumulation m 2 m 1 and Œ≤ is the slope radian the permeability of runoff varies depending on the rock type samanta et al 2018 accordingly the lithology map was prepared in five groups with regards to the geological data fig 4l variable land cover can result in different runoff and flow characteristics the land covers for the study area were retrieved using the clip tool fig 4h water retention and surface runoff generation are significantly influenced by soil types avand et al 2021 to retrieve the soil types in the study area fig 4m the clip tool was applied given the boundary of the study area three indices of ndwi fig 4n ndvi fig 4o and ndmi fig 4p were calculated for the study area based on the sentinel 2 satellite images ndwi identifies the presence of water bodies and tracks changes in their water content the ndwi value ranges from 1 to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating the presence of water zhou et al 2017 the ndvi is an indicator to estimate the density of green on an area of land and identify vegetated regions it has a range of 1 to 1 that positive values indicate a greater amount of greenery whereas negative values indicate a lack of biomass e g water helbich 2019 the ndmi is used to determine the moisture content of vegetation with values closer to 1 indicating higher moisture taloor et al 2021 eqs 3 5 indicate the equations for calculating ndwi eq 3 ndvi eq 4 and ndmi eq 5 3 ndwi g n i r g n i r 4 ndvi nir r nir r 5 ndmi nir s w i r nir s w i r here g is the green band band 3 of sentinel nir is the near infrared band band 8 of sentinel r is the red band band 4 of sentinel and swir is the short wave infrared band band 11 of sentinel having prepared each flood conditioning factor fig 4 all factor layers were converted into raster data with a pixel size of 12 5 m and the values of all factors for flood and non flood sites were retrieved 2 3 correlation and multi collinearity analyses of factors in regression analysis the presence of correlation among predictors is undesirable and leads to an increase in the standard error of predictors coefficients accordingly to investigate the strength and direction of correlations between the predictors the spearman correlation test was employed spearman correlation test is a non parametric test i e it assumes no data distribution for determining the degree of correlation between the pairs of predictors de winter et al 2016 additionally the issue of multi collinearity arises when two or more predictors are substantially correlated with one another daoud 2017 accordingly before feeding all the predictors i e flood conditioning factors into the flood ml models it is indispensable to employ the multi collinearity analysis to determine the proper predictors for assessing the flood susceptibility the multi collinearity analysis assesses the intensity of correlations between the predictors using vifs and tolerances a vif value greater than 5 indicates the multi collinearity issue daoud 2017 in this study to have much certainty in selecting significant independent predictors the threshold of 4 for vif was taken into account saha et al 2021 2 4 machine learning methods applied for flood susceptibility modeling this section describes six various ml models for assessing flood susceptibility in the study area mlp nn see section 2 4 1 dt see section 2 4 2 rf see section 2 4 3 adaboost see section 2 4 4 lr see section 2 4 5 and svm see section 2 4 6 all thirteen independent variables specified as potential explanatory flood conditioning factors were used in all six models as predictors 2 4 1 multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn the neural network model is a basic representation of brain systems that are frequently utilized in science to tackle a variety of issues zeng and yeung 2001 neural network models have the benefit of being able to solve complicated nonlinear issues mlp nn is one of the most efficient neural network methods that is made up of numerous layers of computational units i e nodes or neurons that are interconnected by weights each layer takes in a number of inputs computes the weighted sum and then sends the outcome to a nonlinear activation function accordingly in the mlp nn method input output connections are established using multilayer non linear transformations bishop and nasrabadi 2006 the repetitive training procedure entails adjusting the connection weights to minimize the cost function i e the function which is defined based on the differences between model outputs and the corresponding desired output the conceptual scheme of the mlp nn its working principle and learning processes were explicitly explained in the auxiliary material document 2 4 2 decision tree dt a dt is a decision making tool that employs a tree like decision paradigm a dt is a hierarchical algorithm in which each non terminal node generates a binary decision on a feature each branch reflects the conclusion of the decision and each leaf node i e terminal node represents a class label tehrany et al 2013 the class label is determined based on the dt type in a classification issue the class label is the category to which the data belongs and in a regression issue the class label is a numeric number the tree moves down from the root node to leaf nodes regarding a set of rules that determine the path to follow schneevoigt et al 2008 dt method has certain privileges including i it is capable of representing the relationships between variables without making any assumptions about data distribution ii no explicit restrictions are required for the format of data e g nominal scalar etc iii it is easily interpretable iv it is less sensitive to outliers and v data normalization is not required kheir et al 2010 in this study the dt method was used to separate and classify data into two groups of flooded and non flooded areas using the flood conditioning factors a value of 1 denotes the presence of flooding while a value of 0 denotes the lack of flooding in the region the choice of which conditioning factors to use first for splitting is done based on the notion that classification yields more pure and homogeneous groupings entropy i e the expected amount of information as a criterion to measure the impurity of a dataset charbuty and abdulazeez 2021 was used to split in other words entropy was used as the cost function and the split was done regarding the conditioning factor which yielded the lowest entropy because the lower the entropy value the higher the purity of the classes entropy is calculated according to eq 6 6 e x c 1 c p x c log 2 p x c here c is the number of classes i e in this study c 2 and p is the probability that the variable belongs to class c 2 4 3 random forest rf dt splits the dataset recursively using the decision nodes until the pure leaf nodes are left and it finds the best split in each non terminal node according to entropy value irrespective of the advantages of the dt method the dt method is highly sensitive to the training data which can lead to large variance i e over fitting issue and failure to generalize accordingly the rf method is used to reduce over fitting errors as it is a lot less sensitive method to the training data merghadi et al 2020 sahin et al 2020 the rf method is a collection of multiple random decision trees each tree includes randomly sampled data with replacement i e bootstrap samples so that it fits independently in these data subsets as a result of bootstrapping dou et al 2020 bootstrapping involves producing random new datasets from original data with the same size having produced bootstrap samples and subsequently decision trees based on them the predictions of all trees are aggregated to predict for one sample i e bootstrap aggregation or bagging rf model includes two random processes bootstrapping and random feature selection bootstrapping ensures that no two trees utilize the same data making the model less sensitive to the original training data the random feature selection helps to reduce the correlation between the trees aside from that random feature selection has another advantage some of the trees will be trained on less significant features while others will be trained on more important features resulting in a balanced set of predictions generally the ideal size of the feature selection is determined using the log or square root of the total number of features 2 4 4 adaptive boosting adaboost adaboost a kind of boosted dt performs on the same principle of boosting meaning that it retrains samples which are difficult to classify briem et al 2002 adaboost creates dts called stumps which are built up of just one node and two leaves in other words the adaboost technique is a forest of stumps that includes all the trees and employs an iterative methodology where each training item is given a weight at each level of prediction except the first dou and chen 2017 adaboost allows both records to pass unlike enhanced dts which only enable the incorrectly categorized records from dt to be sent on to another stump in this case the method is to give easier to classify observations a lower weight in order to increase their probability in the subsequent prediction round while giving erroneously identified samples a higher weight as a result the second stump is grown using this weighted data to create further trees this process is repeated a certain number of times following the training of the classifiers a weight will be allocated to each classifier and the final prediction which is based on a weighted majority vote will be evaluated a more accurate classifier will be given more weight in order to produce more plausible findings and have a greater impact on the final prediction the main advantage of this approach is that the optimum answer is found by combining all the trees not just the final one 2 4 5 logistic regression lr linear models aim to capture the relationships between independent and dependent variables by fitting a line that perfectly follows the existing relationship between independent and dependent variables in other words linear models assume that the predicted outcome of an instance is a weighted sum of its features and to estimate the optimal weights the ordinary least squares method is usually used bishop and nasrabadi 2006 although linear regression models offer a lot of potential for regression they fall short when it comes to classification issues accordingly lr an extension of the linear regression model is used for classification issues a detailed explanation of lr s working principles and its learning processes was given in in the auxiliary material document 2 4 6 support vector machines svm svm is a supervised ml model that is frequently used for binary classification the objective of svm models is to determine a hyper plane i e decision boundary that distinctly classifies the data points bishop and nasrabadi 2006 the separation of data points into two classes could be done with many possible hyper planes however the objective of svm is to find the hyper plane that has the maximum margin i e the maximum distance between support vectors of both classes the reason for selecting the hyper plane with maximum margin is robustness and reducing the chance of miss classification in logistic regression the outputs of the linear function are squashed within the range of 0 1 and depending on the comparison between the squashed value and the threshold i e 0 5 the data points are allocated to one of two classes i e classes with labels either 0 or 1 in svm however the output of the kernel function is passed through the sign function and data points are allocated to one of two classes 1 or 1 the svm kernel is a function that transforms a low dimensional input space into a higher dimensional space to convert a non separable issue into a separable one amongst the various functions that are used as the svm kernels e g linear kernel polynomial kernel pl radial basis function kernel rbf and sigmoid kernel pradhan 2013 tehrany et al 2014 pl and rbf as known as gaussian kernels are the most frequently employed kernels marjanoviƒá et al 2011 in this study the rbf kernel function was used a full description of svm s functioning principles and its learning processes were included in the auxiliary material document in this study to reduce the over fitting issue as well as ascertain the values of corresponding hyper parameters in each ml model the 5 fold cross validation technique was used similar studies using ml techniques have shown that 5 fold is often a sufficient number of folds to prevent the likelihood of over fitting immitzer et al 2012 wang et al 2015 baig et al 2021 following the 5 fold cross validation technique the training data are partitioned into five sections of which four sections are used for training the models and one section is used to assess the models performance this process is performed five times using different sections in each iteration 2 5 model validation and performance assessment having reviewed earlier studies the performance of the models was assessed and validated using five accuracy criteria of roc auc jaccard index f1 score oa and Œ∫ avand and moradi 2021a janizadeh et al 2021 avand et al 2022 the roc curve is a graphical representation that shows how a binary ml classifier performs chen et al 2021 the true positive rate tpr and false positive rate fpr are plotted against one other at different threshold levels to form the roc curve the fraction of the positive class that is correctly classified by the model is referred to as sensitivity or tpr the fraction of the negative class that is correctly classified is known as specificity or true negative rate tnr fpr is a metric that indicates the fraction of the negative class that is incorrectly classified eqs 7 9 were used to calculate specificity or tpr fpr and sensitivity 7 sensitivity t p r tp p tp tp f n 8 fpr fp tn f p 1 s p e c i f i c i t y 9 specificity t n r tn n tn tn f p here tp true positive and tn true negative are test results that correctly indicate the presence and absence of a condition or characteristics respectively fp false positive and fn false negative are test results that incorrectly indicate the presence and absence of a condition or characteristics respectively p and n represent the actual positive and negative cases in the data respectively the jaccard index is a statistic for determining sample sets diversity and similarity jaccard index equivalent to the figure of merit fom is calculated according to eq 10 the jaccard index has a range of values from 0 to 1 with 1 being the perfect match yin and yasuda 2005 10 jaccardindex tp tp f p f n in binary classification statistical analysis the f score measures the accuracy of a test it is determined employing the test s precision or sensitivity with precision being equal to the ratio of true positive results to all positive results including those that were misidentified an f score can have a maximum value of 1 which denotes perfect precision and a minimum value of 0 which occurs when either precision or recall is zero f1 score is calculated according to eq 11 chicco and jurman 2020 11 f 1 2 t p 2 t p f p f n one of the metrics that indicates the proportion of accurately predicted pixels to total pixels is the oa criterion eq 12 chicco and jurman 2020 the Œ∫ index another statistical metric indicates the degree of agreement between two sets of data in contrast to oa this metric takes into account incorrectly predicted pixels and includes them in computations as a result this metric reveals the true closeness of predicted values to actual values by eliminating the impact of chance on modeling gharakhanlou and hooshangi 2021 regarding mchugh 2012 values 0 for Œ∫ indicate no conformity or agreement 0 01 0 20 as

the factors that have the most influence on causing a flood could aim at mitigating flood damage the fr method is a basic quantitative technique for revealing the probable relationship between independent and dependent variables with multiple classes razandi et al 2015 accordingly the fr method was employed in this study to assess the importance of each flood conditioning factor on the flood to calculate the fr value of each flood conditioning factor the factors first were classified using the quantile classification method in arcgis and then the proportion of flooded pixels was divided by the proportion of non flooded pixels in the region covered by each class using eq 15 the linkage between the flood susceptibility map and flood conditioning factors has been constructed to determine the fr value for a certain class from a given factor it is worth mentioning that the binary flood susceptibility map which indicates whether each pixel is flooded or not was employed in the fr method 15 fr c n f l o o d e d p i x e l c n f l o o d e d p i x e l a n a l l pixel c n a l l pixel a here fr c is the fr value for a certain class from a given factor n f l o o d e d p i x e l c is the number of pixels from a specific class that have been flooded n f l o o d e d p i x e l a represents all of the flooded pixels in the research region n a l l pixel c is the total number of pixels from a given factor that fall under a specific class and n a l l pixel a is the total number of pixels in the research region 3 results 3 1 investigation the spearman correlation and multi collinearity analyses of factors the value of spearman s coefficient i e rho for each pair of predictors was calculated and shown in fig 5 the direction of correlation between predictors was determined by the sign of the spearman coefficient and shown with two different colors of blue i e the positive direction and red i e the negative direction in fig 5 the spearman correlation coefficient ranges between 1 and 1 the closer the spearman coefficient value to 0 the less correlation between the pair of predictors regarding the results of the spearman correlation analysis ndvi and ndwi variables had the strongest correlation i e 0 914 the results of the multi collinearity analysis were summarized in table 2 the vif had a range from 1 097 to 19 785 with the aspect factor accounting for the lowest value and the ndvi factor for the greatest value regarding the multi collinearity analysis except for three factors of elevation ndwi and ndvi the rest variables had a vif value below the threshold i e 4 accordingly thirteen factors were included in the assessment of study area s susceptibility to flooding 3 2 hyper parameters tuning most ml models have many hyper parameters that influence their performance although hyper parameters are frequently used with their default settings finding the optimum values for them i e tuning hyper parameters is essential to increase the possibility of achieving most desirable results accordingly some of the most essential hyper parameters of each ml model were considered and tuned in this study generally hyper parameters tuning is done through validation techniques such as k fold cross validation accordingly the optimum values of hyper parameters in this study were determined using the 5 fold cross validation it is worth mentioning that the gridsearchcv is configured to build a grid search hyper parameter tuner on the training set besides to provide a comparative analysis of the contribution of hyper parameters values the mean test accuracy score was measured the mean test accuracy describes the mean accuracy of scores accumulated when predicting the test dataset and is used to rank the competing hyper parameter combinations all the investigated hyper parameters along with their optimum values were listed in table 3 3 3 model validation and performance assessment to quantitatively assess and compare the efficiency of ml models in prediction flood prone areas and ensure their consistency with reality i e model validation five accuracy criteria of roc auc jaccard index f1 score oa and Œ∫ were used regarding values calculated for the accuracy criteria table 4 all models have sufficient capability for assessing and predicting flood prone areas the confusion matrixes used for calculating the accuracy criteria were shown in fig a1 appendix a regarding table 4 even though the variations in performance across the models were not significant the rf model outperformed the other models the order of models in terms of performance from high to low was as follows rf adaboost dt lr svm and mlp nn the roc curves were plotted in fig 6 to evaluate and compare the classifier quality independent of the threshold auc values vary in the range 0 5 1 with 1 denoting an unexceptionable prediction and 0 5 denoting a random prediction yesilnacar 2005 3 4 flood susceptibility map each pixel in the study area includes 13 features each of which refers to a different flood conditioning factor having trained six different ml models they were applied to each pixel in the study area to calculate and predict the flood susceptibility value in each pixel after calculating the flood susceptibility value for the whole study area the well defined natural break method of classification through the arcgis tool was used to stratify the flood susceptibility values into five classes i e very low low moderate high and very high all the flood susceptibility maps provided through the ml models were shown in fig 7 based on the dt model 27 55 12 74 10 16 6 88 and 42 67 of the study region were classified as a very low low moderate high and very high flood susceptible zone respectively according to the flood susceptible map provided using the rf model flood susceptibility is very low in 29 91 low in 18 72 moderate in 16 15 high in 15 49 and very high in 19 73 of the study area in the mlp nn model flood susceptibility classes of very low low moderate high and very high respectively covered 29 87 15 46 13 65 15 54 and 25 48 of the study area the findings of the adaboost model indicated that the flood susceptibility in five classes of very low low moderate high and very high included 14 52 17 21 24 53 25 28 and 18 46 of the study area respectively in the svm model the percentage coverage of very low low moderate high and very high flood prone zones was 39 14 8 53 8 62 12 31 and 31 4 respectively lastly the flood susceptibility map produced by the lr model proposed that 40 68 9 65 7 42 9 03 and 33 22 of the study region was in very low low moderate high and very high flood susceptible zones respectively the percentage of flood susceptibility classes in all six ml models was summarized in fig 8 3 5 assessment of flood conditioning factors importance using the fr method and the correlation matrix another aim of this study was to determine the significance of factors affecting flooding accordingly the fr method was used to determine the relationship between the flood occurrences and the flood conditioning factors the fr values calculated for each class of flood conditioning factors and consequently the importance of each class in the given factors were explicitly shown in fig 9 besides the fr value of a certain class in a particular factor was given in much detail in table a1 appendix b it is worth mentioning that the importance of factors increases with the increases in fr value and vice versa regarding the fr results fig 9 and table a1 flooding in the study area was most frequently associated with slopes between 20 and 77 fr 1 16 the fr results indicated that places with plan curvature ranging between 16 04 and 0 59 had the highest fr 1 10 as well as profile curvature between 0 59 and 19 46 fr 1 05 besides for the twi factor the highest fr belongs to the class 7 58 25 59 fr 1 05 in the roughness the class 0 48 0 51 fr 1 08 and among the classes in aspect factor the flat slope aspect fr 1 24 had the highest fr values furthermore perennial cropland annual cropland developed land and grassland land covers had the highest flood occurrences with fr values of 2 32 2 31 2 19 and 1 94 respectively also the highest fr in the cv of rainfall factor was related to class 22 4 23 fr 1 42 in terms of flood occurrence and distance from the river the highest flood occurrence was in the first class and the least distance 0 558 m with an fr value equal to 1 54 the fr method indicated that flooding is less likely to occur in places far away from the rivers there is also the highest likelihood of flooding on the drainage density 4 29 8 83 class fr 1 83 regarding the results of fr the higher the drainage density the greater the risk of flooding furthermore volcanic rocks lithology rf 1 74 haplic kastanozems soil type fr 1 67 and ndmi between 0 87 and 0 07 fr 1 34 were most frequently associated with the flooding having calculated the flood susceptibility values in each pixel of the whole study area using the rf model and provided the flood susceptibility map in the study area the most significant factors influencing the flood were determined using the correlation matrix based on the spearman correlation analysis it is worth mentioning that the flood susceptibility map provided through the rf model due to having the highest accuracy was chosen to evaluate the importance of flood conditioning factors in fig 10 the importance of flood conditioning factors considered in this study was shown the positive correlation was indicated by the blue bars while the negative correlation was indicated by the orange bars following the findings lithology drainage density distance from rivers soil rainfall land cover and ndmi were the most influential flood conditioning factors 4 discussion the rate of floods and the consequent damages have grown dramatically in recent years as a result of human interventions and the ensuing climate and land cover changes mahdizadeh gharakhanlou and perez 2022 an accurate flood susceptibility map could be beneficial in the development of practical and effective mitigation strategies to reduce the damages caused by floods sahana et al 2020 over the previous few decades improving approaches for identifying flood prone areas and providing flood susceptibility maps has been among the primary goals of the scientific community manfreda et al 2014 di baldassarre et al 2020 following the study by saha et al 2021 three substantial elements that have influences in efficiently mapping flood susceptibility are 1 selection of appropriate flood conditioning factors 2 spatial resolution of the flood conditioning factors and 3 the accuracy and efficiency of data layer integration models concerning earlier studies tien bui and hoang 2017 bui et al 2019 ahmed et al 2021 avand and moradi 2021 we chose various climatological hydrological and geo environmental flood conditioning factors and prepared those using remote sensing rs and geographical information systems gis techniques the potential benefit of taking into account diverse flood conditioning factors in terms of providing flood susceptibility maps with the higher accuracy has been asserted in earlier studies tien bui and hoang 2017 bui et al 2019 vojtek and vojtekov√° 2019 dodangeh et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 avand and moradi 2021 likewise our findings in consistent with the earlier studies indicated that considering various meteorological hydrological and geospatial factors influencing floods is highly recommended to provide flood susceptibility maps with higher accuracy the spatial resolution of the flood conditioning factors is another element that has a substantial influence on the accuracy of flood susceptibility maps the dem is one of the primary flood conditioning factors from which a majority of flood conditioning factors are derived following the efficiency of high spatial resolution of factors on floods a dem with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m was used as well as other flood conditioning factors with the same spatial resolution as the dem i e 12 5 m the significance of a high spatial resolution database in flood prediction models was demonstrated in the earlier investigations bonekamp et al 2018 muhadi et al 2020 schaller et al 2020 similarly our findings demonstrated that considering factors with high spatial resolution leads in a more accurate flood susceptibility map in recent years developing more robust methodologies and approaches has been a desire for researchers to achieve precise and accurate flood susceptibility maps bui et al 2020 nachappa et al 2020 remarkable accuracy of ml models and the significant potential of ml models in assessing the flood susceptibility were demonstrated in the earlier studies ngo et al 2018 talukdar et al 2020 accordingly six promising ml models namely dt rf mlp nn adaboost lr and svm were used in this study to assess the flood susceptibility and provide the flood susceptibility maps with greater accuracy in the lower nicola river sub watershed canada our findings like those of other studies ngo et al 2018 talukdar et al 2020 demonstrated the high accuracy and great potential of ml models in assessing flood susceptibility earlier studies have typically assessed flood susceptibility with a single or very few ml techniques chau et al 2005 pradhan 2010 kia et al 2012 lee et al 2012 tehrany et al 2014 pham et al 2020b tang et al 2020 avand et al 2021a farhadi and najafzadeh 2021 due to the inclusion of different flood conditioning factors in ml models comparing them across research has proven problematic accordingly six various ml models were utilized in this research with the same flood conditioning factors and in the same case study to gain a comprehensive understanding of which ml model or collection of ml models may produce the most accurate predictions besides due to the disagreement of researchers on the superiority and preference of accuracy criteria the models were evaluated and compared using five various accuracy criteria the results of various accuracy criteria indicated that the rf model outperformed the other models despite the insignificant differences in performance across the models our findings aligned with those of previous investigations lee et al 2017 chen et al 2020 mahdizadeh gharakhanlou and perez 2022 to evaluate the importance of factors on floods the fr method and the correlation matrix were used in this study regarding our findings lithology drainage density distance from rivers soil rainfall land cover and ndmi were the most influential factors determining flood regarding the findings of previous investigations avand and moradi 2021 avand et al 2022 collins et al 2022 distance from rivers is among the most influential factors in floods drainage density land cover land use lithology and soil type are proven as influential factors affecting floods according to studies by saha et al 2021 avand and moradi 2021 samanta et al 2018 and avand et al 2021 respectively furthermore several previous studies have emphasized the substantial significance and impact of rainfall on flooding avand and moradi 2021 avand et al 2021 accordingly our findings were consistent with earlier studies emphasizing the significant influence of aforementioned factors on floods 4 1 strengths and limitations the strengths of this study include i considering various meteorological hydrological and geospatial flood conditioning factors in the flood susceptibility assessment ii using a dem with a high spatial resolution i e 12 5 m and consequently modeling and assessing the flood susceptibility in a more precise manner iii providing a comprehensive description of the functionality of six ml models iv using six various ml models to identify the most flood prone areas in the study area v evaluating and comparing the performance of six flood ml methods under the consideration of same factors and in the same case study using five various accuracy criteria and vi investigating the impact of each factor on flooding and identifying the most influential ones notwithstanding these strengths the main limitation of this study was related to creating the flood inventory map regarding a single flood event the reason for using a single flood event in this study was the lack of information on previous flood events in the study area as well as available data 5 conclusion owing to life threatening flood disasters and their vast disruptive effects the main aim of the present study was to assess flood susceptibility using ml models among various ml models six most promising ml models were employed to evaluate the flood susceptibility in the lower nicola river sub watershed canada the factors influencing floods were picked from a list of sixteen meteorological hydrological and geospatial variables thirteen variables were ascertained as potential explanatory factors for flood susceptibility assessment using the multi collinearity analysis having trained the models their accuracy was evaluated and validated

rf model had the highest accuracy followed closely by the adaboost model flood conditioning factors were reclassified using quantile classification method and the importance of each class from a given flood conditioning factor was evaluated using the fr method additionally the importance of flood conditioning factors in causing floods was evaluated using the correlation matrix based on the spearman correlation analysis regarding the results of the correlation matrix lithology drainage density distance from rivers soil rainfall land cover and ndmi had the highest influence on flooding the flood susceptibility map as the principal output of this study was produced in five classes ranging from very low to very high susceptibility the flood susceptibility map provided using the rf model i e the model with the highest accuracy indicated that the flood susceptibility is very high in 19 73 of the study area high in 15 49 moderate in 16 15 low in 18 72 and very low in 29 91 our findings demonstrated that ml models have a remarkable potential for assessing flood susceptibility and predicting flood prone locations the quantitative analysis of flood susceptibility can assist with decision making planning and investment in flood mitigation measures besides the destructive consequences of floods could be mitigated by identifying and properly managing flood prone regions in this study the hyper parameters of the models were tuned using the 5 fold cross validation and the gridsearchcv the hyper parameters of the models can be tuned in future research using optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms ga and particle swarm optimization pso additionally it is proposed that future studies employ the identical ml models and consider the same flood conditioning factors to compare the flood susceptibility maps provided in canada with those produced in europe code and data availability the raw data that were utilized in this research are all openly accessible

applied machine learning ml models including decision tree dt random forest rf multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn adaptive boosting adaboost logistic regression lr and support vector machines svm a flood inventory map was provided using 180 flood points and 180 non flood points both flood and non flood locations were randomly partitioned into training and testing datasets with the ratio of

introduction flooding as one of disruptive disasters results in the mortality properties and infrastructure zou et al 2012 identifying flood prone areas aids in providing appropriate policy planning and management and consequently could assist in reducing risks and losses dawson et al 2006 bui et al 2019 however investigating natural phenomena particularly flooding by performing either real world

and perez 2022 in addition some studies to assess flood susceptibility employed multi criteria decision analysis mcda das 2020 nachappa et al 2020 yariyan et al 2020 the main shortcoming of the mcda based flood models is that they are prone to being skewed owing to their dependence on expert knowledge miles et al 1994 physically based models are based on complex mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior of a phenomenon or system solomatine and ostfeld 2008 physically based models are typically computationally challenging and necessitate a complete understanding of the underlying processes and extensive and accurate data sets data driven models on the other hand are based on mathematical equations derived from the investigation of contemporaneous inputs and outputs rather than physical processes solomatine and ostfeld 2008 the most prevalent data driven models are machine learning ml techniques jebur et al 2014 ml models have been widely utilized in natural disaster modeling such as landslide susceptibility modeling pham et al 2016 al najjar and pradhan 2021 chen and chen 2021 forest fire modeling bui et al 2018 pham et al 2020a pourghasemi et al 2020 and flood susceptibility modeling tehrany et al 2013 al abadi 2018 costache 2019 arabameri et al 2020 feng et al 2021 mahdizadeh gharakhanlou and perez 2022 the ann model as one of the prevalent ml models in natural hazard modeling chen et al 2004 pradhan et al 2010 falah et al 2019 is capable of accurately approximating intricate nonlinear input output relationships and uncovering hidden linkages in historical data multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn as one of the most efficient ann models has been utilized as a substitute model of hydrodynamic and hydrological models for flood susceptibility prediction kia et al 2012 janizadeh et al 2019 bui et al 2020 dodangeh et al 2020 mahdizadeh gharakhanlou and perez 2022 adaptive boosting adaboost is considered one of the most often used boosting algorithms which can be implemented without requiring prior knowledge about the functioning of the weak learning methodology the adaboost ensemble learning approach has a strong prediction capability and is not easily overfitted the adaboost approach has been used as one of the potential ml models in the flood susceptibility assessment madhuri et al 2021 balogun et al 2022 the dt and rf models are other predictive ml modeling approaches that have been demonstrated as potential methods in recognizing flooded regions with a much higher degree of accuracy lamovec et al 2013 tehrany et al 2013 lr another commonly used ml model predicts whether an attribute or outcome is present or absent regarding the values of a group of predictor variables ayalew and yamagishi 2005 yilmaz 2009 application of the lr model in recognizing the presence or absence of flood has been investigated in several studies based on various geo hydrological factors helsel and hirsch 2002 pradhan 2010 al juaidi et al 2018 chowdhuri et al 2020 likewise svm is another supervised learning binary classifier that has been commonly employed in flood susceptibility assessment tehrany et al 2014 tehrany et al 2015 sahana et al 2020 previous studies have typically assessed flood susceptibility with a single or very few ml techniques chau et al 2005 pradhan 2010 kia et al 2012 lee et al

to different methods is a relatively new contribution to literature accordingly the primary aim of this research concerns flood susceptibility assessment employing six various ml models e g dt rf mlp nn adaboost lr and svm while numerous meteorological hydrological and geospatial variables with a high spatial resolution i e 12 5 m were taken into account 2 materials and methods fig 1 depicts the flowchart of the research methodology the research process began with identifying and gathering a set of factors that could influence floods following the earlier studies see section 2 2 2 besides several flood and non flood locations were identified and randomly partitioned into training 70 and testing 30 datasets see section 2 2 1 next the correlation between the factors was assessed using the multi collinearity analysis to exclude the factors causing multi collinearity issues see section 2 3 having selected the flood conditioning factors and partitioned flood and non flood points the ml models were trained using the training datasets see section 2 4 the models were then validated against five accuracy criteria i e receiver operating characteristics area under the curve roc auc jaccard index f1 score overall accuracy oa and kappa coefficient Œ∫ using the testing datasets see section 2 5 following that the performance of six ml models was compared and the flood susceptibility map provided by the highest accuracy model was used in the following steps finally the fr method and the correlation matrix were used to determine the importance of each flood conditioning factor see section 2 6 2 1 study area this research was conducted in the lower nicola river sub watershed which has a drainage area of 376 064 ha and is part of the thompson drainage basin of the fraser river system in south central british columbia fig 2 mazany wright et al 2021 the lower nicola river sub watershed experienced a destructive flood on november 14 2021 due to heavy rains brought by an atmospheric river accordingly this sub watershed was selected as an appropriate application site for the mapping of flood susceptibility 2 2 data and preprocessing of the data 2 2 1 flood inventory mapping predicting future floods demands the use of an inventory map which depicts one or more flood events in a certain region bui et al 2012 the basic premise behind the inventory map is that future floods will most likely have comparable conditions to previous ones the flood inventory map was produced by reviewing maps and photos of the flooding that happened on november 14 2021 as well as using satellite images before and after that flooding topographic maps and google earth software 180 flood points in all were identified as well as 180 non flood points and a flood inventory map was provided using them it is worth noting that non flood sites were selected from places where flooding is unable to progress all flood and non flood sites identified throughout the study area were depicted in fig 3 2 2 2 flood conditioning factors the patterns of flooding are not readily predicted without adequate knowledge of the relationships of various meteorological hydrological and geospatial factors vojtek and vojtekov√° 2019 dodangeh et al 2020 despite the lack of a standardized procedure in identifying factors that foremost forecast future floods our approach in selecting the sets of factors mainly was based on previous studies having conducted a literature analysis flood conditioning data were gathered from various sources the data and their sources were summarized in table 1 in this study sixteen following factors were selected as prospective flood susceptibility model independent variables regarding a survey of the literature professional opinions and circumstances in the research region elevation slope aspect plan and profile curvature roughness topographic wetness index twi land cover rainfall distance from rivers drainage density lithology soil normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference moisture index ndmi prior to using all these factors as potential explanatory variables in predicting flood susceptibility it is required to assess the intensity of multiple correlations between factors and whether the factors have a significant role in predicting flood susceptibility to do so the spearman correlation and the multi collinearity analysis were performed and the significance role of thirteen variables in predicting flood susceptibility was confirmed concerning variance inflation factors vifs see section 2 3 the terrain has a significant impact on the direction and speed of surface runoff avand and moradi 2021 azareh et al 2021 in doing so the digital elevation model dem was acquired through the alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar and clipped to the boundary of the study area fig 4 a in hydrologic conditions the slope has an impact on surface infiltration runoff rates and subsurface drainage samanta et al 2018 besides the flow direction of surface runoff is determined by aspect slope and aspect maps fig 4b and fig 4c were derived from the dem layer using slope and aspect tools respectively plan and profile curvature represent the flow convergence and diversion as it changes aspect along a contour and the slope variation along the flow path respectively plan and profile curvatures fig 4d and fig 4e were prepared using the curvature tool on dem rainfall intensity and frequency are among the most crucial factors that lead to floods h√∂lting and coldewey 2019 in this study first annual rainfall was collected at ten climatological stations from 1987 to 2006 i e 20 years both inside and beyond the watershed next the coefficient of variation cv of annual rainfall at each climatological station was calculated then the kriging interpolation method was applied to provide a continuous layer fig 4i following previous studies avand and moradi 2021a janizadeh et al 2021 river flows are the principal paths for amplifying flood discharges as a result regions near rivers are particularly exposed to flooding the euclidean distance tool was employed on the rivers in the research region to provide distance from rivers map fig 4j drainage density is a metric for describing the physical characteristics of a drainage basin to provide the drainage density map in the study area fig 4k the line density tool was applied to streams the roughness is the difference in elevation between neighboring pixels in a dem this is a measure for determining surface runoff and it is calculated according to eq 1 evans 2019 the roughness measure was calculated for each pixel in the study area and depicted in fig 4f 1 roughness f s mean fs min f s max fs min here fs mean fs min and fs max represent the mean minimum and maximum focal statistical layer respectively topographic wetness index twi a physical characteristic of a watershed area measures the impact of topography on the saturation levels of the terrain on runoff generation and the geographical distribution of wetness conditions avand et al 2021 twi for each pixel in the study area fig 4g was calculated according to eq 2 hong et al 2018 2 twi ln Œ± tan Œ≤ here Œ± denotes the cumulative upstream discharge at one point or flow accumulation m 2 m 1 and Œ≤ is the slope radian the permeability of runoff varies depending on the rock type samanta et al 2018 accordingly the lithology map was prepared in five groups with regards to the geological data fig 4l variable land cover can result in different runoff and flow characteristics the land covers for the study area were retrieved using the clip tool fig 4h water retention and surface runoff generation are significantly influenced by soil types avand et al 2021 to retrieve the soil types in the study area fig 4m the clip tool was applied given the boundary of the study area three indices of ndwi fig 4n ndvi fig 4o and ndmi fig 4p were calculated for the study area based on the sentinel 2 satellite images ndwi identifies the presence of water bodies and tracks changes in their water content the ndwi value ranges from 1 to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating the presence of water zhou et al 2017 the ndvi is an indicator to estimate the density of green on an area of land and identify vegetated regions it has a range of 1 to 1 that positive values indicate a greater amount of greenery whereas negative values indicate a lack of biomass e g water helbich 2019 the ndmi is used to determine the moisture content of vegetation with values closer to 1 indicating higher moisture taloor et al 2021 eqs 3 5 indicate the equations for calculating ndwi eq 3 ndvi eq 4 and ndmi eq 5 3 ndwi g n i r g n i r 4 ndvi nir r nir r 5 ndmi nir s w i r nir s w i r here g is the green band band 3 of sentinel nir is the near infrared band band 8 of sentinel r is the red band band 4 of sentinel and swir is the short wave infrared band band 11 of sentinel having prepared each flood conditioning factor fig 4 all factor layers were converted into raster data with a pixel size of 12 5 m and the values of all factors for flood and non flood sites were retrieved 2 3 correlation and multi collinearity analyses of factors in regression analysis the presence of correlation among predictors is undesirable and leads to an increase in the standard error of predictors coefficients accordingly to investigate the strength and direction of correlations between the predictors the spearman correlation test was employed spearman correlation test is a non parametric test i e it assumes no data distribution for determining the degree of correlation between the pairs of predictors de winter et al 2016 additionally the issue of multi collinearity arises when two or more predictors are substantially correlated with one another daoud 2017 accordingly before feeding all the predictors i e flood conditioning factors into the flood ml models it is indispensable to employ the multi collinearity analysis to determine the proper predictors for assessing the flood susceptibility the multi collinearity analysis assesses the intensity of correlations between the predictors using vifs and tolerances a vif value greater than 5 indicates the multi collinearity issue daoud 2017 in this study to have much certainty in selecting significant independent predictors the threshold of 4 for vif was taken into account saha et al 2021 2 4 machine learning methods applied for flood susceptibility modeling this section describes six various ml models for assessing flood susceptibility in the study area mlp nn see section 2 4 1 dt see section 2 4 2 rf see section 2 4 3 adaboost see section 2 4 4 lr see section 2 4 5 and svm see section 2 4 6 all thirteen independent variables specified as potential explanatory flood conditioning factors were used in all six models as predictors 2 4 1 multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn the neural network model is a basic representation of brain systems that are frequently utilized in science to tackle a variety of issues zeng and yeung 2001 neural network models have the benefit of being able to solve complicated nonlinear issues mlp nn is one of the most efficient neural network methods that is made up of numerous layers of computational units i e nodes or neurons that are interconnected by weights each layer takes in a number of inputs computes the weighted sum and then sends the outcome to a nonlinear activation function accordingly in the mlp nn method input output connections are established using multilayer non linear transformations bishop and nasrabadi 2006 the repetitive training procedure entails adjusting the connection weights to minimize the cost function i e the function which is defined based on the differences between model outputs and the corresponding desired output the conceptual scheme of the mlp nn its working principle and learning processes were explicitly explained in the auxiliary material document 2 4 2 decision tree dt a dt is a decision making tool that employs a tree like decision paradigm a dt is a hierarchical algorithm in which each non terminal node generates a binary decision on a feature each branch reflects the conclusion of the decision and each leaf node i e terminal node represents a class label tehrany et al 2013 the class label is determined based on the dt type in a classification issue the class label is the category to which the data belongs and in a regression issue the class label is a numeric number the tree moves down from the root node to leaf nodes regarding a set of rules that determine the path to follow schneevoigt et al 2008 dt method has certain privileges including i it is capable of representing the relationships between variables without making any assumptions about data distribution ii no explicit restrictions are required for the format of data e g nominal scalar etc iii it is easily interpretable iv it is less sensitive to outliers and v data normalization is not required kheir et al 2010 in this study the dt method was used to separate and classify data into two groups of flooded and non flooded areas using the flood conditioning factors a value of 1 denotes the presence of flooding while a value of 0 denotes the lack of flooding in the region the choice of which conditioning factors to use first for splitting is done based on the notion that classification yields more pure and homogeneous groupings entropy i e the expected amount of information as a criterion to measure the impurity of a dataset charbuty and abdulazeez 2021 was used to split in other words entropy was used as the cost function and the split was done regarding the conditioning factor which yielded the lowest entropy because the lower the entropy value the higher the purity of the classes entropy is calculated according to eq 6 6 e x c 1 c p x c log 2 p x c here c is the number of classes i e in this study c 2 and p is the probability that the variable belongs to class c 2 4 3 random forest rf dt splits the dataset recursively using the decision nodes until the pure leaf nodes are left and it finds the best split in each non terminal node according to entropy value irrespective of the advantages of the dt method the dt method is highly sensitive to the training data which can lead to large variance i e over fitting issue and failure to generalize accordingly the rf method is used to reduce over fitting errors as it is a lot less sensitive method to the training data merghadi et al 2020 sahin et al 2020 the rf method is a collection of multiple random decision trees each tree includes randomly sampled data with replacement i e bootstrap samples so that it fits independently in these data subsets as a result of bootstrapping dou et al 2020 bootstrapping involves producing random new datasets from original data with the same size having produced bootstrap samples and subsequently decision trees based on them the predictions of all trees are aggregated to predict for one sample i e bootstrap aggregation or bagging rf model includes two random processes bootstrapping and random feature selection bootstrapping ensures that no two trees utilize the same data making the model less sensitive to the original training data the random feature selection helps to reduce the correlation between the trees aside from that random feature selection has another advantage some of the trees will be trained on less significant features while others will be trained on more important features resulting in a balanced set of predictions generally the ideal size of the feature selection is determined using the log or square root of the total number of features 2 4 4 adaptive boosting adaboost adaboost a kind of boosted dt performs on the same principle of boosting meaning that it retrains samples which are difficult to classify briem et al 2002 adaboost creates dts called stumps which are built up of just one node and two leaves in other words the adaboost technique is a forest of stumps that includes all the trees and employs an iterative methodology where each training item is given a weight at each level of prediction except the first dou and chen 2017 adaboost allows both records to pass unlike enhanced dts which only enable the incorrectly categorized records from dt to be sent on to another stump in this case the method is to give easier to classify observations a lower weight in order to increase their probability in the subsequent prediction round while giving erroneously identified samples a higher weight as a result the second stump is grown using this weighted data to create further trees this process is repeated a certain number of times following the training of the classifiers a weight will be allocated to each classifier and the final prediction which is based on a weighted majority vote will be evaluated a more accurate classifier will be given more weight in order to produce more plausible findings and have a greater impact on the final prediction the main advantage of this approach is that the optimum answer is found by combining all the trees not just the final one 2 4 5 logistic regression lr linear models aim to capture the relationships between independent and dependent variables by fitting a line that perfectly follows the existing relationship between independent and dependent variables in other words linear models assume that the predicted outcome of an instance is a weighted sum of its features and to estimate the optimal weights the ordinary least squares method is usually used bishop and nasrabadi 2006 although linear regression models offer a lot of potential for regression they fall short when it comes to classification issues accordingly lr an extension of the linear regression model is used for classification issues a detailed explanation of lr s working principles and its learning processes was given in in the auxiliary material document 2 4 6 support vector machines svm svm is a supervised ml model that is frequently used for binary classification the objective of svm models is to determine a hyper plane i e decision boundary that distinctly classifies the data points bishop and nasrabadi 2006 the separation of data points into two classes could be done with many possible hyper planes however the objective of svm is to find the hyper plane that has the maximum margin i e the maximum distance between support vectors of both classes the reason for selecting the hyper plane with maximum margin is robustness and reducing the chance of miss classification in logistic regression the outputs of the linear function are squashed within the range of 0 1 and depending on the comparison between the squashed value and the threshold i e 0 5 the data points are allocated to one of two classes i e classes with labels either 0 or 1 in svm however the output of the kernel function is passed through the sign function and data points are allocated to one of two classes 1 or 1 the svm kernel is a function that transforms a low dimensional input space into a higher dimensional space to convert a non separable issue into a separable one amongst the various functions that are used as the svm kernels e g linear kernel polynomial kernel pl radial basis function kernel rbf and sigmoid kernel pradhan 2013 tehrany et al 2014 pl and rbf as known as gaussian kernels are the most frequently employed kernels marjanoviƒá et al 2011 in this study the rbf kernel function was used a full description of svm s functioning principles and its learning processes were included in the auxiliary material document in this study to reduce the over fitting issue as well as ascertain the values of corresponding hyper parameters in each ml model the 5 fold cross validation technique was used similar studies using ml techniques have shown that 5 fold is often a sufficient number of folds to prevent the likelihood of over fitting immitzer et al 2012 wang et al 2015 baig et al 2021 following the 5 fold cross validation technique the training data are partitioned into five sections of which four sections are used for training the models and one section is used to assess the models performance this process is performed five times using different sections in each iteration 2 5 model validation and performance assessment having reviewed earlier studies the performance of the models was assessed and validated using five accuracy criteria of roc auc jaccard index f1 score oa and Œ∫ avand and moradi 2021a janizadeh et al 2021 avand et al 2022 the roc

threshold levels to form the roc curve the fraction of the positive class that is correctly classified by the model is referred to as sensitivity or tpr the fraction of the negative class that is correctly classified is known as specificity or true negative rate tnr fpr is a metric that indicates the fraction of the negative class that is incorrectly classified eqs 7 9 were used to calculate

the factors that have the most influence on causing a flood could aim at mitigating flood damage the fr method is a basic quantitative technique for revealing the probable relationship between independent and dependent variables with multiple classes razandi et al 2015 accordingly the fr method was employed in this study to assess the importance of each flood conditioning factor on the flood to calculate the fr value of each flood conditioning factor the factors first were classified using the quantile classification method in arcgis and then the proportion of flooded pixels was divided by the proportion of non flooded pixels in the region covered by each class using eq 15 the linkage between the flood susceptibility map and flood conditioning factors has been constructed to determine the fr value for a certain class from a given factor it is worth mentioning that the binary flood susceptibility map which indicates whether each pixel is flooded or not was employed in the fr method 15 fr c n f l o o d e d p i x e l c n f l o o d e d p i x e l a n a l l pixel c n a l l pixel a here fr c is the fr value for a certain class from a given factor n f l o o d e d p i x e l c is the number of pixels from a specific class that have been flooded n f l o o d e d p i x e l a represents all of the flooded pixels in the research region n a l l pixel c is the total number of

collinearity analyses of factors the value of spearman s coefficient i e rho for each pair of predictors was calculated and shown in fig 5 the direction of correlation between predictors was determined by the sign of the spearman coefficient and shown with two different colors of blue i e the positive direction and red i e the negative direction in fig 5 the spearman correlation coefficient ranges between 1 and 1 the closer the spearman coefficient value to 0 the less correlation between the pair of predictors regarding the results of the spearman correlation analysis ndvi and ndwi variables had the strongest correlation i e 0 914 the results of the multi collinearity analysis were summarized in table 2 the vif had a range from 1 097 to 19 785 with the aspect factor accounting for the lowest value and the ndvi factor for the greatest value regarding the multi collinearity analysis except for three factors of elevation ndwi and ndvi the rest variables had a vif value below the threshold i e 4 accordingly thirteen factors were included in the assessment of study area s susceptibility to flooding 3 2 hyper parameters tuning most ml models have many hyper parameters that influence their performance although hyper parameters are frequently used with their default settings finding the optimum values for them i e tuning hyper parameters is essential to increase the possibility of achieving most desirable results accordingly some of the most essential hyper parameters of each ml model were considered and tuned in this study generally hyper parameters tuning is done through validation techniques such as k fold cross validation accordingly the optimum values of hyper parameters in this study were determined using the 5 fold cross validation it is worth mentioning that the gridsearchcv is configured to build a grid search hyper parameter tuner on the training set besides to provide a comparative analysis of the contribution of hyper parameters values the mean test accuracy score was measured the mean test accuracy describes the mean accuracy of scores accumulated when predicting the test dataset and is used to rank the competing hyper parameter combinations all the investigated hyper parameters along with their optimum values were listed in table 3 3 3 model validation and performance assessment to quantitatively assess and compare the efficiency of ml models in prediction flood prone areas and ensure their consistency with reality i e model validation five accuracy criteria of roc auc jaccard index f1 score oa and Œ∫ were used regarding values calculated for the accuracy criteria table 4 all models have sufficient capability for assessing and predicting flood prone areas the confusion matrixes used for calculating the accuracy criteria were shown in fig a1 appendix a regarding table 4 even though the variations in performance across the models were not significant the rf model outperformed the other models the order of models in terms of performance from high to low was as follows rf adaboost dt lr svm and mlp nn the roc curves were plotted in fig 6 to evaluate and compare the classifier quality independent of the threshold auc values vary in the range 0 5 1 with 1 denoting an unexceptionable prediction and 0 5 denoting a random prediction yesilnacar 2005 3 4 flood susceptibility map each pixel in the study area includes 13 features each of which refers to a different flood conditioning factor having trained six different ml models they were applied to each pixel in the study area to calculate and predict the flood susceptibility value in each pixel after calculating the flood susceptibility value for the whole study area the well defined natural break method of classification through the arcgis tool was used to stratify the flood susceptibility values into five classes i e very low low moderate high and very high all the flood susceptibility maps provided through the ml models were shown in fig 7 based on the dt model 27 55 12 74 10 16 6 88 and 42 67 of the study region were classified as a very low low moderate high and very high flood susceptible zone respectively according to the flood susceptible map provided using the rf model flood susceptibility is very low in 29 91 low in 18 72 moderate in 16 15 high in 15 49 and very high in 19 73 of the study area in the mlp nn model flood susceptibility classes of very low low moderate high and very high respectively covered 29 87 15 46 13 65 15 54 and 25 48 of the study area the findings of the adaboost model indicated that the flood susceptibility in five classes of very low low moderate high and very high included 14 52 17 21 24 53 25 28 and 18 46 of the study area respectively in the svm model the percentage coverage of very low low moderate high and very high flood prone zones was 39 14 8 53 8 62 12 31 and 31 4 respectively lastly the flood susceptibility map produced by the lr model proposed that 40 68 9 65 7 42 9 03 and 33 22 of the study region was in very low low moderate high and very high flood susceptible zones respectively the percentage of flood susceptibility classes in all six ml models was summarized in fig 8 3 5 assessment of flood conditioning factors importance using the fr method and the correlation matrix another aim of this study was to determine the significance of factors affecting flooding accordingly the fr method was used to determine the relationship between the flood occurrences and the flood conditioning factors the fr values calculated for each class of flood conditioning factors and consequently the importance of each class in the given factors were explicitly shown in fig 9 besides the fr value of a certain class in a particular factor was given in much detail in table a1 appendix b it is worth mentioning that the importance of factors increases with the increases in fr value and vice versa regarding the fr results fig 9 and table a1 flooding in the study area was most frequently associated with slopes between 20 and 77 fr 1 16 the fr results indicated that places with plan curvature ranging between 16 04 and 0 59 had the highest fr 1 10 as well as profile curvature between 0 59 and 19 46 fr 1 05 besides for the twi factor the highest fr belongs to the class 7 58 25 59 fr 1 05 in the roughness the class 0 48 0 51 fr 1 08 and among the classes in aspect factor the flat slope aspect fr 1 24 had the highest fr values furthermore perennial cropland annual cropland developed land and grassland land covers had the highest flood occurrences with fr values of 2 32 2 31 2 19 and 1 94 respectively also the highest fr in the cv of rainfall factor was related to class 22 4 23 fr 1 42 in terms of flood occurrence and distance from the river the highest flood occurrence was in the first class and the least distance 0 558 m with an fr value equal to 1 54 the fr method indicated that flooding is less likely to occur in places far away from the rivers there is also the highest likelihood of flooding on the drainage density 4 29 8 83 class fr 1 83 regarding the results of fr the higher the drainage density the greater the risk of flooding furthermore volcanic rocks lithology rf 1 74 haplic kastanozems soil type fr 1 67 and ndmi between 0 87 and 0 07 fr 1 34 were most frequently associated with the flooding having calculated the flood susceptibility values in each pixel of the whole study area using the rf model and provided the flood susceptibility map in the study area the most significant factors influencing the flood were determined using the correlation matrix based on the spearman correlation analysis it is worth mentioning that the flood susceptibility map provided through the rf model due to having the highest accuracy was chosen to evaluate the importance of flood conditioning factors in fig 10 the importance of flood conditioning factors considered in this study was shown the positive correlation was indicated by the blue bars while the negative correlation was indicated by the orange bars following the findings lithology drainage density distance from rivers soil rainfall land cover and ndmi were the most influential flood conditioning factors 4 discussion the rate of floods and the consequent damages have grown dramatically in recent years as a result of human interventions and the ensuing climate and land cover changes mahdizadeh gharakhanlou and perez 2022 an accurate flood susceptibility map could be beneficial in the development of practical and effective mitigation strategies to reduce the damages caused by floods sahana et al 2020 over the previous few decades improving approaches for identifying flood prone areas and providing flood susceptibility maps has been among the primary goals of the scientific community manfreda et al 2014 di baldassarre et al 2020 following the study by saha et al 2021 three substantial elements that have influences in efficiently mapping flood susceptibility are 1 selection of appropriate flood conditioning factors 2 spatial resolution of the flood conditioning factors and 3 the accuracy and efficiency of data layer integration models concerning earlier studies tien bui and hoang 2017 bui et al 2019 ahmed et al 2021 avand and moradi 2021 we chose various climatological hydrological and geo environmental flood conditioning factors and prepared those using remote sensing rs and geographical information systems gis techniques the potential benefit of taking into account diverse flood conditioning factors in terms of providing flood susceptibility maps with the higher accuracy has been asserted in earlier studies tien bui and hoang 2017 bui et al 2019 vojtek and vojtekov√° 2019 dodangeh et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 avand and moradi 2021 likewise our findings in consistent with the earlier studies indicated that considering various meteorological hydrological and geospatial factors influencing floods is highly recommended to provide flood susceptibility maps with higher accuracy the spatial resolution of the flood conditioning factors is another element that has a substantial influence on the accuracy of flood susceptibility maps the dem is one of the primary flood conditioning factors from which a majority of flood conditioning factors are derived following the efficiency of high spatial resolution of factors on floods a dem with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m was used as well as other flood conditioning factors with the same spatial resolution as the dem i e 12 5 m the significance of a high spatial resolution database in flood prediction models was demonstrated in the earlier investigations bonekamp et al 2018 muhadi et al 2020 schaller et al 2020 similarly our findings demonstrated that considering factors with high spatial resolution leads in a more accurate flood susceptibility map in recent years developing more robust methodologies and approaches has been a desire for researchers to achieve precise and accurate flood susceptibility maps bui et al 2020 nachappa et al 2020 remarkable accuracy of ml models and the significant potential of ml models in assessing the flood susceptibility were demonstrated in the earlier studies ngo et al 2018 talukdar et al 2020 accordingly six promising ml models namely dt rf mlp nn adaboost lr and svm were used in this study to assess the flood susceptibility and provide the flood susceptibility maps with greater accuracy in the lower nicola river sub watershed canada our findings like those of other studies ngo et al 2018 talukdar et al 2020 demonstrated the high accuracy and great potential of ml models in assessing flood susceptibility earlier studies have typically assessed flood susceptibility with a single or very few ml techniques chau et al 2005 pradhan 2010 kia et al 2012 lee et al 2012 tehrany et al 2014 pham et al 2020b tang et al 2020 avand et al 2021a farhadi and najafzadeh 2021 due to the inclusion of different flood conditioning factors in ml models comparing them across research has proven problematic accordingly six various ml models were utilized in this research with the same flood conditioning factors and in the same case study to gain a comprehensive understanding of which ml model or collection of ml models may produce the most accurate predictions besides due to the disagreement of researchers on the superiority and preference of accuracy criteria the models were evaluated and compared using five various accuracy criteria the results of various accuracy criteria indicated that the rf model outperformed the other models despite the insignificant differences in performance across the models our findings aligned with those of previous investigations lee et al 2017 chen et al 2020 mahdizadeh gharakhanlou and perez 2022 to evaluate the importance of factors on floods the fr method and the correlation matrix were used in this study regarding our findings lithology drainage density distance from rivers soil rainfall land cover and ndmi were the most influential factors determining flood regarding the findings of previous investigations avand and moradi 2021 avand et al 2022 collins et al 2022 distance from rivers is among the most influential factors in floods drainage density land cover land use lithology and soil type are proven as influential factors affecting floods according to studies by saha et al 2021 avand and moradi 2021 samanta et al 2018 and avand et al 2021 respectively furthermore several previous studies have emphasized the substantial significance and impact of rainfall on flooding avand and moradi 2021 avand et al 2021 accordingly our findings were consistent with earlier studies emphasizing the significant influence of aforementioned factors on floods 4 1 strengths and limitations the strengths of this study include i considering various meteorological hydrological and geospatial flood conditioning factors in the flood susceptibility assessment ii using a dem with a high spatial resolution i e 12 5 m and consequently modeling and assessing the flood susceptibility in a more precise manner iii providing a comprehensive description of the functionality of six ml models iv using six various ml models to identify the most flood prone areas in the study area v evaluating and comparing the performance of six flood ml methods under the consideration of same factors and in the same case study using five various accuracy criteria and vi investigating the impact of each factor on flooding and identifying the most influential ones notwithstanding these strengths the main limitation of this study was related to creating the flood inventory map regarding a single flood event the reason for using a single flood event in this study was the lack of information on previous flood events in the study area as well as available data 5 conclusion owing to life threatening flood disasters and their vast disruptive effects the main aim of the present study was to assess flood susceptibility using ml models among various ml models six most promising ml models were employed to evaluate the flood susceptibility in the lower nicola river sub watershed canada the factors influencing floods were picked from a list of sixteen meteorological hydrological and geospatial variables thirteen variables were ascertained as potential explanatory factors for flood susceptibility assessment using the multi collinearity analysis having trained the models their accuracy was evaluated and validated regarding five accuracy criteria roc auc jaccard index f1 score oa and Œ∫ besides the efficiency of the models was compared despite the insignificant differences in the performance of the models the rf model had the highest accuracy followed closely by the adaboost model flood conditioning factors were reclassified using quantile classification method and the importance of each class from a given flood conditioning factor was evaluated using the fr method additionally the importance of flood conditioning factors in causing floods was evaluated using the correlation matrix based on the spearman correlation analysis regarding the results of the correlation matrix lithology drainage density distance from rivers soil rainfall land cover and ndmi had the highest influence on flooding the flood susceptibility map as the principal output of this study was produced in five classes ranging from very low to very high susceptibility the flood susceptibility map provided using the rf model i e the model with the highest accuracy indicated that the flood susceptibility is very high in 19 73 of the study area high in 15 49 moderate in 16 15 low in 18 72 and very low in 29 91 our findings demonstrated that ml models have a remarkable potential for assessing flood susceptibility and predicting flood prone locations the quantitative analysis of flood susceptibility can assist with decision making planning and investment in flood mitigation measures besides the destructive consequences of floods could be mitigated by identifying and properly managing flood prone regions in this study the hyper parameters of the models were tuned using the 5 fold cross validation and the gridsearchcv the hyper parameters of the models can be tuned in future research using optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms ga and particle swarm optimization pso additionally it is proposed that future studies employ the identical ml models and consider the same flood conditioning factors to compare the flood susceptibility maps provided in canada with those produced in europe code and data availability the raw data that were utilized in this research are all openly accessible
