4095,forests modulate energy reaching the earth s surface they can change energy balance fluxes near ground meteorological conditions and seasonal snowpack properties in montane areas regions of forests cover are often collocated with areas of freshwater importance for ecosystem and anthropogenic uses as such alteration of forests in these regions has the potential to significantly impact water resources that many depend upon for daily life warmer climates with marginal snowpacks are known to be particularly vulnerable to impacts of climate change that may increase air temperatures and change precipitation similarly montane forests are also becoming increasingly susceptible to modification by wildfire this study measured energy fluxes rates of snow accumulation and ablation and applied energy flux adjusted physically based snowpack models to examine fire alteration of snowmelt yield analysis focused on differences between an undisturbed and fire disturbed forest stand and referenced an unforested site fire disturbance of forest canopy enhanced ablation rates by 53 relative to the undisturbed site swe storage and snowpack longevity were greater at the undisturbed forest with seasonal snowpack in the fire disturbed forest stand existing for 19 fewer days and at the unforested site for 32 fewer days overall our results are congruent with canopy disturbance by fire having the impact of reducing snow accumulation 50 mm less swe over two seasons 4 reduction enhancing ablation through increased evaporation 1 higher at the fire disturbed site and less total snowmelt available for runoff 38 less at the fire disturbed stand these results have significant implications for montane forests and quantifies how they modulate energy fluxes increase snow accumulation

snow accumulation forest meteorology bushfire forest fire 1 introduction mountain snowpack is a crucial freshwater resource for ecosystem and anthropogenic use including agricultural irrigation drinking water for proximal communities energy production and recreation snowpacks that exist at alpine and sub alpine locations have been undergoing modification by climate change hock et al 2019 that has impacted water availability for nearby communities bloschl et al 2019 emphasized the importance of snowpack and its alteration through land cover and vegetation change by determining it to be one of the most important unsolved research questions within hydrology the increasing importance of freshwater obtained from snowpack and its alteration through climate change and land cover vegetation change highlights the need for further understanding on this important resource and potential changes to its properties forests modify the accumulation and redistribution of snow energy fluxes to the surface and snowpack properties the effects of these forests on snowpack characteristics are related to their geographical location climate and tree species varhola et al 2010 significant portions of sub alpine forests regularly undergo disturbance through exposure to fire burles and boon 2011 harpold et al 2014 clear cutting schelker et al 2013 or pests such as pine beetles boon 2009 boon 2012 forest disturbances are expected to increase in frequency due to the effects of climate change at higher altitudes and latitudes stocker 2014 to determine changes to regional hydrology resulting from sub alpine forest disturbance it is important to understand the complex relationships between forests the snowpacks contained within them and ablation processes this is particularly significant for more marginal alpine ecosystems that are responding to the thermal impacts of climate change such as increased air l√≥pez moreno et al 2008 and ground temperatures mellander et al 2007 changes in snow climatology stewart 2009 stewart et al 2004 and precipitation theobald et al 2016 these impacts may be compounded by increased frequency of fire due to climate change that may further modify sub alpine forests their hydrometeorology and consequently their seasonal snowpack change in forest canopy fundamentally alters patterns of snow accumulation gary 1974 gary 1979 and ablation gleason et al 2013 forest canopies govern snow depth and density patterns through interception of snowfall that can result in tree wells with reduced snow depth hardy and albert 1995 hardy et al 1997 and snow water equivalent swe musselman et al 2008 however interception rates and their influence on the snowpack can differ substantially depending on climate and forest characteristics lundquist et al 2013 warmer and more marginal sub alpine landscapes with seasonal snowpacks can be susceptible to fire brewer and clements 2020 harpold et al 2014 lucas et al 2007 maina and siirila woodburn 2020 and are likely to experience greater impacts from global warming schwartz et al 2020 fire has the potential to alter sub alpine ecosystems and regional hydrology as species poorly adapted to fire fairman et al 2017 are degraded these processes may be significant for marginal alpine and sub alpine landscapes and for areas not currently within this category as they shift under a warming climate snowpack energy balances in warm climates are disproportionately affected by changes in radiation transfers and turbulent energy fluxes compared to cold climate snowpacks fayad et al 2017 bilish et al 2019 found that in marginal snow conditions there is potential for ablation to occur throughout the snow season in contrast to the standard accumulation and ablation phases that are observed in colder snowpacks marginal snow locations with evergreen vegetation systems that are slow recovering from fire impacts are of significant interest in the context of fire modification of energy dynamics and snowmelt understanding the magnitude of how canopy disturbance from fire can impact energy fluxes and ablation processes of event driven marginal snowpacks is critical to inform our understanding of likely future change in response to climate variability and forest disturbance the fire prone sub alpine snow gum eucalyptus pauciflora provides an opportunity to investigate how canopy modification by fire affects snowpack accumulation and ablation in a marginal snow landscape e pauciflora are broadleaf evergreen trees that have particularly slow regrowth following disturbance by fire pickering and barry 2005 pure forest stands of e pauciflora are found above 1500 m a s l slatyer and morrow 1977 which coincides with the elevations that are associated with frequent winter snowfall and a seasonal snowpack these forests have been identified as important controls on the spatial distribution of snow bilish et al 2019 and snowpack energy balance schwartz et al 2020 the slow regrowth of e pauciflora following disturbance by bushfires means the impact of wildfire may influence snowpack energy balance and hydrology of this marginal sub alpine area this paper expands on the energy balance findings of schwartz et al 2020 by examining bushfire impacts to snowpack accumulation ablation processes resulting from site energy balances and ablation processes outside of those identified in the previously compared energy balances e g wind scour the aim of this research is to quantify the magnitude that fire modification of tree canopy can potentially impact process and drivers of snow accumulation ablation and snowmelt in a fire susceptible marginal sub alpine location with an evergreen broadleaf sub alpine woodland we use eddy covariance equipment coupled to snow measurements and also apply physically based snow models to compare snow accumulation ablation sub canopy energy dynamics and wind speed and snowmelt yield three sites at equivalent altitude operated for two seasons are used in this study where the focus is on the comparison of undisturbed and fire disturbed e pauciflora woodland burned 2003 sites while also referencing a site without the woodland vegetation system the paper has two objectives 1 compare rates of snow accumulation and ablation and related drivers energy flux dynamics wind characteristics between the fire disturbed and unburned sites and 2 determine the magnitude that fire disturbance can impact snowmelt yield between these sites in a marginal snowpack 2 study site characteristics the

automated weather station 1738 m bureau of meteorology 2020 that result in an isothermal snowpack with marginal characteristics bilish et al 2019 bilish et al 2018 as a result the snowpack is vulnerable to periods of complete ablation particularly early in the snow season and during rain on snow events bilish et al 2019 bilish et al 2018 mcgowan et al 2020 schwartz et al 2020 e pauciflora are common throughout sub alpine regions of the snowy mountains and cover an area of approximately 3000 km2 from 1400 m a s l to the altitudinal tree limit of 1900 m a s l costermans 2009 areas where snowfall commonly occurs within these forests above 1500 m a s l covers approximately 1400 km2 e pauciflora are highly susceptible to fire with slow post fire regrowth pickering and barry 2005 and increased mortality rates that correspond to consecutive fire events fairman et al 2017 bushfires impacted large tracks of e pauciflora in the snowy mountains in 2003 and burned 70 of the sub alpine zone in kosciuszko national park pickering and barry 2005 our analysis of vegetation in the australian alps australian department of agriculture 2018 and 2019 2020 bushfire extent australian department of agriculture 2020 showed the 2019 2020 bushfires impacted approximately 462 km2 33 of mapped forest that regularly has seasonal snowpack as a result the sub alpine regions of the snowy mountains contain substantial portions of both undisturbed and fire disturbed e pauciflora forests three sites were selected for this study fig 1 and were monitored during the 2018 and 2019 snow seasons the sites included an undisturbed e pauciflora forest stand 36 432 148 368 1851 m fig 2 a a fire disturbed e pauciflora forest stand 36 410 148 421 1842 m fig 2b and an unforested area 36 418 148 422 1847 m fig 2c the fire disturbed forest stand was burned in 2003 and had exhibited new stem regrowth coppiced fig 2b but regrowth was not taller than 2 m with no over canopy as seen in the undisturbed site fig 2a it is also worth noting that compared to a forest impacted by a recent fire the fire affected tree stems at our site were less charred but still contributed to debris on the surface of the snowpack therefore we use the term fire disturbed forest stand rather than burned forest stand to avoid confusion equipment at the sites had been removed prior to the summer that included the 2019 2020 bushfires and these sites were not burned during those fires measurement sites were representative of the key functional or structural biomes of the region that directly represent 65 of mapped ecological communities within the seasonally snow covered area the alpine grassland herb fields and bogs located at the unforested site represented 8 of the larger snowy mountains region and the e pauciflora woodland is present in 57 of the wider australian alps area gellie 2005 importance was also placed on locations that had minimal differences in distance all sites within 5 km elevation all within 5 m a s l and shared a similar aspect forested sites shared a north easterly aspect unforested site had no aspect as it was located on relatively level ground forest and soil metrics were recorded at each site and are presented in table 1 the undisturbed forest stand had a stem density of 1900 stems ha 1 and a vegetation area index vai fassnacht et al 1994 of 1 85 which was the highest of all areas despite 77 more stems in the fire disturbed forest stand 8400 stems ha 1 the area had a vai 78 lower than that of the undisturbed forest stand while there had been 15 years of post fire regrowth at the fire disturbed forest stand at the start of the study the maximum 2 m canopy height had a minimal influence on the area s vai which was primarily dead stems rather than canopy fig 2b soil bulk densities were similar at the two forested sites but was 22 lower at the unforested area all soil samples had relatively similar organic matter contents ranging from 22 to 24 overall the effects of fire present at the fire disturbed forest stand at the time of study were reduced canopy cover fewer tall trees and an increased number of stems from new short growth revegetation climate data was obtained from a nearby bureau of meteorology bom automatic weather station aws at perisher valley that operated from 2010 to 2019 36 41 148 41 1738 m a s l

climatological averages for all months except november that was lower by 1 0 c bureau of meteorology 2020 precipitation totals were 969 mm in 2018 and 922 mm in 2019 somewhat less than the mean 1171 mm in both years bureau of meteorology 2020 3 instrumentation and data 3 1 instrumentation snowpack accumulation and ablation characteristics were measured at forest stand energy balance sites that were installed in may 2018 and an unforested site that was installed in june 2016 each site used campbell scientific cr3000 microloggers with easyflux dl software campbell scientific 2018 to record

processing procedures for raw c o 2 and h 2 o fluxes sites were telemetered and monitored in real time for early determination of faults details on the instrumentation and measurement accuracy at the sites is presented in schwartz et al 2020 3 2 energy balance measurements and data quality control snowpack energy balance calculation of energy fluxes and data quality control followed schwartz et al 2020 which expressed the snowpack energy balance as 1 q res q q h q e q g q r q ec where q res is the residual energy flux from the sum of net radiative flux q sensible heat flux q h latent heat flux q e ground heat flux q g rain heat flux q r and energy balance closure error q ec wiring on the ground heat flux plate at the undisturbed forest stand was damaged by a small animal during the 2019 snow season erroneous values were replaced using a multivariate regression model developed using random forest breiman 2001 and 2018 q g values which had a rmse of 0 02 wm 2 for the training data development of an analogous model occurred for the fire disturbed forest stand to determine performance during the 2019 snow season and showed an 8 variance between measured and modelled q g values q r values were calculated for each site following the methods of bilish et al 2018 that utilize wetbulb temperature and fraction of precipitation falling as snow to determine 30 minute liquid precipitation heat flux 3 3 physically based snowpack models three physically based snowpack models were used to identify impacts to ablation processes and runoff following forest disturbance by fire calculation of snowpack swe at each site for cumulative and event based models used d s from the automated measurements in both snow seasons and median snow density values obtained during the 2018 field campaign supplementary data development of physically based swe models used calculated swe measured energy balance and d s and allowed for comparison with ground truth measurements to determine model performance periods of snow accumulation were determined by calculating 90 minute rolling standard deviations œÉ of d s and identifying median d s œÉ at each of the study sites thirty minute accumulation amount accum followed schwartz et al 2020 2 d s œÉ d s n d s n 1 a c c u m d s n d s n 1 where d s œÉ is median œÉ of the swe over the entire study period d s n is the current swe and d s n 1 is the previous swe value calculations of snow ablation followed pomeroy and goodison 1997 3 abl q res œÅ w Œª f b i where q res is the residual energy after summation of the energy balance j m 2 0 5 h 1 the density of liquid water is œÅ w 1000 kg m 3 the latent heat of fusion is Œª f 0 355 106 j kg 1 and the thermal quality of the snow b i which is the proportion of ice in a unit of wet snow gray and male 1981 similar to what was noted by burles and boon 2011 b i had little impact on ablation model output and a value of 0 96 was determined to be accurate for all sites cumulative sums of snowpack accumulation and ablation were created for each site using the calculated accum and abl values for cumulative snowpack models whereas automated snowpack depth measurements made after snowfall periods were used in event based models prior to the start of a new ablation event the event based swe model used measured snowpack depths and median density to determine swe once accumulation periods stopped effectively removing any error from previous ablation calculation as a new ablation event had started the purpose of designing the event based model this way was to allow both models to be run with the same ablation characteristics and calculations which would include any qec to be included in both models as such differences in model performance would likely be the result of outside processes such as wind scour that would accumulate within the cumulative model only periods with automated measurements of snow depth 10 cm at all sites were selected for analysis of cumulative and event based model ablation to ensure a higher degree of snowpack surface homogeneity and correct measurement of snowpack energy balance with minimal contamination from heterogeneous ground surfaces approximately 127 days n 6090 30 minute periods of data between the 2018 and 2019 snow seasons were used for analysis and comparison following quality control gap filling and d s measurement procedures evaluation of cumulative and event based model performance was based on the evaluation methods of moriasi et al 2007 that use percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr the snowpack model bartelt and lehning 2002 lehning et al 2002 was also used in analysis of the snowpack internal state and ablation processes from 26 may to 1 november 2019 in situ measurements of air temperature relative humidity wind speed shortwave and longwave radiation ground temperature and snow depth were used as model inputs regression models developed between similar variables at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forest sites were used to gap fill data from 15 00 4 september 2019 to 00 00 1 november 2019 aest at the undisturbed forest stand after power issues caused the site to stop recording data it s important to note that snowpack uses snowpack height hs for its calculations of new snowfall and associated snowpack morphology and no new snowpack depth measurements were made following 04 september 2019 as such any new snowfall that occurred after that date was not registered at the undisturbed site 4 results 4 1 snow accumulation while all sites had similar aspects and elevation characteristics total volume of accumulated snow across the two seasons 2018 2019 was greatest in the undisturbed forest stand which had a total of 2762 mm of accumulation 1149 mm swe the fire disturbed forest stand was 12 lower in snow accumulation and 4 lower in swe accumulating 2426 mm of snow across the seasons 1099 mm swe the unforested area had the least accumulation with 31 lower snow accumulation 1916 mm and 28 lower swe 822 mm than the undisturbed forest stand shapiro wilk tests conducted on accumulation rates at each site during periods when all sites were experiencing snow accumulation as determined by sonic snow depth sensors showed non normal distributions n 352 therefore comparisons of snow accumulation rates used median rather than mean to avoid contamination from high rate outliers median swe accumulation rates were similar between sites and only varied by 0 33 mm hr 1 fig 3 a the undisturbed forest stand had a median swe accumulation rate of 3 0 mm hr 1 interquartile range iqr 2 5 mm hr 1 the fire disturbed stand had a rate of 3 0 mm hr 1 iqr 3 0 mm hr 1 and the unforested site had a median rate of 2 7 mm hr 1 iqr 1 8 mm hr 1 though a kruskal wallis test showed significant statistical differences between the rates chi squared 43 52 df 2 p value 3 55x10 10 these differences could have been the result of natural variability in precipitation rate and snow accumulation rather than the result of canopy influences in addition to the highest median snow accumulation rate the fire disturbed forest stand had the largest variance in accumulation rate and the unforested site had the least variance fig 3a though the undisturbed and fire disturbed forest stands had similar median accumulation rates increased variance in rate corresponded to reduction in canopy cover analysis of wind speeds during periods of snow accumulation and at times without snow accumulation for each of the sites fig 4 showed that median wind speed was inversely related to canopy cover wind speeds at the fire disturbed forest stand were 18 higher during non accumulation periods 1 23 ms 1 and 38 higher during accumulation periods 2 92 ms 1 than those experienced within the undisturbed forest stand 1 04 ms 1 and 2 12 ms 1 respectively the fire disturbed forest stand also had higher variation in wind speed than the undisturbed forest stand particularly during accumulation periods when the iqr was 94 higher fire disturbed forest iqr 2 44 undisturbed forest iqr 1 26 wind speeds were consistently highest at the unforested site non accumulation median 2 66 ms 1 snow accumulation median 4 18 ms 1 were 156 higher than the undisturbed forest stand during periods of accumulation and 97 higher without accumulation similarly wind speeds at the unforested site were 117 higher than at the fire disturbed forest stand during accumulation and were 43 higher during periods without accumulation variation in wind speed during accumulation events at the unforested site was slightly lower iqr 2 0 ms 1 than at the fire disturbed forest stand iqr 2 4 ms 1 but was higher than both forest stands during non accumulation periods two bimodal distributions existed for wind speed the unforested site during non accumulation periods fig 4a and the fire disturbed forest stand during accumulation periods fig 4b the small increase in distribution of wind speed between 5 and 6 ms 1 at the unforested site was the result of several days having similar maximum wind speeds snow accumulation events that occurred on 3 4 june 2019 11 12 august 2019 and 29 august 2019 were responsible for the increase in fire disturbed wind speed distribution around 1 ms 1 these events caused similarly low wind speed values at the undisturbed forest stand but were not as prominent in its distribution as the overall median of the site is lower than that of the fire disturbed site all events had southeasterly winds resulting from passage of weak cold fronts with surface high pressure moving into the area resulting in upslope wind flow which likely contributed to reduced wind speeds compared to the stronger westerly southwesterly winds generally associated with increased snow accumulation wind speed characteristics for each site affected snow drifting and variation in snowpack depth lower wind speeds at the undisturbed forest resulted in relatively uniform snow depth with only slight undulation of the snowpack fig 5 a that was confirmed by the lower œÉ of 27 mm determined from the manual snow depth measurements supplementary data during the 2018 season however the fire disturbed forest showed significant drifting on the leeward side of objects fig 5b due to increased wind speeds from a reduction in canopy and measurement uncertainty was higher œÉ 37 mm snow depth was also more variable œÉ 46 mm at the unforested site as the alpine bog surrounding the instrumentation had undulations due to differences in surface vegetation 4 2 snow ablation similar to trends seen in accumulation the fire disturbed forest stand showed the highest median ablation rate of all sites at 0 55 mm hr 1 iqr 0 80 mm hr 1 swe when periods that all sites were experiencing ablation were compared n 2357 fig 3b the undisturbed forest stand had slightly higher median ablation rate 0 36 mm hr 1 iqr 0 72 mm hr 1 swe than the unforested area 0 28 mm hr 1 iqr 1 02 mm hr 1 swe total 30 minute periods with ablation were determined for each area during times when all areas had snowpack and showed 8 fewer ablation periods 1583 h in the undisturbed forest stand than in the fire disturbed forest stand 1728 5 h with the lowest occurrence of ablation periods in the unforested area 1409 5 h daily swe ablation calculated from measured snowpack swe during the two seasons is shown in fig 6 power problems at the undisturbed forest site resulted in the loss of snow depth data at the beginning of the 2018 fig 6c and end of the 2019 fig 6d seasons nineteen days were identified at each site as being in the 95th percentile for daily ablation at the individual sites during the two seasons and were deemed high ablation days the majority of high ablation days at the forested sites occurred in spring months september and october with 74 of the undisturbed forest cases in this period and 53 of fire disturbed forest cases the unforested site had more high ablation cases in the winter 58 than the spring 37 few high ablation days were recorded during the winter months that were not related to wind scour at the unforested site and an increase in the frequency of cases occurred after 1 september in both years for all sites the fire disturbed forest site was the first to develop high ablation days during the late winter in both years with consistently higher daily swe ablation than either the undisturbed forest or unforested sites while high ablation days generally occurred prior to 15 june and after 1 september ablation occurred throughout the duration of the snow seasons at all sites trends were site specific as only five high ablation days 26 were shared between the forested sites 12 13 september 2018 28 september 2018 10 june 2019 and 13 june 2019 the shared high ablation days on 12 13 september 2018 fig 7 a and 28 september 2018 were caused by prolonged periods of higher air temperatures the warmer air temperatures during this period resulted in the largest sensible heat flux values during the two seasons at all sites and higher daily ablation due to removal of the common re freezing period overnight an example of which can be seen on the mornings of 8 and 9 september 2018 an increase in soil volumetric water content svwc at the two forest stands corresponded to the increased temperatures fig 7b from 10 to 13 september 2018 a similar shared high ablation event at the forested sites caused by high temperatures occurred on 28 september 2018 the two high ablation periods that occurred at the forested sites on 10 and 13 june 2019 were caused by rain on snow events fig 7c and 7d air temperatures at the sites ranged from 2 0 c to 3 5 c during the first event 10 june and had larger variation during the second event 1 7 c to 5 4 c two increases in svwc at both forest stands occurred during the events on 10 june and 12 june fig 7d the rain on snow events combined with relatively high mean temperatures resulted in increased ablation that met the qualification for high ablation days at all sites overall ambient air temperatures were an average of 0 77 c higher at the fire disturbed forest stand than the undisturbed stand during common high ablation periods with greater differences in temperature occurring during periods with higher incoming shortwave radiation wind scour of recently fallen snow caused three high ablation cases at the unforested site on 9 10 august 2018 20 21 august 2018 and again on 21 august 2019 these periods were defined by sharp increases in swe followed immediately by decreases of nearly the same magnitude resulting in spikes in swe at the unforested site being classified as significant ablation events unsurprisingly mean wind speed wind speed standard deviation and maximum wind speed were all at a maximum at the unforested site table 2 however the behaviour at the fire disturbed forest site during the scour events was unexpected as it was approximately mid way between the mean wind speeds for the undistributed and unforested sites wind speed standard deviation and maximum most closely tracked behaviours at the unforested site sustained snowpack began at all sites on 13 june 2018 and 27 may 2019 complete ablation of the snowpack in 2018 occurred earliest at the unforested site on 18 september 2018 the fire disturbed forest stand snowpack fully ablated 12 days later on 1 october 2018 and the undisturbed forest stand had full ablation more than a month after the unforested site on 20 october 2018 while measurements of the end of the 2019 season are only available for the unforested and fire disturbed forest stand a similar but less pronounced trend in snowpack longevity existed with the fire disturbed forest stand reaching full ablation four days after the unforested site 26 september and 22 september respectively the undisturbed forest stand had 15 more days with snowpack in 2018 130 days than the fire disturbed forest stand 111 days and 25 more days than the unforested site 98 days the fire disturbed forest stand and unforested site had a similar number of days with snowpack in 2019 123 days and 119 days respectively while measurements at the end of the 2019 season were not available for the undisturbed forest stand power failure the higher swe and slower ablation rates of the site make it likely that the snowpack contained within it was the last to fully ablate 4 3 evaluating drivers of snow ablation cumulative and event based swe models were used to investigate physical ablation processes and were applied to periods with 10 cm of snow depth during the 2018 and 2019 snow seasons at all sites fig 8 models were developed for the fire disturbed forest stand using measured fig 8c and corrected fig 8d q h that accounted for contamination of measured q h by stem emission of sensible heat due to increased shortwave radiation resulting from disturbance of the canopy schwartz et al 2020 cumulative models included accumulation and ablation through the duration of each snow season event based swe models began ablation calculations immediately following accumulation periods and stopped when the next accumulation period began model performance was considered as satisfactory if it met three conditions 1 nse 0 50 2 rsr 0 70 and pbias less than 25 moriasi et al 2007 positive bias was present in both model types cumulative versus event based but was substantially higher in the cumulative models and led to unsatisfactory performance of the unforested and fire disturbed forest swe calculations table 3 due to underrepresentation of snowpack ablation that propagated through the season rather than being reset after snowfall events event based swe model performance was superior to cumulative models was statistically satisfactory at all sites and removed the need for stem emitted q h correction at the fire disturbed forest stand improved performance of the event based model is due to the limiting of error propagation through the seasons as the model by definition reset at the end of snowfall periods and removed the cumulative errors of the prior periods error within the cumulative models showed the significance of the other ablation processes such as wind scour that were not represented in swe models median error in the cumulative model and ground truth measurements at the undisturbed forest stand was 7 80 mm swe during the two seasons and was likely the result of snow scour processes by comparison the fire disturbed forest stand had a 37 error prior to q h correction and a median error of 11 407 mm and 121 mm swe during the two seasons respectively after correction was applied the largest error occurred at the unforested site 16 132 mm swe and was likely due to the relatively high wind speeds that resulted in several snow scour events during the 2018 winter season though a portion of the errors are the result of snowpack ablation from sources outside of those modelled they also include q ec from measure snowpack energy balances schwartz et al 2020 as such it is important to note that energy balance closure at these sites may be partially or fully responsible for the errors within both model types as error in closure was similar to those of other snowpack studies welch et al 2016 at 31 39 of total fluxes analysis on sources of ablation at each site was conducted by running the full physics snowpack model bartelt and lehning 2002 lehning et al 2002 from 26 may to 01 november 2019 aest fig 9 modelled accumulation based on snow depth measurements suggested that the unforested site had greater total accumulation of snowfall 1113 kg m 2 than the undisturbed 349 kg m 2 and fire disturbed 335 kg m 2 forests however percentage of snowpack converted to runoff table 4 was highest at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forest sites and accounted for 89 and 51 of snowpack ablation respectively while evaporation rates at the forested sites were similar undisturbed forest 6 fire disturbed forest 7 wind scour of the snowpack at the fire disturbed forest was 37 higher than at the undisturbed forest and led to the reduction in runoff yield overall wind scour was modelled to be the highest at the unforested site accounting for 84 and of snowpack ablation and resulting in only 12 of the snowfall being converted to runoff in the area a summary of snowpack modelled accumulation and ablation during the 2019 snowpack season is shown in fig 9 5 discussion 5 1 fire impacts to snow accumulation data collected during the 2018 and 2019 winter seasons showed considerable change to snow accumulation and swe following fire disturbance of e pauciflora forest and removal of canopy overall reduction in canopy between the undisturbed forest stand and the fire disturbed forest stand was associated with a 12 decrease of accumulated swe fire disturbance was also associated with greater swe spatial variability due to deposition of snow on the lee side of the burned tree stems new vegetation and other objects as shown in fig 5b as both forested sites had similar aspects elevations and exposure to dominant westerly southwesterly winds it is likely that the differences in wind speeds resulted from alteration of vegetation structure by bushfire complete removal of the canopy was associated with least accumulated swe and greatest swe spatial variability which occurred at the unforested site decreased swe accumulation with a reduction in canopy between the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests is contrary to the findings of several other studies that found increases in accumulation associated with decreases in canopy huerta et al 2019 l√≥pez moreno and latron 2008 musselman et al 2008 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 these increases are often associated with decreases in snowfall interception by the canopy and associated evaporation sublimation following events hardy and albert 1995 however e pauciflora canopies have less capacity for snowfall interception before bending and shedding of snow and interception in these areas is relatively negligible even during snowfall events fig 10 whereas fir spruce and pine have greater ability for storage in the canopy that allows for evaporation sublimation following events musselman et al 2008 as such it is likely that the increased swe found at the undisturbed forest site was a result of two processes 1 reduced canopy level wind speeds that allowed for a greater percentage of snowfall falling through the canopy and 2 reduced sub canopy wind speeds that limited drifting redistribution of accumulated snow reduction in canopy was associated with greater wind speeds and hence greater drifting and snow scour of the snowpack that resulted in lower accumulation and higher variability the removal of 84 of snowfall by wind erosion scour is considerably higher than that noted by the 48 to 58 that was noted by pomeroy and li 2000 when using observation tested model of blowing snow in prairie and arctic environments however it should be noted that our results are of total snow mass removal by wind scour whereas the results of pomeroy and li 2000 were specifically prior to melting the 47 less snow accumulation at the unforested site than the fire disturbed forest is associated with several instances of wind scour and redistribution following periods of accumulation such as the event described in section 4 that removed significant portions of new snow similar to what was noted by liston and sturm 2002 the site s 135 m distance to the nearest upwind ridge and vegetation meant that there was little protection from larger scale meteorological processes and the site had the highest wind speeds as a result increased wind speeds and exposure led to reductions in snow accumulation during snowfall events as well as scour and redistribution of snow during periods without precipitation occurring the higher level of variation in swe at the unforested site is similarly related to the redistribution of snow liston and sturm 2002 as the underlying alpine bog surface had undulation that allowed for deeper pockets of snow to develop under the relatively smooth snowpack surface though our results show a reduction in snow accumulation and swe within clearings it is important to note that proximity to slopes and vegetation as well as other variables can change snow accumulation properties of an area bilish et al 2019 and should be considered when trying to scale observations 5 2 fire impacts to snow ablation fire disturbance and reduction of canopy was associated with increased ablation rates and periods with ablation at the fire disturbed forest site this was the result of three forest characteristics reduction in canopy cover a 37 lower albedo 0 71 to 0 45 due to shedding of woody debris onto the snow surface schwartz et al 2020 and increased emission of sensible heat and longwave radiation from the decaying stems to the snow pack decreased albedos resulted in greater absorption of incoming radiation similar to that noted by burles and boon 2011 as this study occurred 15 16 years after fire disturbance occurred many of the characteristics associated with a recently burned forest such as char and blackened tree stems no longer existed nonetheless significant alteration of the snowpack albedo by woody debris from decaying stems was still occurring at the time of the study which is similar to the findings of gleason et al 2019 that showed a reduced snowpack albedo for 15 winters following fire disturbance though many of the larger stems were starting to rot and fall during the study period with one narrowly missing our instrumentation the shedding of the debris and its effect on snowpack albedo and shortwave absorption is likely to persist for several decades until the remainder of the damaged stems have fallen webster et al 2016 showed that tree stem temperatures could exceed air temperatures by as much as 25 c which was problematic when trying to model sub canopy longwave radiation similarly reduction in canopy at the fire disturbed forest increased shortwave radiation incident on tree stems that then emitted sensible heat and longwave radiation throughout the day and into evening periods which also increased ambient air temperatures at the site both the lack of canopy and increased number of stems likely enhanced sensible heat and longwave emission because of increased incident shortwave radiation pomeroy et al 2009 this resulted in the area having the highest number of periods with ablation when compared to the other sites similarly snowpack evaporation sublimation rates at the fire disturbed forest stand during the 2018 and 2019 snowpack seasons were 2 1 higher than that of the undisturbed forest stand 8 1 and 6 respectively resulting in the highest loss of swe to the atmosphere schwartz et al 2020 which supports the findings of harpold et al 2014 that showed increases in snowpack sublimation following fire disturbance while increases in evaporation sublimation from fire disturbance of canopy are relatively small the effects may be more pronounced in continental climates where atmospheric moisture is reduced compared to the maritime climate where our study was conducted canopy cover in the undisturbed forest stand resulted in higher amounts of longwave radiation received at the snow surface schwartz et al 2020 which resulted in the area having higher ablation rates and more ablation periods than the unforested area but less than the fire disturbed forest stand the increase in ablation periods compared to the unforested site supports the conclusions of lundquist et al 2013 that emission of longwave radiation by forest canopy may offset canopy reductions to shortwave radiation that results in acceleration of snowmelt the area also had an average daily q g value twice that of the unforested site schwartz et al 2020 which is likely due to higher heat capacity of the soil from consistently higher svwc based on this any type of e pauciflora canopy cover will likely act to increase sub canopy snow ablation through longwave emission sensible heat emission and or shedding of woody debris from decaying stems snowpack ablation occurred throughout the snow seasons but high ablation periods generally occurred in the early winter or late winter early spring which suggests that the australian snowpack does follow conventional accumulation and ablation phases mentioned in other research feng et al 2008 gr√ºnewald et al 2010 accumulation periods with minimal ablation existed from mid june to mid august and late winter spring ablation occurred mid august through october several high ablation periods including mid winter high ablation periods at the unforested site were the result of short term meteorological forcing through wind scour increased ambient temperatures and rain on snow events these periodic high ablation events confirm the event driven nature of the snowpack suggested by bilish et al 2018 but also show that there are still defined accumulation and ablation periods of the snowpack season at each of the sites in general the greatest swe storage throughout the season was located within the undisturbed forest stand which also had increased longevity because ablation processes were generally less than in the fire disturbed forest stand or unforested area the reduced snowpack longevity of the fire disturbed forest stand agrees with uecker et al 2020 that showed snow disappearance occurring an average of 19 days earlier following post wildfire areas compared to pre wildfire areas while our results agree with the reduced snowpack longevity that burles and boon 2011 noted following forest fire disturbance we found reduced snow accumulation following fire disturbance rather than the increased snow accumulation that they noted our results showed that overall swe accumulation storage and snowpack longevity increased as e pauciflora canopy increased 5 3 physical drivers of ablation physically based models identified several changes to ablation processes resulting from fire disturbance to e pauciflora forest cumulative event based and snowpack models all showed increases in wind scour and snowpack erosion with the reduction of canopy cover with specific referent to the question of the impact of bushfire on a marginal sub alpine snowpack ablation processes and resulting runoff this study found that runoff yield of the snowpack varied substantially between 12 unforested and 89 undisturbed forest with 51 at the fire disturbed forest stand meaning yield of water was closer to the unforested site than the undisturbed forest site though full physics models such as snowpack are preferrable for analysis of the snowpack the need for uninterrupted data can limit their use relatively basic physics based models such as the cumulative and event based models used herein can be used when full physics models are limited while the performance of cumulative models was limited due to error propagation through the snowpack seasons the undisturbed forest stand model was able to accurately represent physical ablation processes with satisfactory performance moriasi et al 2007 as the canopy acted to moderate ablation the contamination of the measured snowpack q h in the fire disturbed forest stand and subsequent model error illustrates the significant changes to the snowpack energy balance through bushfire similarly development and implementation of correction to q h in the fire disturbed forest stand did result in satisfactory performance throughout the two snow seasons although this estimate of partitioned q h has been determined for the fire disturbed forest stand and its inclusion in models results in higher accuracy further work is needed to more accurately determine physical contributions of fire disturbed tree stems to snowpack energetics and ablation while bushfire modified ablation processes accounted for the largest percentage of error in the models it is possible that a portion of the positive biases of the cumulative and event based models are due to settling of newly accumulated snow on the top of the snowpack bartelt and lehning 2002 lehning et al 2002 as the models didn t incorporate this physical process though snowpack density does change throughout the snow season in the snowy mountains supplementary data using median snowpack density values schwartz et al 2020 for calculation of swe proved reliable when examining ablation processes this is largely due to the snowpack of the snowy mountains experiencing near constant ablation and marginal characteristics throughout the season that result in similar densities for significant portions of the season however it should be noted that the use of median snowpack densities is a limitation to this research and may have resulted in increased error from ablation and swe calculations schwartz et al 2020 noted energy balance closure of 61 69 for each of the sites during the same measurement periods used in this study which results in q ec values of 31 39 and is similar to that found by welch et al 2016 over snow during ablation similarly the statistically satisfactory results of the undisturbed and q h corrected fire disturbed cumulative models and all event based models suggests adequate measurement of snowpack energy balance as larger errors in energy balance measurement would have contributed to increased error in swe modelling other physical processes have significant impacts on ablation as illustrated by the relatively poor performance of the cumulative swe model the enhancement of these other ablation processes e g evaporation and wind scour is increased by the disturbance and removal of forest canopy through bushfire and is consistent with other research on fire impacts to snowpack processes harpold et al 2014 regardless of model type cumulative versus event based significant physical processes responsible for high ablation periods were not well represented in particular rain on snow events that can cause significant ablation of the marginal snowy mountains snowpack bilish et al 2018 mcgowan et al 2020 need better understanding and representation as the snowpack of the snowy mountains is defined as being event driven bilish et al 2018 further research into these processes and their impacts on the marginal snowpack in forested and unforested areas is crucial the 2019 2020 bushfires that occurred in alpine and sub alpine areas of the australian alps are likely to contribute to previously existing reductions in snow accumulation from the 2003 bushfires though research is needed on the spatial variation of the processes identified within this paper impacts of the 2019 2020 bushfires on the snowpack contained within the fire disturbed areas can be estimated based on the results presented herein if processes within the 462 km2 of fire disturbed forests are similar to those measured the results of this study suggest that the volume of accumulated and then melted snow would have decreased by 63 3 gl per year while all of the melt is not necessarily recorded as inflows this figure represents 2 24 of total average annual inflows to the snowy hydro scheme snowy hydro ltd 2011 these reductions will likely exist for decades after fire and will compound the effects of climate change on the marginal australian snowpack and hydrology of the region while 127 days of data was collected and used in analysis at the undisturbed forest power issues and associated data gaps prevented a more comprehensive overview as such further examination of fire impacts to snow accumulation and ablation processes in the australian alps should be a priority for future research 6 conclusions canopy disturbance by fire significantly changes snow accumulation and ablation characteristics within e pauciflora forests by 1 decreasing accumulation through increases to wind speeds and 2 increasing melt and evaporation by increased stem emission of longwave radiation and sensible heat flux to the snow surface and decreased snow surface albedo due to deposition of woody debris by decaying stems and 3 increasing snow scour and erosion associated with increased wind speeds lower accumulation and the associated increase in ablation makes these areas less efficient at snow water storage than undisturbed e pauciflora forests therefore melt in these areas is more likely to occur during the course of the winter rather than spring which results in reduced snowpack longevity compared to undisturbed forests though event based swe models better captured ablation occurring at the sites than cumulative models important physical snowpack processes are still either under represented such as rain on snow or are not included such as wind scour and full physics models such as snowpack should be used when data allows further research into the impacts of fire on snowpack should be a priority in the australian alps particularly as the dataset collected at the undisturbed forest did not encompass both seasons completely bushfires are expected to increase due to climate change lucas et al 2007 stocker 2014 including in the australian alps and will likely result in decreases to snowpack longevity and storage recovery of these forested areas becomes less likely as subsequent fires increase in frequency fairman et al 2017 these changes to snowpack properties resulting from forest disturbance by fire will increase the burden that already exists on these important freshwater resources globally due to climate change and other anthropogenic activities as such understanding of changes to freshwater resources and associated mitigation strategies regarding water availability

4095,forests modulate energy reaching the earth s surface they can change energy balance fluxes near ground meteorological conditions and seasonal snowpack properties in montane areas regions of forests cover are often collocated with areas of freshwater importance for ecosystem and anthropogenic uses as such alteration of forests in these regions has the potential to significantly impact water resources that many depend upon for daily life warmer climates with marginal snowpacks are known to be particularly vulnerable to impacts of climate change that may increase air temperatures and change precipitation similarly montane forests are also becoming increasingly susceptible to modification by wildfire this study measured energy fluxes rates of snow accumulation and ablation and applied energy flux adjusted physically based snowpack models to examine fire alteration of snowmelt yield analysis focused on differences between an undisturbed and fire disturbed forest stand and referenced an unforested site fire disturbance of forest canopy enhanced ablation rates by 53 relative to the undisturbed site swe storage and snowpack longevity were greater at the undisturbed forest with seasonal snowpack in the fire disturbed forest stand existing for 19 fewer days and at the unforested site for 32 fewer days overall our results are congruent with canopy disturbance by fire having the impact of reducing snow accumulation 50 mm less swe over two seasons 4 reduction enhancing ablation through increased evaporation 1 higher at the fire disturbed site and less total snowmelt

snow accumulation forest meteorology bushfire forest fire 1 introduction mountain snowpack is a crucial freshwater resource for ecosystem and anthropogenic use including agricultural irrigation drinking water for proximal communities energy production and recreation snowpacks that exist at alpine and sub alpine locations have been undergoing modification by climate change hock et al 2019 that has impacted water availability for nearby communities bloschl et al 2019 emphasized the importance of snowpack and its alteration through land cover and vegetation change by determining it to be one of the most important unsolved research questions within hydrology the increasing importance of freshwater obtained from snowpack and its alteration through climate change and land cover vegetation change highlights the need for further understanding on this important resource and potential changes to its properties forests modify the accumulation and redistribution of snow energy fluxes to the surface and snowpack properties the effects of these forests on snowpack characteristics are related to their geographical location climate and tree species varhola et al 2010 significant portions of sub alpine forests regularly undergo disturbance through exposure to fire burles and boon 2011 harpold et al 2014 clear cutting schelker et al 2013 or pests such as pine beetles boon 2009 boon 2012 forest disturbances are expected to increase in frequency due to the effects of climate change at higher altitudes and latitudes stocker 2014 to determine changes to regional hydrology resulting from sub alpine forest disturbance it is important to understand the complex relationships between forests the snowpacks contained within them and ablation processes this is particularly significant for more marginal alpine ecosystems that are responding to the thermal impacts of climate change such as increased air l√≥pez moreno et al 2008 and ground temperatures mellander et al 2007 changes in snow climatology stewart 2009 stewart et al 2004 and precipitation theobald et al 2016 these impacts may be compounded by increased frequency of fire due to climate change that may further modify sub alpine forests their hydrometeorology and consequently their seasonal snowpack change in forest canopy fundamentally alters patterns of snow accumulation gary 1974 gary 1979 and ablation gleason et al 2013 forest canopies govern snow depth and density patterns through interception of snowfall that can result in tree wells with reduced snow depth hardy and albert 1995 hardy et al 1997 and snow water equivalent swe musselman et al 2008 however interception rates and their influence on the snowpack can differ substantially depending on climate and forest characteristics lundquist et al 2013 warmer and more marginal sub alpine landscapes with seasonal snowpacks can be susceptible to fire brewer and clements 2020 harpold et al 2014 lucas et al 2007 maina and siirila woodburn 2020 and are likely to experience greater impacts from global warming schwartz et al 2020 fire has the potential to alter sub alpine ecosystems and regional hydrology as species poorly adapted to fire fairman et al 2017 are degraded these processes may be significant for marginal alpine and sub alpine landscapes and for areas not currently within this category as they shift under a warming climate snowpack energy balances in warm climates are disproportionately affected by changes in radiation transfers and turbulent energy fluxes compared to cold climate snowpacks fayad et al 2017 bilish et al 2019 found that in marginal snow conditions there is potential for ablation to occur throughout the snow season in contrast to the standard accumulation and ablation phases that are observed in colder snowpacks marginal snow locations with evergreen vegetation systems that are slow recovering from fire impacts are of significant interest in the context of fire modification of energy dynamics and snowmelt understanding the magnitude of how canopy disturbance from fire can impact energy fluxes and ablation processes of event driven marginal snowpacks is critical to inform our understanding of likely future change in response to climate variability and forest disturbance the fire prone sub alpine snow gum eucalyptus pauciflora provides an opportunity to investigate how canopy modification by fire affects snowpack accumulation and ablation in a marginal snow landscape e pauciflora are broadleaf evergreen trees that have particularly slow regrowth following disturbance by fire pickering and barry 2005 pure forest stands of e pauciflora are found above 1500 m a s l slatyer and morrow 1977 which coincides with the elevations that are associated with frequent winter snowfall and a seasonal snowpack these forests have been identified as important controls on the spatial distribution of snow bilish et al 2019 and snowpack energy balance schwartz et al 2020 the slow regrowth of e pauciflora following disturbance by bushfires means the impact of wildfire may influence snowpack energy balance and hydrology of this marginal sub alpine area this paper expands on the energy balance findings of schwartz et al 2020 by examining bushfire impacts to snowpack accumulation ablation processes resulting from site energy balances and ablation processes outside of those identified in the previously compared energy balances e g wind scour the aim of this research is to quantify the magnitude that fire modification of tree canopy can potentially impact process and drivers of snow accumulation ablation and snowmelt in a fire susceptible marginal sub alpine location with an evergreen broadleaf sub alpine woodland we use eddy covariance equipment coupled to snow measurements and also apply physically based snow models to compare snow accumulation ablation sub canopy energy dynamics and wind speed and snowmelt yield three sites at equivalent altitude operated for two seasons are used in this study where the focus is on the comparison of undisturbed and fire disturbed e pauciflora woodland burned 2003 sites while also referencing a site without the woodland vegetation system the paper has two objectives 1 compare rates of snow accumulation and ablation and related drivers energy flux dynamics wind characteristics

vulnerable to periods of complete ablation particularly early in the snow season and during rain on snow events bilish et al 2019 bilish et al 2018 mcgowan et al 2020 schwartz et al 2020 e pauciflora are common throughout sub alpine regions of the snowy mountains and cover an area of approximately 3000 km2 from 1400 m a s l to the altitudinal tree limit of 1900 m a s l costermans 2009 areas where snowfall commonly occurs within these forests above 1500 m a s l covers approximately 1400 km2 e pauciflora are highly susceptible to fire with slow post fire regrowth pickering and barry 2005 and increased mortality rates that correspond to consecutive fire events fairman et al 2017 bushfires impacted large tracks of e pauciflora in the snowy mountains in 2003 and burned 70 of the sub alpine

department of agriculture 2020 showed the 2019 2020 bushfires impacted approximately 462 km2 33 of mapped forest that regularly has seasonal snowpack as a result the sub alpine regions of the snowy mountains contain substantial portions of both undisturbed and fire disturbed e pauciflora forests three sites were selected for this study fig 1 and were monitored during the 2018 and 2019 snow seasons the sites included an undisturbed e pauciflora forest stand 36 432 148 368 1851 m fig 2 a a fire disturbed e pauciflora forest stand 36 410 148 421 1842 m fig 2b and an unforested area 36 418 148 422 1847 m fig 2c the fire disturbed forest stand was burned in 2003 and had exhibited new stem regrowth coppiced fig 2b but regrowth was not taller than 2 m with no over canopy as seen in the undisturbed site fig 2a it is also worth noting that compared to a forest impacted by a recent fire the fire affected tree stems at our site were less charred but still contributed to debris on the surface of the snowpack therefore we use the term fire disturbed forest stand rather than burned forest stand to avoid confusion equipment at the sites had been removed prior to the summer that included the 2019 2020 bushfires and these sites were not burned during those fires measurement sites were representative of the key functional or structural biomes of the region that directly represent 65 of mapped ecological communities within the seasonally snow covered area the alpine grassland herb fields and bogs located at the unforested site represented 8 of the larger snowy mountains region and the e pauciflora woodland is present in 57 of the wider australian alps area gellie 2005 importance was also placed on locations that had minimal differences in distance all sites within 5 km elevation all within 5 m a s l and shared a similar aspect forested sites shared a north easterly aspect unforested site had no aspect as it was located on relatively level ground forest and soil metrics were recorded at each site and are presented in table 1 the undisturbed forest stand had a stem density of 1900 stems ha 1 and a vegetation area index vai fassnacht et al 1994 of 1 85 which was the highest of all areas despite 77 more stems in the fire disturbed forest stand 8400 stems ha 1 the area had a vai 78 lower than that of the undisturbed forest stand while there had been 15 years of post fire regrowth at the fire disturbed forest stand at the start of the study the maximum 2 m canopy height had a minimal influence on the area s vai which was primarily dead stems rather than canopy fig 2b soil bulk densities were similar at the two forested sites but was 22 lower at the unforested area all soil samples had relatively similar organic matter contents ranging

sites is presented in schwartz et al 2020 3 2 energy balance measurements and data quality control snowpack energy balance calculation of energy fluxes and data quality control followed schwartz et al 2020 which expressed the snowpack energy balance as 1 q res q q h q e q g q r q ec where q res is the residual energy flux from the sum of net radiative flux q sensible heat flux q h latent heat flux q e ground heat flux q g rain heat flux q r and energy balance closure error q ec wiring on the ground heat flux plate at the undisturbed forest stand was damaged by a small animal during the 2019 snow season erroneous values were replaced using a multivariate regression model developed using random forest breiman 2001 and 2018 q g values which had a rmse of 0 02 wm 2 for the training data development of an analogous model occurred for the fire disturbed forest stand to determine performance during the 2019 snow season and showed an 8 variance between measured and modelled q g values q r values were calculated for each site following the methods of bilish et al 2018 that utilize wetbulb temperature and fraction of precipitation falling as snow to determine 30 minute liquid precipitation heat flux 3 3 physically based snowpack models three physically based snowpack models were used to identify impacts to ablation processes and runoff following forest disturbance by fire calculation of snowpack swe at each site for cumulative and event based models used d s from the automated measurements in both snow seasons and median snow density values obtained during the 2018

gray and male 1981 similar to what was noted by burles and boon 2011 b i had little impact on ablation model output and a value of 0 96 was determined to be accurate for all sites cumulative sums of snowpack accumulation and ablation were created for each site using the calculated accum and abl values for cumulative snowpack models whereas automated snowpack depth measurements made after snowfall periods were used in event based models prior to the start of a new ablation event the event based swe model used measured snowpack depths and median density to determine swe once accumulation periods stopped effectively removing any error from previous ablation calculation as a new ablation event had started the purpose of designing the event based model this way was to allow both models to be run with the same ablation characteristics and calculations which would include any qec to be included in both models as such differences in model performance would likely be the result of outside processes such as wind scour that would accumulate within the cumulative model only periods with automated measurements of snow depth 10 cm at all sites were selected for analysis of cumulative and event based model ablation to ensure a higher degree of snowpack surface homogeneity and correct measurement of snowpack energy balance with minimal contamination from heterogeneous ground surfaces approximately 127 days n 6090 30 minute periods of data between the 2018 and 2019 snow seasons were used for analysis and comparison following quality control gap filling and d s measurement

sutcliffe 1970 and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr the snowpack model bartelt and lehning 2002 lehning et al 2002 was also used in analysis of the snowpack internal state and ablation processes from 26 may to 1 november 2019 in situ measurements of air temperature relative humidity wind speed shortwave and longwave radiation ground temperature and snow depth were used as model inputs regression models developed between similar variables at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forest sites were used to gap fill data from 15 00 4 september 2019 to 00 00 1 november 2019 aest at the undisturbed forest stand after power issues caused the site to stop recording data it s important to note that snowpack uses snowpack height hs for its calculations of new snowfall and associated snowpack morphology and no new snowpack depth measurements were made following 04 september 2019 as such any new snowfall that occurred after that date was not registered at the undisturbed site 4 results 4 1 snow accumulation while all sites had similar aspects and elevation characteristics total volume of accumulated snow across the two seasons 2018 2019 was greatest in the undisturbed forest stand which had a total of 2762 mm of accumulation 1149 mm swe the fire disturbed forest stand was 12 lower in snow accumulation and 4 lower in swe accumulating 2426 mm of snow across the seasons 1099 mm swe the unforested area had the least accumulation with 31 lower snow accumulation 1916 mm and 28 lower swe 822 mm than the undisturbed forest stand shapiro wilk tests conducted on accumulation rates at each site during periods when all sites were experiencing snow accumulation as determined by sonic snow depth sensors showed non normal distributions n 352 therefore comparisons of snow accumulation rates used median rather than mean to avoid contamination from high rate outliers median swe accumulation rates were similar between sites and only varied by 0 33 mm hr 1 fig 3 a the undisturbed forest stand had a median swe accumulation rate of 3 0 mm hr 1 interquartile range iqr 2 5 mm hr 1 the fire disturbed stand had a rate of 3 0 mm hr 1 iqr 3 0 mm hr 1 and the unforested site had a median rate of 2 7 mm hr 1 iqr 1 8 mm hr 1 though a kruskal wallis test showed significant statistical differences between the rates chi squared 43 52 df 2 p value 3 55x10 10 these differences could have been the result of natural variability in precipitation rate and snow accumulation rather than the result of canopy influences in addition to the highest median snow accumulation rate the fire disturbed forest stand had the largest variance in accumulation rate and the unforested site had the least variance fig 3a though the undisturbed and fire disturbed forest stands had similar median accumulation rates increased variance in rate corresponded to reduction in canopy cover analysis of wind speeds during periods of snow accumulation and at times without snow accumulation for each of the sites fig 4 showed that median wind speed was inversely related to canopy cover wind speeds at the fire disturbed forest stand were 18 higher during non accumulation periods 1 23 ms 1 and 38 higher during accumulation periods 2 92 ms 1 than those experienced within the undisturbed forest stand 1 04 ms 1 and 2 12 ms 1 respectively the fire disturbed forest stand also had higher variation in wind speed than the undisturbed forest stand particularly during accumulation periods when the iqr was 94 higher fire disturbed forest iqr 2 44 undisturbed forest iqr 1 26 wind speeds were consistently highest at the unforested site non accumulation median 2 66 ms 1 snow accumulation median 4 18 ms 1 were 156 higher than the undisturbed forest stand during periods of accumulation and 97 higher without accumulation similarly wind speeds at the unforested site were 117 higher than at the fire disturbed forest stand during accumulation and were 43 higher during periods without accumulation variation in wind speed during accumulation events at the unforested site was slightly lower iqr 2 0 ms 1 than at the fire disturbed forest stand iqr 2 4 ms 1 but was higher than both forest stands during non accumulation periods two bimodal distributions existed for wind speed the unforested site during non accumulation periods fig 4a and the fire disturbed forest stand during accumulation periods fig 4b the small increase in distribution of wind speed between 5 and 6 ms 1 at the unforested site was the result of several days having similar maximum wind speeds snow accumulation events that occurred on 3 4 june 2019 11 12 august 2019 and 29 august 2019 were responsible for the increase in fire disturbed wind speed distribution around 1 ms 1 these events caused similarly low wind speed values at the undisturbed forest stand but were not as prominent in its distribution as the overall median of the site is lower than that of the fire disturbed site all events had southeasterly winds resulting from passage of weak cold fronts with surface high pressure moving into the area resulting in upslope wind flow which likely contributed to reduced wind speeds compared to the stronger westerly southwesterly winds generally associated with increased snow accumulation wind speed characteristics for each site affected snow drifting and variation in snowpack depth lower wind speeds at the undisturbed forest resulted in relatively uniform snow depth with only slight undulation of the snowpack fig 5 a that was confirmed by the lower œÉ of 27 mm determined from the manual snow depth measurements supplementary data during the 2018 season however the fire disturbed forest showed significant drifting on the leeward side of objects fig 5b due to increased wind speeds from a reduction in canopy and measurement uncertainty was higher œÉ 37 mm snow depth was also more variable œÉ 46 mm at the unforested site as the alpine bog surrounding the instrumentation had undulations due to differences in surface vegetation 4 2 snow ablation similar to trends seen in accumulation the fire disturbed forest stand showed the highest median ablation rate of all sites at 0 55 mm hr 1 iqr 0 80 mm hr 1 swe when periods that all sites were experiencing ablation were compared n 2357 fig 3b the undisturbed forest stand had slightly higher median ablation rate 0 36 mm hr 1 iqr 0 72 mm hr 1 swe than the unforested area 0 28 mm hr 1 iqr 1 02 mm hr 1 swe total 30 minute periods with ablation were determined for each area during times when all areas had snowpack and showed 8 fewer ablation periods 1583 h in the undisturbed forest stand than in the fire disturbed forest stand 1728 5 h with the lowest occurrence of ablation periods in the unforested area 1409 5 h daily swe ablation calculated from measured snowpack swe during the two seasons is shown in fig 6 power problems at the undisturbed forest site resulted in the loss of snow depth data at the beginning of the 2018 fig 6c and end of the 2019 fig 6d seasons nineteen days were identified at each site as being in the 95th percentile for daily ablation at the individual sites during the two seasons and were deemed high ablation days the majority of high ablation days at the forested sites occurred in spring months september and october with 74 of the undisturbed forest cases in this period and 53 of fire disturbed forest cases the unforested site had more high ablation cases in the winter 58 than the spring 37 few high ablation days were recorded during the winter months that were not related to wind scour at the unforested site and an increase in the frequency of cases occurred after 1 september in both years for all sites the fire disturbed forest site was the first to develop high ablation days during the late winter in both years with consistently higher daily swe ablation than either the undisturbed forest or unforested sites while high ablation days generally occurred prior to 15 june and after 1 september ablation occurred throughout the duration of the snow seasons at all sites trends were site specific as only five high ablation days 26 were shared between the forested sites 12 13 september 2018 28 september 2018 10 june 2019 and 13 june 2019 the shared high ablation days on 12 13 september 2018 fig 7 a and 28 september 2018 were caused by prolonged periods of higher air temperatures the warmer air temperatures during this period resulted in the largest sensible heat flux values during the two seasons at all sites and higher daily ablation due to removal of the common re freezing period overnight an example of which can be seen on the mornings of 8 and 9 september 2018 an increase in soil volumetric water content svwc at the two forest stands corresponded to the increased temperatures fig 7b from 10 to 13 september 2018 a similar shared high ablation event at the forested sites caused by high temperatures occurred on 28 september 2018 the two high ablation periods that occurred at the forested sites on 10 and 13 june 2019 were caused by rain on snow events fig 7c and 7d air temperatures at the sites ranged from 2 0 c to 3 5 c during the first event 10 june and had larger variation during the second event 1 7 c to 5 4 c two increases in svwc at both forest stands occurred during the events on 10 june and 12 june fig 7d the rain on snow events combined with relatively high mean temperatures resulted in increased ablation that met the qualification for high ablation days at all sites overall ambient air temperatures were an average of 0 77 c higher at the fire disturbed forest stand than the undisturbed stand during common high ablation periods with greater differences in temperature occurring during periods with higher incoming shortwave radiation wind scour of recently fallen snow caused three high ablation cases at the unforested site on 9 10 august 2018 20 21 august 2018 and again on 21 august 2019 these periods were defined by sharp increases in swe followed immediately by decreases of nearly the same magnitude resulting in spikes in swe at the unforested site being classified as significant ablation events unsurprisingly mean wind speed wind speed standard deviation and maximum wind speed were all at a maximum at the unforested site table 2 however the behaviour at the fire disturbed forest site during the scour events was unexpected as it was approximately mid way between the mean wind speeds for the undistributed and unforested sites wind speed standard deviation and maximum most closely tracked behaviours at the unforested site sustained snowpack began at all sites on 13 june 2018 and 27 may 2019 complete ablation of the snowpack in 2018 occurred earliest at the unforested site on 18 september 2018 the fire disturbed forest stand snowpack fully ablated 12 days later on 1 october 2018 and the undisturbed forest stand had full ablation more than a month after the unforested site on 20 october 2018 while measurements of the end of the 2019 season are only available for the unforested and fire disturbed forest stand a similar but less pronounced trend in snowpack longevity existed with the fire disturbed forest stand reaching full ablation four days after the unforested site 26 september and 22 september respectively the undisturbed forest stand had 15 more days with snowpack in 2018 130 days than the fire disturbed forest stand 111 days and 25 more days than the unforested site 98 days the fire disturbed forest stand and unforested site had a similar number of days with snowpack in 2019 123 days and 119 days respectively while measurements at the end of the 2019 season were not available for the undisturbed forest stand power failure the higher swe and slower ablation rates of the site make it likely that the snowpack contained within it was the last to fully ablate 4 3 evaluating drivers of snow ablation cumulative and event based swe models were used to investigate physical ablation processes and were applied to periods with 10 cm of snow depth during the 2018 and 2019 snow seasons at all sites fig 8 models were developed for the fire disturbed forest stand using measured fig 8c and corrected fig 8d q h that accounted for contamination of measured q h by stem emission of sensible heat due to increased shortwave radiation resulting from disturbance of the canopy schwartz et al 2020 cumulative models included accumulation and ablation through the duration of each snow season event based swe models began ablation calculations immediately following accumulation periods and stopped when the next accumulation period began model performance was considered as satisfactory if it met three conditions 1 nse 0 50 2 rsr 0 70 and pbias less than 25 moriasi et al 2007 positive bias was present in both model types cumulative versus event based but was substantially higher in the cumulative models and led to unsatisfactory performance of the unforested and fire disturbed forest swe calculations table 3 due to underrepresentation of snowpack ablation that propagated through the season rather than being reset after snowfall events event based swe model performance was superior to cumulative models was statistically satisfactory at all sites and removed the need for stem emitted q h correction at the fire disturbed forest stand improved performance of the event based model is due to the limiting of error propagation through the seasons as the model by definition reset at the end of snowfall periods and removed the cumulative errors of the prior periods error within the cumulative models showed the significance of the other ablation processes such as wind scour that were not represented in swe models median error in the cumulative model and ground truth measurements at the undisturbed forest stand was 7 80 mm swe during the two seasons and was likely the result of snow scour processes by comparison the fire disturbed forest stand had a 37 error prior to q h correction and a median error of 11 407 mm and 121 mm swe during the two seasons respectively after correction was applied the largest error occurred at the unforested site 16 132 mm swe and was likely due to the relatively high wind speeds that resulted in several snow scour events during the 2018 winter season though a portion of the errors are the result of snowpack ablation from sources outside of those modelled they also include q ec from measure snowpack energy balances schwartz et al 2020 as such it is important to note that energy balance closure at these sites may be partially or fully responsible for the errors within both model types as error in closure was similar to those of other snowpack studies welch et al 2016 at 31 39 of total fluxes analysis on sources of ablation at each site was conducted by running the full physics snowpack model bartelt and lehning 2002 lehning et al 2002 from 26 may to 01 november 2019 aest fig 9 modelled accumulation based on snow depth measurements suggested that the unforested site had greater total accumulation of snowfall 1113 kg m 2 than the undisturbed 349 kg m 2 and fire disturbed 335 kg m 2 forests however percentage of snowpack converted to runoff table 4 was highest at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forest sites and accounted for 89 and 51 of snowpack ablation respectively while evaporation rates at the forested sites were similar undisturbed forest 6 fire disturbed forest 7 wind scour of the snowpack at the fire disturbed forest was 37 higher than at the undisturbed forest and led to the reduction in runoff yield overall wind scour was modelled to be the highest at the unforested site accounting for 84 and of snowpack ablation and resulting in only 12 of the snowfall being converted to runoff in the area a summary of snowpack modelled accumulation and ablation during the 2019 snowpack season is shown in fig 9 5 discussion 5 1 fire impacts to snow accumulation data collected during the 2018 and 2019 winter seasons showed considerable change to snow accumulation and swe following fire disturbance of e pauciflora forest and removal of canopy overall reduction in canopy between the undisturbed forest stand and the fire disturbed forest stand was associated with a 12 decrease of accumulated swe fire disturbance was also associated with greater swe spatial variability due to deposition of snow on the lee side of the burned tree stems new vegetation and other objects as shown in fig 5b as both forested sites had similar aspects elevations and exposure to dominant westerly southwesterly winds it is likely that the differences in wind speeds resulted from alteration of vegetation structure by bushfire complete removal of the canopy was associated with least accumulated swe and greatest swe spatial variability which occurred at the unforested site decreased swe accumulation with a reduction in canopy between the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests is contrary to the findings of several other studies that found increases in accumulation associated with decreases in canopy huerta et al 2019 l√≥pez moreno and latron 2008 musselman et al 2008 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 these increases are often associated with decreases in snowfall interception by the canopy and associated evaporation sublimation following events hardy and albert 1995 however e pauciflora canopies have less capacity for snowfall interception before bending and shedding of snow and interception in these areas is relatively negligible even during snowfall events fig 10 whereas fir spruce and pine have greater ability for storage in the canopy that allows for evaporation sublimation following events musselman et al 2008 as such it is likely that the increased swe found at the undisturbed forest site was a result of two processes 1 reduced canopy level wind speeds that allowed for a greater percentage of snowfall falling through the canopy and 2 reduced sub canopy wind speeds that limited drifting redistribution of accumulated snow reduction in canopy was associated with greater wind speeds and hence greater drifting and snow scour of the snowpack that resulted in lower accumulation and higher variability the removal of 84 of snowfall by wind erosion scour is considerably higher than that noted by the 48 to 58 that was noted by pomeroy and li 2000 when using observation tested model of blowing snow in prairie and arctic environments however it should be noted that our results are of total snow mass removal by wind scour whereas the results of pomeroy and li 2000 were specifically prior to melting the 47 less snow accumulation at the unforested site than the fire disturbed forest is associated with several instances of wind scour and redistribution following periods of accumulation such as the event described in section 4 that removed significant portions of new snow similar to what was noted by liston and sturm 2002 the site s 135 m distance to the nearest upwind ridge and vegetation meant that there was little protection from larger scale meteorological processes and the site had the highest wind speeds as a result increased wind speeds and exposure led to reductions in snow accumulation during snowfall events as well as scour and redistribution of snow during periods without precipitation occurring the higher level of variation in swe at the unforested site is similarly related to the redistribution of snow liston and sturm 2002 as the underlying alpine bog surface had undulation that allowed for deeper pockets of snow to develop under the relatively smooth snowpack surface though our results show a reduction in snow accumulation and swe within clearings it is important to note that proximity to slopes and vegetation as well as other variables can change snow accumulation properties of an area bilish et al 2019 and should be considered when trying to scale observations 5 2 fire impacts to snow ablation fire disturbance and reduction of canopy was associated with increased ablation rates and periods with ablation at the fire disturbed forest site this was the result of three forest characteristics reduction in canopy cover a 37 lower albedo 0 71 to 0 45 due to shedding of woody debris onto the snow surface schwartz et al 2020 and increased emission of sensible heat and longwave radiation from the decaying stems to the snow pack decreased albedos resulted in greater absorption of incoming radiation similar to that noted by burles and boon 2011 as this study occurred 15 16 years after fire disturbance occurred many of the characteristics associated with a recently burned forest such as char and blackened tree stems no longer existed nonetheless significant alteration of the snowpack albedo by woody debris from decaying stems was still occurring at the time of the study which is similar to the findings of gleason et al 2019 that showed a reduced snowpack albedo for 15 winters following fire disturbance though many of the larger stems were starting to rot and fall during the study period with one narrowly missing our instrumentation the shedding of the debris and its effect on snowpack albedo and shortwave absorption is likely to persist for several decades until the remainder of the damaged stems have fallen webster et al 2016 showed that tree stem temperatures could exceed air temperatures by as much as 25 c which was problematic when trying to model sub canopy longwave radiation similarly reduction in canopy at the fire disturbed forest increased shortwave radiation incident on tree stems that then emitted sensible heat and longwave radiation throughout the day and into evening periods which also increased ambient air temperatures at the site both the lack of canopy and increased number of stems likely enhanced sensible heat and longwave emission because of increased incident shortwave radiation pomeroy et al 2009 this resulted in the area having the highest number of periods with ablation when compared to the other sites similarly snowpack evaporation sublimation rates at the fire disturbed forest stand during the 2018 and 2019 snowpack seasons were 2 1 higher than that of the undisturbed forest stand 8 1 and 6 respectively resulting in the highest loss of swe to the atmosphere schwartz et al 2020 which supports the findings of harpold et al 2014 that showed increases in snowpack sublimation following fire disturbance while increases in evaporation sublimation from fire disturbance of canopy are relatively small the effects may be more pronounced in continental climates where atmospheric moisture is reduced compared to the maritime climate where our study was conducted canopy cover in the undisturbed forest stand resulted in higher amounts of longwave radiation received at the snow surface schwartz et al 2020 which resulted in the area having higher ablation rates and more ablation periods than the unforested area but less than the fire disturbed forest stand the increase in ablation periods compared to the unforested site supports the conclusions of lundquist et al 2013 that emission of longwave radiation by forest canopy may offset canopy reductions to shortwave radiation that results in acceleration of snowmelt the area also had an average daily q g value twice that of the unforested site schwartz et al 2020 which is likely due to higher heat capacity of the soil from consistently higher svwc based on this any type of e pauciflora canopy cover will likely act to increase sub canopy snow ablation through longwave emission sensible heat emission and or shedding of woody debris from decaying stems snowpack ablation occurred throughout the snow seasons but high ablation periods generally occurred in the early winter or late winter early spring which suggests that the australian snowpack does follow conventional accumulation and ablation phases mentioned in other research feng et al 2008 gr√ºnewald et al 2010 accumulation periods with minimal ablation existed from mid june to mid august and late winter spring ablation occurred mid august through october several high ablation periods including mid winter high ablation periods at the unforested site were the result of short term meteorological forcing through wind scour increased ambient temperatures and rain on snow events these periodic high ablation events confirm the event driven nature of the snowpack suggested by bilish et al 2018 but also show that there are still defined accumulation and ablation periods of the snowpack season at each of the sites in general the greatest swe storage throughout the season was located within the undisturbed forest stand which also had increased longevity because ablation processes were generally less than in the fire disturbed forest stand or unforested area the reduced snowpack longevity of the fire disturbed forest stand agrees with uecker et al 2020 that showed snow disappearance occurring an average of 19 days earlier following post wildfire areas compared to pre wildfire areas while our results agree with the reduced snowpack longevity that burles and boon 2011 noted following forest fire disturbance we found reduced snow accumulation following fire disturbance rather than the increased snow accumulation that they noted our results showed that overall swe accumulation storage and snowpack longevity increased as e pauciflora canopy increased 5 3 physical drivers of ablation physically based models identified several changes to ablation processes resulting from fire disturbance to e pauciflora forest cumulative event based and snowpack models all showed increases in wind scour and snowpack erosion with the reduction of canopy cover with specific referent to the question of the impact of bushfire on a marginal sub alpine snowpack ablation processes and resulting runoff this study found that runoff yield of the snowpack varied substantially between 12 unforested and 89 undisturbed forest with 51 at the fire disturbed forest stand meaning yield of water was closer to the unforested site than the undisturbed forest site though full physics models such as snowpack are preferrable for analysis of the snowpack the need for uninterrupted data can limit their use relatively basic physics based models such as the cumulative and event based models used herein can be used when full physics models are limited while the performance of cumulative models was limited due to error propagation through the snowpack seasons the undisturbed forest stand model was able to accurately represent physical ablation processes with satisfactory performance moriasi et al 2007 as the canopy acted to moderate ablation the contamination of the measured snowpack q h in the fire disturbed forest stand and subsequent model error illustrates the significant changes to the snowpack energy balance through bushfire similarly development and implementation of correction to q h in the fire disturbed forest stand did result in satisfactory performance throughout the two snow seasons although this estimate of partitioned q h has been determined for the fire disturbed forest stand and its inclusion in models results in higher accuracy further work is needed to more accurately determine physical contributions of fire disturbed tree stems to snowpack energetics and ablation while bushfire modified ablation processes accounted for the largest percentage of error in the models it is possible that a portion of the positive biases of the cumulative and event based models are due to settling of newly accumulated snow on the top of the snowpack bartelt and lehning 2002 lehning et al 2002 as the models didn t incorporate this physical process though snowpack density does change throughout the snow season in the snowy mountains supplementary data using median snowpack density values schwartz et al 2020 for calculation of swe proved reliable when examining ablation processes this is largely due to the snowpack of the snowy mountains experiencing near constant ablation and marginal characteristics throughout the season that result in similar densities for significant portions of the season however it should be noted that the use of median snowpack densities is a limitation to this research and may have resulted in increased error from ablation and swe calculations schwartz et al 2020 noted energy balance closure of 61 69 for each of the sites during the same measurement periods used in this study which results in q ec values of 31 39 and is similar to that found by welch et al 2016 over snow during ablation similarly the statistically satisfactory results of the undisturbed and q h corrected fire disturbed cumulative models and all event based models suggests adequate measurement of snowpack energy balance as larger errors in energy balance measurement would have contributed to increased error in swe modelling other physical processes have significant impacts on ablation as illustrated by the relatively poor performance of the cumulative swe model the enhancement of these other ablation processes e g evaporation and wind scour is increased by the disturbance and removal of forest canopy through bushfire and is consistent with other research on fire impacts to snowpack processes harpold et al 2014 regardless of model type cumulative versus event based significant physical processes responsible for high ablation periods were not well represented in particular rain on snow events that can cause significant ablation of the marginal snowy mountains snowpack bilish et al 2018 mcgowan et al 2020 need better understanding and representation as the snowpack of the snowy mountains is defined as being event driven bilish et al 2018 further research into these processes and their impacts on the marginal snowpack in forested and unforested areas is crucial the 2019 2020 bushfires that occurred in alpine and sub alpine areas of the australian alps are likely to contribute to previously existing reductions in snow accumulation from the 2003 bushfires though research is needed on the spatial variation of the processes identified within this paper impacts of the 2019 2020 bushfires on the snowpack contained within the fire disturbed areas can be estimated based on the results presented herein if processes within the 462 km2 of fire disturbed forests are similar to those measured the results of this study suggest that the volume of accumulated and then melted snow would have decreased by 63 3 gl per year while all of the melt is not necessarily recorded as inflows this figure represents 2 24 of total average annual inflows to the snowy hydro scheme snowy hydro ltd 2011 these reductions will likely exist for decades after fire and will compound the effects of climate change on the marginal australian snowpack and hydrology of the region while 127 days of data was collected and used in analysis at the undisturbed forest power issues and associated data gaps prevented a more comprehensive overview as such further examination of fire impacts to snow accumulation and ablation processes in the australian alps should be a priority for future research 6 conclusions canopy disturbance by fire significantly changes snow accumulation and ablation characteristics within e pauciflora forests by 1 decreasing accumulation through increases to wind speeds and 2 increasing melt and evaporation by increased stem emission of longwave radiation and sensible heat flux to the snow surface and decreased snow surface albedo due to deposition of woody debris by decaying stems and 3 increasing snow scour and erosion associated with increased wind speeds lower accumulation and the associated increase in ablation makes these areas less efficient at snow water storage than undisturbed e pauciflora forests therefore melt in these areas is more likely to occur during the course of the winter rather than spring which results in reduced snowpack longevity compared to undisturbed forests though event based swe models better captured ablation occurring at the sites than cumulative models important physical snowpack processes are still either under represented such as rain on snow or are not included such as wind scour and full physics models such as snowpack should be used when data allows further research into the impacts of fire on snowpack should be a priority in the australian alps particularly as the dataset collected at the undisturbed forest did not encompass both seasons completely bushfires are expected to increase due to climate change lucas et al 2007 stocker 2014 including in the australian alps and will likely result in decreases to snowpack longevity and storage recovery of these forested areas becomes less likely as subsequent fires increase in frequency fairman et al 2017 these changes to snowpack properties resulting from forest disturbance by fire will increase the burden that already exists on these important freshwater resources globally due to climate change and other anthropogenic activities as such understanding of changes to freshwater resources and associated mitigation strategies regarding water availability

relevant departments in time which plays an important role in reducing flood risk aiming at the rapid and strong response of urban river to rainfall a real time rolling prediction system of urban river water level is proposed based on radar rainfall prediction products and coupling model of hydrology and hydrodynamics in the system each simulation is divided into two parts the review period and the prediction period in the review period the river model is driven by the observed rainfall to obtain the latest simulation state to avoid cumulative error while in the prediction period the radar rainfall is used to drive in the short term prediction of river water level taking fuzhou as the research area a long series review of the process from april 1 2020 to october 1 2020 was carried out the accuracy of the river model radar rainfall and prediction system during the study period are evaluated and discussed in detail the results show that the river model can simulate the process of water level change in rainfall and rain free period the performance of radar rainfall to total rainfall prediction is better than that of process prediction the real time prediction system can give the water level risk according to each radar forecast rainfall process and has good performance in judging the peak water level and peak time which can provide reference for urban river dispatching

and fenner 2020b in the rainstorm the rainwater quickly converges to the river through the ground or underground pipe network and the river rises rapidly which may block the outlet of the pipe network resulting in flood zheng et al 2014 the prediction of river water level by river model can provide early warning information for decision makers of relevant departments and make timely emergency

progress in the application of river models in different regions chatterjee et al 2008 kim et al 2012 li et al 2021 paiva et al 2011 a complete channel model generally consists of two parts which are a hydrological model used to calculate the source of flood generated by rainfall and a hydrodynamic model used to effectively simulate the flow process of river network ming et al 2020 the previous prediction of river level mainly uses the rainfall process observed by the rain gauge as boundary conditions to drive the hydrological hydrodynamic model to simulate the water level and flow of the river section speight et al 2021 when the time of rainwater confluence and flow to the target section is longer than the total time of data collection and simulation the process of water level can be predicted in advance this method has high accuracy but it is only suitable for natural areas with large area and long response time in the urban area the catchment area is small and the confluence distance is short in addition the construction of the underlying surface of urbanization and underground pipeline also accelerates the rainwater confluence speed resulting in the short response time of river water level to rainfall flack et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 speight et al 2021 therefore using the observed rainfall driven model to predict the river water level the lead time is relatively short which can not meet the actual requirements therefore in the recent studies the rainfall prediction model is applied to the river water level prediction using the predicted rainfall as the boundary condition to drive the hydrological hydrodynamic model for calculation which significantly improves the forecast period of the results cuo et al 2011 demeritt et al 2007 kim et al 2021 ming

by radar echo extrapolation is fast and it performs best in a very short forecast period 1 2 h but with the increase of the lead time the accuracy decreases rapidly yu et al 2015 nwp performs better in a longer encounter period but its calculation speed is slow and the results are not reliable in the early stage of forecast davies et al 2005 according to the characteristics of different rainstorm

the latest water level rainfall and other information available at each time xu et al 2020 therefore the rolling prediction method should also be used in the real time prediction of river water level in the operation according to the updated boundary conditions at the current time the latest water level prediction results are updated in real time at present the research on real time prediction of river water level is less and the research on rolling prediction in operation has not been reported this study presents a case study of an urban river water level real time prediction system fuzhou city is selected as the study area and the river model of the study area is constructed based on hydrological and hydrodynamic according to the characteristics of the study area a real time rolling prediction system of river water level is proposed based on radar rainfall the accuracy of river model radar rainfall and prediction system from april 1 to october 1 2020 are evaluated and discussed in detail the constructed real time rolling prediction system can provide scheduling basis for local decision makers in addition the construction of the system completely considers the complete urban river water circulation process including rainfall runoff generation confluence river hydrodynamics hydraulic regulation engineering and tide level by rolling prediction the uncertainty of prediction is effectively reduced and the error accumulation caused by continuous simulation is prevented which provides a reference for the construction of urban river water level prediction system in other regions 2 data and methods 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 fuzhou city is located in fujian province the southeast coast of china with 119 17 18 e and 26 04 08 n fuzhou is located in the middle and low latitudes with subtropical monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is 1394 0 mm the precipitation is mainly concentrated from april to october accounting for about 80 of the whole year the study area is located in the north of the central area of fuzhou city with low and flat terrain surrounded by mountains in the east west and north and minjiang river in the south the inland river network is developed and the rainwater pipe network in the urban area is discharged into the inland river nearby when the region encounters heavy rainfall it also coincides with the flood of minjiang river which makes the inland river unable to drain water resulting in a sharp rise in the water level of the inland river resulting in poor drainage of the pipe network resulting in floods 2 2 methods 2 2 1 river model the river model is constructed by coupling hydrological model with 1 d hydrodynamic model for the hydrological model swmm model is used in the central urban area and probability distributed model pdm model is used in the surrounding hilly area in swmm model horton infiltration method is used to calculate the runoff yield and a non linear reservoir model is used to calculate the basin confluence and finally the basin outlet flow process is calculated hasan tanim and goharian 2020 the formula of houghton infiltration is shown in eq 1 1 f f c f 0 f c e k t where f 0 is the initial infiltration rate mm hr f c is the final limiting infiltration rate mm hr k is the coefficient of the exponential term 1 hr the calculation method of nonlinear reservoir method is shown in eqs

the probability distributed model pdm is a general purpose lumped conceptual model for continuous rainfall runoff simulation moore 2007 in the pdm model the runoff process at any position in the basin can be described by eq 4 4 q p e c s 0 p c e 0 p c e where s 0 is the initial runoff depth which is determined by the comprehensive analysis of the previous rainfall soil water storage capacity evaporation and other factors p is rainfall e is evaporation q is effective rainfall runoff the spatial distribution of soil moisture c in a basin is described by pareto cumulative distribution function as shown in eq 5 5 f c 1 1 c c max b 0 c c max where c is the soil water content in the basin cmax is the maximum soil water content and b controls the spatial distribution of soil water content finally the effective runoff q is divided into two parts surface fast response and underground slow response and the discharge process of the basin outlet is obtained by two parallel nonlinear reservoir models the river hydrodynamic is described by one dimensional saint venant equation as shown in eqs 6 and 7 and solved by preissmann implicit difference method chau and lee 1991 6 a t q x 0

browning et al 1982 cross correlation tabary 2007 and optical flow woo and wong 2017 regardless of the extrapolation method the z r relationship as shown in equation 8 is used to estimate the rainfall

rainfall characteristics 2 2 3 framework of real time rolling prediction system in this study the real time rolling prediction of river water level in the study area is constructed as shown in fig 2 the origin time is defined as the completion time of each simulation run and the interval of the origin time shows the system prediction frequency the shorter the interval is the more timely the forecast results will be updated but it will also increase the server computing load in the context of this study 30 min is considered an appropriate interval in a simulation result the series later than the time origin is called the prediction period while the series earlier than the time origin is called the review period in the review period the model is driven by observed rainfall while in the forecast period it is driven by radar rainfall because the radar rainfall prediction has the highest accuracy in a short lead time the prediction period of each simulation is selected as 2 h the review period is determined according to the simulation running interval if the review period is shorter than the running interval the continuous simulation results will not be formed and if it is too long the simulation will be repeated therefore the review period is set at 30 min in the process of real time rolling prediction initialization is only performed in the first simulation in each subsequent simulation the simulation state at the end of the review period will be stored and used as the initial state of the next simulation the simulation results of each review period will form a continuous process which is considered to be the most accurate because it is driven by observed rainfall the results of the prediction period are discontinuous which will be corrected in each new simulation to avoid cumulative errors 2 3 implementation 2 3 1 data acquisition the basic data of river section land use dem sluice pump and so on are from the supporting project stored in gis of geographic information system and the hydrological and hydrodynamic coupling model is established after manual processing in addition rain gauge and river gauge are arranged in the study area to support the project the distribution of stations selected in this study is shown in fig 1 the observed time series data are stored in the database for use by the model the rainfall prediction data of this study is from the radar rainfall prediction product of the national meteorological observatory of china which updates the rainfall process every 5 min in the next 2 h with an interval of 10 min 2 3 2 model construction and calibration infoworks icm was used in this study to build the river model which is a highly integrated model software developed by wallingford uk includes hydrological hydrodynamic water quality and other modules it has performed well in the research of planning and design risk assessment prediction and other purposes in many areas bailey et al 2019 ferguson and fenner 2020a mahmoodian et al 2018 the data of river section sluice pump reservoir and lake in the study area are processed in gis according to the corresponding format and then a one dimensional hydrodynamic model is constructed the catchments in hilly area are divided according to terrain while the catchments in urban area are divided according to underground pipe network distribution terrain and building distribution according to land use and dem the parameters of hydrological model are determined finally the hydrological model and hydrodynamic model are coupled by point inflow or line inflow to complete the river model as shown in fig 3 since the sluice pump monitoring system in the study area is under construction the observed water level is taken as the downstream boundary during the operation of the system the sluice and pump in inland river are controlled by real time control rtc rules which will adjust the next working conditions of sluice and pump according to the preset rules and the water level flow rainfall and other information at each moment in the process of model operation sun et al 2020 vermuyten et al 2018 the preset rules are written according to the local river gate and pump control regulations to ensure that the model is consistent with the actual control process in most cases in the calibration process whether the selected data is appropriate or not has a great impact on the performance of the model zheng et al 2018a in order to ensure that the model is applicable in both flood season and non flood season firstly the parameters of one dimensional hydrodynamic model are calibrated by using the historical measured data of no rainfall period and then the parameters of hydrological model are calibrated by using the observed data of several historical rainfall events 2 3 3 development of forecasting system the real time prediction system is realized by icm exchange and matlab icm exchange provides icm application programming interface api for users to call infoworks icm computing engine to perform steps operations or tasks the rainfall data are collected and preprocessed by matlab and the infoworks icm is instructed by api to calculate save or read the state and export the results at a specific time so as to implement the rolling prediction of river water level 3 results according to the hydrologic and hydrodynamic characteristics of the study area four river sections as shown in fig 1 are selected to analyze the system prediction performance section 1 is located at the confluence of xinxihe river and baimahe river section 2 is located in the middle reaches of jin anhe river section 3 is located in the middle reaches of huqianhe river section 4 is located at the confluence of tangxiexi river and jiefangxi river 3 1 performance of river model the accuracy of the river model is the premise for the system to accurately predict the river water level this section first evaluates the river water level simulation results of the hydrological hydrodynamic coupling model driven by the observed rainfall the continuous process of the river model driven by the measured rainfall in the study area can be obtained by connecting the review period of each simulation result as shown in fig 4 root mean square error rmse nash efficiency coefficient nse and kling gupta efficiency kge are used to evaluate the error of river model and the calculation formulas are shown in eqs 9 11 respectively 9 r m s e i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 n where y i obs is the observed value at time i y i sim is the simulated value at time i n is the total number of data samples rmse is used to measure the deviation between the simulated value and the observed value and its value range is 0 when its value is 0 the simulation effect is the best 10 n s e 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 where y mean is is the average of the observations n s e is used to evaluate the efficiency of the model and its value range is 1 when nse is close to 1 it means that the quality of the model is the best and the model is the most credible when nse is close to 0 it means that the simulation results are close to the average level of the observed values that is the overall results are credible but the process simulation error is large when nse is far less than 0 the model is not credible 11 k g e 1 r 1 2 Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between simulated and observed values Œ± is the ratio of the standard deviation of the simulated value to the standard deviation of the observed value Œ≤ is the ratio between the mean simulated and mean observed values the closer the value of kge is to 1 the better the performance of the model it can be seen from fig 4 and table 1 that rmse values of the four sections are all lower than 0 1 nse values are about 0 8 and kge are 0 7129 0 9154 0 5723 and 0 9057 respectively which indicates that the river model can well reflect the water level change process of urban river among them the water levels of section 1 section 2 and section 3 are affected by the diversion pumping station and the downstream tide level at the same time and the water level fluctuates greatly during the rainfall period the water level also fluctuates in varying degrees while the section 4 is located in the downstream of the surrounding hilly area the water level is maintained by the landscape weir and the minimum basic flow and the water level is almost unchanged only obvious fluctuation occurs during the rainfall 3 2 performance of radar rainfall in a rainstorm process rainfall is one of the main driving factors of river water level changes an accurate rainfall prediction model is vital for the real time river water level prediction system in this section the overall performance of radar rainfall prediction in the study area is evaluated according to the distribution of rain gauge the study area is divided into thiessen polygon and the weighted average value of area at each time is calculated as the observed average rainfall process in the study area the predicted average rainfall process in the study area is obtained by averaging the simulation results of each radar grid the comparison between the predicted and observed values of the average rainfall process in the study area is shown in fig 5 and the average total rainfall during prediction period of each simulation 2 h is shown in fig 6 pod far and csi are selected to evaluate the performance of radar rainfall prediction as shown in table 2 yes or no indicates whether rainfall occurs at the designated station hit indicates that a gauge with observed rainfall is correctly predicted false alarms indicates that a gauge with no observed rainfall is predicted rainfall miss indicates that a gauge with observed rainfall are predicted to have no rainfall none indicates that no rainfall is observed or predicted at a station in general hit and none indicate that the prediction is correct while false alarms and miss indicate that it is wrong due to the rolling forecast method there will be multiple radar forecast rainfall values from different origin times at a time and each forecast value will be used as a sample for evaluation based on the above table the scores of pod far and ets can be calculated as shown in eqs 12 13 and 14 respectively 12 p o d h i t s h i t s m i s s e s pod defines the ratio of successful prediction samples to all observed rainfall samples which is also called hit rate pod values range is 0 1 and the closer the pod value is to 1 the better the prediction performance is 13 f a r f a l s e a l a r m s h i t s f a l s e a l a r m s far is defined as the ratio of false forecast to all forecast rainfall and its value range is 0 1 the closer the value of far is to 0 the better the forecast performance 14 e t s h i t s h i t random h i t s f a l s e a l a r m s m i s s e s h i t random 15 hit random h i t s m i s s e s h i t s f a l s e a l a r m s m i s s e s n o n e ets represents the comprehensive forecast performance of the model e t s values range is 1 3 1 and a value of 1 indicates that the forecast is perfect according to the distribution of 29 rain gauges in the study area and the tyson polygon corresponding to each rain gauge the average radar rainfall of each tyson polygon is calculated as the predicted value of the rain gauge each forecast rainfall process rainfall process every 10 min in the next 2 h and total rainfall total rainfall in the next 2 h are evaluated respectively the scores calculated by the above methods are shown in table 3 it can be seen that radar rainfall prediction has a high hit rate but due to the high false alarm rate the prediction efficiency of the model is not perfect this means that for most rainfall events the prediction model can give early warning but there are also a large number of prediction model early warning events without rainfall in engineering application the loss of missing report of rainfall events is far greater than that of false report so it is considered acceptable the prediction performance of radar rainfall for total value is better than that of process prediction the pod for total rainfall is 0 7658 while that for rainfall process is 0 2929 3 3 case study of real time rolling prediction the system described in section 2 2 3 was tested during the whole research period three typical cases in the study period are selected to analysis the real time rolling prediction of river water level among them case 1 is the scene of almost no rainfall case 2 is the short term heavy rainfall and case 3 is the long term light rainfall the results of these three cases are shown in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 respectively due to the rolling prediction method there will be multiple predicted values from different origin times at one time in order to evaluate the overall error of radar rainfall compared with observed rainfall the total rainfall is calculated as the total rainfall after averaging these values the calculation method of rmse and nse is changed to eqs 16 and 17 to evaluate the performance of rolling prediction similarly the parameters in eq 11 can also be calculated according to the overall situation of the simulation result sets the calculation results of the three cases are shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 respectively 16 r m s e i 1 j 1 n m y i obs y i j sim 2 n 17 n s e 1 i 1 n m y i obs y i j sim 2 i 1 j 1 n m y i obs y mean 2 where y i j sim is the simulation result at time i in the j th simulation n is the number of results in a simulation m is the total number of simulation runs the meaning of other parameters is the same as that in eqs 9 and 10 3 3 1 case 1 this case is from 00 00 on september 18 to 00 00 on september 21 during which there was continuous cloudy day and short duration light rain occurred in some areas it can be seen from fig 7 and table 4 due to the large rainfall risk the total amount of radar rainfall is far greater than the observed rainfall the calculated water level of the model driven by the observed rainfall is in well agreement with the observed water level for the calculation results of radar rainfall driven model the prediction of water level in some periods deviates due to the different errors between radar rainfall and observed rainfall in different areas but this error will be corrected with the arrival of new observed rainfall in the next simulation in the application scenario the development trend of water level can be given according to the real time updated forecast rainfall which can evaluate the corresponding risk and provide some reference for decision makers in the period of no rainfall section 1 section 2 and section 3 are affected by the diversion of pumping station and the tide water level of downstream at the same time and the water level fluctuates up and down every day section 4 is located in the northern hilly area and its water level is maintained by landscape weir and low foundation flow which is relatively stable and only rises during rainfall 3 3 2 case 2 this case is from 12 00 on may 16 2020 to 03 00 on may 17 2020 according to the observed rainfall the rainfall started at 17 20 and the main rainfall process is about 2 h the total rainfall of the catchment basin where the four river sections are located is 69 32 mm 65 74 mm 38 75 mm and 52 17 mm respectively which belongs to short duration heavy rainfall the total value of radar rainfall is 65 74 mm 72 47 mm 64 42 mm and 60 12 mm respectively compared with the observed rainfall although the rainfall process is different the time of rainfall peak is more consistent in the whole prediction process the water level prediction results of the four sections are different and there are different degrees of deviation in each simulation for the observed rainfall driven model section 1 section 2 and section 4 perform better in water level prediction the rmse is 0 1648 0 0511 00659 nse is 0 8027 0 9798 0 8145 and kge is 0 7489 0 9642 0 8592 respectively while section 3 perform not well which is due to the inconsistency between the rtc rules preset by the model and the actual control process when the rainfall occurs the water diversion pumping station has stopped so the water level observation value is lower than the simulation value for the simulation driven by radar rainfall the prediction accuracy of the four sections is reduced to varying degrees rmse is 0 1872 0 0782 0 2723 0 1006 nse is 0 7545 0 9627 1 1008 0 5630 and kge is 0 7254 0 9769 0 6001 0 7847 respectively 3 3 3 case 3 this case is from 08 00 on september 8 to 06 00 on september 9 2020 according to the observed rainfall data there was continuous light rain in the study area during the whole case period and the total rainfall of the four sections was 29 23 mm 33 48 mm 65 25 mm and 59 33 mm respectively the total value of radar rainfall is 42 45 mm 43 05 mm 44 60 mm and 46 89 mm respectively radar rainfall prediction performance is not good did not predict the peak rainfall for the observed rainfall driven river model the four sections all performed well for the radar rainfall driven model section 3 has a large error in which nse is only 0 3267 combined with the first two cases it can be seen that section 1 and section 2 are wide and the water level rises slowly during rainfall while section 3 and section 4 are narrower and the response of water level to rainfall is rapid and strong comparing the changes of nse it can be seen that for the section with stronger response the rainfall error will be enlarged the nse will be reduced significantly otherwise the error will be reduced 3 4 process of real time rolling prediction case 2 is selected to further analyze the whole rolling simulation process a total of 6 simulations were run between 17 00 and 20 00 during the peak rainfall period the simulated radar rainfall was compared with the observed rainfall and the simulated water level driven by the observed rainfall and the simulated water level driven by the radar rainfall model were compared with the observed water level as shown in fig 10 and table 7 in fig 10 in order to identify the results of each simulation opaque lines and marks represent the prediction of the simulation and the translucent part represents after the prediction period it can be seen that there are different errors between radar rainfall and observed rainfall at different time and accordingly the prediction of water level also shows different degrees of deviation the rain began to be observed at 17 20 in the early stage of the rainfall the occurrence of rainfall was not predicted in the simulation of 17 00 and 17 30 so the rise of water level was not accurately predicted which led to the low prediction result of water level in the simulation of 18 00 the predicted rainfall of section 1 2 and 3 is much larger than the observation and the predicted water level is higher than the observation on the contrary the predicted water level of section 4 is lower than the observation in the simulation of 18 30 the observed and predicted water levels have a peak value and each section has achieved good prediction results at the end of rainfall the water level of each section began to decrease in the simulation of 19 00 and 19 30 there was almost no rainfall in the actual measurement although the radar rainfall had false alarm to some extent the trend of water level decline was also predicted successfully 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy of hydrodynamic model when using the real time prediction system proposed in this study to predict the water level in real time a reliable hydrodynamic model is an important guarantee for the accuracy of the system prediction on the one hand the water level change trend of each prediction is obtained according to the river model on the other hand an accurate initial state is an important condition for the accuracy of this prediction in this system the initial state of each simulation is calculated and generated by the observed rainfall driving model before this time before the next simulation a new observation correction model state is connected again to avoid the cumulative error caused by rainfall prediction deviation the accuracy of the river model needs to consider both rainfall and non rainfall scenarios in this study area a variety of hydraulic facilities including water diversion pump station drainage pump station landscape weir landscape gate tide gate and so on were constructed in the urban area to ensure the ecological water level and water quality even in the non rainfall period the river water level in the urban area fluctuates greatly so the parameters of relevant model elements should be adjusted and calibrated according to the data in the non rainfall period during the rainfall period the rainfall process is one of the main factors affecting the water level process based on the adjustment of the above parameters the parameters of runoff generation and confluence in the catchment area should be adjusted according to the data during the rainfall period to ensure the accuracy of the model 4 2 necessity of real time rolling prediction due to the significant influence of natural factors such as rainfall and tide level and engineering control factors such as gate and pump station the prediction of urban river water level is highly uncertain in this case study as shown in section 3 1 the constructed model can provide sufficiently accurate simulation results in the review of historical events based on complete and accurate boundary conditions such as rainfall however in real time prediction it is difficult to obtain complete and accurate boundary conditions of events the model can only be calculated based on the most accurate conditions available at the current time perhaps the model calculates and completes a prediction based on the most accurate conditions available at the current time however with the passage of time the boundary conditions such as rainfall have changed and the prediction results are no longer applicable although this time is still in the prediction period of this prediction the prediction results should also be updated according to the latest observed and predicted data when the rolling prediction framework in section 2 2 3 is applied to the real time prediction of river water level each simulation is divided into review period and prediction period during the review period the observed data are input into the model for simulation which will form a baseline which is considered accurate enough to review the history and provide the initial state for the forecast in the forecast period the latest observed rainfall and radar rainfall will be input into the model for prediction these results may deviate from the baseline but will be corrected in the next forecast effectively prevents the accumulation of errors caused by continuous simulation as can be seen from section 3 3 compared with observed rainfall when radar rainfall is input into the prediction system the simulation performance is slightly reduced which is inevitable however this effectively extends the prediction period of two hours and the accuracy is acceptable which is enough to provide reference for dispatching decision making 4 3 influence of rainfall prediction error on water level prediction radar rainfall prediction can give a rainfall process curve in each simulation which is the main driving factor of river model during rainfall and its accuracy directly affects the performance of system prediction from the analysis in section 3 2 it can be seen that the prediction of rainfall process is difficult to achieve complete accuracy and the accuracy of the total amount of rainfall for each simulation is higher than that of rainfall process prediction it can be seen from the results in section 3 3 that the water level change process in the next 2 h can be given by each operation of the system although it is difficult to achieve complete consistency of the process the prediction of the water level change trend and peak value is more accurate the rainfall error has different effects on each river section for the sections with strong response to rainfall the error will be enlarged otherwise the error will be reduced due to the fast rolling update of the prediction results on the whole the peak time of water level can be guaranteed within 1 h this is enough to provide some early warning information for relevant institutions and provide reference for decision makers 4 4 applicable scenarios of prediction system in coastal areas the risk of urban inland river flood mainly comes from typhoon rainfall and short term imminent rainstorm for typhoon rainfall the relevant units can receive early warning information and deploy response in advance within a long time so as to reduce the water level of reservoir lake and river in advance due to the short period of radar rainfall prediction the system can not predict the medium and long term water level so other rainfall prediction methods should be considered for short term impending rainstorm it is difficult for relevant departments to deploy in advance the prediction system can give the trend of water level in the next two hours according to the short term and impending radar prediction through the prediction results it can judge the area with high probability of disaster occurrence in advance and predict the trend and degree of disaster occurrence which is of great significance for temporary deployment and dispatching 4 5 defects and future development of forecasting system this study discusses and analyzes the application of radar rainfall in real time prediction of river water level and constructs a rolling prediction operation mode but there are still some shortcomings on the one hand the monitoring equipment of sluice pump condition along the river in the study area is not perfect on the other hand this study focuses on the application of rainfall prediction in real time prediction of river water level therefore the prediction of downstream sluice pump and tide level has not been added and the observed water level is used in the downstream instead in the future work the historical data should be used to further calibrate the gate and pump in the hydrodynamic model and access to the measured monitoring information for the control process of gate pump in predictive scenario manual input current time extension pre defined scheduling rules and other methods can be adopted and their advantages and disadvantages are further studied and analyzed respectively in addition a high precision tide level prediction model is needed to provide boundary conditions for the model finally the prediction results such as water level curve and section warning information are formed according to the model calculation results the complete real time prediction system framework is shown in the fig 11 5 conclusion according to the characteristics of rapid and strong response of urban river to rainfall a real time rolling prediction system of river water level is proposed based on radar rainfall prediction and hydrological hydrodynamic coupling model based on the observation data of fuzhou city from april 1 to october 1 2020 the accuracy of river model and radar rainfall prediction products were evaluated the performance of the prediction system is evaluated by using the latest observed rainfall and radar rainfall driven model available at each historical moment which fills the gap in the operational operation of the river water level prediction system the main conclusions are as follows 1 the accuracy of the river model is high which can reflect the daily change of river water level and the change process during rainfall during the whole study period the rmse of the four river sections was 0 0887 0 0951 0 0863 and 0 0113 the nse was 0 8145 0 8085 0 7804 and 0 8361 and the kge was 0 7129 0 9154 0 5723 and 0 9057 respectively the radar rainfall product performs well and the accuracy of total rainfall is higher than that of rainfall process 2 the real time prediction system adopts the rolling operation mode obtains the latest model state by continuously accessing the latest observed rainfall and obtains the latest radar forecast rainfall in each simulation to predict the future river hydrodynamic process thus the forecast period is prolonged and the accumulated error caused by rainfall prediction error is avoided 3 the error of prediction system is affected by radar rainfall and river model compared with the observed rainfall driven model the prediction accuracy of radar rainfall driven river model decreases in different cases for the river section with strong response to rainfall the water level prediction error caused by radar rainfall error will be enlarged otherwise the error will be reduced the system can predict the trend of water level change accurately the error of peak water level is within 0 3 m and the error of peak time is within 1 h it can provide timely and detailed water level forecast for the relevant personnel which is crucial for the assessment and reduction of flood risk and the formulation of detailed emergency response plan

progress in the application of river models in different regions chatterjee et al 2008 kim et al 2012 li et al 2021 paiva et al 2011 a complete channel model generally consists of two parts which are a hydrological model used to calculate the source of flood generated by rainfall and a hydrodynamic model used to effectively simulate the flow process of river network ming et al 2020 the previous prediction of river level mainly uses the rainfall process observed by the rain gauge as boundary conditions to drive the hydrological hydrodynamic model to simulate the water level and flow of the river section speight et al 2021 when the time of rainwater confluence and flow to the target section is longer than the total time of data collection and simulation the process of water level can be predicted in advance this method has high accuracy but it is only suitable for natural areas with large area and long response time in the urban area the catchment area is small and the confluence distance is short in addition the construction of the underlying surface of urbanization and underground pipeline also accelerates the rainwater confluence speed resulting in the short response time of river water level to rainfall flack et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 speight et al 2021 therefore using the observed rainfall driven model to predict the river water level the lead time is relatively short which can not meet the actual requirements therefore in the recent studies the rainfall prediction model is applied to the river water level prediction using the predicted rainfall as the boundary condition to drive the hydrological hydrodynamic model for calculation which significantly improves the forecast period of the results cuo et al 2011 demeritt et al 2007 kim et al 2021 ming et al 2020 radar echo extrapolation radar rainfall and numerical weather prediction nwp are common methods for rainfall prediction a number of studies have shown that the speed of rainfall prediction by radar echo extrapolation is fast and it performs best in a very short forecast period 1 2 h but with the increase of the lead time the accuracy decreases rapidly yu et al 2015 nwp performs better in a longer encounter period but its calculation speed is slow and the results are not reliable in the early stage of forecast davies et al 2005 according to the characteristics of different rainstorm scenarios both methods have been widely used in urban flood forecasting adams and dymond 2019 saleh et al 2017 due to the high uncertainty of temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall zheng et al 2018b usually in a rainfall event lasting for several hours the decision making of urban river regulation is a rolling process decision makers will take corresponding emergency measures according to the latest water level rainfall and other information available at each time xu et al 2020 therefore the rolling prediction method should also be used in the real time prediction of river water level in the operation according to the updated boundary conditions at the current time the latest water level prediction results are updated in real time at present the research on real time prediction of river water level is less and the research on rolling prediction in operation has not been reported this study presents a case study of an urban river water level real time prediction system fuzhou city is selected as the study area and the river model of the study area is constructed based on hydrological and hydrodynamic according to the characteristics of the study area a real time rolling prediction system of river water level is proposed based on radar rainfall the accuracy of river model radar rainfall and prediction system from april 1 to october 1 2020 are evaluated and discussed in detail the constructed real time rolling prediction system can provide scheduling basis for local decision makers in addition the construction of the system completely considers the complete urban river water circulation process including rainfall runoff generation confluence river hydrodynamics hydraulic regulation engineering and tide level by rolling prediction the uncertainty of prediction is effectively reduced and the error accumulation caused by continuous simulation is prevented which provides a reference for the construction of urban river water level prediction system in other regions 2 data and methods 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 fuzhou city is located in fujian province the southeast coast of china with 119 17 18 e and 26 04 08 n fuzhou is located in the middle and low latitudes with subtropical monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is 1394 0 mm the precipitation is mainly concentrated from april to october accounting for about 80 of the whole year the study area is located in the north of the central area of fuzhou city with low and flat terrain surrounded by mountains in the east west and north and minjiang river in the south the inland river network is developed and the rainwater pipe network in the urban area is discharged into the inland river nearby when the region encounters heavy rainfall it also coincides with the flood of minjiang river which makes the inland river unable to drain water resulting in a sharp rise in the water level of the inland river resulting in poor drainage of the pipe network resulting in floods 2 2 methods 2 2 1 river model the river model is constructed by coupling hydrological model with 1 d hydrodynamic model for the hydrological model swmm model is used in the central urban area and probability distributed model pdm model is used in the surrounding hilly area in swmm model horton infiltration method is used to calculate the runoff yield and a non linear reservoir model is used to calculate the basin confluence and finally the basin outlet flow process is calculated hasan tanim and goharian 2020 the formula of houghton infiltration is shown in eq 1 1 f f c f 0 f c e k t where f 0 is the

the probability distributed model pdm is a general purpose lumped conceptual model for continuous rainfall runoff simulation moore 2007 in the pdm model the runoff process at any position in the basin can be described by eq 4 4 q p e c s 0 p c e 0 p c e where s 0 is the initial runoff depth which is determined by the comprehensive analysis of the previous rainfall soil water storage capacity evaporation and other factors p is rainfall e is evaporation q is effective rainfall runoff the spatial distribution of soil moisture c in a basin is described by pareto cumulative distribution function as shown in eq 5 5 f c 1 1 c c max b 0 c c max where c is the soil water content in the basin cmax is the maximum soil water content and b controls the spatial distribution of soil water content finally the effective runoff q is divided into two parts surface fast response and underground slow response and the discharge process of the basin outlet is obtained by two parallel nonlinear reservoir models the river hydrodynamic is described by one dimensional saint venant equation as shown in eqs 6 and 7 and solved by preissmann implicit difference method chau and lee 1991 6 a t q x 0

browning et al 1982 cross correlation tabary 2007 and optical flow woo and wong 2017 regardless of the extrapolation method the z r relationship as shown in equation 8 is used to estimate the rainfall

rainfall characteristics 2 2 3 framework of real time rolling prediction system in this study the real time rolling prediction of river water level in the study area is constructed as shown in fig 2 the origin time is defined as the completion time of each simulation run and the interval of the origin time shows the system prediction frequency the shorter the interval is the more timely the forecast results will be updated but it will also increase the server computing load in the context of this study 30 min is considered an appropriate interval in a simulation result the series later than the time origin is called the prediction period while the series earlier than the time origin is called the review period in the review period the model is driven by observed rainfall while in the forecast period it is driven by radar rainfall because the radar rainfall prediction has the highest accuracy in a short lead time the prediction period of each simulation is selected as 2 h the review period is determined according to the simulation running interval if the review period is shorter than the running interval the continuous simulation results will not be formed and if it is too long the simulation will be repeated therefore the review period is set at 30 min in the process of real time rolling prediction initialization is only performed in the first simulation in each subsequent simulation the simulation state at the end of the review period will be stored and used as the initial state of the next simulation the simulation results of each review period will form a continuous process which is considered to be the most accurate because it is driven by observed rainfall the results of the prediction period are discontinuous which will be corrected in each new simulation to avoid cumulative errors 2 3 implementation 2 3 1 data acquisition the basic data of river section land use dem sluice pump and so on are from the supporting project stored in gis of geographic information system and the hydrological and hydrodynamic coupling model is established after manual processing in addition rain gauge and river gauge are arranged in the study area to support the project the distribution of stations selected in this study is shown in fig 1 the observed time series data are stored in the database for use by the model the rainfall prediction data of this study is from the radar rainfall prediction product of the national meteorological observatory of china which updates the rainfall process every 5 min in the next 2 h with an interval of 10 min 2 3 2 model construction and calibration infoworks icm was used in this study to build the river model which is a highly integrated model software developed by wallingford uk includes hydrological hydrodynamic water quality and other modules it has performed well in the research of planning and design risk assessment prediction and other purposes in many areas bailey et al 2019 ferguson and fenner 2020a mahmoodian et al 2018 the data of river section sluice pump reservoir and lake in the study area are processed in gis according to the corresponding format and then a one dimensional hydrodynamic model is constructed the catchments in hilly area are divided according to terrain while the catchments in urban area are divided according to underground pipe network distribution terrain and building distribution according to land use and dem the parameters of hydrological model are determined finally the hydrological model and hydrodynamic model are coupled by point inflow or line inflow to complete the river model as shown in fig 3 since the sluice pump monitoring system in the study area is under construction the observed water level is taken as the downstream boundary during the operation of the system the sluice and pump in inland river are controlled by real time control rtc rules which will adjust the next working conditions of sluice and pump according to the preset rules and the water level flow rainfall and other information at each moment in the process of model operation sun et al 2020 vermuyten et al 2018 the preset rules are written according to the local river gate and pump control regulations to ensure that the model is consistent with the actual control process in most cases in the calibration process whether the selected data is appropriate or not has a great impact on the performance of the model zheng et al 2018a in order to ensure that the model is applicable in both flood season and non flood season firstly the parameters of one dimensional hydrodynamic model are calibrated by using the historical measured data of no rainfall period and then the parameters of hydrological model are calibrated by using the observed data of several historical rainfall events 2 3 3 development of forecasting system the real time prediction system is realized by icm exchange and matlab icm exchange provides icm application programming interface api for users to call infoworks icm computing engine to perform steps operations or tasks the rainfall data are collected and preprocessed by matlab and the infoworks icm is instructed by api to calculate save or read the state and export the results at a specific time so as to implement the rolling prediction of river water level 3 results according to the hydrologic and hydrodynamic characteristics of the study area four river sections as shown in fig 1 are selected to analyze the system prediction performance section 1 is located at the confluence of xinxihe river and baimahe river section 2 is located in the middle reaches of jin anhe river section 3 is located in the middle reaches of huqianhe river section 4 is located at the confluence of tangxiexi river and jiefangxi river 3 1 performance of river model the accuracy of the river model is the premise for the system to accurately predict the river water level this section first evaluates the river water level simulation results of the hydrological hydrodynamic coupling model driven by the observed rainfall the continuous process of the river model driven by the measured rainfall in the study area can be obtained by connecting the review period of each simulation result as shown in fig 4 root mean square error rmse nash efficiency coefficient nse and kling gupta efficiency kge are used to evaluate the error of river model and the calculation formulas are shown in eqs 9 11 respectively 9 r m s e i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 n where y i obs is the observed value at time i y i sim is the simulated value at time i n is the total number of data samples rmse is used to measure the deviation between the simulated value and the observed value and its value range is 0 when its value is 0 the simulation effect is the best 10 n s e 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 where y mean is is the average of the observations n s e is used to evaluate the efficiency of the model and its value range is 1 when nse is close to 1 it means that the quality of the model is the best and the model is the most credible when nse is close to 0 it means that the simulation results are close to the average level of the observed values that is the overall results are credible but the process simulation error is large when nse is far less than 0 the model is not credible 11 k g e 1 r 1 2 Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between simulated and observed values Œ± is the ratio of the standard deviation of the simulated value to the standard deviation of the observed value Œ≤ is the ratio between the mean simulated and mean observed values the closer the value of kge is to 1 the better the performance of the model it can be seen from fig 4 and table 1 that rmse values of the four sections are all lower than 0 1 nse values are about 0 8 and kge are 0 7129 0 9154 0 5723 and 0 9057 respectively which indicates that the river model can well reflect the water level change process of urban river among them the water levels of section 1 section 2 and section 3 are affected by the diversion pumping station and the downstream tide level at the same time and the water level fluctuates greatly during the rainfall period the water level also fluctuates in varying degrees while the section 4 is located in the downstream of the surrounding hilly area the water level is maintained by the landscape weir and the minimum basic flow and the water level is almost unchanged only obvious fluctuation occurs during the rainfall 3 2 performance of radar rainfall in a rainstorm process rainfall is one of the main driving factors of river water level changes an accurate rainfall prediction model is vital for the real time river water level prediction system in this section the overall performance of radar rainfall prediction in the study area is evaluated according to the distribution of rain gauge the study area is divided into thiessen polygon and the weighted average value of area at each time is calculated as the observed average rainfall process in the study area the predicted average rainfall process in the study area is obtained by averaging the simulation results of each radar grid the comparison between the predicted and observed values of the average rainfall process in the study area is shown in fig 5 and the average total rainfall during prediction period of each simulation 2 h is shown in fig 6 pod far and csi are selected to evaluate the performance of radar rainfall prediction as shown in table 2 yes or no indicates whether rainfall occurs at the designated station hit indicates that a gauge with observed rainfall is correctly predicted false alarms indicates that a gauge with no observed rainfall is predicted rainfall miss indicates that a gauge with observed rainfall are predicted to have no rainfall none indicates that no rainfall is observed or predicted at a station in general hit and none indicate that the prediction is correct while false alarms and miss indicate that it is wrong due to the rolling forecast method there will be multiple radar forecast rainfall values from different origin times at a time and each forecast value will be used as a sample for evaluation based on the above table the scores of pod far and ets can be calculated as shown in eqs 12 13 and 14 respectively 12 p o d h i t s h i t s m i s s e s pod defines the ratio of successful prediction samples to all observed rainfall samples which is also called hit rate pod values range is 0 1 and the closer the pod value is to 1 the better the prediction performance is 13 f a r f a l s e a l a r m s h i t s f a l s e a l a r m s far is defined as the ratio of false forecast to all forecast rainfall and its value range is 0 1 the closer the value of far is to 0 the better the forecast performance 14 e t s h i t s h i t random h i t s f a l s e a l a r m s m i s s e s h i t random 15 hit random h i t s m i s s e s h i t s f a l s e a l a r m s m i s s e s n o n e ets represents the comprehensive forecast performance of the model e t s values range is 1 3 1 and a value of 1 indicates that the forecast is perfect according to the distribution of 29 rain gauges in the study area and the tyson polygon corresponding to each rain gauge the average radar rainfall of each tyson polygon is calculated as the predicted value of the rain gauge each forecast rainfall process rainfall process every 10 min in the next 2 h and total rainfall total rainfall in the next 2 h are evaluated respectively the scores calculated by the above methods are shown in table 3 it can be seen that radar rainfall prediction has a high hit rate but due to the high false alarm rate the prediction efficiency of the model is not perfect this means that for most rainfall events the prediction model can give early warning but there are also a large number of prediction model early warning events without rainfall in engineering application the loss of missing report of rainfall events is far greater than that of false report so it is considered acceptable the prediction performance of radar rainfall for total value is better than that of process prediction the pod for total rainfall is 0 7658 while that for rainfall process is 0 2929 3 3 case study of real time rolling prediction the system described in section 2 2 3 was tested during the whole research period three typical cases in the study period are selected to analysis the real time rolling prediction of river water level among them case 1 is the scene of almost no rainfall case 2 is the short term heavy rainfall and case 3 is the long term light rainfall the results of these three cases are shown in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 respectively due to the rolling prediction method there will be multiple predicted values from different origin times at one time in order to evaluate the overall error of radar rainfall compared with observed rainfall the total rainfall is calculated as the total rainfall after averaging these values the calculation method of rmse and nse is changed to eqs 16 and 17 to evaluate the performance of rolling prediction similarly the parameters in eq 11 can also be calculated according to the overall situation of the simulation result sets the calculation results of the three cases are shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 respectively 16 r m s e i 1 j 1 n m y i obs y i j sim 2 n 17 n s e 1 i 1 n m y i obs y i j sim 2 i 1 j 1 n m y i obs y mean 2 where y i j sim is the simulation result at time i in the j th simulation n is the number of results in a simulation m is the total number of simulation runs the meaning of other parameters is the same as that in eqs 9 and 10 3 3 1 case 1 this case is from 00 00 on september 18 to 00 00 on september 21 during which there was continuous cloudy day and short duration light rain occurred in some areas it can be seen from fig 7 and table 4 due to the large rainfall risk the total amount of radar rainfall is far greater than the observed rainfall the calculated water level of the model driven by the observed rainfall is in well agreement with the observed water level for the calculation results of radar rainfall driven model the prediction of water level in some periods deviates due to the different errors between radar rainfall and observed rainfall in different areas but this error will be corrected with the arrival of new observed rainfall in the next simulation in the application scenario the development trend of water level can be given according to the real time updated forecast rainfall which can evaluate the corresponding risk and provide some reference for decision makers in the period of no rainfall section 1 section 2 and section 3 are affected by the diversion of pumping station and the tide water level of downstream at the same time and the water level fluctuates up and down every day section 4 is located in the northern hilly area and its water level is maintained by landscape weir and low foundation flow which is relatively stable and only rises during rainfall 3 3 2 case 2 this case is from 12 00 on may 16 2020 to 03 00 on may 17 2020 according to the observed rainfall the rainfall started at 17 20 and the main rainfall process is about 2 h the total rainfall of the catchment basin where the four river sections are located is 69 32 mm 65 74 mm 38 75 mm and 52 17 mm respectively which belongs to short duration heavy rainfall the total value of radar rainfall is 65 74 mm 72 47 mm 64 42 mm and 60 12 mm respectively compared with the observed rainfall although the rainfall process is different the time of rainfall peak is more consistent in the whole prediction process the water level prediction results of the four sections are different and there are different degrees of deviation in each simulation for the observed rainfall driven model section 1 section 2 and section 4 perform better in water level prediction the rmse is 0 1648 0 0511 00659 nse is 0 8027 0 9798 0 8145 and kge is 0 7489 0 9642 0 8592 respectively while section 3 perform not well which is due to the inconsistency between the rtc rules preset by the model and the actual control process when the rainfall occurs the water diversion pumping station has stopped so the water level observation value is lower than the simulation value for the simulation driven by radar rainfall the prediction accuracy of the four sections is reduced to varying degrees rmse is 0 1872 0 0782 0 2723 0 1006 nse is 0 7545 0 9627 1 1008 0 5630 and kge is 0 7254 0 9769 0 6001 0 7847 respectively 3 3 3 case 3 this case is from 08 00 on september 8 to 06 00 on september 9 2020 according to the observed rainfall data there was continuous light rain in the study area during the whole case period and the total rainfall of the four sections was 29 23 mm 33 48 mm 65 25 mm and 59 33 mm respectively the total value of radar rainfall is 42 45 mm 43 05 mm 44 60 mm and 46 89 mm respectively radar rainfall prediction performance is not good did not predict the peak rainfall for the observed rainfall driven river model the four sections all performed well for the radar rainfall driven model section 3 has a large error in which nse is only 0 3267 combined with the first two cases it can be seen that section 1 and section 2 are wide and the water level rises slowly during rainfall while section 3 and section 4 are narrower and the response of water level to rainfall is rapid and strong comparing the changes of nse it can be seen that for the section with stronger response the rainfall error will be enlarged the nse will be reduced significantly otherwise the error will be reduced 3 4 process of real time rolling prediction case 2 is selected to further analyze the whole rolling simulation process a total of 6 simulations were run between 17 00 and 20 00 during the peak rainfall period the simulated radar rainfall was compared with the observed rainfall and the simulated water level driven by the observed rainfall and the simulated water level driven by the radar rainfall model were compared with the observed water level as shown in fig 10 and table 7 in fig 10 in order to identify the results of each simulation opaque lines and marks represent the prediction of the simulation and the translucent part represents after the prediction period it can be seen that there are different errors between radar rainfall and observed rainfall at different time and accordingly the prediction of water level also shows different degrees of deviation the rain began to be observed at 17 20 in the early stage of the rainfall the occurrence of rainfall was not predicted in the simulation of 17 00 and 17 30 so the rise of water level was not accurately predicted which led to the low prediction result of water level in the simulation of 18 00 the predicted rainfall of section 1 2 and 3 is much larger than the observation and the predicted water level is higher than the observation on the contrary the predicted water level of section 4 is lower than the observation in the simulation of 18 30 the observed and predicted water levels have a peak value and each section has achieved good prediction results at the end of rainfall the water level of each section began to decrease in the simulation of 19 00 and 19 30 there was almost no rainfall in the actual measurement although the radar rainfall had false alarm to some extent the trend of water level decline was also predicted successfully 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy of hydrodynamic model when using the real time prediction system proposed in this study to predict the water level in real time a reliable hydrodynamic model is an important guarantee for the accuracy of the system prediction on the one hand the water level change trend of each prediction is obtained according to the river model on the other hand an accurate initial state is an important condition for the accuracy of this prediction in this system the initial state of each simulation is calculated and generated by the observed rainfall driving model before this time before the next simulation a new observation correction model state is connected again to avoid the cumulative error caused by rainfall prediction deviation the accuracy of the river model needs to consider both rainfall and non rainfall scenarios in this study area a variety of hydraulic facilities including water diversion pump station drainage pump station landscape weir landscape gate tide gate and so on were constructed in the urban area to ensure the ecological water level and water quality even in the non rainfall period the river water level in the urban area fluctuates greatly so the parameters of relevant model elements should be adjusted and calibrated according to the data in the non rainfall period during the rainfall period the rainfall process is one of the main factors affecting the water level process based on the adjustment of the above parameters the parameters of runoff generation and confluence in the catchment area should be adjusted according to the data during the rainfall period to ensure the accuracy of the model 4 2 necessity of real time rolling prediction due to the significant influence of natural factors such as rainfall and tide level and engineering control factors such as gate and pump station the prediction of urban river water level is highly uncertain in this case study as shown in section 3 1 the constructed model can provide sufficiently accurate simulation results in the review of historical events based on complete and accurate boundary conditions such as rainfall however in real time prediction it is difficult to obtain complete and accurate boundary conditions of events the model can only be calculated based on the most accurate conditions available at the current time perhaps the model calculates and completes a prediction based on the most accurate conditions available at the current time however with the passage of time the boundary conditions such as rainfall have changed and the prediction results are no longer applicable although this time is still in the prediction period of this prediction the prediction results should also be updated according to the latest observed and predicted data when the rolling prediction framework in section 2 2 3 is applied to the real time prediction of river water level each simulation is divided into review period and prediction period during the review period the observed data are input into the model for simulation which will form a baseline which is considered accurate enough to review the history and provide the initial state for the forecast in the forecast period the latest observed rainfall and radar rainfall will be input into the model for prediction these results may deviate from the baseline but will be corrected in the next forecast effectively prevents the accumulation of errors caused by continuous simulation as can be seen from section 3 3 compared with observed rainfall when radar rainfall is input into the prediction system the simulation performance is slightly reduced which is inevitable however this effectively extends the prediction period of two hours and the accuracy is acceptable which is enough to provide reference for dispatching decision making 4 3 influence of rainfall prediction error on water level prediction radar rainfall prediction can give a rainfall process curve in each simulation which is the main driving factor of river model during rainfall and its accuracy directly affects the performance of system prediction from the analysis in section 3 2 it can be seen that the prediction of rainfall process is difficult to achieve complete accuracy and the accuracy of the total amount of rainfall for each simulation is higher than that of rainfall process prediction it can be seen from the results in section 3 3 that the water level change process in the next 2 h can be given by each operation of the system although it is difficult to achieve complete consistency of the process the prediction of the water level change trend and peak value is more accurate the rainfall error has different effects on each river section for the sections with strong response to rainfall the error will be enlarged otherwise the error will be reduced due to the fast rolling update of the prediction results on the whole the peak time of water level can be guaranteed within 1 h this is enough to provide some early warning information for relevant institutions and provide reference for decision makers 4 4 applicable scenarios of prediction system in coastal areas the risk of urban inland river flood mainly comes from typhoon rainfall and short term imminent rainstorm for typhoon rainfall the relevant units can receive early warning information and deploy response in advance within a long time so as to reduce the water level of reservoir lake and river in advance due to the short period of radar rainfall prediction the system can not predict the medium and long term water level so other rainfall prediction methods should be considered for short term impending rainstorm it is difficult for relevant departments to deploy in advance the prediction system can give the trend of water level in the next two hours according to the short term and impending radar prediction through the prediction results it can judge the area with high probability of disaster occurrence in advance and predict the trend and degree of disaster occurrence which is of great significance for temporary deployment and dispatching 4 5 defects and future development of forecasting system this study discusses and analyzes the application of radar rainfall in real time prediction of river water level and constructs a rolling prediction operation mode but there are still some shortcomings on the one hand the monitoring equipment of sluice pump condition along the river in the study area is not perfect on the other hand this study focuses on the application of rainfall prediction in real time prediction of river water level therefore the prediction of downstream sluice pump and tide level has not been added and the observed water level is used in the downstream instead in the future work the historical data should be used to further calibrate the gate and pump in the hydrodynamic model and access to the measured monitoring information for the control process of gate pump in predictive scenario manual input current time extension pre defined scheduling rules and other methods can be adopted and their advantages and disadvantages are further studied and analyzed respectively in addition a high precision tide level prediction model is needed to provide boundary conditions for the model finally the prediction results such as water level curve and section warning information are formed according to the model calculation results the complete real time prediction system framework is shown in the fig 11 5 conclusion according to the characteristics of rapid and strong response of urban river to rainfall a real time rolling prediction system of river water level is proposed based on radar rainfall prediction and hydrological hydrodynamic coupling model based on the observation data of fuzhou city from april 1 to october 1 2020 the accuracy of river model and radar rainfall prediction products were evaluated the performance of the prediction system is evaluated by using the latest observed rainfall and radar rainfall driven model available at each historical moment which fills the gap in the operational operation of the river water level prediction system the main conclusions are as follows 1 the accuracy of the river model is high which can reflect the daily change of river water level and the change process during rainfall during the whole study period the rmse of the four river sections was 0 0887 0 0951 0 0863 and 0 0113 the nse was 0 8145 0 8085 0 7804 and 0 8361 and the kge was 0 7129 0 9154 0 5723 and 0 9057 respectively the radar rainfall product performs well and the accuracy of total rainfall is higher than that of rainfall process 2 the real time prediction system adopts the rolling operation mode obtains the latest model state by continuously accessing the latest observed rainfall and obtains the latest radar forecast rainfall in each simulation to predict the future river hydrodynamic process thus the forecast period is prolonged and the accumulated error caused by rainfall prediction error is avoided 3 the error of prediction system is affected by radar rainfall and river model compared with the observed rainfall driven model the prediction accuracy of radar rainfall driven river model decreases in different cases for the river section with strong response to rainfall the water level prediction error caused by radar rainfall error will be enlarged otherwise the error will be reduced the system can predict the trend of water level change accurately the error of peak water level is within 0 3 m and the error of peak time is within 1 h it can provide timely and detailed water level forecast for the relevant personnel which is crucial for the assessment and reduction of flood risk and the formulation of detailed emergency response plan

4097,comprehensive river water quality monitoring and assessment helps to identify emerging water quality problems as well as developing sustainable water management strategies to maintain and protect healthy rivers and ecosystems however the cost of these efforts is a major concern due to large monitoring networks in rivers and watersheds this paper presents a bayesian maximum entropy bme based framework to optimize the locations of water quality monitoring stations wqms in rivers to obtain the highest value of information with the lowest number of monitoring stations in this study bme is employed as a flexible accurate and effective approach in geostatistics to optimize the spatiotemporal coverage of potential wqms in addition an information entropy model is proposed using value of information voi and transinformation entropy te in a multi objective optimization model to relax the computational burden and allow the entire decision space to be explored the proposed model provides a set of pareto optimal solutions wqms locations with tradeoffs between voi highest information and te lowest overlap this framework was applied to the rappahannock river in eastern virginia united states the results of this study revealed that only 5 monitoring stations optimally placed along the river could capture 76 of the information that 45 monitoring stations provided this significantly reduces the costs of deploying and maintaining monitoring stations our approach will provide improved estimates of water quality in a cost effective manner and can be transferrable to other regions to

optimize the number of monitoring stations and their appropriate locations asadollahfardi et al 2020 although collective features of suitable locations cost effectiveness spatial coverage and mutual information are the key components to consider for the optimal design of a river monitoring network they have not yet been fully explored identifying a limited set of representative wqms to determine river water quality would significantly reduce the cost of the monitoring network while providing adequate spatial coverage and maximum information khorshidi et al 2018 khorshidi et al 2019a pourshahabi et al 2018a the value of information voi method is able to identify a set of optimal wqms and obtain maximum information values this concept was first introduced by grayson 1960 and is one of the most suitable approaches for designing a network of monitoring stations in different types of water bodies hirshleifer and riley 1979 including the design of reservoir water quality monitoring networks maymandi et al 2018 pourshahabi et al 2018a flood monitoring alfonso and price 2012 alfonso et al 2016 and the design of groundwater quality monitoring systems hosseini and kerachian 2017a hosseini and kerachian 2017b previous applications of voi theory in reservoirs and groundwater water quality monitoring systems were mainly to 1 specify the optimal locations of wqms and 2 provide optimal sampling intervals maymandi et al 2018 pourshahabi et al 2018a hosseini and kerachian 2017a hosseini and kerachian 2017b however voi could also be used in the design of a river water quality monitoring network to determine the lowest number of stations with the highest amount of information which would reduce the costs associated with water quality monitoring alameddine et al 2013 destandau and zaiter 2020 minimizing redundant information is another approach to reduce monitoring network costs transinformation entropy te is one of the most efficient and effective approaches to decrease information redundancy between pairs of monitoring stations pourshahabi et al 2018a te which originated from shannon 1948 has been widely used in the design of water quality monitoring networks for groundwater mogheir et al 2004a mogheir et al 2004b masoumi and kerachian 2010 alizadeh et al 2018 and reservoirs lee et al 2014 nikoo et al 2017 boroumand et al 2018 pourshahabi et al 2018b spatiotemporal variability analysis of water quality variables is another key component in the optimal design of wqms layouts bayesian maximum entropy bme was first developed by christakos 1990 1991 as a powerful tool in geostatistics it has been used effectively in the spatiotemporal design of monitoring stations in water bodies such as groundwater alizadeh and mahjouri 2017 hosseini and kerachian 2017a hosseini and kerachian 2017b due to its flexibility in merging soft and hard data and its capacity for spatiotemporal mapping hosseini and kerachian 2017a hosseini and kerachian 2017b however to the best of the authors knowledge bme along with a hybrid information entropy based approach have not previously been applied to river wqms optimization moreover this research for the first time promotes comprehensive river water quality monitoring and assessment through the development of a hybrid framework to efficiently optimize the location of wqms in this study a new methodology is proposed for the optimal design of wqms in rivers using voi te bme a multi objective optimization model the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee within this framework the bme technique was used to obtain an accurate spatiotemporal estimation of potential wqms bme s derived stations in addition to the pre existing monitoring stations collectively constructed the entire potential network of river water quality monitoring stations an information entropy based approach utilizing voi and te was then developed to provide an optimal and effective network of monitoring stations in rivers next the multi objective optimization model was developed to minimize the cost maximize voi and minimize te which resulted in the maximum spatial coverage of the river with a minimum number of stations subsequently the preferred compromise solution was obtained using the promethee method the proposed methodology was applied to the rappahannock river in eastern virginia in the united states in the following sections the methodology is presented in detail the main steps and models are explained and the study area is introduced finally results and conclusions are presented 2 methodology the proposed framework consists of three main steps including data preparation multi objective optimization and decision making fig 1 in the first step water quality measurements were collected in this study from the chesapeake bay program website and bme was employed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of potential monitoring stations then the ccme wqi was calculated based on multiple water quality variables to provide a single representative quality index and to determine voi and te for the potential monitoring stations in the second step a multi objective optimization model was developed based on non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to obtain pareto optimal solutions with three objectives i minimizing costs ii maximizing voi and iii minimizing te in the third step the promethee was employed to select the best compromise solution among the nsga ii results then sensitivity analysis was performed to assess different weighting scenarios in choosing the best optimal solution these steps are described in the following sections 2 1 bayesian maximum entropy bme the bme approach gui 2014 was employed to generate sample designs of a monitoring network in a river based on space time water quality measurements at pre existing monitoring stations the schematic procedure is presented in fig 2 in the first step all required information including water quality observations and locations of corresponding pre existing monitoring stations were used as input based on the spatiotemporal distribution of available measurements exploratory data analysis was then conducted in the next step mean trend analysis was performed to explain when or where the data were consistently higher or lower than the mean spatial and temporal mean trend since potential stations are estimated and identified based on the covariance analysis of pre existing monitoring stations and their associated water quality measurements five different covariance models in the bme including exponential gaussian spheroidal holecos and holesin were used and tested to find the best fit and calculate the spatial and temporal elements of the covariance of the data finally bme estimated the locations of monitoring stations based on the covariance model and analysis these potential stations are the possible locations along a river where water quality monitoring stations could be established to assess the river s water quality 2 2 canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi in 1997 ccme created its wqi as an integrated and consistent water quality index ccme 2001 the ccme wqi provides a comprehensive image of all water quality variables for the optimal design of water quality monitoring stations it is important to note that the best layout of monitoring stations for a single water quality variable might not be optimal for the rest of the variables the ccme wqi presents the overall water quality changes at a specific site and does not reflect the effect of transient and random events unless they happen frequently or over a long period of time ccme 2001 in this study the ccme wqi was employed to combine four individual water quality variables dissolved oxygen total nitrogen total phosphorus and total suspended solids and obtain a single representative index the ccme wqi is comprised of three factors ccme 2001 f1 scope factor the percentage of variables that do not meet their objectives failed

three steps step 1 nse is the normalized sum of excursions and calculated as 3 n s e i 1 n e x c u r s i o n i n u m b e r o f t e s t s step 2 excursion is the number of times an individual

factors as 6 ccme w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 732 ranging from 0 to 100 the ccme wqi is split into five quality classes table 1 ccme 2001 2 3 value of information voi based on the voi method each potential monitoring station might be in a different state condition that is associated with a message with a particular prior probability p s the decision maker s viewpoint about the state of a system is affected by each message when new information is received the updated decision maker s belief is presented by bayes theorem hirshleifer and riley 1979 alfonso and price 2012 7 p s m p m s p s p m where p s prior probability of state s p m probability of receiving message m p m s conditional probability of receiving message m when the state of the system is s p s m the updated belief of being in state s after receiving message m in this study message m is interpreted as the class of water quality new information of ccme wqi quality classes that the decision maker receives from a potential wqms at a specific location the value of information obtained by a received message m can be calculated as the difference between the utility of the action am selected by the decision maker based on the received message and the utility of action as chosen by the decision maker without any received message alfonso and price 2012 the utility of the chosen actions with the received message um and without the received message us is calculated by eqs 8 and 9 therefore the value of a chosen action am with the received message m is determined by eq 10 alfonso and price 2012 8 u m s c a s p

this matrix is defined based on the water quality standards chosen to represent the study area s water quality status in this study since ccme wqi is used to evaluate the water quality the c a s matrix is calculated based on ccme quality classes the general definition of each element of the c a s matrix when there are two actions and two states is presented in table 2 assuming a rational decision maker to always choose the action with maximum utility in the present study the voi of monitoring station i obtaining a message m for the decision maker to detect the state of monitoring

probability of occurrence of jb p i a j b joint probability between ia and jb it should be noted that mutual information of a pair of monitoring stations is the maximum value of their specific te 2 5 multi objective optimization nsga ii is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for multi objective optimization introduced by deb et al 2000 nsga ii is an elitist approach that uses non dominated sorting and an elite multi objective genetic algorithm ga to preserve diversity between alternatives of each non dominated front deb et al 2000 pourshahabi et al 2018b as mentioned earlier the multi objective optimization model was developed in this study to i minimize cost ii maximize voi and iii minimize te both voi and te matrices were determined for all pairs of wqms where the element in the i th row and j th column is equal to the voi i j and te i j respectively a vector of binary decision variables b is defined for the developed multi objective optimization model as if there is a monitoring station at the potential station i bi is equal to 1 if there is no station at the potential station i bi is equal to 0 therefore the first objective function z1 can be formulated as eq 13 the second objective function z2 is formulated as the summation of maximum voi of the chosen monitoring stations among all the potential wqms eq 14 likewise the formula of the third objective function minimizes the sum of maximum mutual information of the chosen pairs of monitoring stations as presented in eq 15 13 minimize z 1 i b i 14 m a x i m i z e z 2 j 1 n p m a x i b i v o i i j 15 m a x i m i z e z 3

was developed by brans et al 1984 and brans and vincke 1985 as a powerful multi criteria decision making mcdm method it is simple to apply and all required information is readily available the promethee method is employed to sort a group of solutions s s1 s2 sn based on some objectives z z1 z2 zm which can be potentially conflicting pourshahabi et al 2018a to utilize the promethee method the following four steps are taken first the preference function for each criterion is obtained in this study the linear preference function type iii is used and presented as brans et al 1986 16 p k d k p k i f 0 d k p k 1 i f d k p k d k z k s i z k s j where p k the k th criterion preference function d k the deviation between the value of the k th criterion in solutions si and sj z k the value of the k th criterion in each solution secondly the preference for each pair of solutions is calculated as brans et al 1986 17 œÄ s i s j k 1 m w k p k z k s i z k s j k 1 m w k 1 where w k the weight that shows the relative importance of the k th criterion in the third step the leaving flow and entering flow of solution si is determined by eqs 18 and 19 respectively brans et al 1986 18 œÜ s i 1 n

the better its rank will be for further information and details on promethee see zhang et al 2009 3 case study the proposed methodology was applied to design a water quality monitoring network for the rappahannock river located in the eastern part of virginia united states fig 3 the rappahannock river watershed drains an area of approximately 7 380 km2 and flows nearly 314 km from the blue ridge mountains in the west to chesapeake bay south of the potomac river it is a principal source for the region s water needs industrial development and population growth impose ever increasing pressure on chesapeake bay and the rappahannock river and have also caused significant adverse effects on the bay s water quality including risks to human health and aquatic life as a result there is an urgent need for an efficient and effective water quality monitoring network along this river zhang et al 2018 in this study dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss were selected because these are crucial variables in chesapeake bay and rappahannock river water quality zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 measurements of these four variables were collected from the chesapeake bay program website chesapeake bay at 25 pre existing monitoring stations throughout the rappahannock river from january 2005 to december 2018 distribution and locations of all the pre existing wqmss are mapped in fig 4 and their longitude latitude and station ids are provided in table s1 supplementary material section s1 the ccme wqi was calculated based on the four water quality variables do tn tp tss for each month of the study period 4 results 4 1 bme analysis and estimation of wqms locations suitable locations of all potential monitoring stations and required data for the optimization model were determined by bme after analysis of the spatiotemporal variation of water quality do tn tp tss observations in pre existing monitoring stations station coordinates the concentrations of monthly water quality variables at each station and the time of observation were employed by the bme as spatial and temporal characteristics to operate the space time analysis of monitoring stations and water quality measurements histograms of the water quality variables are plotted in fig 5 the plot presents the frequency of different variable concentrations on a logarithmic scale each water quality variable revealed a specific distribution which governed the occurrence of specific values of each variable before examining different covariance models a mean trend analysis was performed on the water quality variable data the mean trend model removed averages from the data and generated residual values i e data minus mean trend which created a homogenous and stationary time series temporal mean trend analysis and spatial mean trend analysis of the water quality variable observations are presented in figs s1 and s2 respectively supplementary material section s3 moreover five different space time covariance models defined in the bme analysis were tested to find the exponential model with the best fit as an example the spatial covariance model obtained for tp is shown in fig 6 the bme model was set to estimate 20 new locations of wqms based on the space time covariance model and corresponding values of water quality variables these 20 locations were identified to ensure that other possible locations for monitoring were considered in our monitoring network and optimization framework all pre existing monitoring locations were added to the estimated monitoring stations and collectively a monitoring network of 45 potential monitoring stations was established for the rappahannock river this was done to ensure the entire study area could be sufficiently monitored the distribution and locations of all potential wqms along the rappahannock river are presented in fig 7 longitude latitude and station ids of all the potential monitoring stations are shown in table s2 supplementary material section s2 since the bme model considered spatiotemporal variation of the measurements the estimated monitoring stations were consistently distributed between the pre existing monitoring stations throughout the river 4 2 ccme wqi after using the bme technique and determining all potential monitoring stations the ccme wqi was calculated based on the four water quality variables for each of the potential monitoring stations through this index the water quality status of the entire study area over 14 years was presented which in turn helped design an optimal water quality monitoring network for all the considered water quality variables as an example time series of ccme wqi at five potential monitoring stations distributed throughout the rappahannock river are shown in fig 8 the ccme wqi time series were also utilized to provide the prior probability of each class at all 45 potential stations 4 3 voi te and multi objective optimization in this study a cost matrix table 3 was developed according to the ccme wqi at each monitoring station each value of c a s was calculated by subtracting the center of each class of ccme wqi from the center of its previous ccme wqi class since the c a s reveals the relative cost of actions chosen by the decision maker a negative sign indicates a loss as an example if the water quality in a monitoring location is deemed to be excellent but is actually only fair this would bring about a cost equal to 25 5 the element in the 5th row and 3rd column of table 3 subsequently for all pairs of stations voi and te were calculated using eqs 11 and 12 the results were two 45 45 matrices which included the values voii j and te i j in their ith and jth columns hence the element in the i th row and j th column of the voi matrix showed the value of information of monitoring station i to detect the state of monitoring station j while the same element in the te matrix was the common information between each pair of monitoring stations i and j the nsga ii multi objective optimization model was then developed to obtain a set of high coverage monitoring station layouts with a minimum number of stations maximum voi and minimum te simultaneously many station layouts were chosen by nsga ii through an iterative approach in which the three mentioned criteria were met population size generation and the number of decision variables same as the number of potential stations of the developed optimization model were 900 200 and 45 respectively moreover the optimization algorithm converged after reaching the set maximum generations or when the average change in the spread of pareto solutions became less than 10 4 the pareto front solutions obtained by nsga ii for the three defined objectives are presented in fig 9 as observed in fig 9 both the voi and te rise as the number of monitoring stations increases however a large number of monitoring stations would be prohibitively expensive to deploy and maintain the 58 pareto optimal solutions with their objective values are also presented in table 4 it can be seen that the number of monitoring stations voi and te in the optimal solutions obtained by nsga ii varied between 5 and 43 111 67 and 199 55 and 0 61 and 20 respectively this implies that these optimal sets of monitoring stations almost perfectly represented the water quality of the entire area which results in a comprehensive water quality assessment to reduce the ecosystem loss and protect vulnerable water bodies such as the chesapeake bay and rappahannock river 4 4 multi criteria decision making considering all three objectives the preferred compromise solution among all the nsga ii optimal solutions was selected using the promethee multi criteria decision making method this method was employed to rank the pareto front solutions based on the three optimization objectives in the promethee method the rank of every solution was determined based on its calculated net flow since we aimed to have a monitoring station layout with lowest cost and highest possible information simultaneously all three objectives were considered to be equally important in this step and equal weights were considered for selecting the best solution w 1 w2 w3 0 33 the net flows of the first 10 solutions are listed in table 5 higher net flow was associated with a higher ranking the most preferable solution was no 1 which included five wqms out of the 45 potential monitoring stations the selected wqms provided 76 of the information captured by the entire potential monitoring stations according to table 4 solution no 1 captured the maximum amount of information with the lowest number of monitoring stations and minimum redundancy in comparison to other optimal sets this would allow a significant reduction in the financial burden of adopting and maintaining the river monitoring network although other optimal solutions could provide higher voi and te the number of monitoring stations would increase significantly along with the cost of the system as the selected solution captured maximum information it is capable of providing thorough and effective water quality monitoring to ensure high quality water supply for municipalities and industries and also save chesapeake bay s endangered aquatic life locations of the optimal wqms along the rappahannock river selected by the promethee method are shown in fig 10 exact longitude and latitude of the selected wqms are presented in table 6 4 5 sensitivity analysis in a final step sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the weighting of the three objectives i e the number of stations voi and te in choosing the best optimal solution by the promethee method table 7 shows the six different weighting scenarios considered for the three criteria the weight of each criterion varied between 0 1 and 0 9 accordingly the selected optimal solutions and their corresponding objective values in different weighting scenarios are listed in table 8 for weighting scenarios with w 1 0 3 minimum number of monitoring stations is preferable solution no 1 with five monitoring stations was selected as the best choice if voi received a higher weight a significant increase was seen in the number of required stations solutions no 4 24 36 which would mean the cost of the monitoring network would rise significantly fig 11 presents the results of the sensitivity analysis of the three criteria in six weighting scenarios 5 conclusions this paper proposes a novel optimization approach using bayesian maximum entropy bme value of information voi transinformation entropy te a multi objective optimization model the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi and promethee to obtain an optimal design of a water quality monitoring station wqms network for a river the proposed framework was applied to the rappahannock river in eastern virginia united states to evaluate its effectiveness first the bme method was used for spatiotemporal analysis of the collected water quality measurements as well as the optimal placement of 20 potential wqms along the river collectively the 20 bme found stations plus the 25 pre existing monitoring locations provided the decision space for the information entropy framework to select the optimal locations of stations secondly the ccme wqi was calculated for each monitoring station based on four water quality variables dissolved oxygen total nitrate total phosphorous and total suspended solids gathered over a 14 year period then the nsga ii optimization model was developed to determine the optimal wqms with three main objectives i minimizing cost i e number of monitoring stations ii maximizing voi and iii minimizing te results of the multi objective optimization model revealed that if voi increased te and the number of optimal monitoring stations also increased the number of wqms locations in 58 pareto optimal solutions varied between 5 and 43 finally after assigning the same weight to the three objectives the preferable solution obtained by the promethee method selected five monitoring stations out of the 45 potential stations in conclusion using the bme model results allowed for the determination of the best locations for potential wqms coupling voi and te enabled the exploration of the entire decision space which provided a set of representative stations minimum number of wqms with the highest information and minimum redundancy in future studies a spatial variogram could be developed instead of te to determine the minimum mutual information credit authorship contribution statement reza salman conceptualization methodology software investigation

taken into account including sampling locations sampling duration and water quality variables harmancioglu et al 1999 asadollahfardi 2015 karamouz and kerachian 2015 behmel et al 2016 a wide range of studies have been conducted to develop appropriate optimization frameworks for the design of water quality monitoring networks focusing on dam reservoirs groundwater rainfall and polders many of these

ran et al 2015 although many studies have been conducted on the optimization of monitoring networks in reservoirs groundwater and other water bodies there are relatively few studies on the optimal design of wqms in rivers mahjouri and kerachian 2010 alameddine et al 2013 memarzadeh et al 2013 asadollahfardi et al 2020 destandau and zaiter 2020 pourshahabi et al 2020 different frameworks have been developed in rivers to obtain the best monitoring locations and optimally design water quality monitoring networks mahjouri and kerachian 2010 memarzadeh et al 2013 using optimization based approaches focused on minimizing the number of monitoring stations and contaminant detection time in a recent study of the mond basin river in iran dynamic programing was used to simultaneously optimize the number of monitoring stations and their appropriate locations asadollahfardi et al 2020 although collective features of suitable locations cost effectiveness spatial coverage and mutual information are the key components to consider for the optimal design of a river monitoring network they have not yet been fully explored identifying a limited set of representative wqms to determine river water quality would significantly reduce the cost of the monitoring network while providing adequate spatial coverage and maximum information khorshidi et al 2018 khorshidi et al 2019a pourshahabi et al 2018a the value of information voi method is able to identify a set of optimal wqms and obtain maximum information values this concept was first introduced by grayson 1960 and is one of the most suitable approaches for designing a network of monitoring stations in different types of water bodies hirshleifer and riley 1979 including the design of reservoir water quality monitoring networks maymandi et al 2018 pourshahabi et al 2018a flood monitoring alfonso and price 2012 alfonso et al 2016 and the design of groundwater quality monitoring systems hosseini and kerachian 2017a hosseini and kerachian 2017b previous applications of voi theory in reservoirs and groundwater water quality monitoring systems were mainly to 1 specify the optimal locations of wqms and 2 provide optimal sampling intervals maymandi et al 2018 pourshahabi et al 2018a hosseini and kerachian 2017a hosseini and kerachian 2017b however voi could also be used in the design of a river water quality monitoring network to determine the lowest number of stations with the highest amount of information which would reduce the costs associated with water quality monitoring alameddine et al 2013 destandau and zaiter 2020 minimizing redundant information is another approach to reduce monitoring network costs transinformation entropy te is one of the most efficient and effective approaches to decrease information redundancy between pairs of monitoring stations pourshahabi et al 2018a te which originated from shannon 1948 has been widely used in the design of water quality monitoring networks for groundwater mogheir et al 2004a mogheir et al 2004b masoumi and kerachian 2010 alizadeh et al 2018 and reservoirs lee et al 2014 nikoo et al 2017 boroumand et al 2018 pourshahabi et al 2018b spatiotemporal variability analysis of water quality variables is another key component in the optimal design of wqms layouts bayesian maximum entropy bme was first developed by christakos 1990 1991 as a powerful tool in geostatistics it has been used effectively in the spatiotemporal design of monitoring stations in water bodies such as groundwater alizadeh and mahjouri 2017 hosseini and kerachian 2017a hosseini and kerachian 2017b due to its flexibility in merging soft and hard data and its capacity for spatiotemporal mapping hosseini and kerachian 2017a hosseini and kerachian 2017b however to the best of the authors knowledge bme along with a hybrid information entropy based approach have not previously been applied to river wqms optimization moreover this research for the first time promotes comprehensive river water quality monitoring and assessment through the development of a hybrid framework to efficiently optimize the location of wqms in this study a new methodology is proposed for the optimal design of wqms in rivers using voi te bme a multi objective optimization model the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee within this framework the bme technique was used to obtain an accurate spatiotemporal estimation of potential wqms bme s derived stations in addition to the pre existing monitoring stations collectively constructed the entire potential network of river water quality monitoring stations an information entropy based approach utilizing voi and te was then developed to provide an optimal and effective network of monitoring stations in rivers next the multi objective optimization model was developed to minimize the cost maximize voi and minimize te which resulted in the maximum spatial coverage of the river with a minimum number of stations subsequently the preferred compromise solution was obtained using the promethee method the proposed methodology was applied to the rappahannock river in eastern virginia in the united states in the following sections the methodology is presented in detail the main steps and models are explained and the study area is introduced finally results and conclusions are presented 2 methodology the proposed framework consists of three main steps including data preparation multi objective optimization and decision making fig 1 in the first step water quality measurements were collected in this study from the chesapeake bay program website and bme was employed to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of potential monitoring stations then the ccme wqi was calculated based on multiple water quality variables to provide a single representative quality index and to determine voi and te for the potential monitoring stations in the second step a multi objective optimization model was developed based on non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to obtain pareto optimal solutions with three objectives i minimizing costs ii maximizing voi and iii minimizing te in the third step the promethee was employed to select the best compromise solution among the nsga ii results then sensitivity analysis was performed to assess different weighting scenarios in choosing the best optimal solution these steps are described in the following sections 2 1 bayesian maximum entropy bme the bme approach gui 2014 was employed to generate sample designs of a monitoring network in a river based on space time water quality measurements at pre existing monitoring stations the schematic procedure is presented in fig 2 in the first step all required information including water quality observations and locations of corresponding pre existing monitoring stations were used as input based on the spatiotemporal distribution of available measurements exploratory data analysis was then conducted in the next step mean trend analysis was performed to explain when or where the data were consistently higher or lower than the mean spatial and temporal mean trend since potential stations are estimated and identified based on the covariance analysis of pre existing monitoring stations and their associated water quality measurements five different covariance models in the bme including exponential gaussian spheroidal holecos and holesin were used and tested to find the best fit and calculate the spatial and temporal elements of the covariance of the data finally bme estimated the locations of monitoring stations based on the covariance model and analysis these potential stations are the possible locations along a river where water quality monitoring stations could be established to assess the river s water quality 2 2 canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi in 1997 ccme created its wqi as an integrated and consistent water quality index ccme 2001 the ccme wqi provides a comprehensive image of all water quality variables for the optimal design of water quality monitoring stations it is important to note that the best layout of monitoring stations for a single water quality variable might not be optimal for the rest of the variables the ccme wqi presents the overall water quality changes at a specific site and does not reflect the effect of transient and random events unless they happen frequently or over a long period of time ccme 2001 in this study the ccme wqi was employed to combine four individual water quality variables dissolved oxygen total nitrogen total phosphorus and total suspended solids and obtain a single representative index the ccme wqi is comprised of three factors ccme 2001 f1 scope factor the percentage of variables that do not meet their objectives failed

factors as 6 ccme w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 732 ranging from 0 to 100 the ccme wqi is split into five quality classes table 1 ccme 2001 2 3 value of information voi based on the voi method each potential monitoring station might be in a different state condition that is associated with a message with a particular prior probability p s the decision maker s viewpoint about the state of a system is affected by each message when new information is received the updated decision maker s belief is presented by bayes theorem hirshleifer and riley 1979 alfonso and price 2012 7 p s m p m s p

being in state s after receiving message m in this study message m is interpreted as the class of water quality new information of ccme wqi quality classes that the decision maker receives from a potential wqms at a specific location the value of information obtained by a received message m can be calculated as the difference between the utility of the action am selected by the decision maker based on the received message and the utility of action as chosen by the decision maker without any received message alfonso and price 2012 the utility of the chosen actions with the received message um and without the received message us is calculated by eqs 8 and 9 therefore the value of a chosen action am with the received message m is determined by eq 10 alfonso and price 2012 8 u m s c a s p

this matrix is defined based on the water quality standards chosen to represent the study area s water quality status in this study since ccme wqi is used to evaluate the water quality the c a s matrix is calculated based on ccme quality classes the general definition of each element of the c a s matrix when there are two actions and two states is presented in table 2 assuming a rational decision maker to always choose the action with maximum utility in the present study the voi of monitoring station i obtaining a message m for the decision maker to detect the state of monitoring

multi objective optimization nsga ii is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for multi objective optimization introduced by deb et al 2000 nsga ii is an elitist approach that uses non dominated sorting and an elite multi objective genetic algorithm ga to preserve diversity between alternatives of each non dominated front deb et al 2000 pourshahabi et al 2018b as mentioned earlier the multi objective optimization model was developed in this study to i minimize cost ii maximize voi and iii minimize te both voi and te matrices were determined for all pairs of wqms where the element in the i th row and j th column is equal to the voi i j and te i j respectively a vector of binary decision variables b is defined for the developed multi objective optimization model as if there is a monitoring station at the potential station i bi is equal to 1 if there is no station at the potential station i bi is equal to 0 therefore the first objective function z1 can be formulated as eq 13 the second objective function z2 is formulated as the summation of maximum voi of the chosen monitoring stations among all the potential wqms eq 14 likewise the formula of the third objective function minimizes the sum of maximum mutual information of the chosen pairs of monitoring stations as presented in eq 15 13 minimize z 1 i b i 14 m a x i m i z e z 2 j 1 n p m a x i b i v o i i j 15 m a x i m i z e z 3

was developed by brans et al 1984 and brans and vincke 1985 as a powerful multi criteria decision making mcdm method it is simple to apply and all required information is readily available the promethee method is employed to sort a group of solutions s s1 s2 sn based on some objectives z z1 z2 zm which can be potentially conflicting pourshahabi et al 2018a to utilize the promethee method the following four steps are taken first the preference function for each criterion is obtained in this study the linear preference function type iii is used and presented as brans et al 1986 16 p k d k p k i f 0 d k p k 1 i f d k p k d k z k s i z k s j where p k the k th criterion preference function d k the deviation between the value of the k th criterion in solutions si and sj z k the value of the k th criterion in each solution secondly the preference for each pair of solutions is calculated as brans et al 1986 17 œÄ s i s j k 1 m w k p k z k s i z k s j k 1 m w k 1 where w k the weight that shows the relative importance of the k th criterion in the third step the leaving flow and entering flow of solution si is determined by eqs 18 and 19 respectively brans et al 1986 18 œÜ s i 1 n

the better its rank will be for further information and details on promethee see zhang et al 2009 3 case study the proposed methodology was applied to design a water quality monitoring network for the rappahannock river located in the eastern part of virginia united states fig 3 the rappahannock river watershed drains an area of approximately 7 380 km2 and flows nearly 314 km from the blue ridge mountains in the west to chesapeake bay south of the potomac river it is a principal source for the region s water needs industrial development and population growth impose ever increasing pressure on chesapeake bay and the rappahannock river and have also caused significant adverse effects on the bay s water quality including risks to human health and aquatic life as a result there is an urgent need for an efficient and effective water quality monitoring network along this river zhang et al 2018 in this study dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss were selected because these are crucial variables in chesapeake bay and rappahannock river water quality zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 measurements of these four variables were collected from the chesapeake bay program website chesapeake bay at 25 pre existing monitoring stations throughout the rappahannock river from january 2005 to december 2018 distribution and locations of all the pre existing wqmss are mapped in fig 4 and their longitude latitude and station ids are provided in table s1 supplementary material section s1 the ccme wqi was calculated based on the four water quality variables do tn tp tss for each month of the study period 4 results 4 1 bme analysis and estimation of wqms locations suitable locations of all potential monitoring stations and required data for the optimization model were determined by bme after analysis of the spatiotemporal variation of water quality do tn tp tss observations in pre existing monitoring stations station coordinates the concentrations of monthly water quality variables at each station and the time of observation were employed by the bme as spatial and temporal characteristics to operate the space time analysis of monitoring stations and water quality measurements histograms of the water quality variables are plotted in fig 5 the plot presents the frequency of different variable concentrations on a logarithmic scale each water quality variable revealed a specific distribution which governed the occurrence of specific values of each variable before examining different covariance models a mean trend analysis was performed on the water quality variable data the mean trend model removed averages from the data and generated residual values i e data minus mean trend which created a homogenous and stationary time series temporal mean trend analysis and spatial mean trend analysis of the water quality variable observations are presented in figs s1 and s2 respectively supplementary material section s3 moreover five different space time covariance models defined in the bme analysis were tested to find the exponential model with the best fit as an example the spatial covariance model obtained for tp is shown in fig 6 the bme model was set to estimate 20 new locations of wqms based on the space time covariance model and corresponding values of water quality variables these 20 locations were identified to ensure that other possible locations for monitoring were considered in our monitoring network and optimization framework all pre existing monitoring locations were added to the estimated monitoring stations and collectively a monitoring network of 45 potential monitoring stations was established for the rappahannock river this was done to ensure the entire study area could be sufficiently monitored the distribution and locations of all potential wqms along the rappahannock river are presented in fig 7 longitude latitude and station ids of all the potential monitoring stations are shown in table s2 supplementary material section s2 since the bme model considered spatiotemporal variation of the measurements the estimated monitoring stations were consistently distributed between the pre existing monitoring stations throughout the river 4 2 ccme wqi after using the bme technique and determining all potential monitoring stations the ccme wqi was calculated based on the four water quality variables for each of the potential monitoring stations through this index the water quality status of the entire study area over 14 years was presented which in turn helped design an optimal water quality monitoring network for all the considered water quality variables as an example time series of ccme wqi at five potential monitoring stations distributed throughout the rappahannock river are shown in fig 8 the ccme wqi time series were also utilized to provide the prior probability of each class at all 45 potential stations 4 3 voi te and multi objective optimization in this study a cost matrix table 3 was developed according to the ccme wqi at each monitoring station each value of c a s was calculated by subtracting the center of each class of ccme wqi from the center of its previous ccme wqi class since the c a s reveals the relative cost of actions chosen by the decision maker a negative sign indicates a loss as an example if the water quality in a monitoring location is deemed to be excellent but is actually only fair this would bring about a cost equal to 25 5 the element in the 5th row and 3rd column of table 3 subsequently for all pairs of stations voi and te were calculated using eqs 11 and 12 the results were two 45 45 matrices which included the values voii j and te i j in their ith and jth columns hence the element in the i th row and j th column of the voi matrix showed the value of information of monitoring station i to detect the state of monitoring station j while the same element in the te matrix was the common information between each pair of monitoring stations i and j the nsga ii multi objective optimization model was then developed to obtain a set of high coverage monitoring station layouts with a minimum number of stations maximum voi and minimum te simultaneously many station layouts were chosen by nsga ii through an iterative approach in which the three mentioned criteria were met population size generation and the number of decision variables same as the number of potential stations of the developed optimization model were 900 200 and 45 respectively moreover the optimization algorithm converged after reaching the set maximum generations or when the average change in the spread of pareto solutions became less than 10 4 the pareto front solutions obtained by nsga ii for the three defined objectives are presented in fig 9 as observed in fig 9 both the voi and te rise as the number of monitoring stations increases however a large number of monitoring stations would be prohibitively expensive to deploy and maintain the 58 pareto optimal solutions with their objective values are also presented in table 4 it can be seen that the number of monitoring stations voi and te in the optimal solutions obtained by nsga ii varied between 5 and 43 111 67 and 199 55 and 0 61 and 20 respectively this implies that these optimal sets of monitoring stations almost perfectly represented the water quality of the entire area which results in a comprehensive water quality assessment to reduce the ecosystem loss and protect vulnerable water bodies such as the chesapeake bay and rappahannock river 4 4 multi criteria decision making considering all three objectives the preferred compromise solution among all the nsga ii optimal solutions was selected using the promethee multi criteria decision making method this method was employed to rank the pareto front solutions based on the three optimization objectives in the promethee method the rank of every solution was determined based on its calculated net flow since we aimed to have a monitoring station layout with lowest cost and highest possible information simultaneously all three objectives were considered to be equally important in this step and equal weights were considered for selecting the best solution w 1 w2 w3 0 33 the net flows of the first 10 solutions are listed in table 5 higher net flow was associated with a higher ranking the most preferable solution was no 1 which included five wqms out of the 45 potential monitoring stations the selected wqms provided 76 of the information captured by the entire potential monitoring stations according to table 4 solution no 1 captured the maximum amount of information with the lowest number of monitoring stations and minimum redundancy in comparison to other optimal sets this would allow a significant reduction in the financial burden of adopting and maintaining the river monitoring network although other optimal solutions could provide higher voi and te the number of monitoring stations would increase significantly along with the cost of the system as the selected solution captured maximum information it is capable of providing thorough and effective water quality monitoring to ensure high quality water supply for municipalities and industries and also save chesapeake bay s endangered aquatic life locations of the optimal wqms along the rappahannock river selected by the promethee method are shown in fig 10 exact longitude and latitude of the selected wqms are presented in table 6 4 5 sensitivity analysis in a final step sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the weighting of the three objectives i e the number of stations voi and te in choosing the best optimal solution by the promethee method table 7 shows the six different weighting scenarios considered for the three criteria the weight of each criterion varied between 0 1 and 0 9 accordingly the selected optimal solutions and their corresponding objective values in different weighting scenarios are listed in table 8 for weighting scenarios with w 1 0 3 minimum number of monitoring stations is preferable solution no 1 with five monitoring stations was selected as the best choice if voi received a higher weight a significant increase was seen in the number of required stations solutions no 4 24 36 which would mean the cost of the monitoring network would rise significantly fig 11 presents the results of the sensitivity analysis of the three criteria in six weighting scenarios 5 conclusions this paper proposes a novel optimization approach using bayesian maximum entropy bme value of information voi transinformation entropy te a multi objective optimization model the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi and promethee to obtain an optimal design of a water quality monitoring station wqms network for a river the proposed framework was applied to the rappahannock river in eastern virginia united states to evaluate its effectiveness first the bme method was used for spatiotemporal analysis of the collected water quality measurements as well as the optimal placement of 20 potential wqms along the river collectively the 20 bme found stations plus the 25 pre existing monitoring locations provided the decision space for the information entropy framework to select the optimal locations of stations secondly the ccme wqi was calculated for each monitoring station based on four water quality variables dissolved oxygen total nitrate total phosphorous and total suspended solids gathered over a 14 year period then the nsga ii optimization model was developed to determine the optimal wqms with three main objectives i minimizing cost i e number of monitoring stations ii maximizing voi and iii minimizing te results of the multi objective optimization model revealed that if voi increased te and the number of optimal monitoring stations also increased the number of wqms locations in 58 pareto optimal solutions varied between 5 and 43 finally after assigning the same weight to the three objectives the preferable solution obtained by the promethee method selected five monitoring stations out of the 45 potential stations in conclusion using the bme model results allowed for the determination of the best locations for potential wqms coupling voi and te enabled the exploration of the entire decision space which provided a set of representative stations minimum number of wqms with the highest information and minimum redundancy in future studies a spatial variogram could be developed instead of te to determine the minimum mutual information credit authorship contribution statement reza salman conceptualization methodology software investigation

4098,the temporal sequence of fluctuating rainfall intensities during an event the intensity profile or rainfall pattern is known to affect water partitioning at the ground surface and associated erosional processes there can be large differences in runoff ratios and runoff rates between early peak and late peak events and hence in the depth speed and sediment transport capacity of resulting overland flow whilst rainfall intensity may fluctuate continually during all ips in natural rainfall there is little information on the rates of such intensity fluctuations that can be used to guide the design of rainfall simulation experiments this review analyses relevant data derived from published high resolution rainfall records and also from new analyses of data from australian ground observing stations both sources confirm the occurrence of rates of intensity change of greater than 500 mm h 1 min 1 it is suggested that the fluctuating intensities characteristic of natural rainfall need to be employed in rainfall simulation experiments in order to generate results applicable to natural landsurface processes like infiltration or soil removal constant intensity rain as commonly used in rainfall simulation experiments lacks both the kinds of rapid intensity fluctuations seen in natural rainfall as well as any representation of natural intensity profiles these unrepresentative conditions can result in lower runoff rates and larger proportions of infiltration than when intensity fluctuations are present there is thus a strong case for changing the design of rainfall simulation to reflect more closely natural intensity fluctuations and intensity profiles and their influence on key surface processes such as overland flow and soil erosion keywords intensity profile intensity fluctuations storm pattern rainfall simulation soil erosion infiltration 1 introduction rainfall simulation is a widely applied research tool that has contributed to our understanding of landsurface processes in hydrology geomorphology soil erosion studies and related fields specific subjects investigated have included infiltration rates the timing of overland flow production during rainfall the detachment and removal of soil particles and nutrients as a result of drop impacts and overland flow and the development of surface seals and crusts from rain impact in order to maximise the usefulness of experimental results in enhancing our understanding of such processes simulated rainfall should correspond as closely as possible to the important characteristics of natural rainfall as they bear on each process or mechanism failure to reproduce these characteristics which might include drop sizes intensity duration depth and others is a widely identified concern regarding the appropriateness of rainfall simulation as a research tool hall 1970 riezebos seyhan 1977 agassi bradford 1999 grismer 2012 a universal feature of natural rainfall is that its intensity fluctuates continually this characteristic can therefore be included on the list of rainfall properties that may need to be correctly reproduced in rainfall simulations the continually changing intensities have been variously referred to as comprising the intensity distribution intensity profile storm pattern rainfall pattern or rainfall temporal pattern the latter term however has a broader meaning often to refer to the pattern of rainfall arrival through weeks months or the seasons sombroek 2001 zhang liu 2016 mitra et al 2019 raz yaseef et al 2012 in the present paper the term intensity profile hereafter ip is used to refer to the entire sequence of time varying intensities that makes up a rainfall event storm pattern is avoided because not all rainfall arrives from storms and rainfall pattern does not clearly relate to temporal rather than spatial patterns at least three distinct aspects of the ips that occur in natural rainfall need to be identified the first may be referred to as the classificatory ip which refers to the overall form of the ip of an event viz whether the rainfall exhibits for instance an intensity peak early or late in the course of an event the use of such classifications has quite a long history thus huff 1967 introduced a classification of ip by quartiles in which the ip was classified as being first quartile second quartile etc depending on which quarter of the event duration received the largest rainfall depth equally that quartile can be said to have experienced the highest average rainfall rate this kind of classificatory ip nomenclature does not depend on the absolute rainfall depths or intensities involved nor on their rate of change during the event a first quartile event might involve very intense rain or merely very low intensity rain without this affecting the classification the second aspect of ips in natural rainfall that must be considered is the actual rate of change of rainfall intensity during the course of the ip for instance regardless of its position during the duration of the rainfall event an interval of high intensity might be reached and perhaps followed by a gradual and progressive change in intensity or by very rapid changes to form what has been termed an intensity burst dunkerley 2019c a third aspect of ip is true intermittency when the rainfall ceases temporarily this is a very common phenomenon trenberth et al 2017 and is relevant to infiltration runoff and other phenomena not least because periods of intermittency allow some recovery of soil infiltrability and the partial or complete dissipation of ephemeral surface ponding and runoff dunkerley 2020b 2021 it is suggested here that in using rainfall simulation to explore and understand infiltration overland flow soil detachment and other important landsurface processes it is desirable to reproduce all three aspects of ip in a way that corresponds as closely as possible with the ip characteristics of natural rainfall in each particular study location historically in rainfall simulation experiments that rely on constant intensity simulated rainfall mostly generated using spray nozzles all aspects of ip have been neglected the classificatory ip the rates of intensity change and the occurrence of intermittency dunkerley 2020b dunkerley 2021 failure to reflect these characteristics of natural rainfall may contribute to the limited success reported by studies seeking to validate rainfall simulation as a research tool dunkerley 2021 it can be concluded that the complexity of natural intensity profiles is not captured in the majority of rainfall simulation studies indeed whilst the fixed intensities used in most rainfall simulations are sometimes selected to correspond with the kinds of intensities that occur in a study region they are often selected without any particular rationale being offered dunkerley 2008 the most likely explanation being that the conditions are dictated by the available pumps and spray nozzle hardware only in a minority of studies is a classificatory ip adopted for the simulated rain and in fewer still is the adopted ip based upon the kinds of natural ips recorded in the study region some examples are provided below almost no rainfall simulation studies give any consideration to the rates of intensity fluctuations or to intermittency during the ip tao et al 2017 2 consequently emphasised that the influence of rainfall patterns intensity profile on runoff erosion and nutrient loss has rarely been investigated the relative neglect of ip is of concern because there is sufficient published evidence to demonstrate that the ip of rainfall can affect water partitioning and other landsurface processes ip is also known to influence flood peaks and flood discharges especially in urban and urbanising areas guan et al 2016 zeimetz et al 2018 mu et al 2020 whilst increasingly researchers are identifying and exploring the importance of classificatory ip there are no studies in which the rate of intensity change or the intermittency of natural rainfall have been reproduced in rainfall simulation one factor that may be contributing to this is a lack of empirical data describing the nature of intensity fluctuations during the ips of natural rainfall high temporal resolution rainfall records universally show intensity fluctuations see for instance fig 3 of georgakakos et al 1994 which shows a time series of 5 second rainfall rates or fig 12 of smith et al 1994 which portrays intensity fluctuations in 5 minute rainfall data but data quantifying the rates of intensity change and intermittency during the ip that could be used to guide rainfall simulation experiments are almost unavailable further illustration of the high frequency intensity fluctuations of natural rainfall were derived by dunkerley 2020a using acoustic methods this paper therefore seeks to explore further the ips of natural rainfall events and the desirability of improving our representation of these in rainfall simulation experiments the principal focus of this paper is the rates of intensity change that occur during natural rainfall and which must be known in order to further refine methods of simulating natural rainfall other aspects of the ip will be discussed in further research owing to the relative neglect of ip in rainfall simulation experiments the present paper necessarily presents both a selective literature review and some illustrative data the paper has three key objectives 1 to consider the kinds of processes at the ground that are affected by the classificatory ip intensity fluctuations and intermittency of rainfall 2 to provide a guide to the magnitude and rapidity of intensity fluctuations that occur during natural rainfall because data on this are largely unavailable 3 to highlight potential limitations arising from the widespread reliance on constant intensity simulated rainfall experimentation as it applied to landsurface processes such as overland flow and soil erosion and to offer a reasoned proposal for the further development of more sophisticated and more relevant rainfall simulation methods the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a brief historical account of the consideration of classificatory ip in hydrology and related fields the following section section 3 provides a brief overview of the origin and nature of different ips in rainfall and their role in modifying surface processes data and methods are set out in section 4 followed by results in section 5 the paper concludes with discussion in section 6 and the principal conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 intensity profile in rainfall a brief history and review of its role at the landsurface in their appraisal of methods applied to the study of interrill soil erosion processes agassi bradford 1999 identified the issue of ip in passing they mentioned the intensity distribution of natural rainfall but did not examine it further ip was also listed as a significant aspect of rainfall by miller and daily 1977 in their publication rainfall factors that affect erosion there is indeed quite a long history of studies in which intensity variation has been seen as an integral and important aspect of rainfall and hence of rainfall simulation almost 80 years ago in a study of overland flow over grassed surfaces horner jens 1942 classified natural rainfall events into three temporal patterns the classificatory ips of the present paper depending on when the most intense rain fell within a rainfall event they named the ips advanced if the intensity peak arrived early intermediate if the intensity peak occurred around the mid point of the event and delayed if the intensity peak occurred toward the end of the event they also identified a uniform constant intensity ip this nomenclature is still in use e g wu et al 2006 yusof et al 2014 wang et al 2016 a et al 2018 pinheiro et al 2018 zeimetz et al 2018 their fig 2 presented schematic hyetographs illustrating advanced and delayed ips subsequently schiff 1943 adopted the nomenclature of horner jens 1942 and introduced additional ips termed interrupted reflecting the occurrence of intermittency and sporadic it is important to note here that these classificatory schemes for describing ips do not consider the actual rainfall intensities involved nor the rates at which the intensity might fluctuate during the course of a rainfall event reproducing the various classificatory ips seen in natural rainfall during rainfall simulation experiments was subsequently viewed as important and this drove methodological developments nearly 50 years ago young burwell 1972 attempted to reproduce the broad ip characteristics of three natural rainfall events that had been recorded at a research farm in minnesota usa one event storm no 45 contained two periods of rain separated by about 50 min of intermittency this natural rainfall event was simulated using a rainulator that could generate three different intensities 31 8 63 5 ad 127 mm h 1 although because of the high flow rate from the spray nozzles used the rain had to be pulsed on and off to achieve these intensities the resulting runoff and soil loss from field plots were recorded and young burwell 1972 concluded that the simulation of intensity fluctuations and intermittency increased the likelihood that the results would reflect the runoff and soil loss that would occur under similar conditions during natural rainfall this is a pioneering attempt to reproduce natural intermittency and intensity fluctuations during an ip in a similar study made more than 40 years ago alfaro hachum 1977 further refined the design of rainfall simulation apparatus in order to be able to reproduce rainfall ips with more fidelity they employed a drop forming rainfall simulator design whose water supply could be adjusted to allow rainfall intensity to be varied smoothly and continuously during an experiment they simulated a 36 minute intermediate ip event whose intensity rose and fell in a continuous convex upward ip and which peaked at 25 4 mm h 1 at mid duration see fig 3 of alfaro hachum 1977 prior to the intensity peak rainfall intensity was increased smoothly from zero for the first 18 min and then declined smoothly and progressively to zero through the 18 min after the intensity peak the mean rate of increase or decrease of rainfall intensity was thus 1 4 mm h 1 min 1 as will be shown later this is a very low rate of intensity change when judged against rates seen in natural rainfall flanagan et al 1988 later explored the effect of different classificatory ips by simulating rainfall events having a triangular ip but varying the position of the intensity maximum within a series of 1 h simulated rainfall events applied to small field plots in all cases intensity change was smooth and progressed at fixed rates before and after the intensity peak infiltration runoff and soil loss results were compared with constant intensity simulated rainfall having the same average intensity of 64 mm h 1 they established that peak runoff rates from a late peak ip were more than six times larger than from a constant intensity ip additionally they reported that soil loss rates were up to 8 5 times higher in late peak ips than in any other ip and more than three times larger than resulted from the constant intensity rain alfaro hachum 1977 concluded that constant intensity simulated rain does not result in runoff and erosion comparable to that resulting from ips that involve changing intensities frauenfeld truman 2004 undertook a further important study of runoff and interrill erosion on cultivated soils in georgia usa using a single ip with an early peak and gradual adjustments of intensity prior to and following the peak there were no periods of constant intensity at all during the event and no intermittency however an important aspect of this study was that the design of the ip that was simulated was derived from high resolution 1 min 5 min empirical data describing a single representative rainfall event recorded in their study area the experiments of young burwell 1972 alfaro hachum 1977 flanagan et al 1988 and of frauenfeld truman 2004 demonstrated the use of variable intensity rainfall simulation among the key findings to emerge and one that has been confirmed by later research was that the implementation of late intensity peaks the delayed pattern of earlier workers resulted in much greater runoff rates and soil loss from soil trays than did constant intensity rain or different classificatory ips such as the advanced pattern rather than smooth and gradational intensity adjustment moment by moment as used in some of the studies just cited more recent rainfall simulation that has involved varying ip has primarily adopted a staircase or stepped pattern in which constant intensities of simulated rain are applied for nominated periods and then varied up or down almost instantaneously in fixed step increments this was the approach of parsons stone 2006 warnamuende et al 2007 an et al 2014 chen et al 2015 fadhel et al 2018 alavinia et al 2019 and gholami et al 2021 fig 1 illustrates this kind of staircase intensity pattern it is not clear how satisfactorily such stepped sequences of constant intensity adequately reflect the intensity fluctuations during the ips of natural rainfall and this is an area in need of study these contemporary methods avoid the unnaturally smooth intensity changes that had been used in the earlier rainfall simulations just cited and are perhaps simpler to implement by switching on or off multiple spray nozzles however the possible effects of the essentially instantaneous changes of intensity remain unknown the use of both rapidly switched intensity changes and very smooth and gradual intensity changes raises the issue of which more closely resembles the rates of intensity change that occur in natural rainfall other approaches to exploring the importance of rainfall intensity have been used but generally only employing constant intensities with no ip or intensity fluctuations sometimes several different fixed intensities are employed in separate rainfall simulation experiments recently li et al 2020 for instance employed fixed extreme intensities of 60 120 150 and 180 mm h 1 for up to 2 h shojaei et al 2020 in contrast employed very short simulations of 3 to 7 min duration at constant intensities of 30 60 and 90 mm h 1 wang bi 2020 applied constant intensity simulated rainfall at 30 mm h 1 for 3 h 60 mm h 1 for 1 5 h and 90 mm h 1 for 30 min these recent studies have thus abandoned the attempt to reproduce natural intensity profiles and the associated intensity fluctuations in favour of operationally simpler though less realistic constant intensities experiments using multiple different intensities may employ separate runs using each intensity in turn or intensities applied in succession during a longer period of continuous rainfall carey paige 2016 an example is the work of nouwakpo et al 2018 who applied simulated rain to soil plots in indiana usa at 75 mm h 1 for 60 min switching without a break to 25 mm h 1 for 15 min and finally to 100 mm h 1 for 15 min the total rainfall duration was 90 min and each interval was intended to allow a steady runoff rate to be achieved the authors did not analyse the resulting soil loss from different agricultural treatments the underlying subject of the study separately for each intensity nevertheless from the foregoing review of the effects of ip it seems likely that much of the runoff and sediment would have resulted from the final interval of rain at 100 mm 1 since the sequence of applied rainfall intensities actually constitutes a late peak ip despite being intended to separately resolve the effects of each different intensity used this goal may simply not be achievable using what is in effect a single ip the same consideration applies to the work of warnemuende et al 2007 who applied in sequence 50 mm h 1 for 50 min 75 mm h 1 for 15 min 25 mm h 1 for 15 min and finally 100 mm h 1 for 15 min again without any break in rainfall in this way effectively a late peak or delayed event ip was created which would likely have resulted in disproportionately high runoff in the final most intense period of simulated rainfall nevertheless the intensity profile involved only a few fixed intensities with no intensity fluctuation at all during each interval of constant intensity and no intermittency as just noted many rainfall simulation studies hold intensity constant for up to several hours table 1 such constant intensity simulation cannot be used to explore such subjects as the different impact of a short but intense summer convective storm having early peak ip versus a long duration and less intense frontal rainfall event with a late peak ip nor compare rates of soil loss between two different locations where the rain has contrasting ips identifying these differences is potentially important to understanding the annual pattern of runoff and soil loss furthermore given that ips may change with rising temperatures in a warmer future fadhel et al 2018 when rainfall intensities may also change neglecting intensity profile makes many experimental results of limited use in supporting forecasts of future land surface processes such an infiltration or soil loss that have clear relevance to issues of importance to society including water supply and sustainable agricultural production 2 1 why has the historical focus on ip become relatively neglected it may be that the dominance of constant intensity rainfall simulation and the relative neglect of ip table 1 reflects an intention to standardise experimental conditions however relative rankings of soil loss among different soil types or treatments could remain erroneous if for instance study area a had a rainfall climate of early peak convective storms and comparison area b had late peak events or perhaps more intermittent events applying constant intensity rainfall simulation to both would by likely to lead to an under estimate of runoff and soil loss in area b and might over estimate both in a such that any resulting ranking of relative erodibilities or erosion rates between the two locations would be of questionable validity perhaps worse the magnitude of the over or under estimation would be unknown thus a belief that constant intensity perhaps regarded as some kind of standardisation allows valid comparison between soil types locations or crop management practices may well be misplaced an additional component of natural rainfall that is also overlooked in constant intensity rainfall simulation is of course the typical frequency and rate of intensity fluctuations during the ip of natural local rainfall thus if one comparator site experiences more intensity bursts or more rapid and intense intensity bursts than another site with which a comparison is required then again constant intensity rainfall simulation of conditions at these two sites can only lead to unrepresentative experimental conditions and inter site comparisons whose validity must be in doubt 3 how do different ips arise and how do they affect processes at the landsurface it is appropriate here to consider briefly the origin nature and role of the ip and intensity fluctuations of natural rainfall the origin of the ip in precipitation processes is first considered and then its impacts at the landsurface are reviewed these sections are not intended to provide comprehensive reviews but to offer sufficient background to allow the data on intensity fluctuations presented later to be seen in their wider context 3 1 the nature and origin of the ip and intensity fluctuations of rainfall intensity variations during the course of a rainfall event are virtually ubiquitous being evident in all records of intensity variation e g m√°ca torfs 2009 nel et al 2016 gabella et al 2014 reported that rainfall rate expressed in mm h 1 can change by an order of magnitude in 10 min for rainfall events as distinct from rain hours or days intensity variations can involve more than an order of magnitude change in rainfall intensity between the peak and the average intensity of the event further data on this characteristic are presented below as noted earlier the distribution of rainfall amount and rainfall rate within a rainfall event have frequently been broadly characterised by the classificatory huff curves huff 1967 huff curve and related accumulation mass curve methods remain in use for rainfall description and analysis e g yin et al 2016 for china zeimetz et al 2018 for switzerland though not all studies employ huff analyses as an example of quartile analysis nel 2007 reported from south africa a dominance of first and second quartile events in intense rainfall events around the drakensburg escarpment in part this reflects the fact that short convective events primarily occurring in summer are dominantly early peak events moseley et al 2013 westra et al 2014 events of longer duration much less frequently exhibit first quartile ips but rather tend to have more complex ips with multiple intensity peaks and fluctuations dunkerley 2019a in other rainfall climatologies quartiles other than the first quartile may become dominant gilan et al 2010 provided an example from iran in which the largest fraction of rainfall events of 1 3 h duration 48 3 was made up of fourth quartile events where the most intense rain falls late in the event data of this kind have been published for relatively few locations globally and further analyses are needed not least to guide rainfall simulation experiments in the different regions it has been shown that even in a single region the classificatory ip can differ among events with different durations and can also vary among the seasons e g between summer storms and winter storms the link between ip and event duration has been widely reported bustami et al 2012 yoon et al 2012 dol≈°ak et al 2016 a et al 2018 for instance reported that in rainfall event data from north china early peak events had the shortest average duration 9 1 h whilst late peak events had the longest average duration 13 1 h likewise changes in ip from summer to winter and between the wet and dry seasons are known tsubo et al 2005 fadhel et al 2018 yusof et al 2014 for instance encountered central peak intermediate rainfall events only in the south west monsoon season in johor malaysia during the north west monsoon and in the inter monsoon periods only early peak events were recorded the origin of early peak events is generally considered to lie in the nature of convective rainfall especially when driven by late afternoon surface heating that is rapidly nullified by evaporative cooling of the soil surface once rain begins in this way the most rapid moisture convergence and uplift occur early in the rainfall event and intensity thereafter wanes the explanation for the arrival of other ips is less clear but the interaction of wind and topography may be involved nel 2007 massmann et al 2017 investigated orographic precipitation in chile and noted that an increase in intensity late in rainfall events reflected a change from ice initiated to warm rain periods it may well be that via such mechanisms event duration influences the occurrence of late peak events as for early peak events for the case of switzerland zeimetz et al 2018 suggested that the country wide generalised mass curve that they proposed could be refined to account more fully for the possible differences in ip among orographic convective and frontal precipitation events from such studies which are certainly needed we would learn more about how event duration and precipitation mechanisms affect ip areas where knowledge is far from complete in addition to the classificatory ip the intra event fluctuations of intensity within the ip have potential importance to landsurface processes this subject is briefly considered next 3 2 intra event intensity fluctuations and their origin physical and micro physical processes in clouds and the sub cloud atmosphere drive continuous fluctuations in the intensity of rainfall arrival at the ground these can be related to the rate and vigour of turbulent convective uplift from the surface to the effects of wind and boundary layer turbulence on drop trajectories and arrival at the ground on sub cloud evaporation rates of moisture convergence surface cooling by evaporation during rainfall and many other factors in trade wind showers there may be bubbles of moist air that arise over warm ocean surfaces which persist as short lived rain events over land woodcock 1960 connor bonell 1998 owing to such mechanisms rain may begin and end abruptly many times during a rainfall event or a day more generally rapidly developing and weakening turbulence appears to be capable of causing rainfall to begin and end very sharply over periods of just seconds during rainfall intensity may fall to zero during periods of true intermittency or may be continuous but with changing intensity through the entire duration of an event periods of intermittency may have durations of only a few minutes or may last for more than an hour dunkerley 2020 see for instance fig 1 in torri et al 1999 intermittency is a relatively neglected aspect of the intensity variation that comprises the ip but one with relevance to many surface processes 3 3 how does ip influence surface processes whilst its variation globally remains only partly documented classificatory ip has been shown in multiple studies to be an important aspect of catchment response to rainfall and is a component of many studies designed to predict peak flood discharges and flood flow volumes rahman et al 2006 demonstrated that design flood estimates for the gold coast region queensland australia varied by 250 depending on the choice of ip used for rainfall input to a hydrological model for the same rainfall depth from saudi arabia ewea et al 2016 likewise found that if the locally dominant early peak rainfall patterns were not used as input to a hydrological model and instead a more intermediate ip was employed runoff peaks could be over estimated by up to 68 this was because early peak events resulted in less runoff for the same rainfall depth than did events with late rainfall peaks for developing warnings of flash flooding in southern china zhai et al 2018 likewise concluded that the occurrence of flooding could be under predicted if the occurrence of late peaking rainfall was not appropriately allowed for in predictive models because such events result in more runoff than did events with early intensity peaks all of these studies show that successful prediction of runoff peaks and total volumes can depend on a correct representation of the ip of the rainfall this in turn requires that the ip characteristics of the local rainfall have been established from suitable observational data whilst ip has been considered as an influential parameter in hydrologic and flood studies it has less often been included in the analysis of hillslope hydrology erosion and sediment yield this is important because the most commonly used approach relying on simulated rainfall of constant intensity may result in the smallest amount of surface runoff and the smallest peak discharges dunkerley 2012 guan et al 2016 see tables 3 and 4 it therefore probably results in the shallowest and slowest overland flow which in turn would reduce its capacity for soil dislodgment and transport therefore rainfall simulation at constant intensity is unlikely to be able to reveal how infiltration overland flow and soil erosion might operate during natural rainfall events even if the mean intensities had been selected to correspond with that of natural rainfall in the study region however targeted research is needed to explore and evaluate such hypotheses further because existing evidence is very limited some published studies that explore the importance of ip in landsurface processes are summarised in table 2 two rainfall events of the same average intensity may have distinctly different ips and therefore ip must be resolved at intra event timescales bustami et al 2012 yoon et al 2012 this establishes a need for suitable rainfall data having sufficient temporal resolution the unavailability of such data and of analyses of ip may thus hinder the development of relevant rainfall simulation conditions at particular field locations as tables 3 and 4 show the difference between constant early peak and late peak ips in terms of runoff ratio peak runoff rate and other parameters can be considerable reaching hundreds of percent at plot scale however much more research is required to develop a fuller understanding of the importance of ip intermittency is a neglected aspect of ip but one which is also relevant to processes at the soil surface periods of reduced rainfall intensity or of true intermittency allow soil infiltrability to partially recover toward pre rain values dunkerley 2018 permit surface ponding to partially or wholly dissipate aryal et al 2007 and allow some drying of vegetation canopies kume et al 2008 understory vegetation and ground litter so regenerating rainfall interception capacity studies employing high temporal resolution rainfall data have shown that even in very wet climates the aggregate duration of true intermittency may occupy on average more than one third of a rain day or more than 8 h dunkerley 2018 this non raining time can be comprised of multiple short and long cessations of rainfall even in rainfall events of short duration intermittency is commonly present dunkerley 2020 these characteristics of natural rainfall ips and their associated intensity fluctuations are almost always neglected in rainfall simulation experiments and again this may in part be because those aspects of local natural rainfall have not been documented in summary the effects of rainfall ips appear to be significant for many landsurface processes though much remains to be learned for the diversity of contexts where ip may be influential table 2 and about the variation of ip with the climatological context 3 4 what accounts for the effects of different ips and associated intensity fluctuations at the landsurface the reason for the reduced surface runoff reported from some early peak events and enhanced runoff from some late peak events has not been thoroughly explored in the case of early peak ips these effects can be hypothesised to result from the arrival of the most intense rain on dry soils whose infiltrability is still high in late peak events the soil is pre wetted before the most intense rain arrives and rain is therefore more rapidly partitioned into surface ponding and then surface runoff it may also be more likely that depression storages have also been partially filled by the time of the intense rain in a late peak event or else fill and are overtopped more rapidly when the intense rain commences moreover by the time of arrival of a late intensity peak the soil infiltrability would be reduced in comparison with the infiltrability earlier in the event as described for instance by the classical horton infiltration model that relates declining infiltrability to the lapse of time during rainfall given that runoff rates may consequently be higher in late peak ips the overland flow across the soil surface must be both deeper and faster than runoff occurring in early peaks of comparable intensity because flow depth affects the intensity of splash impact forces felt at the soil surface ip can be anticipated to affect soil erosion as well this has been confirmed experimentally but the exact mechanisms provide a potentially fruitful field for future research an area that remains completely unresearched is the importance of the rate of intensity fluctuation within rainfall events having different classificatory ips early peak late peak etc for instance we might enquire whether typical short early peak convective rainfall events contain more rapid and potentially erosive intensity bursts than do longer intermediate ip events or whether intense events of any given ip have more intensity bursts than less intense events of the same ip such questions cannot presently be answered we now turn to the rainfall data that are analysed here to document the nature of the ips of rainfall at two australian locations as well as from some published reports from locations including usa japan germany and norfolk island australia these data are used to document the magnitudes and rates of intensity fluctuations that make up the ips at these sites and are intended to provide a guide to what may be required in rainfall simulation experiments that simulate rainfall ips having variable rainfall intensities in such experiments the rate at which rainfall intensity changes before and following intensity peaks including intermittency the decline to zero intensity would ideally be known and reproduced during rainfall simulation 4 data and methods the data on rainfall intensity fluctuations presented here were derived from seven published studies table 4 and from the author s own field data the published data were available as graphical intensity time plots from which the numerical values were extracted by using an on screen digitiser the permitted rates of intensity change to be calculated the author s observations were collected at two australian ground observing stations one in a wet tropical location near the township of millaa millaa in far norther queensland hereafter mm and the other at an arid location the fowlers gap arid zone research station in far western new south wales hereafter fg the mm station has a mean annual rainfall of 3000 mm and the fg station 220 mm these observing stations in contrasting environments were studied in order to enquire whether there were differences in the ips associated with the external climatic type and if so how large any variability was further details of the two sites were provided in dunkerley 2019a 2019b 2020a 2020b the ground observing station data were collected using tipping bucket rain gauges tbrgs equipped with event data loggers the gregorian date and clock time of each bucket tip were logged to the nearest 1 sec in data processing these events were recoded as modified julian dates using fortran subroutines from the international astronomical union standards of fundamental astronomy http www iausofa org the unaggregated inter tip times were analysed here because they retain the highest temporal resolution possible for tbrg data some intensity information is forfeited when rainfall amounts are aggregated for instance to hourly totals individual inter tip times itts were used to estimate intensity on the assumption that the intensity is constant during the filling time of the tbrg bucket then 1 r t2 t1 Œ¥v t2 t1 where r is the rainfall rate mm h 1 between times t1 and t2 the clock times of two successive bucket tip events hour and Œ¥v is the recorded rain depth mm that is a function of the bucket capacity for mm this was 0 2 mm and for fg 0 5 mm the data were grouped into rainfall events using a minimum inter event time mit criterion of 6 h dunkerley 2008 the tip event data were also aggregated to rainfall amounts in various commonly used accumulation durations ads and 15 min data are analysed here subsequently the standard deviation of the 15 min rainfall rates was calculated separately for individual rainfall events as a measure of the intra event intensity variation the relationship between the total rainfall delivered in an event and the standard deviation of the intra event 15 min rainfall rates was then examined the mean event intensity was derived from the unaggregated itt data expressed in minutes from the value of n the number of itts in the rainfall event and Œ¥v the bucket capacity of the tbrg 2 i ave i 1 n 60 Œ¥ v itt i the mean intensity was subsequently regressed against the maximum intensity judged from unaggregated itts as per equation 1 in order to investigate how these two measures of event intensity are linked likewise the standard deviation of the 15 minute intensities was regressed against mean event intensity to document the extent of dependency of variability in intensity on the mean intensity of the enclosing event 4 1 a note on linear regression models applied to intra event intensity variation the various regression relationships reported here linking mean event intensity to measures of intra event intensity variation equations 3 6 below all exhibit significant scatter figs 3 and 4 as would be anticipated from the high variability in the characteristics of rainfall events analysis of the residuals from the regression models established that they are not normally distributed as confirmed by shapiro wilk tests shapiro wilk 1965 however in all of the cases analysed here the sample sizes are very large involving hundreds of rainfall events at both mm and fg in applying linear regression to such cases normality of the distribution of residuals from regression becomes much less important and has been shown to have little or no impact on the statistical validity and power of fitted linear models schmidt finan 2018 knief forstmeier 2021 likewise as in all applications of linear models normality is not a requirement for the dependent or independent variables employed in linear regression k√©ry hatfield 2003 5 results the results presented here first document the rapidity of the intensity variations that make up the ip of natural rainfall on the basis of published high resolution data from a number of global locations further statistics are then presented based on pluviography data collected at the two australian ground observing stations 5 1 the nature of intensity profiles in natural rainfall from published data the data extracted from published high resolution data are presented in table 5 representative major intensity fluctuations were selected from each rainfall record and the rates of intensity increase and decrease calculated table 5 here data on rates of intensity fluctuation from published studies these data demonstrate that intensity fluctuations can occur at very rapid rates exceeding 100 mm h 1 min 1 in several cases it is evident that the two lowest rates of intensity fluctuation are derived from data at 1 min resolution much higher rates are seen when the temporal resolution is finer inspection of the original intensity time plots in the published studies cited in table 4 confirms that rainfall arrival in many cases involved no steady rainfall rates but rather involved continually changing intensity with rapid increases and decreases of intensity for rainfall simulation studies it may not be necessary for such very rapid intensity fluctuations to be replicated since the response time of surface ponding or the smoothing of intensity variations by canopy and litter interception keim et al 2006 or the time needed for overland flow to deepen or become shallower would smooth the effects of such rapid fluctuations however it is relatively easy to simulate the intensity variation seen in the 1 min data using appropriate rainfall simulation apparatus and there is a strong case for this to become a protocol that should be considered in rainfall simulation experiments ideally this would be guided by knowledge of the local seasonal rainfall conditions in individual study areas currently there are insufficient high resolution data to characterise seasonal rainfall arrival in wet tropical temperate trade wind or dryland environments in terms of ips but local data can be gathered relatively easily using widely available tbrgs as illustrated next 5 2 rate and magnitude of intensity fluctuations in the mm and fg field data a great deal of temporal detail is present in data on rainfall intensity derived from unaggregated itts fig 2 and these confirm the occurrence of rapid intensity fluctuations during rainfall arrival and that periods of constant intensity are simply not seen in data having sufficiently high temporal resolution of course coarsening the time resolution reduces the apparent occurrence of intensity fluctuations e g see fig 3 in dunkerley 2019c the intensity fluctuations evident in fig 2 mm event 589 are comparable to those listed in table 4 thus the first rapid intensity increase labelled 1 on fig 2 occurs at a rate of 556 mm h 1 min 1 this confirms that ordinary tbrg data if unaggregated can reveal these extremely rapid and frequent intensity changes thus a means to examine intensity fluctuations that is probably widely possible especially in hydrologic and erosional research is to use the unaggregated inter tip times itts of tipping bucket rain gauges tbrgs this type of gauge is relatively inexpensive and widely used in field experiments itts can be 10 s in intense rainfall 100 mm h 1 for a 0 2 mm bucket sensitivity unaggregated itts can be converted to the equivalent rainfall rate using equation 1 even the most rapid intensity fluctuations presented in table 4 suggest that maximum fluctuation rates might often be no more than 500 mm h 1 min 1 or 8 mm h 1 s 1 and more often at rates of 100 mm h 1 min 1 or 1 7 mm h 1 s 1 this leads to some residual uncertainty in the rain rate that accounts for observed bucket filling times in order to describe the magnitude of intensity fluctuations rather than their rate of occurrence the relationships between maximum event intensity imax based on the shortest itt in each rainfall event and the mean event rainfall intensity iave were determined for the mm and fg rainfall events both are fitted by power function regression models fig 3 the regression models fig 3 are respectively for the mm rainfall events 3 imax 15 6 iave 0 96 r2 0 34 for the fg rainfall events 4 imax 5 1 iave 0 92 r2 0 36 these relationships confirm that the maximum intensity within a rainfall event increases with the mean intensity of that event some of these maximum intensity values would represent quite short lived intensity bursts within the ip of the event dunkerley 2019c it is important to emphasise that the level of explained variance in equations 3 and 4 is only modest there may be multiple factors influencing this outcome which almost certainly include the inability of a single minimum itt maximum intensity to characterise rainfall events with complex intensity profiles nevertheless these equations serve as an indication of the tendency of maximum intensity to be larger in rainfall events that have higher mean intensities and suggest that these two measures of intensity are linked by a power function relationship the variability in rainfall rates during events can also be readily described by calculating the standard deviation of the intensities calculated as above using itts aggregated to longer timescales more typical of the data available in rainfall records this has been done for 399 rainfall events at mm and 245 events from fg tallying all itts to yield rainfall amounts and thus intensities for 15 min intervals fig 4 the linear regression relationships between the mean rainfall event intensity and the maximum 15 minute rainfall rate for mm and for fg are plotted in fig 4 for the mm data the relationship between the standard deviation œÉ i 15 in mm h 1 and event mean 15 min intensity i 15 in mm h 1 is 5 œÉ i 15 1 04 i 15 0 69 r 2 0 75 and for the fg data with the same units 6 œÉ i 15 0 82 i 15 0 76 r 2 0 76 these relationships indicate that the standard deviation of all intra event 15 min rainfall rates increases with the overall mean rainfall event intensity this presumably simply reflects the fact that more intense rainfall events have a higher intensity not because the events consist entirely of intense rainfall but rather in part at least because they include more bursts of rainfall at higher intensities as shown in fig 1 given that the intensity cannot be less than zero such bursts of high intensity rain increase both the intensity and the variance of intensities the level of explained variance in equations 5 and 6 is notably larger than for the analysis of peak intensity equations 3 and 4 this is likely to arise in part from the many 15 minute intervals within the analysed rainfall events reaching a maximum of 157 at fg and 827 at mm in comparison with the single measure of peak intensity employed in equations 3 and 4 for rainfall simulation the implication from both of the descriptions of intensity fluctuation just presented based on unaggregated itts and also on aggregated 15 min data is that the variability of rainfall intensities ought to increase in proportion to the mean intensity being simulated in other words simulated rain of higher intensity should also contain a wider range of intensities in the form of fluctuations in the intensity profile quantitative detail is important if simulated rainfall events are to correspond as closely as possible to natural events to illustrate this with the field data from mm and fg table 6 presents data on the distributions of the ratios of maximum event intensity based on the shortest itt in each event to the mean event intensity these data show that for both sites the most common ratio is 5 however the mean is 28 9 for fg and 41 3 for mm in other words the maximum intensity imax at mm is on average more than 41 times higher than the mean event intensity iave the mm data extend to much higher ratios the maximum being 759 table 5 also details the upper percentiles of the distribution of this ratio the 90th percentile for mm is 95 3 whilst for fg it is only 32 8 an important result emerging from these analyses is that the variability of rainfall intensity fluctuations within events at the arid and wet tropical field sites differ significantly the wet tropical mm site displays maximum intensities within events that are larger than the mean event intensity by a much larger proportion than occurs at fg this is consistent with the higher coefficient in equation 3 for mm than in equation 4 for fg 6 discussion the evidence presented above confirms that intensity fluctuations are both frequent essentially continuous during natural rainfall and that the intensity fluctuations can occur at rapid rates hundreds of mm h 1 per minute as the integration time through which the rainfall arrivals are aggregated increases the apparent magnitude and rate of the intensity fluctuations diminishes as is well known since rapid events are smoothed when intense and less intense intervals are lumped nevertheless even in the mm tbrg data processed as unaggregated itts intensity fluctuations are frequent and rapid occurring at rates of at least 555 mm h 1 min 1 fig 1 with dynamic cloud microphysical processes and atmospheric turbulence in the sub cloud atmosphere rain of constant intensity simply does not occur this is precisely the observation made in a study of rainfall in mauritius nel et al 2016 thus the ip of a rainfall event is a trend in rainfall rate perhaps reaching a maximum in the first or last quartile or some other section of the event but with rapid intensity fluctuations superimposed upon it as many workers have pointed out on the basis of rainfall simulation experiments using idealised geometric representations of the ips seen in natural rainfall e g strickland et al 2005 franklin et al 2007 truman et al 2007 constant intensity rainfall simulation is inappropriate for many investigations the differences between measures of infiltration and surface runoff between constant intensity and early peak or late peak rainfall events of the same total depth and average intensity can reach hundreds of percent importantly all of this occurs even if the constant and variable intensity rainfall simulations have the same average intensity and deliver the same total rainfall depth and in the same event duration as shown in a number of the studies cited above this in turn suggests that even if two natural rainfall events had the same average intensity they might well result in different runoff ratios and runoff rates and soil losses depending on their individual ips this finding once again suggests that the supposed advantage of constant intensity rainfall simulation namely the ability to make comparisons between different sites under the same test conditions may not in fact be helpful in understanding infiltration rates or soil erosion processes 6 1 can a consideration of ip add value to rainfall simulation experiments all of this suggests strongly that neglect of ips and their associated intensity fluctuations in most rainfall simulation experiments table 1 is resulting in test conditions that diverge widely from those of natural rainfall evidently for many studies constant intensity rainfall simulation is not appropriate its use may indeed conceal important effects important for landsurface processes our understanding of seasonally varying rainfall event characteristics for instance or the changes likely in soil surface processes as climate change alters ips would be enhanced if these were included in rainfall simulation protocols an alternative approach to exploring this would be for more comparative studies of paired co located runoff plot responses to natural rainfall and to simulated rainfall indeed a greater reliance on observations under natural rainfall where this is practicable within the time constraints of many research efforts would remove any concern with the appropriateness of the rainfall simulation protocol it would also remove another concern with rainfall simulation that relates to the representation of natural ips the limited duration of most simulation experiments which are commonly only 30 min in duration and rarely exceed 1 h table 3 wang et al 2016 adopted the approach of observing the effects of natural rainfall for studying the erosion of experimental soil plots in china there results showed that the delayed ip in natural rainfall resulted in the greatest soil erosion mohamadi kavian 2015 reached the same conclusion from plots exposed to natural rainfall in iran the study of the effects of natural rainfall events on soil plots was also the protocol adopted by guimar√£es et al 2017 studying erosion in eucalyptus plantations in brazil in this study they used the three way ip classification of horner jens 1942 and found that the advanced pattern was the most common and accounted for more soil loss than the delayed pattern possibly because the intensity was higher in the advanced rainfall events this is the kind of situation where data on natural rainfall become important in making the correct interpretation of the experimental results they show that generalisations about the effects of different ips should be made cautiously this was further illustrated by the results of tao et al 2017 who found greatest soil and nutrient loss from rainfall simulations in which the intensity was maximal early in the course of 90 minute simulations diversity in outcomes merely strengthens the case for additional research giving attention for instance to possible sediment exhaustion effects that may modify the erosional outcome from any particular ip soil properties and characteristics may exert a diversity of possible influences on the interaction between ip overland flow and erosion an example is the effect of changing soil surface microtopography and roughness during the course of a rainfall event this was explored by luo et al 2020 using sequences of three simulated rainfall intensities 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 each held constant for 30 60 min but applied to roughened soil surfaces in sequences of increasing or decreasing intensity as abstractions of the more complex ips of natural rainfall luo et al 2020 were able to illustrate some of the interactions of the rainfall ip the soil surface morphology and the runoff rate many opportunities exist for such work exploring litter or plant cover effects for instance and extending simple sequences of fixed intensities to more fully developed ips ideally including realistic levels of rainfall intermittency and intensity fluctuation the importance of the experimental control of rainfall intensity duration and other characteristics and freedom from weather constraints ensure that rainfall simulation is a valuable and in some cases essential research tool however to increase its relevance to natural conditions ip and associated intensity fluctuations should increasingly be added to the aspects of rainfall arrival that need to be considered and reproduced in an informed and relevant way 6 2 the case for improved incorporation of ip in rainfall simulation experiments in terms of the assessment of key processes such as rill and interrill soil erosion mechanisms or the relative erosion rates of different tillage and mulching practices it may be helpful to ask directly why does ip matter this can be re phrased as asking in effect what is wrong with applying simulated rainfall at high and fixed intensities the most general answer is that natural rainfall is not like this constant rainfall intensities have been shown to result in lower rates of surface runoff and lower peak runoff rates than variable intensity rainfall having the same mean intensity this means that surface runoff will be both shallower and slower in constant intensity rain than in variable intensity rain in turn the shallower flow means that drop impact and splash dislodgement will be less attenuated by the cushioning effect that can be created by the presence of surface water mutchler and hansen 1970 the effect of mulch or stone cover may therefore appear to be more significant in reducing erosion than would be the case in variable intensity rain with higher flow depths when the cushioning of drop impacts by surface water would itself reduce soil dislodgement even more fundamentally the reduced runoff rate expected from constant intensity rainfall may mean that soil loss operates under transport limited conditions so limiting the size and load of particles that can be removed from experimental plots and making soil detachment processes less influential in overall load of eroded soil materials in variable intensity rain with its higher peak runoff rates detachment limited conditions are more probable making key drivers of interrill soil detachment intensity drop size and kinetic energy of greater importance ran et al 2012 reproducing the sediment transport conditions that arise under natural local rainfall transport or detachment limited is clearly vital if we are to understand the role of rainfall integral parameters such as depth duration and intensity it is worth noting that describing and analysing the intensity profile of rainfall and its relevance to landsurface processes offers scope for considerable development of analytical methods in particular rainfall depth rainfall intensity and the lengths of antecedent rainless periods are all rainfall event characteristics of relevance to many processes rainfall events can be analysed using various classification methods that extend the early or late peak peak descriptors for instance both lana et al 2020 working on flood producing rainfalls in the barcelona district of spain and ni song 2020 working on the conditions responsible for the triggering of debris flows in china have used clustering methods to identify multiple classes of local rainfall events these provide the potential to analyse not just intra event characteristics but the context of a rainfall event in terms of longer term perhaps multi day rainfalls and can incorporate rainfall amounts as well as intensities such methods might be developed to include also the rates of intensity change during rainfall and the frequency and duration of periods of intra event intermittency 7 conclusions there is ample evidence that rainfall ip is an important characteristic of rainfall arrival ips have been classified and their importance recognised for almost 80 years modern rainfall simulation apparatus with computer control of flow rates makes it possible to incorporate some representation albeit an imperfect one of the kinds of ips and intensity fluctuations seen in natural rainfall this has been possible to some extent for more than 40 years since early designs for rainfall simulators that could deliver changing intensities became available even in other areas of measurement such as the estimation of soil hydraulic conductivity it has been realised that the application of water in an inappropriate way such as static water ponding in a cylinder infiltrometer may result in very misleading results as multiple analyses have shown more reasonable results may be obtained from rainfall simulation or by pouring the infiltrometer water from a substantial height above the soil to mimic at least partially the kinetic energy delivered by rainfall to advance our understanding of the ways in which rainfall ips affect infiltration runoff soil loss and many related processes several challenges arise first we need additional studies of intensity and ips from a range of rainfall climates ideally these would permit us to identify any contrasts between convective and stratiform rain for instance or short and long rainfalls or winter and summer rainfall in a range of locations in addition to the overall ip it is desirable to document the range and speed of intensity fluctuations that characterise natural rainfall given that short intensity bursts may drive pulses of sediment dislodgment and transport second it is desirable when possible to use conventional and well established runoff plot methods but exposed to natural rainfall rather than simulated rainfall in this way if the appropriate rainfall characteristics are monitored including ip then those that are most important to soil surface processes could be identified via statistical analysis these aspects of rainfall having been identified could then be targeted for incorporation into rainfall simulation protocols third because the bulk of rainfall simulation studies continue to employ constant and often very high intensities with no representation of ip we need to progress to more appropriate protocols that better capture the character of natural rainfall arrival even if we are unable to reproduce with fidelity the fine details of natural ips it appears essential that we capture at least the broad character of classificatory ips such as early peak versus late peak as well as the ratio of peak intensity to average intensity only by making progress on these various challenges will we be able to understand more completely key soil surface processes and perhaps be able to analyse and manage the kinds of change in these processes that might occur in coming decades as a warmer climate

4098,the temporal sequence of fluctuating rainfall intensities during an event the intensity profile or rainfall pattern is known to affect water partitioning at the ground surface and associated erosional processes there can be large differences in runoff ratios and runoff rates between early peak and late peak events and hence in the depth speed and sediment transport capacity of resulting overland flow whilst rainfall intensity may fluctuate continually during all ips in natural rainfall there is little information on the rates of such intensity fluctuations that can be used to guide the design of rainfall simulation experiments this review analyses relevant data derived from published high resolution rainfall records and also from new analyses of data from australian ground observing stations both sources confirm the occurrence of rates of intensity change of greater than 500 mm h 1 min 1 it is suggested that the fluctuating intensities characteristic of natural rainfall need to be employed in rainfall simulation experiments in order to generate results applicable to natural landsurface processes like infiltration or soil removal constant intensity rain as commonly used in rainfall simulation experiments lacks both the kinds of rapid intensity fluctuations seen in natural rainfall as well as any representation of natural intensity profiles these unrepresentative conditions can result in lower runoff rates and larger proportions of infiltration than when intensity fluctuations are present there is thus a strong case for changing the design of rainfall simulation to reflect more closely natural intensity fluctuations and intensity profiles and their influence on key surface processes such as overland flow and soil erosion keywords intensity profile intensity fluctuations storm pattern rainfall simulation soil erosion infiltration 1 introduction rainfall simulation is a widely applied research tool that has contributed to our understanding of landsurface processes in hydrology geomorphology soil erosion studies and related fields specific subjects investigated have included infiltration rates the timing of overland flow production during rainfall the detachment and removal of soil particles and nutrients as a result of drop impacts and overland flow and the development of surface seals and crusts from rain impact in order to maximise the usefulness of experimental results in enhancing our understanding of such processes simulated rainfall should correspond as closely as possible to the important characteristics of natural rainfall as they bear on each process or mechanism failure to reproduce these characteristics which might include drop sizes intensity duration depth and others is a widely identified concern regarding the appropriateness of rainfall simulation as a research tool hall 1970 riezebos seyhan 1977 agassi bradford 1999 grismer 2012 a universal feature of natural rainfall is that its intensity fluctuates continually this characteristic can therefore be included on the list of rainfall properties that may need to be correctly reproduced in rainfall simulations the continually changing intensities have been variously referred to as comprising the intensity distribution intensity profile storm pattern rainfall pattern or rainfall temporal pattern the latter term however has a broader meaning often to refer to the pattern of rainfall arrival through weeks months or the seasons sombroek 2001 zhang liu 2016 mitra et al 2019 raz yaseef et al 2012 in the present paper the term intensity profile hereafter ip is used to refer to the entire sequence of time varying intensities that makes up a rainfall event storm pattern is avoided because not all rainfall arrives from storms and rainfall pattern does not clearly relate to temporal rather than spatial patterns at least three distinct aspects of the ips that occur in natural rainfall need to be identified the first may be referred to as the classificatory ip which refers to the overall form of the ip of an event viz whether the rainfall exhibits for instance an intensity peak early or late in the course of an event the use of such classifications has quite a long history thus huff 1967 introduced a classification of ip by quartiles in which the ip was classified as being first quartile second quartile etc depending on which quarter of the event duration received the largest rainfall depth equally that quartile can be said to have experienced the highest average rainfall rate this kind of classificatory ip nomenclature does not depend on the absolute rainfall depths or intensities involved nor on their rate of change during the event a first quartile event might involve very intense rain or merely very low intensity rain without this affecting the classification the second aspect of ips in natural rainfall that must be considered is the actual rate of change of rainfall intensity during the course of the ip for instance regardless of its position during the duration of the rainfall event an interval of high intensity might be reached and perhaps followed by a gradual and progressive change in intensity or by very rapid changes to form what has been termed an intensity burst dunkerley 2019c a third aspect of ip is true intermittency when the rainfall ceases temporarily this is a very common phenomenon trenberth et al 2017 and is relevant to infiltration runoff and other phenomena not least because periods of intermittency allow some recovery of soil infiltrability and the partial or complete dissipation of ephemeral surface ponding and runoff dunkerley 2020b 2021 it is suggested here that in using rainfall simulation to explore and understand infiltration overland flow soil detachment and other important landsurface processes it is desirable to reproduce all three aspects of ip in a way that corresponds as closely as possible with the ip characteristics of natural rainfall in each particular study location historically in rainfall simulation experiments that rely on constant intensity simulated rainfall mostly generated using spray nozzles all aspects of ip have been neglected the classificatory ip the rates of intensity change and the occurrence of intermittency dunkerley 2020b dunkerley 2021 failure to reflect these characteristics of natural rainfall may contribute to the limited success reported by studies seeking to validate rainfall simulation as a research tool dunkerley 2021 it can be concluded that the complexity of natural intensity profiles is not captured in the majority of rainfall simulation studies indeed whilst the fixed intensities used in most rainfall simulations are sometimes selected to correspond with the kinds of intensities that occur in a study region they are often selected without any particular rationale being offered dunkerley 2008 the most likely explanation being that the conditions are dictated by the available pumps and spray nozzle hardware only in a minority of studies is a classificatory ip adopted for the simulated rain and in fewer still is the adopted ip based upon the kinds of natural ips recorded in the study region some examples are provided below almost no rainfall simulation studies give any consideration to the rates of intensity fluctuations or to intermittency during the ip tao et al 2017 2 consequently emphasised that the influence of rainfall patterns intensity profile on runoff erosion and nutrient loss has rarely been investigated the relative neglect of ip is of concern because there is sufficient published evidence to demonstrate that the ip of rainfall can affect water partitioning and other landsurface processes ip is also known to influence flood peaks and flood discharges especially in urban and urbanising areas guan et al 2016 zeimetz et al 2018 mu et al 2020 whilst increasingly researchers are identifying and exploring the importance of classificatory ip there are no studies in which the rate of intensity change or the intermittency of natural rainfall have been reproduced in rainfall simulation one factor that may be contributing to this is a lack of empirical data describing the nature of intensity fluctuations during the ips of natural rainfall high temporal resolution rainfall records universally show intensity fluctuations see for instance fig 3 of georgakakos et al 1994 which shows a time series of 5 second rainfall rates or fig 12 of smith et al 1994 which portrays intensity fluctuations in 5 minute rainfall data but data quantifying the rates of intensity change and intermittency during the ip that could be used to guide rainfall simulation experiments are almost unavailable further illustration of the high frequency intensity fluctuations of natural rainfall were derived by dunkerley 2020a using acoustic methods this paper therefore seeks to explore further the ips of natural rainfall events and the desirability of improving our representation of these in rainfall simulation experiments the principal focus of this paper is the rates of intensity change that occur during natural rainfall and which must be known in order to further refine methods of simulating natural rainfall other aspects of the ip will be discussed in further research owing to the relative neglect of ip in rainfall simulation experiments the present paper necessarily presents both a selective literature review and some illustrative data the paper has three key objectives 1 to consider the kinds of processes at the ground that are affected by the classificatory ip intensity fluctuations and intermittency of rainfall 2 to provide a guide to the magnitude and rapidity of intensity fluctuations that occur during natural rainfall because data on this are largely unavailable 3 to highlight potential limitations arising from the widespread reliance on constant intensity simulated rainfall experimentation as it applied to landsurface processes such as overland flow and soil erosion and to offer a reasoned proposal for the further development of more sophisticated and more relevant rainfall simulation methods the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a brief historical account of the consideration of classificatory ip in hydrology and related fields the following section section 3 provides a brief overview of the origin and nature of different ips in rainfall and their role in modifying surface processes data and methods are set out in section 4 followed by results in section 5 the paper concludes with discussion in section 6 and the principal conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 intensity profile in rainfall a brief history and review of its role at the landsurface in their appraisal of methods applied to the study of interrill soil erosion processes agassi bradford 1999 identified the issue of ip in passing they mentioned the intensity distribution of natural rainfall but did not examine it further ip was also listed as a significant aspect of rainfall by miller and daily 1977 in their publication rainfall factors that affect erosion there is indeed quite a long history of studies in which intensity variation has been seen as an integral and important aspect of rainfall and hence of rainfall simulation almost 80 years ago in a study of overland flow over grassed surfaces horner jens 1942 classified natural rainfall events into three temporal patterns the classificatory ips of the present paper depending on when the most intense rain fell within a rainfall event they named the ips advanced if the intensity peak arrived early intermediate if the intensity peak occurred around the mid point of the event and delayed if the intensity peak occurred toward the end of the event they also identified a uniform constant intensity ip this nomenclature is still in use e g wu et al 2006 yusof et al 2014 wang et al 2016 a et al 2018 pinheiro et al 2018 zeimetz et al 2018 their fig 2 presented schematic hyetographs illustrating advanced and delayed ips subsequently schiff 1943 adopted the nomenclature of horner jens 1942 and introduced additional ips termed interrupted reflecting the occurrence of intermittency and sporadic it is important to note here that these classificatory schemes for describing ips do not consider the actual rainfall intensities involved nor the rates at which the intensity might fluctuate during the course of a rainfall event reproducing the various classificatory ips seen in natural rainfall during rainfall simulation experiments was subsequently viewed as important and this drove methodological developments nearly 50 years ago young burwell 1972 attempted to reproduce the broad ip characteristics of three natural rainfall events that had been recorded at a research farm in minnesota usa one event storm no 45 contained two periods of rain separated by about 50 min of intermittency this natural rainfall event was simulated using a rainulator that could generate three different intensities 31 8 63 5 ad 127 mm h 1 although because of the high flow rate from the spray nozzles used the rain had to be pulsed on and off to achieve these intensities the resulting runoff and soil loss from field plots were recorded and young burwell 1972 concluded that the simulation of intensity fluctuations and intermittency increased the likelihood that the results would reflect the runoff and soil loss that would occur under similar conditions during natural rainfall this is a pioneering attempt to reproduce natural intermittency and intensity fluctuations during an ip in a similar study made more than 40 years ago alfaro hachum 1977 further refined the design of rainfall simulation apparatus in order to be able to reproduce rainfall ips with more fidelity they employed a drop forming rainfall simulator design whose water supply could be adjusted to allow rainfall intensity to be varied smoothly and continuously during an experiment they simulated a 36 minute intermediate ip event whose intensity rose and fell in a continuous convex upward ip and which peaked at 25 4 mm h 1 at mid duration see fig 3 of alfaro hachum 1977 prior to the intensity peak rainfall intensity was increased smoothly from zero for the first 18 min and then declined smoothly and progressively to zero through the 18 min after the intensity peak the mean rate of increase or decrease of rainfall intensity was thus 1 4 mm h 1 min 1 as will be shown later this is a very low rate of intensity change when judged against rates seen in natural rainfall flanagan et al 1988 later explored the effect of different classificatory ips by simulating rainfall events having a triangular ip but varying the position of the intensity maximum within a series of 1 h simulated rainfall events applied to small field plots in all cases intensity change was smooth and progressed at fixed rates before and after the intensity peak infiltration runoff and soil loss results were compared with constant intensity simulated rainfall having the same average intensity of 64 mm h 1 they established that peak runoff rates from a late peak ip were more than six times larger than from a constant intensity ip additionally they reported that soil loss rates were up to 8 5 times higher in late peak ips than in any other ip and more than three times larger than resulted from the constant intensity rain alfaro hachum 1977 concluded that constant intensity simulated rain does not result in runoff and erosion comparable to that resulting from ips that involve changing intensities frauenfeld truman 2004 undertook a further important study of runoff and interrill erosion on cultivated soils in georgia usa using a single ip with an early peak and gradual adjustments of intensity prior to and following the peak there were no periods of constant intensity at all during the event and no intermittency however an important aspect of this study was that the design of the ip that was simulated was derived from high resolution 1 min 5 min empirical data describing a single representative rainfall event recorded in their study area the experiments of young burwell 1972 alfaro hachum 1977 flanagan et al 1988 and of frauenfeld truman 2004 demonstrated the use of variable intensity rainfall simulation among the key findings to emerge and one that has been confirmed by later research was that the implementation of late intensity peaks the delayed pattern of earlier workers resulted in much greater runoff rates and soil loss from soil trays than did constant intensity rain or different classificatory ips such as the advanced pattern rather than smooth and gradational intensity adjustment moment by moment as used in some of the studies just cited more recent rainfall simulation that has involved varying ip has primarily adopted a staircase or stepped pattern in which constant intensities of simulated rain are applied for nominated periods and then varied up or down almost instantaneously in fixed step increments this was the approach of parsons stone 2006 warnamuende et al 2007 an et al 2014 chen et al 2015 fadhel et al 2018 alavinia et al 2019 and gholami et al 2021 fig 1 illustrates this kind of staircase intensity pattern it is not clear how satisfactorily such stepped sequences of constant intensity adequately reflect the intensity fluctuations during the ips of natural rainfall and this is an area in need of study these contemporary methods avoid the unnaturally smooth intensity changes that had been used in the earlier rainfall simulations just cited and are perhaps simpler to implement by switching on or off multiple spray nozzles however the possible effects of the essentially instantaneous changes of intensity remain unknown the use of both rapidly switched intensity changes and very smooth and gradual intensity changes raises the issue of which more closely resembles the rates of intensity change that occur in natural rainfall other approaches to exploring the importance of rainfall intensity have been used but generally only employing constant intensities with no ip or intensity fluctuations sometimes several different fixed intensities are employed in separate rainfall simulation experiments recently li et al 2020 for instance employed fixed extreme intensities of 60 120 150 and 180 mm h 1 for up to 2 h shojaei et al 2020 in contrast employed very short simulations of 3 to 7 min duration at constant intensities of 30 60 and 90 mm h 1 wang bi 2020 applied constant intensity simulated rainfall at 30 mm h 1 for 3 h 60 mm h 1 for 1 5 h and 90 mm h 1 for 30 min these recent studies have thus abandoned the attempt to reproduce natural intensity profiles and the associated intensity fluctuations in favour of operationally simpler though less realistic constant intensities experiments using multiple different intensities may employ separate runs using each intensity in turn or intensities applied in succession during a longer period of continuous rainfall carey paige 2016 an example is the work of nouwakpo et al 2018 who applied simulated rain to soil plots in indiana usa at 75 mm h 1 for 60 min switching without a break to 25 mm h 1 for 15 min and finally to 100 mm h 1 for 15 min the total rainfall duration was 90 min and each interval was intended to allow a steady runoff rate to be achieved the authors did not analyse the resulting soil loss from different agricultural treatments the underlying subject of the study separately for each intensity nevertheless from the foregoing review of the effects of ip it seems likely that much of the runoff and sediment would have resulted from the final interval of rain at 100 mm 1 since the sequence of applied rainfall intensities actually constitutes a late peak ip despite being intended to separately resolve the effects of each different intensity used this goal may simply not be achievable using what is in effect a single ip the same consideration applies to the work of warnemuende et al 2007 who applied in sequence 50 mm h 1 for 50 min 75 mm h 1 for 15 min 25 mm h 1 for 15 min and finally 100 mm h 1 for 15 min again without any break in rainfall in this way effectively a late peak or delayed event ip was created which would likely have resulted in disproportionately high runoff in the final most intense period of simulated rainfall nevertheless the intensity profile involved only a few fixed intensities with no intensity fluctuation at all during each interval of constant intensity and no intermittency as just noted many rainfall simulation studies hold intensity constant for up to several hours table 1 such constant intensity simulation cannot be used to explore such subjects as the different impact of a short but intense summer convective storm having early peak ip versus a long duration and less intense frontal rainfall event with a late peak ip nor compare rates of soil loss between two different locations where the rain has contrasting ips identifying these differences is potentially important to understanding the annual pattern of runoff and soil loss furthermore given that ips may change with rising temperatures in a warmer future fadhel et al 2018 when rainfall intensities may also change neglecting intensity profile makes many experimental results of limited use in supporting forecasts of future land surface processes such an infiltration or soil loss that have clear relevance to issues of importance to society including water supply and sustainable agricultural production 2 1 why has the historical focus on ip become relatively neglected it may be that the dominance of constant intensity rainfall simulation and the relative neglect of ip table 1 reflects an intention to standardise experimental conditions however relative rankings of soil loss among different soil types or treatments could remain erroneous if for instance study area a had a rainfall climate of early peak convective storms and comparison area b had late peak events or perhaps more intermittent events applying constant intensity rainfall simulation to both would by likely to lead to an under estimate of runoff and soil loss in area b and might over estimate both in a such that any resulting ranking of relative erodibilities or erosion rates between the two locations would be of questionable validity perhaps worse the magnitude of the over or under estimation would be unknown thus a belief that constant intensity perhaps regarded as some kind of standardisation allows valid comparison between soil types locations or crop management practices may well be misplaced an additional component of natural rainfall that is also overlooked in constant intensity rainfall simulation is of course the typical frequency and rate of intensity fluctuations during the ip of natural local rainfall thus if one comparator site experiences more intensity bursts or more rapid and intense intensity bursts than another site with which a comparison is required then again constant intensity rainfall simulation of conditions at these two sites can only lead to unrepresentative experimental conditions and inter site comparisons whose validity must be in doubt 3 how do different ips arise and how do they affect processes at the landsurface it is appropriate here to consider briefly the origin nature and role of the ip and intensity fluctuations of natural rainfall the origin of the ip in precipitation processes is first considered and then its impacts at the landsurface are reviewed these sections are not intended to provide comprehensive reviews but to offer sufficient background to allow the data on intensity fluctuations presented later to be seen in their wider context 3 1 the nature and origin of the ip and intensity fluctuations of rainfall intensity variations during the course of a rainfall event are virtually ubiquitous being evident in all records of intensity variation e g m√°ca torfs 2009 nel et al 2016 gabella et al 2014 reported that rainfall rate expressed in mm h 1 can change by an order of magnitude in 10 min for rainfall events as distinct from rain hours or days intensity variations can involve more than an order of magnitude change in rainfall intensity between the peak and the average intensity of the event further data on this characteristic are presented below as noted earlier the distribution of rainfall amount and rainfall rate within a rainfall event have frequently been broadly characterised by the classificatory huff curves huff 1967 huff curve and related accumulation mass curve methods remain in use for rainfall description and analysis e g yin et al 2016 for china zeimetz et al 2018 for switzerland though not all studies employ huff analyses as an example of quartile analysis nel 2007 reported from south africa a dominance of first and second quartile events in intense rainfall events around the drakensburg escarpment in part this reflects the fact that short convective events primarily occurring in summer are dominantly early peak events moseley et al 2013 westra et al 2014 events of longer duration much less frequently exhibit first quartile ips but rather tend to have more complex ips with multiple intensity peaks and fluctuations dunkerley 2019a in other rainfall climatologies quartiles other than the first quartile may become dominant gilan et al 2010 provided an example from iran in which the largest fraction of rainfall events of 1 3 h duration 48 3 was made up of fourth quartile events where the most intense rain falls late in the event data of this kind have been published for relatively few locations globally and further analyses are needed not least to guide rainfall simulation experiments in the different regions it has been shown that even in a single region the classificatory ip can differ among events with different durations and can also vary among the seasons e g between summer storms and winter storms the link between ip and event duration has been widely reported bustami et al 2012 yoon et al 2012 dol≈°ak et al 2016 a et al 2018 for instance reported that in rainfall event data from north china early peak events had the shortest average duration 9 1 h whilst late peak events had the longest average duration 13 1 h likewise changes in ip from summer to winter and between the wet and dry seasons are known tsubo et al 2005 fadhel et al 2018 yusof et al 2014 for instance encountered central peak intermediate rainfall events only in the south west monsoon season in johor malaysia during the north west monsoon and in the inter monsoon periods only early peak events were recorded the origin of early peak events is generally considered to lie in the nature of convective rainfall especially when driven by late afternoon surface heating that is rapidly nullified by evaporative cooling of the soil surface once rain begins in this way the most rapid moisture convergence and uplift occur early in the rainfall event and intensity thereafter wanes the explanation for the arrival of other ips is less clear but the interaction of wind and topography may be involved nel 2007 massmann et al 2017 investigated orographic precipitation in chile and noted that an increase in intensity late in rainfall events reflected a change from ice initiated to warm rain periods it may well be that via such mechanisms event duration influences the occurrence of late peak events as for early peak events for the case of switzerland zeimetz et al 2018 suggested that the country wide generalised mass curve that they proposed could be refined to account more fully for the possible differences in ip among orographic convective and frontal precipitation events from such studies which are certainly needed we would learn more about how event duration and precipitation mechanisms affect ip areas where knowledge is far from complete in addition to the classificatory ip the intra event fluctuations of intensity within the ip have potential importance to landsurface processes this subject is briefly considered next 3 2 intra event intensity fluctuations and their origin physical and micro physical processes in clouds and the sub cloud atmosphere drive continuous fluctuations in the intensity of rainfall arrival at the ground these can be related to the rate and vigour of turbulent convective uplift from the surface to the effects of wind and boundary layer turbulence on drop trajectories and arrival at the ground on sub cloud evaporation rates of moisture convergence surface cooling by evaporation during rainfall and many other factors in trade wind showers there may be bubbles of moist air that arise over warm ocean surfaces which persist as short lived rain events over land woodcock 1960 connor bonell 1998 owing to such mechanisms rain may begin and end abruptly many times during a rainfall event or a day more generally rapidly developing and weakening turbulence appears to be capable of causing rainfall to begin and end very sharply over periods of just seconds during rainfall intensity may fall to zero during periods of true intermittency or may be continuous but with changing intensity through the entire duration of an event periods of intermittency may have durations of only a few minutes or may last for more than an hour dunkerley 2020 see for instance fig 1 in torri et al 1999 intermittency is a relatively neglected aspect of the intensity variation that comprises the ip but one with relevance to many surface processes 3 3 how does ip influence surface processes whilst its variation globally remains only partly documented classificatory ip has been shown in multiple studies to be an important aspect of catchment response to rainfall and is a component of many studies designed to predict peak flood discharges and flood flow volumes rahman et al 2006 demonstrated that design flood estimates for the gold coast region queensland australia varied by 250 depending on the choice of ip used for rainfall input to a hydrological model for the same rainfall depth from saudi arabia ewea et al 2016 likewise found that if the locally dominant early peak rainfall patterns were not used as input to a hydrological model and instead a more intermediate ip was employed runoff peaks could be over estimated by up to 68 this was because early peak events resulted in less runoff for the same rainfall depth than did events with late rainfall peaks for developing warnings of flash flooding in southern china zhai et al 2018 likewise concluded that the occurrence of flooding could be under predicted if the occurrence of late peaking rainfall was not appropriately allowed for in predictive models because such events result in more runoff than did events with early intensity peaks all of these studies show that successful prediction of runoff peaks and total volumes can depend on a correct representation of the ip of the rainfall this in turn requires that the ip characteristics of the local rainfall have been established from suitable observational data whilst ip has been considered as an influential parameter in hydrologic and flood studies it has less often been included in the analysis of hillslope hydrology erosion and sediment yield this is important because the most commonly used approach relying on simulated rainfall of constant intensity may result in the smallest amount of surface runoff and the smallest peak discharges dunkerley 2012 guan et al 2016 see tables 3 and 4 it therefore probably results in the shallowest and slowest overland flow which in turn would reduce its capacity for soil dislodgment and transport therefore rainfall simulation at constant intensity is unlikely to be able to reveal how infiltration overland flow and soil erosion might operate during natural rainfall events even if the mean intensities had been selected to correspond with that of natural rainfall in the study region however targeted research is needed to explore and evaluate such hypotheses further because existing evidence is very limited some published studies that explore the importance of ip in landsurface processes are summarised in table 2 two rainfall events of the same average intensity may have distinctly different ips and therefore ip must be resolved at intra event timescales bustami et al 2012 yoon et al 2012 this establishes a need for suitable rainfall data having sufficient temporal resolution the unavailability of such data and of analyses of ip may thus hinder the development of relevant rainfall simulation conditions at particular field locations as tables 3 and 4 show the difference between constant early peak and late peak ips in terms of runoff ratio peak runoff rate and other parameters can be considerable reaching hundreds of percent at plot scale however much more research is required to develop a fuller understanding of the importance of ip intermittency is a neglected aspect of ip but one which is also relevant to processes at the soil surface periods of reduced rainfall intensity or of true intermittency allow soil infiltrability to partially recover toward pre rain values dunkerley 2018 permit surface ponding to partially or wholly dissipate aryal et al 2007 and allow some drying of vegetation canopies kume et al 2008 understory vegetation and ground litter so regenerating rainfall interception capacity studies employing high temporal resolution rainfall data have shown that even in very wet climates the aggregate duration of true intermittency may occupy on average more than one third of a rain day or more than 8 h dunkerley 2018 this non raining time can be comprised of multiple short and long cessations of rainfall even in rainfall events of short duration intermittency is commonly present dunkerley 2020 these characteristics of natural rainfall ips and their associated intensity fluctuations are almost always neglected in rainfall simulation experiments and again this may in part be because those aspects of local natural rainfall have not been documented in summary the effects of rainfall ips appear to be significant for many landsurface processes though much remains to be learned for the diversity of contexts where ip may be influential table 2 and about the variation of ip with the climatological context 3 4 what accounts for the effects of different ips and associated intensity fluctuations at the landsurface the reason for the reduced surface runoff reported from some early peak events and enhanced runoff from some late peak events has not been thoroughly explored in the case of early peak ips these effects can be hypothesised to result from the arrival of the most intense rain on dry soils whose infiltrability is still high in late peak events the soil is pre wetted before the most intense rain arrives and rain is therefore more rapidly partitioned into surface ponding and then surface runoff it may also be more likely that depression storages have also been partially filled by the time of the intense rain in a late peak event or else fill and are overtopped more rapidly when the intense rain commences moreover by the time of arrival of a late intensity peak the soil infiltrability would be reduced in comparison with the infiltrability earlier in the event as described for instance by the classical horton infiltration model that relates declining infiltrability to the lapse of time during rainfall given that runoff rates may consequently be higher in late peak ips the overland flow across the soil surface must be both deeper and faster than runoff occurring in early peaks of comparable intensity because flow depth affects the intensity of splash impact forces felt at the soil surface ip can be anticipated to affect soil erosion as well this has been confirmed experimentally but the exact mechanisms provide a potentially fruitful field for future research an area that remains completely unresearched is the importance of the rate of intensity fluctuation within rainfall events having different classificatory ips early peak late peak etc for instance we might enquire whether typical short early peak convective rainfall events contain more rapid and potentially erosive intensity bursts than do longer intermediate ip events or whether intense events of any given ip have more intensity bursts than less intense events of the same ip such questions cannot presently be answered we now turn to the rainfall data that are analysed here to document the nature of the ips of rainfall at two australian locations as well as from some published reports from locations including usa japan germany and norfolk island australia these data are used to document the magnitudes and rates of intensity fluctuations that make up the ips at these sites and are intended to provide a guide to what may be required in rainfall simulation experiments that simulate rainfall ips having variable rainfall intensities in such experiments the rate at which rainfall intensity changes before and following intensity peaks including intermittency the decline to zero intensity would ideally be known and reproduced during rainfall simulation 4 data and methods the data on rainfall intensity fluctuations presented here were derived from seven published studies table 4 and from the author s own field data the published data were available as graphical intensity time plots from which the numerical values were extracted by using an on screen digitiser the permitted rates of intensity change to be calculated the author s observations were collected at two australian ground observing stations one in a wet tropical location near the township of millaa millaa in far norther queensland hereafter mm and the other at an arid location the fowlers gap arid zone research station in far western new south wales hereafter fg the mm station has a mean annual rainfall of 3000 mm and the fg station 220 mm these observing stations in contrasting environments were studied in order to enquire whether there were differences in the ips associated with the external climatic type and if so how large any variability was further details of the two sites were provided in dunkerley 2019a 2019b 2020a 2020b the ground observing station data were collected using tipping bucket rain gauges tbrgs equipped with event data loggers the gregorian date and clock time of each bucket tip were logged to the nearest 1 sec in data processing these events were recoded as modified julian dates using fortran subroutines from the international astronomical union standards of fundamental astronomy http www iausofa org the unaggregated inter tip times were analysed here because they retain the highest temporal resolution possible for tbrg data some intensity information is forfeited when rainfall amounts are aggregated for instance to hourly totals individual inter tip times itts were used to estimate intensity on the assumption that the intensity is constant during the filling time of the tbrg bucket then 1 r t2 t1 Œ¥v t2 t1 where r is the rainfall rate mm h 1 between times t1 and t2 the clock times of two successive bucket tip events hour and Œ¥v is the recorded rain depth mm that is a function of the bucket capacity for mm this was 0 2 mm and for fg 0 5 mm the data were grouped into rainfall events using a minimum inter event time mit criterion of 6 h dunkerley 2008 the tip event data were also aggregated to rainfall amounts in various commonly used accumulation durations ads and 15 min data are analysed here subsequently the standard deviation of the 15 min rainfall rates was calculated separately for individual rainfall events as a measure of the intra event intensity variation the relationship between the total rainfall delivered in an event and the standard deviation of the intra event 15 min rainfall rates was then examined the mean event intensity was derived from the unaggregated itt data expressed in minutes from the value of n the number of itts in the rainfall event and Œ¥v the bucket capacity of the tbrg 2 i ave i 1 n 60 Œ¥ v itt i the mean intensity was subsequently regressed against the maximum intensity judged from unaggregated itts as per equation 1 in order to investigate how these two measures of event intensity are linked likewise the standard deviation of the 15 minute intensities was regressed against mean event intensity to document the extent of dependency of variability in intensity on the mean intensity of the enclosing event 4 1 a note on linear regression models applied to intra event intensity variation the various regression relationships reported here linking mean event intensity to measures of intra event intensity variation equations 3 6 below all exhibit significant scatter figs 3 and 4 as would be anticipated from the high variability in the characteristics of rainfall events analysis of the residuals from the regression models established that they are not normally distributed as confirmed by shapiro wilk tests shapiro wilk 1965 however in all of the cases analysed here the sample sizes are very large involving hundreds of rainfall events at both mm and fg in applying linear regression to such cases normality of the distribution of residuals from regression becomes much less important and has been shown to have little or no impact on the statistical validity and power of fitted linear models schmidt finan 2018 knief forstmeier 2021 likewise as in all applications of linear models normality is not a requirement for the dependent or independent variables employed in linear regression k√©ry hatfield 2003 5 results the results presented here first document the rapidity of the intensity variations that make up the ip of natural rainfall on the basis of published high resolution data from a number of global locations further statistics are then presented based on pluviography data collected at the two australian ground observing stations 5 1 the nature of intensity profiles in natural rainfall from published data the data extracted from published high resolution data are presented in table 5 representative major intensity fluctuations were selected from each rainfall record and the rates of intensity increase and decrease calculated table 5 here data on rates of intensity fluctuation from published studies these data demonstrate that intensity fluctuations can occur at very rapid rates exceeding 100 mm h 1 min 1 in several cases it is evident that the two lowest rates of intensity fluctuation are derived from data at 1 min resolution much higher rates are seen when the temporal resolution is finer inspection of the original intensity time plots in the published studies cited in table 4 confirms that rainfall arrival in many cases involved no steady rainfall rates but rather involved continually changing intensity with rapid increases and decreases of intensity for rainfall simulation studies it may not be necessary for such very rapid intensity fluctuations to be replicated since the response time of surface ponding or the smoothing of intensity variations by canopy and litter interception keim et al 2006 or the time needed for overland flow to deepen or become shallower would smooth the effects of such rapid fluctuations however it is relatively easy to simulate the intensity variation seen in the 1 min data using appropriate rainfall simulation apparatus and there is a strong case for this to become a protocol that should be considered in rainfall simulation experiments ideally this would be guided by knowledge of the local seasonal rainfall conditions in individual study areas currently there are insufficient high resolution data to characterise seasonal rainfall arrival in wet tropical temperate trade wind or dryland environments in terms of ips but local data can be gathered relatively easily using widely available tbrgs as illustrated next 5 2 rate and magnitude of intensity fluctuations in the mm and fg field data a great deal of temporal detail is present in data on rainfall intensity derived from unaggregated itts fig 2 and these confirm the occurrence of rapid intensity fluctuations during rainfall arrival and that periods of constant intensity are simply not seen in data having sufficiently high temporal resolution of course coarsening the time resolution reduces the apparent occurrence of intensity fluctuations e g see fig 3 in dunkerley 2019c the intensity fluctuations evident in fig 2 mm event 589 are comparable to those listed in table 4 thus the first rapid intensity increase labelled 1 on fig 2 occurs at a rate of 556 mm h 1 min 1 this confirms that ordinary tbrg data if unaggregated can reveal these extremely rapid and frequent intensity changes thus a means to examine intensity fluctuations that is probably widely possible especially in hydrologic and erosional research is to use the unaggregated inter tip times itts of tipping bucket rain gauges tbrgs this type of gauge is relatively inexpensive and widely used in field experiments itts can be 10 s in intense rainfall 100 mm h 1 for a 0 2 mm bucket sensitivity unaggregated itts can be converted to the equivalent rainfall rate using equation 1 even the most rapid intensity fluctuations presented in table 4 suggest that maximum fluctuation rates might often be no more than 500 mm h 1 min 1 or 8 mm h 1 s 1 and more often at rates of 100 mm h 1 min 1 or 1 7 mm h 1 s 1 this leads to some residual uncertainty in the rain rate that accounts for observed bucket filling times in order to describe the magnitude of intensity fluctuations rather than their rate of occurrence the relationships between maximum event intensity imax based on the shortest itt in each rainfall event and the mean event rainfall intensity iave were determined for the mm and fg rainfall events both are fitted by power function regression models fig 3 the regression models fig 3 are respectively for the mm rainfall events 3 imax 15 6 iave 0 96 r2 0 34 for the fg rainfall events 4 imax 5 1 iave 0 92 r2 0 36 these relationships confirm that the maximum intensity within a rainfall event increases with the mean intensity of that event some of these maximum intensity values would represent quite short lived intensity bursts within the ip of the event dunkerley 2019c it is important to emphasise that the level of explained variance in equations 3 and 4 is only modest there may be multiple factors influencing this outcome which almost certainly include the inability of a single minimum itt maximum intensity to characterise rainfall events with complex intensity profiles nevertheless these equations serve as an indication of the tendency of maximum intensity to be larger in rainfall events that have higher mean intensities and suggest that these two measures of intensity are linked by a power function relationship the variability in rainfall rates during events can also be readily described by calculating the standard deviation of the intensities calculated as above using itts aggregated to longer timescales more typical of the data available in rainfall records this has been done for 399 rainfall events at mm and 245 events from fg tallying all itts to yield rainfall amounts and thus intensities for 15 min intervals fig 4 the linear regression relationships between the mean rainfall event intensity and the maximum 15 minute rainfall rate for mm and for fg are plotted in fig 4 for the mm data the relationship between the standard deviation œÉ i 15 in mm h 1 and event mean 15 min intensity i 15 in mm h 1 is 5 œÉ i 15 1 04 i 15 0 69 r 2 0 75 and for the fg data with the same units 6 œÉ i 15 0 82 i 15 0 76 r 2 0 76 these relationships indicate that the standard deviation of all intra event 15 min rainfall rates increases with the overall mean rainfall event intensity this presumably simply reflects the fact that more intense rainfall events have a higher intensity not because the events consist entirely of intense rainfall but rather in part at least because they include more bursts of rainfall at higher intensities as shown in fig 1 given that the intensity cannot be less than zero such bursts of high intensity rain increase both the intensity and the variance of intensities the level of explained variance in equations 5 and 6 is notably larger than for the analysis of peak intensity equations 3 and 4 this is likely to arise in part from the many 15 minute intervals within the analysed rainfall events reaching a maximum of 157 at fg and 827 at mm in comparison with the single measure of peak intensity employed in equations 3 and 4 for rainfall simulation the implication from both of the descriptions of intensity fluctuation just presented based on unaggregated itts and also on aggregated 15 min data is that the variability of rainfall intensities ought to increase in proportion to the mean intensity being simulated in other words simulated rain of higher intensity should also contain a wider range of intensities in the form of fluctuations in the intensity profile quantitative detail is important if simulated rainfall events are to correspond as closely as possible to natural events to illustrate this with the field data from mm and fg table 6 presents data on the distributions of the ratios of maximum event intensity based on the shortest itt in each event to the mean event intensity these data show that for both sites the most common ratio is 5 however the mean is 28 9 for fg and 41 3 for mm in other words the maximum intensity imax at mm is on average more than 41 times higher than the mean event intensity iave the mm data extend to much higher ratios the maximum being 759 table 5 also details the upper percentiles of the distribution of this ratio the 90th percentile for mm is 95 3 whilst for fg it is only 32 8 an important result emerging from these analyses is that the variability of rainfall intensity fluctuations within events at the arid and wet tropical field sites differ significantly the wet tropical mm site displays maximum intensities within events that are larger than the mean event intensity by a much larger proportion than occurs at fg this is consistent with the higher coefficient in equation 3 for mm than in equation 4 for fg 6 discussion the evidence presented above confirms that intensity fluctuations are both frequent essentially continuous during natural rainfall and that the intensity fluctuations can occur at rapid rates hundreds of mm h 1 per minute as the integration time through which the rainfall arrivals are aggregated increases the apparent magnitude and rate of the intensity fluctuations diminishes as is well known since rapid events are smoothed when intense and less intense intervals are lumped nevertheless even in the mm tbrg data processed as unaggregated itts intensity fluctuations are frequent and rapid occurring at rates of at least 555 mm h 1 min 1 fig 1 with dynamic cloud microphysical processes and atmospheric turbulence in the sub cloud atmosphere rain of constant intensity simply does not occur this is precisely the observation made in a study of rainfall in mauritius nel et al 2016 thus the ip of a rainfall event is a trend in rainfall rate perhaps reaching a maximum in the first or last quartile or some other section of the event but with rapid intensity fluctuations superimposed upon it as many workers have pointed out on the basis of rainfall simulation experiments using idealised geometric representations of the ips seen in natural rainfall e g strickland et al 2005 franklin et al 2007 truman et al 2007 constant intensity rainfall simulation is inappropriate for many investigations the differences between measures of infiltration and surface runoff between constant intensity and early peak or late peak rainfall events of the same total depth and average intensity can reach hundreds of percent importantly all of this occurs even if the constant and variable intensity rainfall simulations have the same average intensity and deliver the same total rainfall depth and in the same event duration as shown in a number of the studies cited above this in turn suggests that even if two natural rainfall events had the same average intensity they might well result in different runoff ratios and runoff rates and soil losses depending on their individual ips this finding once again suggests that the supposed advantage of constant intensity rainfall simulation namely the ability to make comparisons between different sites under the same test conditions may not in fact be helpful in understanding infiltration rates or soil erosion processes 6 1 can a consideration of ip add value to rainfall simulation experiments all of this suggests strongly that neglect of ips and their associated intensity fluctuations in most rainfall simulation experiments table 1 is resulting in test conditions that diverge widely from those of natural rainfall evidently for many studies constant intensity rainfall simulation is not appropriate its use may indeed conceal important effects important for landsurface processes our understanding of seasonally varying rainfall event characteristics for instance or the changes likely in soil surface processes as climate change alters ips would be enhanced if these were included in rainfall simulation protocols an alternative approach to exploring this would be for more comparative studies of paired co located runoff plot responses to natural rainfall and to simulated rainfall indeed a greater reliance on observations under natural rainfall where this is practicable within the time constraints of many research efforts would remove any concern with the appropriateness of the rainfall simulation protocol it would also remove another concern with rainfall simulation that relates to the representation of natural ips the limited duration of most simulation experiments which are commonly only 30 min in duration and rarely exceed 1 h table 3 wang et al 2016 adopted the approach of observing the effects of natural rainfall for studying the erosion of experimental soil plots in china there results showed that the delayed ip in natural rainfall resulted in the greatest soil erosion mohamadi kavian 2015 reached the same conclusion from plots exposed to natural rainfall in iran the study of the effects of natural rainfall events on soil plots was also the protocol adopted by guimar√£es et al 2017 studying erosion in eucalyptus plantations in brazil in this study they used the three way ip classification of horner jens 1942 and found that the advanced pattern was the most common and accounted for more soil loss than the delayed pattern possibly because the intensity was higher in the advanced rainfall events this is the kind of situation where data on natural rainfall become important in making the correct interpretation of the experimental results they show that generalisations about the effects of different ips should be made cautiously this was further illustrated by the results of tao et al 2017 who found greatest soil and nutrient loss from rainfall simulations in which the intensity was maximal early in the course of 90 minute simulations diversity in outcomes merely strengthens the case for additional research giving attention for instance to possible sediment exhaustion effects that may modify the erosional outcome from any particular ip soil properties and characteristics may exert a diversity of possible influences on the interaction between ip overland flow and erosion an example is the effect of changing soil surface microtopography and roughness during the course of a rainfall event this was explored by luo et al 2020 using sequences of three simulated rainfall intensities 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 each held constant for 30 60 min but applied to roughened soil surfaces in sequences of increasing or decreasing intensity as abstractions of the more complex ips of natural rainfall luo et al 2020 were able to illustrate some of the interactions of the rainfall ip the soil surface morphology and the runoff rate many opportunities exist for such work exploring litter or plant cover effects for instance and extending simple sequences of fixed intensities to more fully developed ips ideally including realistic levels of rainfall intermittency and intensity fluctuation the importance of the experimental control of rainfall intensity duration and other characteristics and freedom from weather constraints ensure that rainfall simulation is a valuable and in some cases essential research tool however to increase its relevance to natural conditions ip and associated intensity fluctuations should increasingly be added to the aspects of rainfall arrival that need to be considered and reproduced in an informed and relevant way 6 2 the case for improved incorporation of ip in rainfall simulation experiments in terms of the assessment of key processes such as rill and interrill soil erosion mechanisms or the relative erosion rates of different tillage and mulching practices it may be helpful to ask directly why does ip matter this can be re phrased as asking in effect what is wrong with applying simulated rainfall at high and fixed intensities the most general answer is that natural rainfall is not like this constant rainfall intensities have been shown to result in lower rates of surface runoff and lower peak runoff rates than variable intensity rainfall having the same mean intensity this means that surface runoff will be both shallower and slower in constant intensity rain than in variable intensity rain in turn the shallower flow means that drop impact and splash dislodgement will be less attenuated by the cushioning effect that can be created by the presence of surface water mutchler and hansen 1970 the effect of mulch or stone cover may therefore appear to be more significant in reducing erosion than would be the case in variable intensity rain with higher flow depths when the cushioning of drop impacts by surface water would itself reduce soil dislodgement even more fundamentally the reduced runoff rate expected from constant intensity rainfall may mean that soil loss operates under transport limited conditions so limiting the size and load of particles that can be removed from experimental plots and making soil detachment processes less influential in overall load of eroded soil materials in variable intensity rain with its higher peak runoff rates detachment limited conditions are more probable making key drivers of interrill soil detachment intensity drop size and kinetic energy of greater importance ran et al 2012 reproducing the sediment transport conditions that arise under natural local rainfall transport or detachment limited is clearly vital if we are to understand the role of rainfall integral parameters such as depth duration and intensity it is worth noting that describing and analysing the intensity profile of rainfall and its relevance to landsurface processes offers scope for considerable development of analytical methods in particular rainfall depth rainfall intensity and the lengths of antecedent rainless periods are all rainfall event characteristics of relevance to many processes rainfall events can be analysed using various classification methods that extend the early or late peak peak descriptors for instance both lana et al 2020 working on flood producing rainfalls in the barcelona district of spain and ni song 2020 working on the conditions responsible for the triggering of debris flows in china have used clustering methods to identify multiple classes of local rainfall events these provide the potential to analyse not just intra event characteristics but the context of a rainfall event in terms of longer term perhaps multi day rainfalls and can incorporate rainfall amounts as well as intensities such methods might be developed to include also the rates of intensity change during rainfall and the frequency and duration of periods of intra event intermittency 7 conclusions there is ample evidence that rainfall ip is an important characteristic of rainfall arrival ips have been classified and their importance recognised for almost 80 years modern rainfall simulation apparatus with computer control of flow rates makes it possible to incorporate some representation albeit an imperfect one of the kinds of ips and intensity fluctuations seen in natural rainfall this has been possible to some extent for more than 40 years since early designs for rainfall simulators that could deliver changing intensities became available even in other areas of measurement such as the estimation of soil hydraulic conductivity it has been realised that the application of water in an inappropriate way such as static water ponding in a cylinder infiltrometer may result in very misleading results as multiple analyses have shown more reasonable results may be obtained from rainfall simulation or by pouring the infiltrometer water from a substantial height above the soil to mimic at least partially the kinetic energy delivered by rainfall to advance our understanding of the ways in which rainfall ips affect infiltration runoff soil loss and many related processes several challenges arise first we need additional studies of intensity and ips from a range of rainfall climates ideally these would permit us to identify any contrasts between convective and stratiform rain for instance or short and long rainfalls or winter and summer rainfall in a range of locations in addition to the overall ip it is desirable to document the range and speed of intensity fluctuations that characterise natural rainfall given that short intensity bursts may drive pulses of sediment dislodgment and transport second it is desirable when possible to use conventional and well established runoff plot methods but exposed to natural rainfall rather than simulated rainfall in this way if the appropriate rainfall characteristics are monitored including ip then those that are most important to soil surface processes could be identified via statistical analysis these aspects of rainfall having been identified could then be targeted for incorporation into rainfall simulation protocols third because the bulk of rainfall simulation studies continue to employ constant and often very high intensities with no representation of ip we need to progress to more appropriate protocols that better capture the character of natural rainfall arrival even if we are unable to reproduce with fidelity the fine details of natural ips it appears essential that we capture at least the broad character of classificatory ips such as early peak versus late peak as well as the ratio of peak intensity to average intensity only by making progress on these various challenges will we be able to understand more completely key soil surface processes and perhaps be able to analyse and manage the kinds of change in these processes that might occur in coming decades as a warmer climate

nonlinear clustering analysis such as k means hierarchical clustering and self organizing maps soms bierman et al 2011 clark et al 2020 a som is a neural network based classification method with unsupervised learning kohonen 1982 the excellent clustering ability of som is valuable because of its noise tolerance and nonlinearity characteristics astel et al 2007 nourani et al 2017 compared with that of traditional multivariate statistical methods such as discriminant analysis da cluster analysis ca and principal components analysis pca the better visualization of data in som is also helpful in exploring the regularity of complex data sets chang et al 2014 li et al 2018 to date soms have been widely applied to water quality analysis clark et al 2020 kalteh et al 2008 an et al 2016 employed a som to analyze a surface water dataset for the tolo harbor and channel water control zone hong kong and clustered 396 water samples into four groups with different water quality characteristics wu et al 2015 used a som to assess the effects of climate change and human activities on the water quality in daya bay south china sea liu et al 2016 successfully explored the patterns of the loop current system in the eastern gulf of mexico with a dual som which is the separate application of som to spatial and temporal analyses however a simultaneous spatiotemporal som analysis is still lacking which is our focus the hong kong marine area is a complicated system influenced by pearl river freshwater discharge monsoon induced coastal currents and industrial and urban wastewater discharges lai et al 2016 morton and wu 1975 a large part of the coastal water in hong kong has been degraded by both local and transboundary pollution from the pearl river delta substantially which has led to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms lai et al 2016 with high concentrations of nutrients and chl a red tides also known as algal blooms occur frequently especially in spring xu et al 2010 the marine ecosystem of hong kong has been threatened by deteriorated marine water quality and as a result the population of chinese white dolphins one of the two resident marine mammals in hong kong has been at a historic low and continues to decline due to habitat loss lai et al 2016 in this study a som has been applied to explore the long term water quality distribution and spatiotemporal water quality variability in the hong kong marine area while pca is used to cluster som results this study involves a simultaneous spatiotemporal som analysis which is rarely attempted in previous studies our study results show that spatiotemporal som analysis can not only identify common patterns in complex water quality data but also enable to reveal the driving forces behind water quality changes the objectives of this study are 1 to illustrate the long term water quality pattern for hong kong marine water 2 to determine the spatiotemporal variabilities in some water quality parameters and 3 to explore the main driving factors for marine water quality and propose some management strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hong kong special administrative region is located in southern china south of shenzhen guangdong province east of the pearl river estuary between 22 12 22 54 n and 113 31 114 18 e hong kong has a land area of 1 106 km2 and marine water area of 1 649 km2 hong kong contains three major parts hong kong island kowloon and new territories with various small islands the marine environment of hong kong is complex as the west coast is influenced by terrestrial discharge from the pearl river delta the east coast connects with the relatively clear water of the south china sea and municipal and industrial wastewater is discharged into the marine water chen et al 2004 morton and wu 1975 the hong kong marine waters are influenced by pearl river discharge monsoon induced coastal currents and tidal currents in the wet season pearl river discharge contributes a large freshwater flux with high nutrient loading to the western marine water and the heavy rainfall during monsoon dilutes the sea water in the dry season the northeastern monsoon winds drive the river water away from hong kong so the oceanic water dominates the marine water chen et al 2021 morton and wu 1975 in addition typhoons with strong winds and storms are frequent during summer and autumn which influence hydrodynamics greatly choy et al 2020 the water quality of hong kong marine water is also influenced by several water control projects before 2001 most sewage was discharged into victoria harbor after basic treatment in december 2001 stage i of the hong kong harbor area treatment scheme hats was implemented to improve the water quality in victoria harbor and surrounding waters the hong kong government constructed a long deep tunnel sewage system to collect sewage from urban kowloon tsing yi kwai chung tseung kwan o and eastern hong kong island and transport it to a centralized sewage treatment plant at stonecutters island after chemically enhanced primary treatment cept a sewage flow of 1 4 million m3 d is discharged 2 km west of the harbor xu et al 2011 in 1998 another project called the tolo harbor action plan thap was implemented to reduce anthropogenic nutrient pollution in tolo harbor by transferring 90 of the sewage to victoria lie et al 2011 as a provincial boundary river the shenzhen river is managed by the governments of both hong kong and guangdong province the shenzhen river control project srcp was implemented in four stages the first and second stages of the srcp were implemented from 1995 to 1998 by cutting straight and widening the depth of the shenzhen river and the third and fourth stages focused on comprehensive river water quality improvements after 2001 he and ye 2010 hu and tong 2015 2 2 water quality data to protect the marine environment the hong kong environmental protection department epd has been implementing a comprehensive marine water quality monitoring program since 1986 until 2016 the epd monitored marine water quality at 76 monitoring stations monthly and at 18 typhoon shelters marinas or dockyard bimonthly fig 1 presents the locations of the monitoring stations the epd has a dedicated marine monitoring vessel which is equipped with an advanced conductivity temperature depth ctd profiler linked to a computer controlled rosette water sampler more details are given in the epd report epd 2016 the surface water samples are collected 1 m below the surface the measured water quality parameters include volatile suspended solids vss unionized ammonia ua turbidity total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total inorganic nitrogen tin temperature suspended solids ss silica si secchi disc depth sdd salinity phaeopigments ph orthophosphate phosphorus po4 3 nitrite nitrogen no2 nitrate nitrogen no3 fecal coliform fc e coli dissolved oxygen do dissolved oxygen percentage do chlorophyll a chl a ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 to manage the marine environment the epd divided the hong kong marine area into 10 water control zones deep bay eastern buffer junk bay mirs bay north western port shelter southern tolo harbor and channel victoria harbor and western buffer fig 1 the station name comprises of two characters and a number the first character of the station name is the first character of the water control zone and the second character is m or t where m represents monitoring stations with monthly sampling and mostly more than 300 records and t refers to typhoon shelters marinas or dockyard with bimonthly sampling and only 30 records the different water control zones have different water quality objectives according to their location and usage epd 2016 2 3 self organizing map som algorithm a som is an unsupervised artificial neural network that projects multivariate input data onto a low dimensional space and visualizes output in a two dimensional space it is considered a nonlinear mapping technique as it identifies clusters in an unsupervised way without assumptions of linearity or normality of the input data based rather on the similarity of input data kohonen 1982 a som consists of two layers of neurons or units the input layer and output layer the input fed to a som is a n m matrix with n rows of samples and m columns of variables therefore the input matrix has n input vectors x i x 1 x m i 1 n the input vectors are classified or clustered using similarity measurements such as euclidean distance each input vector is connected to all the output neurons through the corresponding weight vector also called the reference vector the output neurons are fully connected and orderly arranged on a rectangular or hexagonal grid the learning algorithm of a som is as follows kalteh et al 2008 vesanto et al 2000 1 each neuron j 1 l in the output layer is linearly or randomly assigned an initial weight vector w j w 1 w m where l is the number of output neurons or map size and wj is transformed into the range of min x i max x i i 1 n 2 an input vector x i is fed to the network and the euclidean distances between the input vector x i and each of the weight vectors w j are calculated 3 the best matching unit bmu w b or the winner is selected according to eq 1 1 x i w b min j x i w j 4 the weight vectors of the bmu and topological neighbors of the bmu are updated following the learning rule eq 2 2 w j p 1 w j p Œ∑ p œï bj p x i w j p where p is the iteration step Œ∑ p is the learning rate and œï bj p is the neighborhood function which decreases from one at the bmu to zero at the units located within the radius r topological neighbors mean the neighbors in rectangular or hexagonal grid the most commonly used neighborhood functions are gaussian and bubble functions clark et al 2020 5 steps 2 to 4 are repeated until the learning rate is reduced to a predetermined small number or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached in this paper linear initialization is used as default setting for weight vector the initialization is made by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the training data at first then the map is initialized along the m dim greatest eigenvectors of the training data where m dim is the dimension of the map grid gaussian function is applied for neighborhood function the maximum iteration numbers are predefined according to the size of train data during learning process the weight vector associated with each neuron moves to the center of a cluster of input vectors in addition neurons that are adjacent to each other in the topology also move close to each other in the input space after training inputs with similar features are projected to the same map unit or nearby neighboring units therefore it is possible to visualize a high dimensional input space in the two dimensions of the network topology two types of grids are used to visualize a som result the unified distance matrix u matrix and the component plane vesanto et al 2000 both grids provide an intuitive display for users to understand cluster structure and complex relationships among the variables the u matrix displays euclidean distances between neighboring neurons by gradient color for example when using a gray gradient color the darker colors represent larger distances and vice versa in the u matrix a cluster is represented by a continuous region with lower values indicated by light colors bounded by high values indicated by darker colors in addition each input is assigned a label and the labels are on the u matrix map the component plane provides another way to visualize a som analysis result a component plane of a som shows the values that take the same component of the weight vectors in each of the map units the gradient similarity of m component planes provides direct visual information for the relations between the m variables notably parallel gradients show positive correlations while anti parallel gradients indicate negative correlations yin et al 2021 determining the map size the number of output neurons and the ratio between the number of map rows and columns is critical to applying a som the number of output neurons is determined using the formula 5 n n is the number of samples and the ratio between the number of map rows and columns is determined by the square root of the ratio between the largest eigenvalue and the second largest eigenvalue for the training data vesanto et al 2000 2 4 clustering som neurons the result of a som is a two dimensional arrangement of neurons on the map however a som cannot directly provide clusters of neurons because the boundaries of possible clusters are unclear in addition it is difficult to identify clusters from dozens of component planes without a clustering method therefore regardless of som neurons or numerous component planes a clustering method is needed lee et al 2019 the most common clustering method for a som is k means which aims to minimize the sum of squared distances from all points to their cluster centers and the davies bouldin index is often used to determine the optimal number of clusters baghanam et al 2020 gu et al 2019 however the k means algorithm has great uncertainty and may lead to different results by only simple repeats because of its stochastic initial cluster centers fr√§nti and sieranoja 2019 principal component analysis pca is another commonly used method for som neurons clustering pca is a powerful tool to explain the variance of a large dataset of interrelated variables with a smaller set of independent variables by extracting eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the covariance matrix of the original variables new orthogonal variables are produced to represent the original dataset with minimal loss of original information the principal components pcs provide information on the most meaningful parameters to describe the dataset zhang et al 2011 by extracting the first two pcs of neuron weight matrix or component plane matrix which is the transpose of weight matrix the neurons or component planes are clustered manually according to the relative position in the plot of the first two pcs li et al 2018 2 5 som analysis schemes water quality monitoring data is expressed by a three dimensional matrix x s v t s 1 n v 1 m t 1 k where a particular observed data value is expressed by three fundamental characteristics the sampling location s the sampling time t and the data type v in this study soms are applied for three kinds of input vectors corresponding to three analysis schemes i e s v som s t som and t s som which mean one dimension is chosen to be constant the three schemes have similar analyzing procedures but have different inputs fig 2 displays the flow chart of the s v som for a given time or time averaging the input matrix of a som is n m by learning with l neurons som s weight matrix l m is gotten then the som s results are displayed as u matrix or component planes to show the distances between neurons or the similarities between components if the neurons or the component planes are easy to classify manual classification is chosen to obtain the final clustering results of n and m otherwise by extracting first two pcs of l or m manual classification is applied to get results as described in section 2 4 finally if the clustering results are spatial results a map display is built to further interpret the spatial relations as for s t som or t s som a specified water quality variable is selected and som input matrix is n k or k n for s v som or s t som spatial clusters of monitoring stations that have similar water quality characteristics or time characteristics are obtained based on the corresponding u matrix additionally important discriminant parameters or times responsible for the clustering can be identified from the component planes allowing us to reveal relationships among the parameters or times for t s som som network receives a time dependent matrix and learns temporal relations among units over time temporal clusters where the units tend to follow each other over time are obtained based on som analysis results the temporal clusters represent the evolution over time of certain water quality parameters observed at all monitoring stations liu et al 2016 in this study the water quality trend in hong kong marine water has been explored from 1984 to 2016 in section 3 1 the descriptive statistics of the 24 water quality parameters are introduced the time average values from 1984 to 2016 with monthly or bimonthly measurements of the 24 water quality parameters are calculated for the 94 monitoring stations including 76 monitoring stations and 18 typhoon shelters marinas or dockyard then the s v som is used to explore long term patterns in water quality which is displayed in section 3 2 the total neuron number is 48 12 4 which is close to 5 94 94 is the total number of stations following the rule introduced in 2 3 four representative parameters have been selected to explore the spatiotemporal variability in marine water quality including fecal coliform bacteria po4 3 no3 and chl a the reasons for choosing these four variables are as follows 1 fecal coliform bacteria are introduced into aquatic environments mainly by discharge of nontreated wastewater and sewage thus the number of fecal coliforms bacteria is a good indicator of microbiological pollution for marine water rajendran et al 2018 2 with the implementation of stage i hats the concentration of po4 3 in victoria harbor greatly decreased as reported in some articles lai et al 2016 xu et al 2011 therefore po4 3 is an important parameter that is able to reflect the effects of water control projects 3 because of strong nitrification with the influence of high do concentrations in guangdong coastal regions the main composition of din is no3 rather than nh4 for most locations zhang et al 2016 thus no3 is selected to represent nitrogen nutrients and 4 the concentration of chl a is an important water quality indicator high chl a values indicate harmful algal blooms which may be caused by land drainage with high nutrient inputs lie et al 2011 many data points before 1994 are missing for all monitoring stations in addition the water quality parameters have been measured bimonthly at the 18 typhoon shelters marinas or dockyard therefore only the data measured at the 73 monitoring stations with relatively complete records between 1994 and 2016 have been chosen to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of the four selected parameters the annual averaged data have been used to explore the interannual patterns of e coli and po4 3 and the monthly averaged data have been used to explore the intra annual patterns of no3 and chl a to reduce skewness logarithmic transformation is applied for chl a monthly data for e coli and chl a s t som is applied while for po4 3 and no3 t s som is used the neuron numbers are 44 11 4 24 6 4 15 5 3 and 40 8 5 for e coli po4 3 no3 and chl a these results are shown in section 3 3 besides considering the decreasing concentration of po4 3 since the implementation of stage i hats in victoria harbor and the high concentration of no3 for pearl river in summer p may be the limiting nutrient in the estuarine influenced waters of hong kong to verify the assumption mentioned above the tin po4 3 n p ratios have also been analyzed using a s t som for monthly averaged data with 40 8 5 neuron numbers which is displayed in section 3 4 all the analyses in this study have been implemented in matlab r2018b using som toolbox 2 0 vatanen et al 2015 the toolbox can be downloaded for free at http www cis hut fi projects somtoolbox to visualize and interpret large high dimensional data sets data preprocessing normalizations initializing and training and visualizing has been implemented following the toolbox manual the source code accompanying this study is available at https doi org 10 25442 hku 13838315 v1 3 results 3 1 statistical analysis the descriptive statistics of the 24 water quality parameters for the surface water of the hong kong marine area are listed in table s1 the statistics include minimum values maximum values mean values median values standard deviations sds and coefficients of variation cvs as shown in table s1 e coli has the largest cv followed by fc nh3 n and phaeopigments the cv values are more than 3 ph has the smallest cv followed by salinity and temperature the cv values are less than 0 2 for most parameters except temperature salinity ph do and do the median values are much smaller than the mean values indicating that the distributions of these parameters are far from a normal distribution the concentration of chl a ranges from 0 2 to 360 Œºg l with a mean value of 4 935 Œºg l and a sd of 9 302 Œºg l showing great variability regarding nutrients the mean value of tn is nearly ten times that of tp and approximately that half of si for nitrogen tin is roughly 55 2 of tn while nh3 n no2 and no3 are approximately 48 6 9 8 and 41 6 of tin for phosphorus po4 is about 45 6 of tp 3 2 long term water quality patterns 3 2 1 cluster identification the component planes of the 24 parameters are shown in fig 3 and the pca result corresponding to the component planes is shown in fig 4 notably to show the negative correlations of the component planes the absolute values of the covariance matrix have been used for pca the 24 parameters have been classified into five groups based on their component plane similarities fig 3 and fig 4 1 all nutrient related parameters ua tp tn tkn tin si po4 3 no2 no3 and nh3 n salinity and suspended matter related parameters vss ss and turbidity are classified into the first group except for salinity the high values of this group are located in the bottom left part of the som planes in comparison with the other parameters in this group salinity has the opposite gradient distribution 2 two dissolved oxygen related parameters do and do are classified in the second group the low values are located in the bottom right part of the plane 3 two chlorophyll related parameters phaeopigments and chl a temperature and organic matter bod5 are classified into the third group the high values are located in the middle left and bottom left parts of the plane 4 two microbiological parameters fc and e coli and ph are classified into the fourth group the high values are located in the bottom right part of the plane and the highest values are located to the left of the last row of neurons for fc and e coli besides ph has an opposite gradient distribution than that of the microbiological parameters 5 sdd is classified into the fifth group the high values are located in the upper right part of the plane and the low values are located in the bottom left part of the plane some additional information is obtained from fig 4 for group i vss and no3 deviate the most from the center while turbidity salinity and other parameters cluster closely to two different centers group iii is a sparse cluster because the distances between the parameters are large compared to other clusters sdd is in the middle of pca results alone which shows its unique characteristics 3 2 2 spatial patterns of the clusters fig 5 a and fig 5b present the u matrix and corresponding monitoring station names of the s v som results to overcome the difficulty in directly determining the boundaries between the clusters in the u matrix pca is applied to the 48 neurons of the u matrix to obtain clusters of the monitoring stations as showed in fig s1 in supplementary materials five regions with distinctive marine water characteristics are identified based on the clustering analysis fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of the five regions which are described as follows the box plot of different regions for 24 parameters is also displayed in fig s2 to verify clustering results and find characteristics for different regions 1 region 1 consists of western buffer victoria harbor junk bay and part of eastern buffer this region is characterized by high fc low temperature and low do water quality in region 1 is intensively influenced by human activities such as marine transportation and industry wastewater discharge feng et al 2019 2 region 2 is located in the interior of deep bay and receives discharge along the new territories and runoff from the shenzhen river yang and chui 2017 region 2 features high concentrations of nutrients chl a and fc and low salinity and do the water fluidity in this region is poor and anthropogenic pollutants are severe actually it is the worst water quality region along the hong kong marine region 3 region 3 is located in the northwestern region and the outlet of deep bay it is characterized by low salinity moderate nutrient concentration especially no3 and high temperature this region is adjacent to the pearl river estuary and directly influenced by massive pearl river discharge thus the salinity is low and the nutrient concentration is moderate 4 region 4 is mainly located in tolo harbor and channel this region features high do and high chl a concentrations the high do may be related to low levels of pollution which is rarely affected by industrial and urban activities chau 2007 on the contrary the high chl a may be due to poor water fluidity since tolo harbor is a semi closed shallow bay xu et al 2010 5 region 5 includes the areas to the east and south of hong kong marine water and this region has high do and high sdd this region is mainly influenced by the south china sea current so the water quality is pretty good region 4 has three stations sm11 st3 and st1 near lantau island and region 2 has one station vt4 at victoria harbor on the one hand st3 st1 and vt4 only have 30 bimonthly records which means insufficient information for accurate classification on the other hand the neuron that includes sm11 st1 and st4 is in the boundary of region 4 and region 5 as showed in fig 5 and pca cannot accurately distinguish the boundary 3 3 spatiotemporal patterns of representative water quality parameters fig 7 displays the spatial clustering results of the four representative parameters the spatial classifications corresponding to the clustering results are given in fig s3 fig 8 and fig 9 display the temporal patterns and corresponding clustering results for four parameters the boxplots of the corresponding clustering results are presented in fig 10 the remainder of this section illustrates the som analysis results of the four parameters in detail 3 3 1 fecal coliform bacteria three spatial clusters have been identified for fecal coliform bacteria e coli by clustering som units through pca fig s3a the spatial distribution of the clusters is presented in fig 7a cluster i s i ec is distributed inside deep bay and part of victoria harbor while cluster ii s ii ec in another part of victoria harbor and cluster iii c iii ec in the remaining water control zones the temporal som analysis results for fecal coliform bacteria are presented in fig 8a with the help of pca the pca groups the yearly component planes into two periods the first period t 1 ec ranging from 1994 to 2000 except 1996 and the second period ranging from 2001 to 2016 the year 1996 is excluded because of extremely high values observed at the dm1 station fig 11 shows the annual variation in e coli between the two periods within the three spatial clusters as observed in the fig 9a and fig 11 e coli concentrations are higher in spatial clusters s i ec and s ii ec than in spatial cluster s iii ec no obvious trend is found between the two periods for spatial cluster s iii ec while significant shifts can be seen for spatial clusters s i ec and s ii ec the e coli concentration for spatial cluster s i ec fluctuates more from period 1 to period 2 in contrast a downward trend in the mean e coli concentration is observed for spatial cluster s ii ec 3 3 2 orthophosphate phosphorus four spatial clusters are identified for orthophosphate phosphorus po4 3 by applying pca on station component planes fig s3b fig 7b presents the spatial distribution of the four clusters cluster i s i p o 4 includes the water control zones of deep bay station dm5 is not included and northwestern cluster ii s ii p o 4 includes victoria harbor tolo harbor and channel western buffer junk bay eastern buffer and a small part of southern cluster iii s iii p o 4 includes mirs bay port shelter and southern cluster iv s iv p o 4 includes the outlet of deep bay dm5 fig 8b presents the u matrix and temporal clusters of som analysis for po4 3 as shown in fig 8b there is a clear boundary between the results of the u matrix before and after 2001 the temporal evolution of po4 3 is also clearly illustrated by the movement of the bmu the bmu moves from the bottom of the map to the upper left and then to the upper right over time three periods are identified in the figure 1994 2001 t 1 p o 4 2003 2008 t 2 p o 4 and 2009 2015 t 2 p o 4 the years 2002 and 2016 are not included because of quite low values of deep bay and northwestern in 2002 and sharply increased values of tolo harbor in 2016 as shown in fig s4 the first period t 1 p o 4 is further divided into two stages 1994 1995 and 1999 2001 is recognized as t 1 p o 4 s 1 and 1996 1998 as t 1 p o 4 s 2 as shown in fig 10b the average concentration of po4 3 decreases gradually from period 1 to period 3 for spatial cluster i s i p o 4 as indicated by the values of s i p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s i p o 4 t 2 p o 4 and s i p o 4 t 3 p o 4 spatial cluster ii s ii p o 4 has a similar temporal evolution pattern as that of s i p o 4 however there is a difference between s i p o 4 and s ii p o 4 in the two stages of period t 1 p o 4 as shown in the subplot of fig 9b spatial cluster s i p o 4 has the highest average value of po4 3 in the second stage of period 1 as indicated by s i p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s 2 however the average values of po4 3 in the two stages of period 1 i e s ii p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s 1 and s ii p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s 2 are almost identical for s ii p o 4 for spatial cluster iii s iii p o 4 the average value of po4 3 is the highest in period 1 see s iii p o 4 t 1 p o 4 and lowest in period 2 see s iii p o 4 t 2 p o 4 and the average value of po4 3 in period 3 s iii p o 4 t 3 p o 4 is slightly higher than that in period 2 s iii p o 4 t 2 p o 4 for cluster iv the average value of po4 3 is the highest in period 2 s iv p o 4 t 2 p o 4 and the po4 3 values are almost equal in period 1 s iv p o 4 t 1 p o 4 and period 3 s iv p o 4 t 3 p o 4 3 3 3 nitrate nitrogen three spatial clusters for no3 have been identified by applying pca on component planes fig s3c and corresponding results are displayed in fig 7c spatial cluster i s i n o 3 includes the water control zones of northwestern victoria harbor southern eastern buffer western buffer and part of deep bay nearly all the west and south regions of hong kong spatial cluster ii s ii n o 3 includes port shelter mirs bay and part of tolo harbor and channel spatial cluster iii s iii n o 3 includes the interior of deep bay and the interior of tolo harbor and channel obviously the spatial clustering results are distinctive with geological locations as displayed in fig 7c three temporal clusters have been identified through manual classification of u matrix fig 8c season 1 m 1 n o 3 consists of dec jan feb and mar while season 2 m 2 n o 3 jun and jul and season 3 m 3 n o 3 apr may aug sep oct and nov the temporal clustering results show good seasonal variation fig 9c compares the seasonal variation in no3 among the three temporal monthly clusters within the three spatial clusters for median values in the box plot spatial cluster i s i n o 3 s values are the highest followed by spatial cluster iii s iii n o 3 s values and spatial cluster ii s ii n o 3 s values are the lowest it can also be observed that no3 concentrations in different spatial clusters reach their peak values in different seasons the no3 concentrations in spatial cluster i and ii s i n o 3 and s ii n o 3 are the highest in season 2 and season 1 respectively as indicated by the values of s i n o 3 m 2 n o 3 and s ii n o 3 m 1 n o 3 no obvious peak value is found for spatial cluster iii s iii n o 3 there are large outliers for spatial cluster i and ii s i n o 3 and s ii n o 3 of all three temporal clusters while spatial cluster iii s iii n o 3 does not have outliers on the contrary spatial cluster iii s 25 75 variation ranges are the largest and the median values are much smaller than the third quartile values for all three temporal clusters 3 3 4 chlorophyll a three spatial clusters of chl a have been identified based on the u matrix and pca fig 7d presents the spatial distribution of the three clusters spatial cluster i s i chl consists of the water control zones of western buffer victoria harbor junk bay eastern buffer part of northwestern part of mirs bay and part of southern spatial cluster ii s ii chl consists of port shelter mirs bay the outlet of deep bay and part of northwestern spatial cluster iii s iii chl consists of the interior of deep bay tolo harbor and channel and part of southern fig 8d shows component planes for the 12 months analyzed in the temporal som three seasonal clusters have been identified based on the similarities of the component planes jun jul and aug are classified as season 2 m 2 chl may and sep are classified as season 3 m 3 chl while the other months are classified as season 1 m 1 chl as shown in fig 9d all the average values of chl a in the three spatial clusters are the highest in season 2 and the lowest in season 1 the average values of chl a in spatial cluster iii are higher than those in the other spatial clusters in almost all three seasons 3 4 n p ratios the results of the som and component planes for tin po4 3 are shown in fig s5 and fig 12 two temporal patterns are classified clearly from fig 12 for may jun jul aug and sep the highest values are located in the bottom left while for other months in the bottom right the average phytoplankton n p ratios is 16 1 which represents a balance of n and p nutrient for phytoplankton growth for a large portion of the locations n p value exceeds 16 in summer except for those in the upper right in winter nearly all the regions have n p ratios lower than the average level the pca result of spatial clustering does not have clear boundaries so the average phytoplankton n p ratios of 16 1 cannot be directly displayed to overcome this the values of typical months have been chosen to display the spatial distribution in fig 13 jul nov apr and sep are selected considering representativeness and transition for july the values of west and south of hong kong coastal regions are larger than 16 especially the southern control zone where the values are larger than 50 for november the values of nearly all the stations are smaller than 16 except that of nm6 most of mirs bay port shelter and east of southern s values are even smaller than 9 for april and september the highest values are located in the west of hong kong and the values for east of hong kong are smaller than 16 the southern regions of hong kong are transition zones of 16 for tolo harbor the values decrease from the interior to outlet nearly all months for the interior of deep bay the values are smaller than 16 whole year all these results are consistent with som s results 4 discussion 4 1 interrelations among water quality parameters in the long term water quality analysis mutual relationships among the 24 water quality parameters have been determined by clustering parameter component planes fig 3 and fig 4 high and positive correlations are found between nutrient parameters and suspended matter while negative correlations are found between nutrient parameters and salinity this means that the monitoring stations with high levels of nutrients may also have high levels of suspended matter and low salinity levels due to the inflow of freshwater that brought considerable amounts of n p and si nutrients and suspended matter for hong kong marine water the discharges of the pearl and shenzhen rivers are the main freshwater sources thus regions 2 and 3 have relatively high levels of nutrients and suspended matter chl a has positive correlations with temperature and bod5 meaning that high temperature and organic matter may be related to high chl a concentrations generally high temperature accelerates the growth of phytoplankton which are responsible for high chl a concentrations de jonge et al 2012 after a decay process phytoplankton turn into organic matters and bod5 increases subsequently the correlation is weak compared with that among other water quality parameter groups implying that the factors influencing of chl a concentration are not only the two mentioned above nutrient levels sufficient illumination and water fluidity are also important factors for chl a chen et al 2017 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 regions 2 and 4 have high concentrations of chl a saliently ph has a high and negative correlation with the microbiological parameters due to different control factors for ph physical mixing between riverine freshwater and seawater dominates its distribution which shows lower values in region 1 region 3 especially region 2 as displayed in fig s2 as mentioned in existing studies pearl river s mean ph is around 7 4 while shenzhen river s ph varies from 6 67 to 7 21 lu et al 2020 wijesiri et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 besides region 4 s ph is larger than that of region 5 region 5 s ph represents the normal level of south china sea this ph increase in surface water may be contributed to biological metabolism and co2 outgassing because of severe phytoplankton blooms zhao et al 2020 for the high levels of e coli severe pollution of shenzhen river and sewage discharge from hong kong may be responsible for regions 2 and 3 consequently shenzhen river s extremely high microbiological pollution and lower ph leads to the ph being classified in group iv rather than group i do and sdd are classified as unique individual patterns reflecting that these two parameters have their own characteristics and may have been influenced by multifaceted factors 4 2 influence of ocean currents and freshwater discharge on marine water quality based on the som analysis results for chl a and no3 fig 7c 7d and fig 8c 8d the spatiotemporal variations in chl a and no3 are affected by ocean currents and nutrients from freshwater discharge three spatial clusters and three temporal clusters have been identified for no3 spatial cluster s i n o 3 is located to the west and south of hong kong fig 7c where the pearl river brings a large amount of nutrients the no3 values in deep bay and northwestern belonging to spatial cluster s i n o 3 are significantly larger than those in other water control zones especially at the monitoring stations of dm3 dm4 dm5 nm5 and nm6 where no3 values are close to 1 0 mg l and are displayed as outliers in fig 9c the temporal pattern of no3 in s i n o 3 is also impacted by the seasonal variation in the pearl river discharge the no3 concentration in s i n o 3 is higher in summer than in winter as indicated by the values of s i n o 3 m 2 n o 3 and s i n o 3 m 1 n o 3 fig 9c which may result from the large nutrient input from the pearl river in summer spatial cluster s ii n o 3 is located in east hong kong and is influenced mainly by the oligotrophic conditions of the south china sea for this cluster the limited nutrient is bioavailable nitrogen rather than dip he et al 2016 the no3 concentration in this region is relatively low in all years compared to that in the other control zones furthermore the no3 concentration in summer is lower than that in winter a possible reason may be the consumption of no3 caused by phytoplankton spatial cluster s iii n o 3 includes the interior of deep bay and tolo harbor where the water fluidity is poor thus the seasonal variation in the no3 values of this cluster is weak for the interior of tolo harbor submarine groundwater discharge sgd is also an important and steady nitrogen source as reported in several articles with an estimated range from 3 104 to 1 1 106 mol d for dissolved inorganic nitrogen input lee et al 2012 luo and jiao 2016 luo et al 2014 which is pretty high compared to global levels beusen et al 2013 similar to those in no3 the spatiotemporal variations in chl a are also influenced by ocean currents and nutrients from freshwater victoria harbor in spatial cluster s i chl is highly flushed where the monthly average value of chl a reaches its maximum in summer when the strongest stratification occurred as indicated by the value of s i chl m 1 chl in fig 9d on the other hand the high flushing rate also restricts nutrient utilization lee et al 2006 in other seasons horizontal dilution and light limitation induced by vertical mixing lead to low chl a values xu et al 2010 with high nutrient levels and strong stratification chl a increases greatly in summer in this region while the intensive flushing restricts a further increase in chl a in summer and leads to low concentrations in other seasons overall the chl a concentrations in spatial cluster s ii chl i e port shelter mirs bay outlet of deep bay and part of northwestern are low however the spatiotemporal variations in chl a in different parts of s ii chl are different the nutrient level in the eastern part of s ii chl i e port shelter and mirs bay is very low resulting in low chl a concentrations in contrast the nutrient level in the western part of s ii chl i e outlet of deep bay and part of northwestern is as high as in spatial cluster s i chl but the strong current in the pearl river estuary restricts the chl a concentration in summer due to weak flushing year long stratification long residence times weak tidal currents and adequate nutrients from local rivers or sgd chl a concentrations in spatial cluster s iii chl are high in all seasons as indicated by the values of s iii chl m 1 chl s iii chl m 2 chl and s iii chl m 3 chl especially in tolo harbor luo and jiao 2016 xu et al 2010 the areas of this cluster including deep bay tolo harbor and northwestern mirs bay have also been mentioned in other articles hafeez et al 2019 nazeer and nichol 2016 4 3 effects of water control projects on marine water quality e coli and po4 3 have been used as indicators to assess the effects of water control projects on marine water quality three spatial clusters and two temporal clusters are identified for e coli the concentrations of e coli are high in victoria harbor and the interior of deep bay in spatial clusters s i ec and s ii ec however the e coli concentrations in s ii ec reaches their peak values in approximately 2000 and declined continually thereafter more interestingly the area with relatively high e coli levels in victoria harbor moves to the west slightly from spatial cluster s ii ec to s i ec and the station with the highest e coli moves from vm2 to vm5 these spatiotemporal changes in e coli in victoria harbor coincide with the construction of stage i hats which collects approximately 75 of the sewage generated in the harbor area for treatment at stonecutters island which is finally discharged through the outfall to the western harbor area lai et al 2016 in contrast increase in severity of e coli pollution in the interior of deep bay can be noticed after 2000 therefore close attention and action should be implemented for severe bacterial pollution in deep bay as described in the section 3 3 2 four spatial clusters and three periods have been identified for po4 3 based on the som analysis results temporal changes in po4 3 concentrations in spatial clusters s i p o 4 and s ii p o 4 reflect the different effects of different water control projects on marine water quality water quality in spatial cluster s i p o 4 i e deep bay and northwestern is largely related to srcp for the first and second stages of the srcp from 1995 to 1998 by cutting straight and widening the depth the water flow rate of the shenzhen river increased greatly and bottom sediments moved into deep bay with large nutrient levels he and ye 2010 hu and tong 2015 as a result the po4 3 concentration reaches its highest value during this period as shown in s i p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s 2 however after implementing the third and fourth stages of the srcp the po4 3 concentration continuously decreases after 2001 lan and wu 2015 it should be noted that even the lowest po4 3 concentrations in the interior of deep bay are higher than most of the highest values in the other regions especially at stations dm1 and dm2 therefore more attention should be given to the high levels of nutrient pollution in deep bay temporal changes in the po4 3 concentration in spatial cluster s ii p o 4 are largely related to the thap and hats projects s ii op includes the surrounding area of victoria harbor and tolo harbor the implementation of thap in 1998 largely reduces anthropogenic nutrient pollution in tolo harbor lie et al 2011 in 2001 with the implementation of hats 75 of the sewage from victoria was treated and discharged west of the harbor near stonecutters island xu et al 2010 the po4 3 concentration in tolo harbor has decreased gradually since 1998 and has been at a low level since 2001 while the po4 3 concentration in victoria harbor and its surrounding areas has decreased dramatically since 2001 the limiting nutrient for tolo harbor s surface layer also changed from si in wet season to p after 2000 liang et al 2020 the result implies the good effects of thap and hats in terms of reducing anthropogenic phosphorus nutrient pollution similar to that in spatial cluster s ii p o 4 the po4 3 concentration in spatial cluster s iii p o 4 decreases significantly after 2001 however the average po4 3 concentration in third period t 3 p o 4 2009 2015 increases in comparison with that in second period t 2 p o 4 2003 2008 the increase in the po4 3 concentration may be resulted from nonpoint pollution archana et al 2016 chau 2007 the po4 3 concentration in spatial cluster s iv p o 4 is mainly influenced by pearl river discharge the average pearl river discharge in period t 2 p o 4 is larger than that in the remaining periods lu et al 2009 and the po4 concentration in s iv p o 4 is also larger that in t 2 p o 4 the influence of the pearl river discharge decreases from nm5 to nm1 with the flow direction which is confirmed by the decreasing values from nm5 to nm1 in t 2 p o 4 4 4 variation in nutrient limitation as displayed in figs 12 and 13 tin po4 3 have obvious spatiotemporal characteristics the tin po4 3 values of a large portion of the locations exceed 16 in summer except those in port shelter tolo harbor and channel the interior of deep bay and part of mirs bay therefore p is the limiting nutrient in the western and southern hong kong marine regions in summer xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 in winter nearly all the regions have lower n p values than the average level which means that n is the limiting nutrient in winter for spring and autumn south regions of hong kong are transition zones from p limit in west regions to n limit in east regions another interesting finding is the change in the region with the highest n p value during may june july and august the southern control zone has the highest n p values while during other months northwestern western buffer and the outlet of deep bay have the highest n p values one of reason for this phenomenon may have been the spatiotemporal variation of the influence range of pearl river discharge which is the main source of nitrogen zhang et al 2019 in summer pearl river freshwater discharge reaches southern control zone with high nitrate concentrations because of the low orthophosphate concentrations as mentioned in section 3 3 2 the nitrates consumed by phytoplankton are also low compared with victoria harbor leaving considerably high n p values in this region as for spring and winter pearl river discharge reaches northwestern control zone and west of southern control zone and causes high n p values in these regions as for tolo harbor the gradually decreasing n p values from the interior to outlet may be contributed to sgd with high n p values luo et al 2014 the high n p values for sgd are also reported in other regions gao et al 2018 rodellas et al 2015 slomp and van cappellen 2004 5 summary and conclusions this study explores the spatiotemporal variability of water quality in hong kong marine water areas by combined use of som and pca three types of som analysis schemes have been applied to multivariate marine water quality observations and pca is used to help the clustering of som neurons and component planes with nonlinearity characteristics noise tolerance and excellent visualization s t som and t s som are powerful for spatiotemporal analysis i e a simultaneous clustering of spatiotemporal domains which is helpful in deciphering the driving forces behind the data overall the combined use of som and pca provides a holistic view of the complex multivariate water quality data the major findings of this study are as follows first the long term mean water quality analysis shows that the hong kong marine water areas can be classified into five regions with distinctive water quality characteristics the representative water control zones in the five regions are victoria harbor deep bay northwestern tolo harbor and mirs bay second the spatiotemporal variations in chl a and no3 are greatly affected by ocean currents and nutrients from pearl river discharge tolo harbor and deep bay experience high chl a year round because of weak flushing hydrodynamics and abundant nutrients from local rivers or sgd third the effects of water control projects on marine water quality determined by the som reveal that with the implementation of hats anthropogenic bacterial and po4 3 contamination have decreased significantly in victoria harbor since 2001 srcp also decreases the po4 3 pollution in deep bay fourth in the western and southern hong kong marine regions n is the limiting nutrient in winter and p in summer due to the massive discharge of the pearl river that contain no3 our study suggests that deep bay deserves immediate attention for its high chl a nutrient and fc levels and poor fluidity the studied marine water area being located between hong kong sar and guangdong province cross regional cooperation of the two governments is needed to improve the water quality of deep bay the combined spatiotemporal som analyses provide a powerful tool for understanding complex marine water processes this method can be applied to solve other hydrological and

4099,a self organizing map som which is an unsupervised neural network is used to explore the spatiotemporal variability of water quality in hong kong marine water areas based on 31 years of monitoring data 1986 2016 in this study three types of soms referred to as s v s t and t s som respectively are applied to the multivariate marine water quality data and principal component analysis pca is used to help the clustering of som neurons and component planes the major findings revealed by the spatiotemporal som analyses include the following a hong kong marine water areas can be classified into five regions with distinctive water quality characteristics over the long term b the spatiotemporal variations in chlorophyll a chl a and no3 are greatly affected by ocean currents and nutrients from pearl river discharge c marine water quality is significantly affected by water control projects e g the hong kong harbor area treatment scheme hats and d nitrogen n is the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth in winter west and south of the hong kong marine regions while phosphorus p is the limiting nutrient in summer owing to the massive discharge of the pearl river that contain no3 furthermore the severe pollution in deep bay with high levels of chl a nutrients and fecal coliform fc deserves immediate attention from the governments the results of this study prove that combined spatiotemporal som analyses provide a powerful tool to identify spatiotemporal patterns in water quality data and to reveal the driving forces behind water quality changes this study presents the first attempt to apply soms to water quality analysis at both spatial and temporal domains keywords self organizing map marine water quality machine learning classification hong kong 1 introduction the ocean contains essential ecosystems that play an important role in sustaining the human food supply and supporting transportation and tourism however many ocean ecosystems have been affected by human activities and they in turn influence human production and life choy et al 2020 elliott et al 2020 halpern et al 2008 madin and madin 2015 ostad ali askari et al 2019 as a symbol of marine biodiversity coral habitats have significantly declined in recent years with deteriorating coastal water quality and coastal development madin and madin 2015 vega thurber et al 2014 many studies show that the rate of global warming has been increasing over the past few decades cheng et al 2019 dai 2013 ostad ali askar et al 2018 talebmorad et al 2021 trenberth et al 2014 global warming results in extreme weather events glacial melting and enhancement of ocean stratification which intensifies the responses of ocean ecosystems to anthropogenic activities kroeker et al 2013 ostad ali askari et al 2019 rombouts et al 2013 herbicide and microplastic contamination has been discovered widely and persistently in nearshore marine ecosystems amelia et al 2021 shahul hamid et al 2018 thomas et al 2020 numerous parameters such as the concentrations of dissolved oxygen nitrogen phosphorous and chlorophyll a chl a biochemical oxygen demand bod salinity temperature and turbidity are used to characterize status of marine water quality these parameters are also used to classify marine waterbodies for management purposes based on specified water quality indices or recommended water quality standards with the development of monitoring technology more water quality parameters are being monitored and more water quality data are becoming available chai et al 2020 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 however due to the spatiotemporal variations in water quality parameters it is difficult to identify common patterns in the complex and large amount of water quality data to draw meaningful conclusions using conventional water quality classification systems or simple statistical methods therefore multivariate statistical methods are usually employed to explore and understand spatiotemporal variations in water quality for reasonable classifications and meaningful interpretations to aid marine water management magyar et al 2013 varol 2020 zhang et al 2011 however due to the limitations of conventional multivariate statistical methods in terms of nonlinearity outliers and missing data some machine learning techniques are more suited for multivariate and nonlinear clustering analysis such as k means hierarchical clustering and self organizing maps soms bierman et al 2011 clark et al 2020 a som is a neural network based classification method with unsupervised learning kohonen 1982 the excellent clustering ability of som is valuable because of its noise tolerance and nonlinearity characteristics astel et al 2007 nourani et al 2017 compared with that of traditional multivariate statistical methods such as discriminant analysis da cluster analysis ca and principal components analysis pca the better visualization of data in som is also helpful in exploring the regularity of complex data sets chang et al 2014 li et al 2018 to date soms have been widely applied to water quality analysis clark et al 2020 kalteh et al 2008 an et al 2016 employed a som to analyze a surface water dataset for the tolo harbor and channel water control zone hong kong and clustered 396 water samples into four groups with different water quality characteristics wu et al 2015 used a som to assess the effects of climate change and human activities on the water quality in daya bay south china sea liu et al 2016 successfully explored the patterns of the loop current system in the eastern gulf of mexico with a dual som which is the separate application of som to spatial and temporal analyses however a simultaneous spatiotemporal som analysis is still lacking which is our focus the hong kong marine area is a complicated system influenced by pearl river freshwater discharge monsoon induced coastal currents and industrial and urban wastewater discharges lai et al 2016 morton and wu 1975 a large part of the coastal water in hong kong has been degraded by both local and transboundary pollution from the pearl river delta substantially which has led to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms lai et al 2016 with high concentrations of nutrients and chl a red tides also known as algal blooms occur frequently especially in spring xu et al 2010 the marine ecosystem of hong kong has been threatened by deteriorated marine water quality and as a result the population of chinese white dolphins one of the two resident marine mammals in hong kong has been at a historic low and continues to decline due to habitat loss lai et al 2016 in this study a som has been applied to explore the long term water quality distribution and spatiotemporal water quality variability in the hong kong marine area while pca is used to cluster som results this study involves a simultaneous spatiotemporal som analysis which is rarely attempted in previous studies our study results show that spatiotemporal som analysis can not only identify common patterns in complex water quality data but also enable to reveal the driving forces behind water quality changes the objectives of this study are 1 to illustrate the long term water quality pattern for hong kong marine water 2 to determine the spatiotemporal variabilities in some water quality parameters and 3 to explore the main driving factors for marine water quality and propose some management strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hong kong special administrative region is located in southern china south of shenzhen guangdong province east of the pearl river estuary between 22 12 22 54 n and 113 31 114 18 e hong kong has a land area of 1 106 km2 and marine water area of 1 649 km2 hong kong contains three major parts hong kong island kowloon and new territories with various small islands the marine environment of hong kong is complex as the west coast is influenced by terrestrial discharge from the pearl river delta the east coast connects with the relatively clear water of the south china sea and municipal and industrial wastewater is discharged into the marine water chen et al 2004 morton and wu 1975 the hong kong marine waters are influenced by pearl river discharge monsoon induced coastal currents and tidal currents in the wet season pearl river discharge contributes a large freshwater flux with high nutrient loading to the western marine water and the heavy rainfall during monsoon dilutes the sea water in the dry season the northeastern monsoon winds drive the river water away from hong kong so the oceanic water dominates the marine water chen et al 2021 morton and wu 1975 in addition typhoons with strong winds and storms are frequent during summer and autumn which influence hydrodynamics greatly choy et al 2020 the water quality of hong kong marine water is also influenced by several water control projects before 2001 most sewage was discharged into victoria harbor after basic treatment in december 2001 stage i of the hong kong harbor area treatment scheme hats was implemented to improve the water quality in victoria harbor and surrounding waters the hong kong government constructed a long deep tunnel sewage system to collect sewage from urban kowloon tsing yi kwai chung tseung kwan o and eastern hong kong island and transport it to a centralized sewage treatment plant at stonecutters island after chemically enhanced primary treatment cept a sewage flow of 1 4 million m3 d is discharged 2 km west of the harbor xu et al 2011 in 1998 another project called the tolo harbor action plan thap was implemented to reduce anthropogenic nutrient pollution in tolo harbor by transferring 90 of the sewage to victoria lie et al 2011 as a provincial boundary river the shenzhen river is managed by the governments of both hong kong and guangdong province the shenzhen river control project srcp was implemented in four stages the first and second stages of the srcp were implemented from 1995 to 1998 by cutting straight and widening the depth of the shenzhen river and the third and fourth stages focused on comprehensive river water quality improvements after 2001 he and ye 2010 hu and tong 2015 2 2 water quality data to protect the marine environment the hong kong environmental protection department epd has been implementing a comprehensive marine water quality monitoring program since 1986 until 2016 the epd monitored marine water quality at 76 monitoring stations monthly and at 18 typhoon shelters marinas or dockyard bimonthly fig 1 presents the locations of the monitoring stations the epd has a dedicated marine monitoring vessel which is equipped with an advanced conductivity temperature depth ctd profiler linked to a computer controlled rosette water sampler more details are given in the epd report epd 2016 the surface water samples are collected 1 m below the surface the measured water quality parameters include volatile suspended solids vss unionized ammonia ua turbidity total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total inorganic nitrogen tin temperature suspended solids ss silica si secchi disc depth sdd salinity phaeopigments ph orthophosphate phosphorus po4 3 nitrite nitrogen no2 nitrate nitrogen no3 fecal coliform fc e coli dissolved oxygen do dissolved oxygen percentage do chlorophyll a chl a ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 to manage the marine environment the epd divided the hong kong marine area into 10 water control zones deep bay eastern buffer junk bay mirs bay north western port shelter southern tolo harbor and channel victoria harbor and western buffer fig 1 the station name comprises of two characters and a number the first character of the station name is the first character of the water control zone and the second character is m or t where m represents monitoring stations with monthly sampling and mostly more than 300 records and t refers to typhoon shelters marinas or dockyard with bimonthly sampling and only 30 records the different water control zones have different water quality objectives according to their location and usage epd 2016 2 3 self organizing map som algorithm a som is an unsupervised artificial neural network that projects multivariate input data onto a low dimensional space and visualizes output in a two dimensional space it is considered a nonlinear mapping technique as it identifies clusters in an unsupervised way without assumptions of linearity or normality of the input data based rather on the similarity of input data kohonen 1982 a som consists of two layers of neurons or units the input layer and output layer the input fed to a som is a n m matrix with n rows of samples and m columns of variables therefore the input matrix has n input vectors x i x 1 x m i 1 n the input vectors are classified or clustered using similarity measurements such as euclidean distance each input vector is connected to all the output neurons through the corresponding weight vector also called the reference vector the output neurons are fully connected and orderly arranged on a rectangular or hexagonal grid the learning algorithm of a som is as follows kalteh et al 2008 vesanto et al 2000 1 each neuron j 1 l in the output layer is linearly or randomly assigned an initial weight vector w j w 1 w m where l is the number of output neurons or map size and wj is transformed into the range of min x i max x i i 1 n 2 an input vector x i is fed to the network and the euclidean distances between the input vector x i and each of the weight vectors w j are calculated 3 the best matching unit bmu w b or the winner is selected according to eq 1 1 x i w b min j x i w j 4 the weight vectors of the bmu and topological neighbors of the bmu are updated following the learning rule eq 2 2 w j p 1 w j p Œ∑ p œï bj p x i w j p where p is the iteration step Œ∑ p is the learning rate and œï bj p is the neighborhood function which decreases from one at the bmu to zero at the units located within the radius r topological neighbors mean the neighbors in rectangular or hexagonal grid the most commonly used neighborhood functions are gaussian and bubble functions clark et al 2020 5 steps 2 to 4 are repeated until the learning rate is reduced to a predetermined small number or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached in this paper linear initialization is used as default setting for weight vector the initialization is made by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the training data at first then the map is initialized along the m dim greatest eigenvectors of the training data where m dim is the dimension of the map grid gaussian function is applied for neighborhood function the maximum iteration numbers are predefined according to the size of train data during learning process the weight vector associated with each neuron moves to the center of a cluster of input vectors in addition neurons that are adjacent to each other in the topology also move close to each other in the input space after training inputs with similar features are projected to the same map unit or nearby neighboring units therefore it is possible to visualize a high dimensional input space in the two dimensions of the network topology two types of grids are used to visualize a som result the unified distance matrix u matrix and the component plane vesanto et al 2000 both grids provide an intuitive display for users to understand cluster structure and complex relationships among the variables the u matrix displays euclidean distances between neighboring neurons by gradient color for example when using a gray gradient color the darker colors represent larger distances and vice versa in the u matrix a cluster is represented by a continuous region with lower values indicated by light colors bounded by high values indicated by darker colors in addition each input is assigned a label and the labels are on the u matrix map the component plane provides another way to visualize a som analysis result a component plane of a som shows the values that take the same component of the weight vectors in each of the map units the gradient similarity of m component planes provides direct visual information for the relations between the m variables notably parallel gradients show positive correlations while anti parallel gradients indicate negative correlations yin et al 2021 determining the map size the number of output neurons and the ratio between the number of map rows and columns is critical to applying a som the number of output neurons is determined using the formula 5 n n is the number of samples and the ratio between the number of map rows and columns is determined by the square root of the ratio between the largest eigenvalue and the second largest eigenvalue for the training data vesanto et al 2000 2 4 clustering som neurons the result of a som is a two dimensional arrangement of neurons on the map however a som cannot directly provide clusters of neurons because the boundaries of possible clusters are unclear in addition it is difficult to identify clusters from dozens of component planes without a clustering method therefore regardless of som neurons or numerous component planes a clustering method is needed lee et al 2019 the most common clustering method for a som is k means which aims to minimize the sum of squared distances from all points to their cluster centers and the davies bouldin index is often used to determine the optimal number of clusters baghanam et al 2020 gu et al 2019 however the k means algorithm has great uncertainty and may lead to different results by only simple repeats because of its stochastic initial cluster centers fr√§nti and sieranoja 2019 principal component analysis pca is another commonly used method for som neurons clustering pca is a powerful tool to explain the variance of a large dataset of interrelated variables with a smaller set of independent variables by extracting eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the covariance matrix of the original variables new orthogonal variables are produced to represent the original dataset with minimal loss of original information the principal components pcs provide information on the most meaningful parameters to describe the dataset zhang et al 2011 by extracting the first two pcs of neuron weight matrix or component plane matrix which is the transpose of weight matrix the neurons or component planes are clustered manually according to the relative position in the plot of the first two pcs li et al 2018 2 5 som analysis schemes water quality monitoring data is expressed by a three dimensional matrix x s v t s 1 n v 1 m t 1 k where a particular observed data value is expressed by three fundamental characteristics the sampling location s the sampling time t and the data type v in this study soms are applied for three kinds of input vectors corresponding to three analysis schemes i e s v som s t som and t s som which mean one dimension is chosen to be constant the three schemes have similar analyzing procedures but have different inputs fig 2 displays the flow chart of the s v som for a given time or time averaging the input matrix of a som is n m by learning with l neurons som s weight matrix l m is gotten then the som s results are displayed as u matrix or component planes to show the distances between neurons or the similarities between components if the neurons or the component planes are easy to classify manual classification is chosen to obtain the final clustering results of n and m otherwise by extracting first two pcs of l or m manual classification is applied to get results as described in section 2 4 finally if the clustering results are spatial results a map display is built to further interpret the spatial relations as for s t som or t s som a specified water quality variable is selected and som input matrix is n k or k n for s v som or s t som spatial clusters of monitoring stations that have similar water quality characteristics or time characteristics are obtained based on the corresponding u matrix additionally important discriminant parameters or times responsible for the clustering can be identified from the component planes allowing us to reveal relationships among the parameters or times for t s som som network receives a time dependent matrix and learns temporal relations among units over time temporal clusters where the units tend to follow each other over time are obtained based on som analysis results the temporal clusters represent the evolution over time of certain water quality parameters observed at all monitoring stations liu et al 2016 in this study the water quality trend in hong kong marine water has been explored from 1984 to 2016 in section 3 1 the descriptive statistics of the 24 water quality parameters are introduced the time average values from 1984 to 2016 with monthly or bimonthly measurements of the 24 water quality parameters are calculated for the 94 monitoring stations including 76 monitoring stations and 18 typhoon shelters marinas or dockyard then the s v som is used to explore long term patterns in water quality which is displayed in section 3 2 the total neuron number is 48 12 4 which is close to 5 94 94 is the total number of stations following the rule introduced in 2 3 four representative parameters have been selected to explore the spatiotemporal variability in marine water quality including fecal coliform bacteria po4 3 no3 and chl a the reasons for choosing these four variables are as follows 1 fecal coliform bacteria are introduced into aquatic environments mainly by discharge of nontreated wastewater and sewage thus the number of fecal coliforms bacteria is a good indicator of microbiological pollution for marine water rajendran et al 2018 2 with the implementation of stage i hats the concentration of po4 3 in victoria harbor greatly decreased as reported in some articles lai et al 2016 xu et al 2011 therefore po4 3 is an important parameter that is able to reflect the effects of water control projects 3 because of strong nitrification with the influence of high do concentrations in guangdong coastal regions the main composition of din is no3 rather than nh4 for most locations zhang et al 2016 thus no3 is selected to represent nitrogen nutrients and 4 the concentration of chl a is an important water quality indicator high chl a values indicate harmful algal blooms which may be caused by land drainage with high nutrient inputs lie et al 2011 many data points before 1994 are missing for all monitoring stations in addition the water quality parameters have been measured bimonthly at the 18 typhoon shelters marinas or dockyard therefore only the data measured at the 73 monitoring stations with relatively complete records between 1994 and 2016 have been chosen to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of the four selected parameters the annual averaged data have been used to explore the interannual patterns of e coli and po4 3 and the monthly averaged data have been used to explore the intra annual patterns of no3 and chl a to reduce skewness logarithmic transformation is applied for chl a monthly data for e coli and chl a s t som is applied while for po4 3 and no3 t s som is used the neuron numbers are 44 11 4 24 6 4 15 5 3 and 40 8 5 for e coli po4 3 no3 and chl a these results are shown in section 3 3 besides considering the decreasing concentration of po4 3 since the implementation of stage i hats in victoria harbor and the high concentration of no3 for pearl river in summer p may be the limiting nutrient in the estuarine influenced waters of hong kong to verify the assumption mentioned above the tin po4 3 n p ratios have also been analyzed using a s t som for monthly averaged data with 40 8 5 neuron numbers which is displayed in section 3 4 all the analyses in this study have been implemented in matlab r2018b using som toolbox

initializing and training and visualizing has been implemented following the toolbox manual the source code accompanying this study is available at https doi org 10 25442 hku 13838315 v1 3 results 3 1 statistical analysis the descriptive statistics of the 24 water quality parameters for the surface water of the hong kong marine area are listed in table s1 the statistics include minimum values maximum values mean values median values standard deviations sds and coefficients of variation cvs as shown in table s1 e coli has the largest cv followed by fc nh3 n and phaeopigments the cv values are more than 3 ph has the smallest cv followed by salinity and temperature the cv values are less than 0 2 for most parameters except temperature salinity ph do and do the median values are much smaller than the mean values indicating that the distributions of these parameters are far from a normal distribution the concentration of chl a ranges from 0 2 to 360 Œºg l with a mean value of 4 935 Œºg l and a sd of 9 302 Œºg l showing great variability regarding nutrients the mean value of tn is nearly ten times that of tp and approximately that half of si for nitrogen tin is roughly 55 2 of tn while nh3 n no2 and no3 are approximately 48 6 9 8 and 41 6 of tin for phosphorus po4 is about 45 6 of tp 3 2 long term water quality patterns 3 2 1 cluster identification the component planes of the 24 parameters are shown in fig 3 and the pca result corresponding to the component planes is shown in fig 4 notably to show the negative correlations of the component planes the absolute values of the covariance matrix have been used for pca the 24 parameters have been classified into five groups based on their component plane similarities fig 3 and fig 4 1 all nutrient related parameters ua tp tn tkn tin si po4 3 no2 no3 and nh3 n salinity and suspended matter related parameters vss ss and turbidity are classified into the first group except for salinity the high values of this group are located in the bottom left part of the som planes in comparison with the other parameters in this group salinity has the opposite gradient distribution 2 two dissolved oxygen related parameters do and do are classified in the second group the low values are located in the bottom right part of the plane 3 two chlorophyll related parameters phaeopigments and chl a temperature and organic matter bod5 are classified into the third group the high values are located in the middle left and bottom left parts of the plane 4 two microbiological parameters fc and e coli and ph are classified into the fourth group the high values are located in the bottom right part of the plane and the highest values are located to the left of the last row of neurons for fc and e coli besides ph has an opposite gradient distribution than that of the microbiological parameters 5 sdd is classified into the fifth group the high values are located in the upper right part of the plane and the low values are located in the bottom left part of the plane some additional information is obtained from fig 4 for group i vss and no3 deviate the most from the center while turbidity salinity and other parameters cluster closely to two different centers group iii is a sparse cluster because the distances between the parameters are large compared to other clusters sdd is in the middle of pca results alone which shows its unique characteristics 3 2 2 spatial patterns of the clusters fig 5 a and fig 5b present the u matrix and corresponding monitoring station names of the s v som results to overcome the difficulty in directly determining the boundaries between the clusters in the u matrix pca is applied to the 48 neurons of the u matrix to obtain clusters of the monitoring stations as showed in fig s1 in supplementary materials five regions with distinctive marine water characteristics are identified based on the clustering analysis fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of the five regions which are described as follows the box plot of different regions for 24 parameters is also displayed in fig s2 to verify clustering results and find characteristics for different regions 1 region 1 consists of western buffer victoria harbor junk bay and part of eastern buffer this region is characterized by high fc low temperature and low do water quality in region 1 is intensively influenced by human activities such as marine transportation and industry wastewater discharge feng et al 2019 2 region 2 is located in the interior of deep bay and receives discharge along the new territories and runoff from the shenzhen river yang and chui 2017 region 2 features high concentrations of nutrients chl a and fc and low salinity and do the water fluidity in this region is poor and anthropogenic pollutants are severe actually it is the worst water quality region along the hong kong marine region 3 region 3 is located in the northwestern region and the outlet of deep bay it is characterized by low salinity moderate nutrient concentration especially no3 and high temperature this region is adjacent to the pearl river estuary and directly influenced by massive pearl river discharge thus the salinity is low and the nutrient concentration is moderate 4 region 4 is mainly located in tolo harbor and channel this region features high do and high chl a concentrations the high do may be related to low levels of pollution which is rarely affected by industrial and urban activities chau 2007 on the contrary the high chl a may be due to poor water fluidity since tolo harbor is a semi closed shallow bay xu et al 2010 5 region 5 includes the areas to the east and south of hong kong marine water and this region has high do and high sdd this region is mainly influenced by the south china sea current so the water quality is pretty good region 4 has three stations sm11 st3 and st1 near lantau island and region 2 has one station vt4 at victoria harbor on the one hand st3 st1 and vt4 only have 30 bimonthly records which means insufficient information for accurate classification on the other hand the neuron that includes sm11 st1 and st4 is in the boundary of region 4 and region 5 as showed in fig 5 and pca cannot accurately distinguish the boundary 3 3 spatiotemporal patterns of representative water quality parameters fig 7 displays the spatial clustering results of the four representative parameters the spatial classifications corresponding to the clustering results are given in fig s3 fig 8 and fig 9 display the temporal patterns and corresponding clustering results for four parameters the boxplots of the corresponding clustering results are presented in fig 10 the remainder of this section illustrates the som analysis results of the four parameters in detail 3 3 1 fecal coliform bacteria three spatial clusters have been identified for fecal coliform bacteria e coli by clustering som units through pca fig s3a the spatial distribution of the clusters is presented in fig 7a cluster i s i ec is distributed inside deep bay and part of victoria harbor while cluster ii s ii ec in another part of victoria harbor and cluster iii c iii ec in the remaining water control zones the temporal som analysis results for fecal coliform bacteria are presented in fig 8a with the help of pca the pca groups the yearly component planes into two periods the first period t 1 ec ranging from 1994 to 2000 except 1996 and the second period ranging from 2001 to 2016 the year 1996 is excluded because of extremely high values observed at the dm1 station fig 11 shows the annual variation in e coli between the two periods within the three spatial clusters as observed in the fig 9a and fig 11 e coli concentrations are higher in spatial clusters s i ec and s ii ec than in spatial cluster s iii ec no obvious trend is found between the two periods for spatial cluster s iii ec while significant shifts can be seen for spatial clusters s i ec and s ii ec the e coli concentration for spatial cluster s i ec fluctuates more from period 1 to period 2 in contrast a downward trend in the mean e coli concentration is observed for spatial cluster s ii ec 3 3 2 orthophosphate phosphorus four spatial clusters are identified for orthophosphate phosphorus po4 3 by applying pca on station component planes fig s3b fig 7b presents the spatial distribution of the four clusters cluster i s i p o 4 includes the water control zones of deep bay station dm5 is not included and northwestern cluster ii s ii p o 4 includes victoria harbor tolo harbor and channel western buffer junk bay eastern buffer and a small part of southern cluster iii s iii p o 4 includes mirs bay port shelter and southern cluster iv s iv p o 4 includes the outlet of deep bay dm5 fig 8b presents the u matrix and temporal clusters of som analysis for po4 3 as shown in fig 8b there is a clear boundary between the results of the u matrix before and after 2001 the temporal evolution of po4 3 is also clearly illustrated by the movement of the bmu the bmu moves from the bottom of the map to the upper left and then to the upper right over time three periods are identified in the figure 1994 2001 t 1 p o 4 2003 2008 t 2 p o 4 and 2009 2015 t 2 p o 4 the years 2002 and 2016 are not included because of quite low values of deep bay and northwestern in 2002 and sharply increased values of tolo harbor in 2016 as shown in fig s4 the first period t 1 p o 4 is further divided into two stages 1994 1995 and 1999 2001 is recognized as t 1 p o 4 s 1 and 1996 1998 as t 1 p o 4 s 2 as shown in fig 10b the average concentration of po4 3 decreases gradually from period 1 to period 3 for spatial cluster i s i p o 4 as indicated by the values of s i p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s i p o 4 t 2 p o 4 and s i p o 4 t 3 p o 4 spatial cluster ii s ii p o 4 has a similar temporal evolution pattern as that of s i p o 4 however there is a difference between s i p o 4 and s ii p o 4 in the two stages of period t 1 p o 4 as shown in the subplot of fig 9b spatial cluster s i p o 4 has the highest average value of po4 3 in the second stage of period 1 as indicated by s i p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s 2 however the average values of po4 3 in the two stages of period 1 i e s ii p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s 1 and s ii p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s 2 are almost identical for s ii p o 4 for spatial cluster iii s iii p o 4 the average value of po4 3 is the highest in period 1 see s iii p o 4 t 1 p o 4 and lowest in period 2 see s iii p o 4 t 2 p o 4 and the average value of po4 3 in period 3 s iii p o 4 t 3 p o 4 is slightly higher than that in period 2 s iii p o 4 t 2 p o 4 for cluster iv the average value of po4 3 is the highest in period 2 s iv p o 4 t 2 p o 4 and the po4 3 values are almost equal in period 1 s iv p o 4 t 1 p o 4 and period 3 s iv p o 4 t 3 p o 4 3 3 3 nitrate nitrogen three spatial clusters for no3 have been identified by applying pca on component planes fig s3c and corresponding results are displayed in fig 7c spatial cluster i s i n o 3 includes the water control zones of northwestern victoria harbor southern eastern buffer western buffer and part of deep bay nearly all the west and south regions of hong kong spatial cluster ii s ii n o 3 includes port shelter mirs bay and part of tolo harbor and channel spatial cluster iii s iii n o 3 includes the interior of deep bay and the interior of tolo harbor and channel obviously the spatial clustering results are distinctive with geological locations as displayed in fig 7c three temporal clusters have been identified through manual classification of u matrix fig 8c season 1 m 1 n o 3 consists of dec jan feb and mar while season 2 m 2 n o 3 jun and jul and season 3 m 3 n o 3 apr may aug sep oct and nov the temporal clustering results show good seasonal variation fig 9c compares the seasonal variation in no3 among the three temporal monthly clusters within the three spatial clusters for median values in the box plot spatial cluster i s i n o 3 s values are the highest followed by spatial cluster iii s iii n o 3 s values and spatial cluster ii s ii n o 3 s values are the lowest it can also be observed that no3 concentrations in different spatial clusters reach their peak values in different seasons the no3 concentrations in spatial cluster i and ii s i n o 3 and s ii n o 3 are the highest in season 2 and season 1 respectively as indicated by the values of s i n o 3 m 2 n o 3 and s ii n o 3 m 1 n o 3 no obvious peak value is found for spatial cluster iii s iii n o 3 there are large outliers for spatial cluster i and ii s i n o 3 and s ii n o 3 of all three temporal clusters while spatial cluster iii s iii n o 3 does not have outliers on the contrary spatial cluster iii s 25 75 variation ranges are the largest and the median values are much smaller than the third quartile values for all three temporal clusters 3 3 4 chlorophyll a three spatial clusters of chl a have been identified based on the u matrix and pca fig 7d presents the spatial distribution of the three clusters spatial cluster i s i chl consists of the water control zones of western buffer victoria harbor junk bay eastern buffer part of northwestern part of mirs bay and part of southern spatial cluster ii s ii chl consists of port shelter mirs bay the outlet of deep bay and part of northwestern spatial cluster iii s iii chl consists of the interior of deep bay tolo harbor and channel and part of southern fig 8d shows component planes for the 12 months analyzed in the temporal som three seasonal clusters have been identified based on the similarities of the component planes jun jul and aug are classified as season 2 m 2 chl may and sep are classified as season 3 m 3 chl while the other months are classified as season 1 m 1 chl as shown in fig 9d all the average values of chl a in the three spatial clusters are the highest in season 2 and the lowest in season 1 the average values of chl a in spatial cluster iii are higher than those in the other spatial clusters in almost all three seasons 3 4 n p ratios the results of the som and component planes for tin po4 3 are shown in fig s5 and fig 12 two temporal patterns are classified clearly from fig 12 for may jun jul aug and sep the highest values are located in the bottom left while for other months in the bottom right the average phytoplankton n p ratios is 16 1 which represents a balance of n and p nutrient for phytoplankton growth for a large portion of the locations n p value exceeds 16 in summer except for those in the upper right in winter nearly all the regions have n p ratios lower than the average level the pca result of spatial clustering does not have clear boundaries so the average phytoplankton n p ratios of 16 1 cannot be directly displayed to overcome this the values of typical months have been chosen to display the spatial distribution in fig 13 jul nov apr and sep are selected considering representativeness and transition for july the values of west and south of hong kong coastal regions are larger than 16 especially the southern control zone where the values are larger than 50 for november the values of nearly all the stations are smaller than 16 except that of nm6 most of mirs bay port shelter and east of southern s values are even smaller than 9 for april and september the highest values are located in the west of hong kong and the values for east of hong kong are smaller than 16 the southern regions of hong kong are transition zones of 16 for tolo harbor the values decrease from the interior to outlet nearly all months for the interior of deep bay the values are smaller than 16 whole year all these results are consistent with som s results 4 discussion 4 1 interrelations among water quality parameters in the long term water quality analysis mutual relationships among the 24 water quality parameters have been determined by clustering parameter component planes fig 3 and fig 4 high and positive correlations are found between nutrient parameters and suspended matter while negative correlations are found between nutrient parameters and salinity this means that the monitoring stations with high levels of nutrients may also have high levels of suspended matter and low salinity levels due to the inflow of freshwater that brought considerable amounts of n p and si nutrients and suspended matter for hong kong marine water the discharges of the pearl and shenzhen rivers are the main freshwater sources thus regions 2 and 3 have relatively high levels of nutrients and suspended matter chl a has positive correlations with temperature and bod5 meaning that high temperature and organic matter may be related to high chl a concentrations generally high temperature accelerates the growth of phytoplankton which are responsible for high chl a concentrations de jonge et al 2012 after a decay process phytoplankton turn into organic matters and bod5 increases subsequently the correlation is weak compared with that among other water quality parameter groups implying that the factors influencing of chl a concentration are not only the two mentioned above nutrient levels sufficient illumination and water fluidity are also important factors for chl a chen et al 2017 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 regions 2 and 4 have high concentrations of chl a saliently ph has a high and negative correlation with the microbiological parameters due to different control factors for ph physical mixing between riverine freshwater and seawater dominates its distribution which shows lower values in region 1 region 3 especially region 2 as displayed in fig s2 as mentioned in existing studies pearl river s mean ph is around 7 4 while shenzhen river s ph varies from 6 67 to 7 21 lu et al 2020 wijesiri et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 besides region 4 s ph is larger than that of region 5 region 5 s ph represents the normal level of south china sea this ph increase in surface water may be contributed to biological metabolism and co2 outgassing because of severe phytoplankton blooms zhao et al 2020 for the high levels of e coli severe pollution of shenzhen river and sewage discharge from hong kong may be responsible for regions 2 and 3 consequently shenzhen river s extremely high microbiological pollution and lower ph leads to the ph being classified in group iv rather than group i do and sdd are classified as unique individual patterns reflecting that these two parameters have their own characteristics and may have been influenced by multifaceted factors 4 2 influence of ocean currents and freshwater discharge on marine water quality based on the som analysis results for chl a and no3 fig 7c 7d and fig 8c 8d the spatiotemporal variations in chl a and no3 are affected by ocean currents and nutrients from freshwater discharge three spatial clusters and three temporal clusters have been identified for no3 spatial cluster s i n o 3 is located to the west and south of hong kong fig 7c where the pearl river brings a large amount of nutrients the no3 values in deep bay and northwestern belonging to spatial cluster s i n o 3 are significantly larger than those in other water control zones especially at the monitoring stations of dm3 dm4 dm5 nm5 and nm6 where no3 values are close to 1 0 mg l and are displayed as outliers in fig 9c the temporal pattern of no3 in s i n o 3 is also impacted by the seasonal variation in the pearl river discharge the no3 concentration in s i n o 3 is higher in summer than in winter as indicated by the values of s i n o 3 m 2 n o 3 and s i n o 3 m 1 n o 3 fig 9c which may result from the large nutrient input from the pearl river in summer spatial cluster s ii n o 3 is located in east hong kong and is influenced mainly by the oligotrophic conditions of the south china sea for this cluster the limited nutrient is bioavailable nitrogen rather than dip he et al 2016 the no3 concentration in this region is relatively low in all years compared to that in the other control zones furthermore the no3 concentration in summer is lower than that in winter a possible reason may be the consumption of no3 caused by phytoplankton spatial cluster s iii n o 3 includes the interior of deep bay and tolo harbor where the water fluidity is poor thus the seasonal variation in the no3 values of this cluster is weak for the interior of tolo harbor submarine groundwater discharge sgd is also an important and steady nitrogen source as reported in several articles with an estimated range from 3 104 to 1 1 106 mol d for dissolved inorganic nitrogen input lee et al 2012 luo and jiao 2016 luo et al 2014 which is pretty high compared to global levels beusen et al 2013 similar to those in no3 the spatiotemporal variations in chl a are also influenced by ocean currents and nutrients from freshwater victoria harbor in spatial cluster s i chl is highly flushed where the monthly average value of chl a reaches its maximum in summer when the strongest stratification occurred as indicated by the value of s i chl m 1 chl in fig 9d on the other hand the high flushing rate also restricts nutrient utilization lee et al 2006 in other seasons horizontal dilution and light limitation induced by vertical mixing lead to low chl a values xu et al 2010 with high nutrient levels and strong stratification chl a increases greatly in summer in this region while the intensive flushing restricts a further increase in chl a in summer and leads to low concentrations in other seasons overall the chl a concentrations in spatial cluster s ii chl i e port shelter mirs bay outlet of deep bay and part of northwestern are low however the spatiotemporal variations in chl a in different parts of s ii chl are different the nutrient level in the eastern part of s ii chl i e port shelter and mirs bay is very low resulting in low chl a concentrations in contrast the nutrient level in the western part of s ii chl i e outlet of deep bay and part of northwestern is as high as in spatial cluster s i chl but the strong current in the pearl river estuary restricts the chl a concentration in summer due to weak flushing year long stratification long residence times weak tidal currents and adequate nutrients from local rivers or sgd chl a concentrations in spatial cluster s iii chl are high in all seasons as indicated by the values of s iii chl m 1 chl s iii chl m 2 chl and s iii chl m 3 chl especially in tolo harbor luo and jiao 2016 xu et al 2010 the areas of this cluster including deep bay tolo harbor and northwestern mirs bay have also been mentioned in other articles hafeez et al 2019 nazeer and nichol 2016 4 3 effects of water control projects on marine water quality e coli and po4 3 have been used as indicators to assess the effects of water control projects on marine water quality three spatial clusters and two temporal clusters are identified for e coli the concentrations of e coli are high in victoria harbor and the interior of deep bay in spatial clusters s i ec and s ii ec however the e coli concentrations in s ii ec reaches their peak values in approximately 2000 and declined continually thereafter more interestingly the area with relatively high e coli levels in victoria harbor moves to the west slightly from spatial cluster s ii ec to s i ec and the station with the highest e coli moves from vm2 to vm5 these spatiotemporal changes in e coli in victoria harbor coincide with the construction of stage i hats which collects approximately 75 of the sewage generated in the harbor area for treatment at stonecutters island which is finally discharged through the outfall to the western harbor area lai et al 2016 in contrast increase in severity of e coli pollution in the interior of deep bay can be noticed after 2000 therefore close attention and action should be implemented for severe bacterial pollution in deep bay as described in the section 3 3 2 four spatial clusters and three periods have been identified for po4 3 based on the som analysis results temporal changes in po4 3 concentrations in spatial clusters s i p o 4 and s ii p o 4 reflect the different effects of different water control projects on marine water quality water quality in spatial cluster s i p o 4 i e deep bay and northwestern is largely related to srcp for the first and second stages of the srcp from 1995 to 1998 by cutting straight and widening the depth the water flow rate of the shenzhen river increased greatly and bottom sediments moved into deep bay with large nutrient levels he and ye 2010 hu and tong 2015 as a result the po4 3 concentration reaches its highest value during this period as shown in s i p o 4 t 1 p o 4 s 2 however after implementing the third and fourth stages of the srcp the po4 3 concentration continuously decreases after 2001 lan and wu 2015 it should be noted that even the lowest po4 3 concentrations in the interior of deep bay are higher than most of the highest values in the other regions especially at stations dm1 and dm2 therefore more attention should be given to the high levels of nutrient pollution in deep bay temporal changes in the po4 3 concentration in spatial cluster s ii p o 4 are largely related to the thap and hats projects s ii op includes the surrounding area of victoria harbor and tolo harbor the implementation of thap in 1998 largely reduces anthropogenic nutrient pollution in tolo harbor lie et al 2011 in 2001 with the implementation of hats 75 of the sewage from victoria was treated and discharged west of the harbor near stonecutters island xu et al 2010 the po4 3 concentration in tolo harbor has decreased gradually since 1998 and has been at a low level since 2001 while the po4 3 concentration in victoria harbor and its surrounding areas has decreased dramatically since 2001 the limiting nutrient for tolo harbor s surface layer also changed from si in wet season to p after 2000 liang et al 2020 the result implies the good effects of thap and hats in terms of reducing anthropogenic phosphorus nutrient pollution similar to that in spatial cluster s ii p o 4 the po4 3 concentration in spatial cluster s iii p o 4 decreases significantly after 2001 however the average po4 3 concentration in third period t 3 p o 4 2009 2015 increases in comparison with that in second period t 2 p o 4 2003 2008 the increase in the po4 3 concentration may be resulted from nonpoint pollution archana et al 2016 chau 2007 the po4 3 concentration in spatial cluster s iv p o 4 is mainly influenced by pearl river discharge the average pearl river discharge in period t 2 p o 4 is larger than that in the remaining periods lu et al 2009 and the po4 concentration in s iv p o 4 is also larger that in t 2 p o 4 the influence of the pearl river discharge decreases from nm5 to nm1 with the flow direction which is confirmed by the decreasing values from nm5 to nm1 in t 2 p o 4 4 4 variation in nutrient limitation as displayed in figs 12 and 13 tin po4 3 have obvious spatiotemporal characteristics the tin po4 3 values of a large portion of the locations exceed 16 in summer except those in port shelter tolo harbor and channel the interior of deep bay and part of mirs bay therefore p is the limiting nutrient in the western and southern hong kong marine regions in summer xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 in winter nearly all the regions have lower n p values than the average level which means that n is the limiting nutrient in winter for spring and autumn south regions of hong kong are transition zones from p limit in west regions to n limit in east regions another interesting finding is the change in the region with the highest n p value during may june july and august the southern control zone has the highest n p values while during other months northwestern western buffer and the outlet of deep bay have the highest n p values one of reason for this phenomenon may have been the spatiotemporal variation of the influence range of pearl river discharge which is the main source of nitrogen zhang et al 2019 in summer pearl river freshwater discharge reaches southern control zone with high nitrate concentrations because of the low orthophosphate concentrations as mentioned in section 3 3 2 the nitrates consumed by phytoplankton are also low compared with victoria harbor leaving considerably high n p values in this region as for spring and winter pearl river discharge reaches northwestern control zone and west of southern control zone and causes high n p values in these regions as for tolo harbor the gradually decreasing n p values from the interior to outlet may be contributed to sgd with high n p values luo et al 2014 the high n p values for sgd are also reported in other regions gao et al 2018 rodellas et al 2015 slomp and van cappellen 2004 5 summary and conclusions this study explores the spatiotemporal variability of water quality in hong kong marine water areas by combined use of som and pca three types of som analysis schemes have been applied to multivariate marine water quality observations and pca is used to help the clustering of som neurons and component planes with nonlinearity characteristics noise tolerance and excellent visualization s t som and t s som are powerful for spatiotemporal analysis i e a simultaneous clustering of spatiotemporal domains which is helpful in deciphering the driving forces behind the data overall the combined use of som and pca provides a holistic view of the complex multivariate water quality data the major findings of this study are as follows first the long term mean water quality analysis shows that the hong kong marine water areas can be classified into five regions with distinctive water quality characteristics the representative water control zones in the five regions are victoria harbor deep bay northwestern tolo harbor and mirs bay second the spatiotemporal variations in chl a and no3 are greatly affected by ocean currents and nutrients from pearl river discharge tolo harbor and deep bay experience high chl a year round because of weak flushing hydrodynamics and abundant nutrients from local rivers or sgd third the effects of water control projects on marine water quality determined by the som reveal that with the implementation of hats anthropogenic bacterial and po4 3 contamination have decreased significantly in victoria harbor since 2001 srcp also decreases the po4 3 pollution in deep bay fourth in the western and southern hong kong marine regions n is the limiting nutrient in winter and p in summer due to the massive discharge of the pearl river that contain no3 our study suggests that deep bay deserves immediate attention for its high chl a nutrient and fc levels and poor fluidity the studied marine water area being located between hong kong sar and guangdong province cross regional cooperation of the two governments is needed to improve the water quality of deep bay the combined spatiotemporal som analyses provide a powerful tool for understanding complex marine water processes this method can be applied to solve other hydrological and
