4855,as brazil becomes one of the largest agricultural and livestock producers the expansion of cultivated pasture and crop areas in the cerrado region is expected to cause significant changes in carbon and water vapor fluxes while this change in land use promotes modifications in regional carbon uptake and water cycle eddy covariance studies carried out in pasture areas in the brazilian cerrado remain scarce the present study aimed to quantify the carbon uptake and water vapor exchange of these areas in the brazilian cerrado the experimental site was installed in an area covered by brachiaria sp in três lagoas ms brazil data were collected during two hydrological years 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 pasture strongly acted as a carbon sink its total accumulation reached 208 9 9 6 and 171 8 15 8 g c m 2 in the first and second hydrological years respectively average evapotranspiration of 2 0 1 1 mm d 1 was observed in the two hydrological years there was significant reduction in evapotranspiration at the pasture site during the driest months of the year june and july mainly in the second hydrological year which recorded an average of 0 4 0 1 mm d 1 the lower recorded water availability in the soil led to the release of 86 7 g c m 2 over 85 days in the dry season of the second hydrological year ecosystem level water use efficiency observed during the higher soil water deficit facilitated the survival of the grass this information is the basis for further studies about the impact of climate change on carbon uptake and water vapor flux by cultivated and natural pasture additionally the present research will allow comparisons of carbon storage results to other ecosystems and to support studies of agrometeorological modeling keywords eddy covariance evapotranspiration land use change net ecosystem exchange 1 introduction brazil became one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities in the last 50 years such change derived from the development of production technologies moreover brazil is highly competitive in the livestock sector it has one of the largest bovine herds in the world consisting of approximately 215 million head of cattle beef cattle production in 2017 reached 9 5 million tons and dairy cattle produced 33 5 million tons of milk the country is the second largest beef producer only behind the united states fao 2019 given the advancements in livestock due to the government incentives to the sector mainly from 1940s pasture areas have been expanding in 2017 such area accounted for 112 million hectares which corresponds to approximately 32 of the area used for agriculture ibge 2019 this expansion of pastures has accounted for the loss of native areas in many ecosystems one of which being the brazilian cerrado estimates show that approximately 50 of the brazilian cerrado ecosystem was deforested and this biome accounts for more than 50 of the national beef production vendrame et al 2010 lapola et al 2014 arantes et al 2016 bonanomi et al 2019 currently at least 30 of the brazilian cerrado area is covered with cultivated pasture and approximately 12 is used for annual and perennial crop cultivation mapbiomas 2020 this change in land use has led to evapotranspiration and carbon fixation reductions arantes et al 2016 however the annual budgets and the seasonal effects of beef production on carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes in pasture areas of the brazilian cerrado remains poorly understood due to the small number of eddy covariance studies conducted under the climatic conditions of this region the replacement of natural forests by crop areas also intensifies global climate change according to ipcc 2013 climate change causes temperature rise and an increase in dry season duration climate change has the potential to alter the carbon source sink dynamics of ecosystems thus the analysis of carbon fluxes including net ecosystem exchange nee gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration reco is essential to study the influence of environmental conditions such as drought periods rainfall and fire frequency on the role of pastures as a carbon source or sink xu and baldocchi 2004 rajan et al 2013 feng and liu 2016 sharma et al 2019 jongen et al 2011 have concluded that lack of rain decreases gpp and consequently decreases carbon uptake in pastures silva et al 2017 analyzed the surface fluxes seasonality in changing land use from the caatinga biome to pasture areas with aim to identify the key variables that drive the surface fluxes and they observed short term increased in carbon fluxes under rainfall events in pasture and caatinga biome sites results showed that the soil water content was crucial to carbon fluxes seasonality evapotranspiration et is one of the main components of the hydrological cycle it is a critical variable that explains the impact of water cycle dynamics on composition growth and development of plant communities at different spatial scales feng and liu 2016 castelli et al 2018 the et is also directly influenced by environmental conditions such as sunlight availability vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil water content silva et al 2017 found et decreased in pasture subjected to high vpd rubert et al 2018 concluded that grassland et had a linear response to the radiation balance and presented hysteresis due to high vpd and high air temperature this shows there was an increase in et response until certain water vapor demand of atmosphere and air temperature values were reached additionally ecosystem level water use efficiency wue broadly defined as the ratio between ecosystem level et and gpp provides a way to understand the relationship between carbon uptake and water loss by different plant groups c3 and c4 and the vegetation adaptation mechanisms under water stress conditions at the ecosystem level in different time scales hu et al 2008 beer et al 2009 tang et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 guerrieri et al 2016 wue variability is closely related to climatic metabolic vegetal and floristic composition factors tang et al 2014 knauer et al 2018 de oliveira et al 2018 identified lower wue in wheatgrass in the growing season than in times of greater vegetation dormancy due to the higher water content in the soil during this season other environmental indices may be used to characterize the meteorological conditions influence on the ecosystem such as light use efficiency lue the temporal quantification of ecosystem level lue allows to analyze the seasonal pattern of radiation solar conversion into vegetation biomass overtime zhang et al 2011 thus eddy covariance studies performed in pasture areas in the brazilian cerrado are essential to help better understanding alterations in carbon and water vapor fluxes along with changes in vegetation activities over wet dry seasons as well as future implications of such changes the aims of the present study were i to determinate carbon and water vapor fluxes of a pasture site in the brazilian cerrado and to compare their variations between wet and dry seasons ii to determine water use efficiency vegetation stomatal conductance and light use efficiency and iii to compare the present results of seasonal pattern and annual budgets of carbon and water vapor fluxes with other studies in savannas 2 materials

throughout the two hydrological years 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 are shown in fig 1 and table 2 the average air temperature tair during the study period was 23 2 3 2 c standard deviation in the first hydrological year the lowest tair was 9 3 c recorded in july 2017 with the average of 23 0 3 2 c fig 1a in the second hydrological year the average tair was 23 4 3 2 c fig 1a the monthly tair ranged from 18 1 to 25 6 c in the first hydrological year and from 19 6 to 26 8 c in the second year table 2 the vapor pressure deficit vpd ranged from 0 3 kpa to 3 1 kpa with average vpd of 1 3 0 5 kpa throughout the period the highest monthly vpd values in the first and second hydrological years were 2 1 and 1 7 kpa respectively fig 1a and table 2 solar radiation rg had a similar response in the two hydrological years with highest values in the wet season total sum of 3720 mj m 2 d 1 and lowest values in the dry season total sum of 2950 mj m 2 d 1 that is a decrease of 21 however there was a low incidence of solar radiation in october 2017 fig 2 b and table 2 the soil water recharge period often lasts six months from october to march although some rainfall events are observed during the driest period of the year from april to september there was a larger number of events and higher total rainfall 115 events 1150 mm respectively in the first hydrological year total rainfall in the second hydrological year 673 mm was 41 lower than the first year and it was distributed into 92 events moreover short drought periods were observed in the warmest months from december to february fig 1c and table 2 the highest monthly rainfall accumulation throughout the whole experimental period was 450 6 mm month 1 distributed across 25 days of january during the first hydrological year due to the drought in the second hydrological year there was total soil water storage sws reduction by 24 during the dry season in comparison to the same period in the previous year table 2 3 2 seasonal variations in vegetation index ndvi estimated throughout the experimental period ranged from 0 11 to 0 70 in 2017 the highest ndvi was recorded on february 28th with an average value of 0 60 0 07 and

evapotranspiration et and average water use efficiency wue in the pasture are shown in fig 3 and table 2 nee was 208 9 9 6 the annual nee uncertainty g c m 2 in the first hydrological year which resulted in carbon uptake at rates of 2 1 t c ha 1 and nee was 171 8 15 8 g c m 2 in the second hydrological year which represented an accumulation of 1 7 t c ha 1 these results show that pasture acted as a carbon sink during the assessed hydrological years fig 3a the maximum daily net ecosystem exchange nee by the pasture during the experimental period was 7 1 g c m 2 d 1 and the maximum carbon release was 6 9 g c m 2 d 1 with an average value of 0 5 1 5 g c m 2 d 1 fig 3a the greatest monthly co2 fixation 89 5 g c m 2 occurred in january of the second year the pasture acted as a carbon source in october 2016 august 2017 and july through september of 2018 table 2 higher carbon fixation peaked in the wet season and the average values were 0 8 1 5 g c m 2 d 1 and 1 2 1 9 g c m 2 d 1 in the first and second hydrological years respectively fig 3a the pasture had low values of nee in the dry season during the first hydrological year with average of 0 4 0 9 g c m 2 d 1 resulting in a decrease of 50 compared to wet season in the same year however the pasture had positive average nee of 0 24 1 2 g c m 2 d 1 in the dry season of the second hydrological year fig 3a in the driest period june and july of the second hydrological year nee 0 was recorded for 40 days fig 3a daily average gpp was 6 9 3 0 g c m 2 d 1 with a total accumulation in the first hydrological year equal to 2 673 g c m 2 and 2 346 g c m 2 in the second year resulting in a 12 gpp reduction in the second hydrological year the highest monthly gpp sum 336 7 g c m 2 occurred in november 2017 and the lowest 59 5 g c m 2 in august 2018 the daily average reco was 6 3 2 4 g c m 2 d 1 fig 3a the highest monthly reco sum occurred in the same month of the highest gpp sum table 2 daily et ranged from 0 1 to 5 7 mm d

lowest monthly accumulated et value was 9 1 mm recorded in july 2018 table 2 the total et was 791 mm in the first hydrological year where 66 was observed in the wet season fig 2b differently in the second hydrological year the total et was 640 mm and 75 of the total et was recorded at the wet season fig 3b ecosystem level water use efficiency wue ranged from 1 5 to 9 7 g c kg 1 h2o with an average of 4 0 1 1 g c kg 1 h2o fig 3c also in both hydrological years the lowest wue values occurred in the wet season where the average was 3 5 0 8 g c kg 1 h2o and the highest wue values occurred in the dry season with the average of 4 5 1 1 g c kg 1 h2o which represents an increase by 29 of wue fig 3c and table 2 3 4 hourly co2 uptake pattern strong reductions of nee showed the source behavior of the pasture during the dry season for example the 3 day average of nee was close to 0 0 1 g c m 2 30 min 1 resulting in a 3 day accumulated value of 0 4 g c m 2 d 1 high carbon uptake values were found in the wet season with an average nee of 0 10 0 2 g c m 2 30 min 1 resulting in a 3 day accumulated value of 13 g c m 2 d 1 fig 4 hourly average of gpp was 0 3 0 2 g c m 2 30 min 1 during the three days analyzed during the wet season and the hourly average of gpp was 0 1 0 1 g c m 2 30 min 1 during the dry season hourly reco presented an average of 0 16 0 01 during the days analyzed in the wet season and an average of 0 05 0 01 g c m 2 30 min 1 during the days analyzed in the dry season fig 4 3 5 relationship between gpp and et a positive linear gpp et ratio p 0 01 was observed between gpp and et throughout the two hydrological years the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 41 in the first year and 0 76 in the second year in addition to the greater correlation a higher slope coefficient 2 94 110 above that of the previous year was observed in the second hydrological year fig 5 the same behavior was observed through the gpp et ratio in the wet and dry seasons with a higher slope 2 96 in the dry season which was higher than 90 fig 5 3 6 vegetation stomatal conductance and its seasonal pattern the average vegetation stomatal conductance g c was 6 9 7 1 mm s 1 throughout the whole experimental period the minimum and maximum g c values of the pasture in the first hydrological year were 0 7 and 43 6 mm s 1 respectively with an average of 8 8 7 9 mm s 1 fig 6 the average g c value was 5 0 5 5 mm s 1 in the second hydrological year approximately 43 decrease in comparison to the previous period average g c in the wet season was 13 5 8 2 and 8 7 5 8 mm s 1 in the first and second hydrological year respectively the lowest average g c values were observed in the dry season with an average of 4 7 4 7 and 2 0 3 0 mm s 1 in the first and second hydrological years respectively fig 6 3 7 seasonal pattern of lue light use efficiency lue ranged from 0 to 60 mmol co2 mol 1 photons with an average of 16 0 7 4 mmol co2 mol 1 photons throughout the whole experimental period average lue in the wet season of the first hydrological year was similar to that recorded for the dry season with average close to 16 0 mmol co2 mol 1 photons however during the dry season of the second hydrological year an average of 9 5 4 9 mmol co2 mol 1 photons was recorded this number was 44 lower than that recorded in the same previous season fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 carbon and water vapor fluxes patterns in the pasture the study analyzed two seasonal cycles coinciding with hydrological years significant interannual and intra annual variations are expected to be observed in pasture carbon fluxes the current research showed the roll of pastures as carbon sink during the study period see fig 3a and table 2 a similar result was obtained by silva et al 2017 that analyzed the seasonal net ecosystem exchange of a pasture in the brazilian caatinga march 2014 to february 2015 they observed that pasture acted as a carbon sink 362 g c m 2 yr 1 the authors emphasized that there was a strong reduction in carbon assimilation during the dry season probably due to the water stress condition marchin et al 2018 analyzed net ecosystem exchange and gross photosynthesis of pasture in the mountains of australia from 2007 to 2012 they also observed that pasture acted as a carbon sink with maximum annual nee of 185 g c m 2 yr 1 throughout the assessed years value similar to nee sum found in this study and they highlighted the highest peak of nee in the warm season results contrary to our observation were obtained by hutley et al 2005 in an analysis of carbon fixation in two tropical savanna sites virginia park and howard springs for two years 2001 2003 annual nee was observed to range between 0 21 and 0 49 t c ha 1 yr 1 at the virginia park site during the study period indicating the site acted as a carbon source likely due to the hydric restriction precipitation p 600 mm yr 1 contrarily at the howard springs site was found values range from 0 18 to 1 64 t c ha 1 yr 1 excluding fire action that indicated this site acted as a carbon sink because of increased rainfall p 1400 mm yr 1 in comparison to the virginia park site rocha et al 2002 noticed a balance in carbon fluxes with nee close to 0 1 t c ha 1 yr 1 in the cerrado sensu stricto from 2000 to 2001 this result may be related to the presence of different plant communities and fire events low carbon fixation from july to september in the second hydrological year contributed to the pasture s role as the main carbon source given the rainfall frequency reduction and the soil water available for plants the highest carbon release by pasture throughout the whole experimental period was observed in september 2018 related to the long period of low sws values in the dry season june to august this result was confirmed by the low average ndvi value that indicated reduced vegetation coverage 0 36 see fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 and table 2 thus it was possible to observe high pasture dependence on soil water availability and fast gpp increases due to rainfall events feng and liu 2016 sharma et al 2019 based on the recorded results there is a strong dependence of pasture physiological activity on rainfall events that shape pasture s action as the source or sink of vegetation rajan et al 2013 pastures are more sensitive to more extended drought events than trees given the relatively shallow root system compared to that of trees in soil surface layers wolf et al 2011 silva et al 2017 yuhui et al 2018 also mentioned that rainfall frequency plays a crucial role in carbon exchanges in the ecosystem it is even more critical than total rainfall this statement is related to days with high total rainfall that result in high water loss caused by surface runoff and the percolation for groundwater ecosystem respiration reco presented a significant reduction during the dry season for both years there was a 48 reduction at the month with the lowest reco peak in the second hydrological year compared to the same month in the previous year this outcome was followed by gpp reduction and by the decrease of microbiological activity such plant behavior aimed reallocating nutrients within the plant to avoid its death due to low temperatures and reduced soil water content xu and baldocchi 2004 wei et al 2016 another important aspect is the influence of air temperature on pasture growth and development mainly when temperatures fall below that of the inferior basal temperature which may range from 10 c to 16 c for brachiaria sp silva et al 2012 the vegetation growth stopped under this temperature due to strong enzymatic activity reduction and the low biochemical reactions rates essential for the plant growth process this condition was more often observed in the dry season because minimum temperatures 10 c were observed as well as the lowest average value of 2 c in the study site data not shown the pasture et also followed the carbon fluxes the highest values were recorded in the wet season due to the highest soil water storage with peaks up to 6 mm d 1 see fig 3 and table 2 rubert et al 2018 assessed evapotranspiration in two sites of the brazilian pampa biome sma and pas from 2014 to 2016 they identified strong et seasonality with higher values in the warm and wet season the average et of the whole period was 2 36 1 4 mm d 1 and 2 56 1 7 mm d 1 for the sma and pas sites respectively the values are close to this present study feng and liu 2016 also analyzed the evapotranspiration behavior in a degraded pasture area in china from 2003 to 2007 and they found average et values close to 2 0 mm d 1 in the growing season also they stated that et peaks took place after the rainfall events and under favorable meteorological conditions such as high solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit results significantly lower than our observations were obtained by silva et al 2017 that reported an average et of 0 8 mm d 1 in a pasture of northeastern brazil this number is 60 lower than the average value recorded in the current study a fact that can be associated with the drier conditions in the northeastern region our results were similar to et averages of other brazilian cerrado sites such as giambelluca et al 2009 that obtained average et close to 2 0 mm d 1 in two brazilian cerrado sites cerrado denso and campo cerrado for two experimental years 2001 2003 although this ecosystem has a tree component it also has grasses that reduce et strongly during the dry season differing from the amazon rainforest that may reach average et of 3 96 0 65 mm d 1 during the dry season da rocha et al 2004 cabral et al 2015 monitored the et seasonality in the brazilian cerrado biome that is composed mainly of closed scrubs with tall trees a dense woody and grasses for three years 2009 2012 and they obtained average annual et of 1228 mm yr 1 72 higher than average et measured in this study 716 mm yr 1 this result indicates the greater contribution of tree species to the water cycle due to their expansive root system ability to explore deeper soil layers than grasses in the second hydrological year despite the drastic et reduction throughout the driest two months june july the efficient c4 metabolism allowed photosynthesis to continue even during the dry season which pasture had high wue during this period this is an adaptive strategy that allows c4 plants survival under stress conditions osborne and sack 2012 griffiths et al 2013 however given the long drought period plants were unable to maintain photosynthetic rates which resulted in carbon release due to higher ecosystem respiration de oliveira et al 2018 analyzed water vapor flux in wheatgrass in the united states from 2012 to 2016 and found annual average wue close to 2 0 g c kg 1 h2o 50 lower than that observed in the present study sharma et al 2019 found seasonal wue values between 2 7 and 3 0 g c kg 1 h2o in bluestem grass in texas the u s a from 2013 to 2015 a strong positive linear relationship between et and gpp was observed due to water vapor loss by plants which is an essential value for gas exchange in the vegetal community see fig 5 this result shows the influence of water cycle dynamics on vegetation growth as observed by sharma et al 2019 4 2 seasonal vegetation stomatal conductance variation in pasture there was a seasonal pattern of pasture vegetation stomatal conductance with a strong decrease in the driest two months in both hydrological years this process was driven by the lowest rainfall rates approximately 27 mm in june and july in the first hydrological year and it was 0 mm in same months in the second year furthermore in this last year there are lower sws values and higher dpv values peaks up to 1 6 kpa see fig 1a fig 6 and table 2 vapor pressure deficit is the main mechanism to influence the stomatal conductance because stomata present high sensitivity to the increased demand for atmospheric evaporation this scenario leads to high vpd values that cause stomatal closure which reduces the gas exchange rates between leaves and the atmosphere and consequently results in gpp decrease sharma et al 2019 low soil water availability harms the transpiration process and can cause the water column disruption throughout the xylem and promotes the leaf desiccation plants use survival strategies such as smaller stomata opening and osmotic adjustment to minimize water stress effects chaves et al 2016 these strategies are more effective in c4 than in c3 plants due to the mechanism to concentrate co2 and the spatial separation between rubisco and pepcase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase which reduces the photorespiration effects a process that diminishes photosynthetic efficiency sage 2004 griffiths et al 2013 4 3 pasture responses to sunlight variability solar radiation seasonality influences the pasture growth dynamics through time it is essential to analyze the efficient use of this meteorological element since it affects the biomass accumulation and duration of phenological stages the study showed efficient light use by the pasture mainly in the dry season this is a strategy to achieve better biomass conversion with lower solar radiation to ensure plant survival however there was a significant lue decrease in the dry season in the second hydrological year due to the increased water deficit this drought caused physiological and biochemical damage a fact that resulted in reduced vegetation cover in the site and leaf senescence this result was proven by the low ndvi value recorded in the dry season of this same hydrological year see fig 1c fig 2 and fig 7 this situation decreased light interception by the canopy and it caused plants to stop reaching sufficient light use efficiencies to ensure their growth and development the reduction of vegetative cover in the dry season is an alternative strategy to diminish canopy s evapotranspiration area mitigating the impact of water stress on plants lambers et al 2000 taiz et al 2017 another important aspect that must be highlighted is the highest lue value 29 9 mmol co2 mol 1 photons of the whole experimental period which was recorded in october 2017 this month was the rainiest throughout the entire period different from the previous hydrological year see fig 7 this response is related to the low solar radiation accumulation value caused by the cloudiness at the site such cloudiness made plants use mechanisms to adapt to ensure biomass production i e lue increase however despite the lue increase the pasture had nee close to zero and it only assured its maintenance zhang et al 2011 verified different lue responses under clear sky and cloudy sky conditions in many ecosystems in china the authors highlighted that under cloudy sky condition occurs increased diffuse radiation that reduces the light saturation in the leaves diminishing the photoinhibition effect 5 conclusions the current research quantified carbon and water vapor flux in the pasture as studies on cultivated pastures in the brazilian cerrado are scarce pasture acted as a carbon sink throughout the experimental period with total accumulated carbon reached 208 9 and 171 8 g c m 2 in the first and second hydrological years respectively carbon assimilation was strongly influenced by environmental conditions mainly by rainfall and soil water availability in the second year there was a significant reduction in the photosynthetic respiratory and evapotranspiration activities in the dry season concerning the wet season however high wue occurred in the driest two months june and july in both hydrological years due to the c4 metabolism of the pasture thus brachiaria sp at the experimental site used different ecophysiological strategies to allow their survival during the dry season such as smaller stomata opening leaf senescence and deeper roots in soil layers this information is the basis for further studies about the impact of climate change on carbon uptake and water vapor flux by cultivated and natural pasture moreover the present research will allow comparisons of carbon storage results to other ecosystems and to support studies of agrometeorological modeling credit authorship contribution statement josé darlon nascimento alves formal analysis data curation writing

4855,as brazil becomes one of the largest agricultural and livestock producers the expansion of cultivated pasture and crop areas in the cerrado region is expected to cause significant changes in carbon and water vapor fluxes while this change in land use promotes modifications in regional carbon uptake and water cycle eddy covariance studies carried out in pasture areas in the brazilian cerrado remain scarce the present study aimed to quantify the carbon uptake and water vapor exchange of these areas in the brazilian cerrado the experimental site was installed in an area covered by brachiaria sp in três lagoas ms brazil data were collected during two hydrological years 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 pasture strongly acted as a carbon sink its total accumulation reached 208 9 9 6 and 171 8 15 8 g c m 2 in the first and second hydrological years respectively average evapotranspiration of 2 0 1 1 mm d 1 was observed in the two hydrological years there was significant reduction in evapotranspiration at the pasture site during the driest months of the year june and july mainly in the second hydrological year which recorded an average of 0 4 0 1 mm d 1 the lower recorded water availability in the soil led to the release of 86 7 g c m 2 over 85 days in the dry season of the second hydrological year ecosystem level water use efficiency observed during the higher soil water deficit facilitated the survival of the grass this information is the basis for further studies about the impact of climate change on carbon uptake and water vapor flux by cultivated and natural pasture additionally the present research will allow comparisons of carbon storage results to other ecosystems and to support studies of agrometeorological modeling keywords eddy covariance evapotranspiration land use change net ecosystem exchange 1 introduction brazil became one of the largest producers of agricultural commodities in the last 50 years such change derived from the development of production technologies moreover brazil is highly competitive in the livestock sector it has one of the largest bovine herds in the world consisting of approximately 215 million head of cattle beef cattle production in 2017 reached 9 5 million tons and dairy cattle produced 33 5 million tons of milk the country is the second largest beef producer only behind the united states fao 2019 given the advancements in livestock due to the government incentives to the sector mainly from 1940s pasture areas have been expanding in 2017 such area accounted for 112 million hectares which corresponds to approximately 32 of the area used for agriculture ibge 2019 this expansion of pastures has accounted for the loss of native areas in many ecosystems one of which being the brazilian cerrado estimates show that approximately 50 of the brazilian cerrado ecosystem was deforested and this biome accounts for more than 50 of the national beef production vendrame et al 2010 lapola et al 2014 arantes et al 2016 bonanomi et al 2019 currently at least 30 of the brazilian cerrado area is covered with cultivated pasture and approximately 12 is used for annual and perennial crop cultivation mapbiomas 2020 this change in land use has led to evapotranspiration and carbon fixation reductions arantes et al 2016 however the annual budgets and the seasonal effects of beef production on carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes in pasture areas of the brazilian cerrado remains poorly understood due to the small number of eddy covariance studies conducted under the climatic conditions of this region the replacement of natural forests by crop areas also intensifies global climate change according to ipcc 2013 climate change causes temperature rise and an increase in dry season duration climate change has the potential to alter the carbon source sink dynamics of ecosystems thus the analysis of carbon fluxes including net ecosystem exchange nee gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration reco is essential to study the influence of environmental conditions such as drought periods rainfall and fire frequency on the role of pastures as a carbon source or sink xu and baldocchi 2004 rajan et al 2013 feng and liu 2016 sharma et al 2019 jongen et al 2011 have concluded that lack of rain decreases gpp and consequently decreases carbon uptake in pastures silva et al 2017 analyzed the surface fluxes seasonality in changing land use from the caatinga biome to pasture areas with aim to identify the key variables that drive the surface fluxes and they observed short term increased in carbon fluxes under rainfall events in pasture and caatinga biome sites results showed that the soil water content was crucial to carbon fluxes seasonality evapotranspiration et is one of the main components of the hydrological cycle it is a critical variable that explains the impact of water cycle dynamics on composition growth and development of plant communities at different spatial scales feng and liu 2016 castelli et al 2018 the et is also directly influenced by environmental conditions such as sunlight availability vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil water content silva et al 2017 found et decreased in pasture subjected to high vpd rubert et al 2018 concluded that grassland et had a linear response to the radiation balance and presented hysteresis due to high vpd and high air temperature this shows there was an increase in et response until certain water vapor demand of atmosphere and air temperature values were reached additionally ecosystem level water use efficiency wue broadly defined as the ratio between ecosystem level et and gpp provides a way to understand the relationship between carbon uptake and water loss by different plant groups c3 and c4 and the vegetation adaptation mechanisms under water stress conditions at the ecosystem level in different time scales hu et al 2008 beer et al 2009 tang et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 guerrieri et al 2016 wue variability is closely related to climatic metabolic vegetal and floristic composition factors tang et al 2014 knauer et al 2018 de oliveira et al 2018 identified lower wue in wheatgrass in the growing season than in times of greater vegetation dormancy due to the higher water content in the soil during this season other environmental indices may be used to characterize the meteorological conditions influence on the ecosystem such as light use efficiency lue the temporal quantification of ecosystem level lue allows to analyze the seasonal pattern of radiation solar conversion into vegetation biomass overtime zhang et al 2011 thus eddy covariance studies performed in pasture areas in the brazilian cerrado are essential to help better understanding alterations in carbon and water vapor fluxes along with changes in vegetation activities over wet dry seasons as well as future implications of such changes the aims of the present study were i to determinate carbon and water vapor fluxes of a pasture site in the brazilian cerrado and to compare their variations between wet and dry seasons ii to determine water use efficiency vegetation stomatal conductance and light use efficiency and iii to compare the present results of seasonal pattern and annual budgets of carbon and water vapor fluxes with other studies in savannas 2 materials

low incidence of solar radiation in october 2017 fig 2 b and table 2 the soil water recharge period often lasts six months from october to march although some rainfall events are observed during the driest period of the year from april to september there was a larger number of events and higher total rainfall 115 events 1150 mm respectively in the first hydrological year total rainfall in the second hydrological year 673 mm was 41 lower than the first year and it was distributed into 92 events moreover short drought periods were observed in the warmest months from december to february fig

evapotranspiration et and average water use efficiency wue in the pasture are shown in fig 3 and table 2 nee was 208 9 9 6 the annual nee uncertainty g c m 2 in the first hydrological year which resulted in carbon uptake at rates of 2 1 t c ha 1 and nee was 171 8 15 8 g c m 2 in the second hydrological year which represented an accumulation of 1 7 t c ha 1 these results show that pasture acted as a carbon sink during the assessed hydrological years fig 3a the maximum daily net ecosystem exchange nee by the pasture during the experimental period was 7 1 g c m 2 d 1 and the maximum carbon release was 6 9 g c m 2 d 1 with an average value of 0 5 1 5 g c m 2 d 1 fig 3a the greatest monthly co2 fixation 89 5 g c m 2 occurred in january of the second year the pasture acted as a

in the dry season with the average of 4 5 1 1 g c kg 1 h2o which represents an increase by 29 of wue fig 3c and table 2 3 4 hourly co2 uptake pattern strong reductions of nee showed the source behavior of the pasture during the dry season for example the 3 day average of nee was close to 0 0 1 g c m 2 30 min 1 resulting in a 3 day accumulated value of 0 4 g c m 2 d 1 high carbon uptake

observed between gpp and et throughout the two hydrological years the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 41 in the first year and 0 76 in the second year in addition to the greater correlation a higher slope coefficient 2 94 110 above that of the previous year was observed in the second hydrological year fig 5 the same behavior was observed through the gpp et ratio in the wet and dry seasons with a higher slope 2 96 in the dry season which was higher than 90 fig 5 3 6 vegetation stomatal conductance and its seasonal pattern the average vegetation stomatal conductance g c was 6 9 7 1 mm s

years respectively fig 6 3 7 seasonal pattern of lue light use efficiency lue ranged from 0 to 60 mmol co2 mol 1 photons with an average of 16 0 7 4 mmol co2 mol 1 photons throughout the whole experimental period average lue in the wet season of the first hydrological year was similar to that recorded for the dry season with average close to 16 0 mmol co2 mol 1 photons however during the dry season of the second hydrological year an average of 9 5 4 9 mmol co2 mol 1 photons was recorded this number was 44 lower than that recorded in the same previous season fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 carbon and water vapor fluxes patterns in the pasture the study analyzed two seasonal cycles coinciding with hydrological years significant interannual and intra annual variations are expected to be observed in pasture carbon fluxes the current research showed the roll of pastures as carbon sink during the study period see fig 3a and table 2 a similar result was obtained by silva et al 2017 that analyzed the seasonal net ecosystem exchange of a pasture in the brazilian caatinga march 2014 to february 2015 they observed that pasture acted as a carbon sink 362 g c m 2 yr 1 the authors emphasized that there was a strong reduction in carbon assimilation during the dry season probably due to the water stress condition marchin et al 2018 analyzed net ecosystem exchange and gross photosynthesis of pasture in the mountains of australia from 2007 to 2012 they also observed that pasture acted as a carbon sink with maximum annual nee of 185 g c m 2 yr 1 throughout the assessed years value similar to nee sum found in this study and they highlighted the highest peak of nee in the warm season results contrary to our observation were obtained by hutley et al 2005 in an analysis of carbon fixation in two tropical savanna sites virginia park and howard springs for two years 2001 2003 annual nee was observed to range between 0 21 and 0 49 t c ha 1 yr 1 at the virginia park site during the study period indicating the site acted as a carbon source likely due to the hydric restriction precipitation p 600 mm yr 1 contrarily at the howard springs site was found values range from 0 18 to 1 64 t c ha 1 yr 1 excluding fire action that indicated this site acted as a carbon sink because of increased rainfall p 1400 mm yr 1 in comparison to the virginia park site rocha et al 2002 noticed a balance in carbon fluxes with nee close to 0 1 t c ha 1 yr 1 in the cerrado sensu stricto from 2000 to 2001 this result may be related to the presence of different plant communities and fire events low carbon fixation from july to september in the second hydrological year contributed to the pasture s role as the main carbon source given the rainfall frequency reduction and the soil water available for plants the highest carbon release by pasture throughout the whole experimental period was observed in september 2018 related to the long period of low sws values in the dry season june to august this result was confirmed by the low average ndvi value that indicated reduced vegetation coverage 0 36 see fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 and table 2 thus it was possible to observe high pasture dependence on soil water availability and fast gpp increases due to rainfall events feng and liu 2016 sharma et al 2019 based on the recorded results there is a strong dependence of pasture physiological activity on rainfall events that shape pasture s action as the source or sink of vegetation rajan et al 2013 pastures are more sensitive to more extended drought events than trees given the relatively shallow root system compared to that of trees in soil surface layers wolf et al 2011 silva et al 2017 yuhui et al 2018 also mentioned that rainfall frequency plays a crucial role in carbon exchanges in the ecosystem it is even more critical than total rainfall this statement is related to days with high total rainfall that result in high water loss caused by surface runoff and the percolation for groundwater ecosystem respiration reco presented a significant reduction during the dry season for both years there was a 48 reduction at the month with the lowest reco peak in the second hydrological year compared to the same month in the previous year this outcome was followed by gpp reduction and by the decrease of microbiological activity such plant behavior aimed reallocating nutrients within the plant to avoid its death due to low temperatures and reduced soil water content xu and baldocchi 2004 wei et al 2016 another important aspect is the influence of air temperature on pasture growth and development mainly when temperatures fall below that of the inferior basal temperature which may range from 10 c to 16 c for brachiaria sp silva et al 2012 the vegetation growth stopped under this temperature due to strong enzymatic activity reduction and the low biochemical reactions rates essential for the plant growth process this condition was more often observed in the dry season because minimum temperatures 10 c were observed as well as the lowest average value of 2 c in the study site data not shown the pasture et also followed the carbon fluxes the highest values were recorded in the wet season due to the highest soil water storage with peaks up to 6 mm d 1 see fig 3 and table 2 rubert et al 2018 assessed evapotranspiration in two sites of the brazilian pampa biome sma and pas from 2014 to 2016 they identified strong et seasonality with higher values in the warm and wet season the average et of the whole period was 2 36 1 4 mm d 1 and 2 56 1 7 mm d 1 for the sma and pas sites respectively the values are close to this present study feng and liu 2016 also analyzed the evapotranspiration behavior in a degraded pasture area in china from 2003 to 2007 and they found average et values close to 2 0 mm d 1 in the growing season also they stated that et peaks took place after the rainfall events and under favorable meteorological conditions such as high solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit results significantly lower than our observations were obtained by silva et al 2017 that reported an average et of 0 8 mm d 1 in a pasture of northeastern brazil this number is 60 lower than the average value recorded in the current study a fact that can be associated with the drier conditions in the northeastern region our results were similar to et averages of other brazilian cerrado sites such as giambelluca et al 2009 that obtained average et close to 2 0 mm d 1 in two brazilian cerrado sites cerrado denso and campo cerrado for two experimental years 2001 2003 although this ecosystem has a tree component it also has grasses that reduce et strongly during the dry season differing from the amazon rainforest that may reach average et of 3 96 0 65 mm d 1 during the dry season da rocha et al 2004 cabral et al 2015 monitored the et seasonality in the brazilian cerrado biome that is composed mainly of closed scrubs with tall trees a dense woody and grasses for three years 2009 2012 and they obtained average annual et of 1228 mm yr 1 72 higher than average et measured in this study 716 mm yr 1 this result indicates the greater contribution of tree species to the water cycle due to their expansive root system ability to explore deeper soil layers than grasses in the second hydrological year despite the drastic et reduction throughout the driest two months june july the efficient c4 metabolism allowed photosynthesis to continue even during the dry season which pasture had high wue during this period this is an adaptive strategy that allows c4 plants survival under stress conditions osborne and sack 2012 griffiths et al 2013 however given the long drought period plants were unable to maintain photosynthetic rates which resulted in carbon release due to higher ecosystem respiration de oliveira et al 2018 analyzed water vapor flux in wheatgrass in the united states from 2012 to 2016 and found annual average wue close to 2 0 g c kg 1 h2o 50 lower than that observed in the present study sharma et al 2019 found seasonal wue values between 2 7 and 3 0 g c kg 1 h2o in bluestem grass in texas the u s a from 2013 to 2015 a strong positive linear relationship between et and gpp was observed due to water vapor loss by plants which is an essential value for gas exchange in the vegetal community see fig 5 this result shows the influence of water cycle dynamics on vegetation growth as observed by sharma et al 2019 4 2 seasonal vegetation stomatal conductance variation in pasture there was a seasonal pattern of pasture vegetation stomatal conductance with a strong decrease in the driest two months in both hydrological years this process was driven by the lowest rainfall rates approximately 27 mm in june and july in the first hydrological year and it was 0 mm in same months in the second year furthermore in this last year there are lower sws values and higher dpv values peaks up to 1 6 kpa see fig 1a fig 6 and table 2 vapor pressure deficit is the main mechanism to influence the stomatal conductance because stomata present high sensitivity to the increased demand for atmospheric evaporation this scenario leads to high vpd values that cause stomatal closure which reduces the gas exchange rates between leaves and the atmosphere and consequently results in gpp decrease sharma et al 2019 low soil water availability harms the transpiration process and can cause the water column disruption throughout the xylem and promotes the leaf desiccation plants use survival strategies such as smaller stomata opening and osmotic adjustment to minimize water stress effects chaves et al 2016 these strategies are more effective in c4 than in c3 plants due to the mechanism to concentrate co2 and the spatial separation between rubisco and pepcase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase which reduces the photorespiration effects a process that diminishes photosynthetic efficiency sage 2004 griffiths et al 2013 4 3 pasture responses to sunlight variability solar radiation seasonality influences the pasture growth dynamics through time it is essential to analyze the efficient use of this meteorological element since it affects the biomass accumulation and duration of phenological stages the study showed efficient light use by the pasture mainly in the dry season this is a strategy to achieve better biomass conversion with lower solar radiation to ensure plant survival however there was a significant lue decrease in the dry season in the second hydrological year due to the increased water deficit this drought caused physiological and biochemical damage a fact that resulted in reduced vegetation cover in the site and leaf senescence this result was proven by the low ndvi value recorded in the dry season of this same hydrological year see fig 1c fig 2 and fig 7 this situation decreased light interception by the canopy and it caused plants to stop reaching sufficient light use efficiencies to ensure their growth and development the reduction of vegetative cover in the dry season is an alternative strategy to diminish canopy s evapotranspiration area mitigating the impact of water stress on plants lambers et al 2000 taiz et al 2017 another important aspect that must be highlighted is the highest lue value 29 9 mmol co2 mol 1 photons of the whole experimental period which was recorded in october 2017 this month was the rainiest throughout the entire period different from the previous hydrological year see fig 7 this response is related to the low solar radiation accumulation value caused by the cloudiness at the site such cloudiness made plants use mechanisms to adapt to ensure biomass production i e lue increase however despite the lue increase the pasture had nee close to zero and it only assured its maintenance zhang et al 2011 verified different lue responses under clear sky and cloudy sky conditions in many ecosystems in china the authors highlighted that under cloudy sky condition occurs increased diffuse radiation that reduces the light saturation in the leaves diminishing the photoinhibition effect 5 conclusions the current research quantified carbon and water vapor flux in the pasture as studies on cultivated pastures in the brazilian cerrado are scarce pasture acted as a carbon sink throughout the experimental period with total accumulated carbon reached 208 9 and 171 8 g c m 2 in the first and second hydrological years respectively carbon assimilation was strongly influenced by environmental conditions mainly by rainfall and soil water availability in the second year there was a significant reduction in the photosynthetic respiratory and evapotranspiration activities in the dry season concerning the wet season however high wue occurred in the driest two months june and july in both hydrological years due to the c4 metabolism of the pasture thus brachiaria sp at the experimental site used different ecophysiological strategies to allow their survival during the dry season such as smaller stomata opening leaf senescence and deeper roots in soil layers this information is the basis for further studies about the impact of climate change on carbon uptake and water vapor flux by cultivated and natural pasture moreover the present research will allow comparisons of carbon storage results to other ecosystems and to support studies of agrometeorological modeling credit authorship contribution statement josé darlon nascimento alves formal analysis data curation writing

4856,clearly water conservancy projects are advantageous for human beings however they significantly change the streamflow variability of rivers this change is a result of the complex and non linear interactions between natural processes and human activities thus far our understanding of these interactions is still inadequate in this study these interactions were evaluated for a large river basin i e the pearl river basin with numerous reservoirs to identify reservoir operation scenarios for mitigating drought and flood impacts to this end first the flow variability pattern was derived based on the concept of the admissible range of flow variability second the moving average over shifting horizon method was used to evaluate the effects of the reservoirs on the streamflow variability finally the network theory and data mining technology were applied to establish the streamflow relations between the upstream and downstream reservoirs the results show that the cascade reservoirs reshape the streamflow variability patterns of the pearl river in time and space and have a cumulative effect on the downstream runoff the constructed networks and the identified operation scenarios present that this effect is mainly influenced by the upstream critical reservoirs having different inflows and storage capacities this suggests the varied roles of the reservoirs for drought mitigation and flood control limiting the formulation and application of integrated operating strategies for the multi reservoir system keywords streamflow variability scenario discovery cascade reservoir operation water resources management pearl river basin 1 introduction human impact has pushed the earth into the anthropocene age in which high levels of volatility and unpredictability are common keys et al 2019 the effect on a river system is mainly caused by the construction of various water conservancy projects at present more than 50 000 dams heights greater than 15 m exist worldwide lehner et al 2011 which regulate the natural variability of the runoffs leading to a change in the natural flow regime richter 2010 poff and schmidt 2016 arthington et al 2018 liu et al 2018 li et al 2020 for runoffs under regulated conditions and induced by climatic forces time sequences cannot be accurately predicted and typically present statistical non stationarity serinaldi and kilsby 2015 poff 2018 ali et al 2020b huang et al 2020 traditional hydrologic frequency analysis based on stationary assumptions may incorrectly predict flood and drought risks under human and climatic factors rootzén and katz 2013 huang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 feng et al 2017 salas et al 2018 although water resource management e g reservoir optimization operation has been extensively studied for numerous years it is not conducted in practice because its optimized operating rules are based on the deterministic runoff processes i e stationary conditions feng et al 2019 ren et al 2020 furthermore the complexity of the reservoir optimization models and algorithms built by researchers make it difficult for decision makers to understand and apply them hejazi and cai 2011 libisch lehner et al 2019 smith et al 2019 feng et al 2020 for resolving this difficulty we argue that the effective structure of an operation model should be established by ensuring that the decision processes fit the needs of the decision makers to satisfy the above mentioned requirements or improve the management strategy we should first learn from the historical hydrologic information and the operating strategies for water management hejazi and cai 2011 used a data mining tool the maximum relevance minimum redundancy algorithm to identify the most important state variables from hydrologic information and reservoir operations these were incorporated with stochastic dynamic programming sdp to build a more realistic reservoir operation policy however sdp formulations are limited by the drawbacks of dimensionality and multiple objectives giuliani et al 2015a denaro et al 2017 used the information selection assessment framework proposed by giuliani et al 2015a to select the most relevant information e g hydro meteorological data which was directly used in the evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps method the emodps method combines data mining techniques i e non linear approximating networks with evolutionary algorithms which is an adaptive and reliable strategy to adapt to reservoir operation problems giuliani et al 2015b the chief advantage of these methods over traditional optimization models is that they incorporate multi source information to build increasing realistic operating rules which are also optimized by optimization algorithms although these methods are feasible in theory and practical applications of researchers decision makers still need to examine whether they satisfy the behaviour patterns and information requirements of water reservoir managers the flow dynamics of river systems are influenced not only by the natural flow regime but also by human behaviours the environmental models developed over the past decades have provided detailed analyses of river systems under natural conditions however they include human mechanisms in a relatively simple manner sivapalan 2018 therefore numerous approaches are emerging to consider the interaction between human activities and the natural flow regime e g socio hydrology di baldassarre et al 2019 the mechanism of a river system may be highly complex under the influence of the subjective factors of human activities giuliani and herman 2018 proposed a framework based on eigenbehaviour analysis to establish typical operating policies for a large set of water reservoirs from historical observations e g water level elevation and storage the proposed tool extracted the typical behavioural profiles of these reservoirs which comprehensively interpreted their drawdown stable and refill features although this study defined the characteristics of a reservoir operation coupling natural processes and human behaviour the proposed method cannot reproduce human decisions under different runoff conditions e g flood and drought events reservoirs built on rivers are mainly designed to generate electricity control floods and supply water to ensure the reliability of the water supply the reservoir water level is required to be maximally high however to ensure that the reservoir has adequate capacity for flood control the reservoir water level should be maximally low di baldassarre et al 2017 furthermore reservoir operation strategies influenced by the behaviours of decision makers also very significantly in response to drought and flood risks decision makers modify the operating rules by learning from the historical water management strategies for dealing with drought and flood events for example di baldassarre et al 2017 summarized an unprecedented and multi year drought that occurred in australia in the last decade triggered flood control reservoirs to modify their operating rules to raise water levels for mitigating drought conditions however paradoxically when the 2011 flooding occurred the local population suffered severe and catastrophic consequences which can be attributed to the combined effect of water management and flow dynamics concurrently the role of a reservoir in alleviating a drought depends on its size as well as the intensity and duration of the drought reservoirs can reduce the frequency of droughts having short durations and low intensity nevertheless they are ineffective against megadroughts which may be intensified by reservoir effects kuil et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2018 the natural flow regime alterations caused by dam and reservoir constructions and management have changed the characteristics of droughts and floods on spatial and temporal scales bunn and arthington 2002 acreman et al 2014 wang et al 2018 guo et al 2019 however detailed research on the mechanism of reservoirs for dealing with drought and flood risks is limited furthermore most of the current studies are focused on the effects of a single reservoir on downstream flow mechanisms whereas those of multiple reservoirs remain unresolved in this study we focus on a large river basin with a set of reservoirs in which the flow mechanisms affected by cascade reservoir operating strategies show cumulative or propagation effects e g domino effect from the upstream to downstream as mentioned above reservoir operating strategies differ in dealing with flood and drought risks therefore we use the admissible range of the flow variability method proposed by garcía de jalón et al 2017 and garcía de jalón et al 2019 to define the low and high flow processes i e drought and flood conditions of historical regulated flows furthermore the moving average over shifting horizon mash method is used to reveal the trend duration and intensity of the drought and flood events over the basin for determining the key factors affecting the downstream flow mechanism we apply the network theory and establish a network structure between the downstream flow and the outflows of the cascade reservoirs most importantly a scenario discovery method i e patient rule induction method prim based on a data mining algorithm is introduced in this study to build the operation patterns of the cascade reservoirs for mitigating flood and drought risks these patterns reflect the interaction between human behaviours and the natural flow dynamics and provide the basis for the construction of integrated drought and flood warning mechanisms 2 methods in this section we present in detail on the methods adopted in this study all the methods are for the given data i e historical observational information which form a complete framework from the problem definition to resolution 2 1 natural patterns of flow variability the natural flow regime paradigms of unregulated natural rivers are intrinsic attributes of natural flows which represent the regional character of the rivers and are the combined result of the hydro physical mechanisms and climate of the river basins acreman et al 2014 the construction and management of reservoirs and dams impound natural flow variability and their operation strategies are predetermined and fixed to guide the management during operation periods arthington et al 2006 the typical management strategy of reservoirs is to store water during the wet season and discharge the stored water in the dry season which significantly changes the difference between the minimum and maximum flows therefore the impounding flow variability depends not only on the reservoir operation but also on the regional hydrological conditions the current ecological environmental flow studies believe that the natural patterns of flow variability should be maintained in regulated flows for preserving the health of the river ecosystem garcía de jalón et al 2017 proposed the admissible range of the regulated flow variability for covering the range of daily flow fluctuations this admissible range is considered as the natural patterns of flow variability without human activities the upper and lower limits of this range are defined as the values of the 10th and 90th percentiles of each natural daily flow respectively however as stated by the authors the selection of the percentiles to calculate the range might be subjective therefore in this study we used the 25th and 75th percentiles to calculate the upper and lower limits of the range which is identified as the patterns of flow variability to exclude the extreme values note that the operation strategies of reservoirs may be unreasonable when dealing with extreme flows which can lead to decision making errors once the patterns of flow variability are determined the high or low flow impact i can be obtained as the current flow q higher or lower than the upper or lower limits of the patterns of the flow variability they are the divergence between the current flow and the patterns of the flow variability as follows 1 i high q current q high limit max q current q high limit and 2 i low q current q low limit max q current q low limit in reservoir operation the outflows of the reservoirs are the managed inflows which are in accordance with the initial operating rules therefore although the patterns of natural and regulated flow variabilities are governed by different factors they are considered as the inherent characteristics of the flow processes furthermore these patterns exclude the extreme flows and are formed by reservoir operations to largely mitigate the effects of moderate drought and flood events which correspond to the percentiles i e 25th and 75th more detailed calculation and interpretation of the flow patterns are presented in section 4 1 2 2 moving average over shifting horizon in water resource management trend detection methods are used to evaluate the changes in the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial distributions of water availability the statistical methods of trend detections e g mann kendall test spearman s rho test and regression techniques are frequently used to detect the trend of the time series depending on the selected time scale of the analysis however the natural processes e g temperature precipitation and river flow are influenced by different temporal factors and change differently on the time scales e g seasonal and interannual although these trends can be detected by repeated calculations on different time scales using the statistical method this is frequently complex when splitting the relations between the different timescales for dealing with these limitations anghileri et al 2014 proposed the mash method which can detect trends of seasonality and interannual variability simultaneously as the name suggests this method is based on two aspects 1 the values of the daily flow over a year represent the seasonal variability they are averaged over consecutive days in the same year and over the same consecutive days in consecutive years i e shifting horizon 2 the progressive shifting of the horizon of consecutive years ahead for determining the interannual variability the average daily flow μ t h on the tth day of a year in the hth horizon is calculated as follows 3 μ t h mean y h h y 1 mean d t w t w x d y where x d y is the observed flow on the dth day of the yth year of the observed time series w is the number of consecutive days 2w 1 is defined as the number of days and y is the length of the shifting horizon thus the mash can be represented as a matrix 4 mash μ 1 1 μ 1 2 μ 1 n h μ 2 1 μ 2 2 μ 2 n h μ 365 1 μ 365 2 μ 365 n h where n h is the number of horizons which is calculated as n h n y y 1 where n y is the length years of the observed time series in this method the appropriate number of consecutive days w and the shifting horizon y are determined by trial and error after determining the most appropriate magnitudes of these indicators the mash of the observed flow can be represented using visual tools e g line plot and matrix plot which yields the durations of the different hydrological seasons and the variations in the observed flow magnitude for a more detailed discussion and application of this method the reader is referred to the report by anghileri et al 2014 2 3 network and clustering coefficient a streamflow is a result of the complex and non linear interactions between the regional climate and the landscape characteristics which are the key inputs of environmental modelling and water resource management the objective of streamflow modelling based on statistical methods or hydro physical processes is to define the relations between the streamflow and its affecting factors however the current techniques of streamflow modelling cannot fully present these relations owing to the significant differences in the affecting factors in time and space sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 introduced the theory of network to evaluate the spatial relations in streamflow dynamics they used the observed streamflow series of 639 monitoring stations in the contiguous us as a case study to build the network structures of the streamflow whose clustering tendencies are examined by the clustering coefficient a network is composed of two basic components i e a node and a link which are related in a network if node i is more connected to some nodes than other nodes the more connected nodes are defined as the neighbours of the node these connections are frequently measured by the degree of correlation which can be quantified by the correlation coefficients e g pearson or spearman correlation coefficient given node i in the network has ki links which are connected to ki other nodes if the neighbours of this node are a part of the cluster the total number of the links between them can be calculated as k i k i 1 2 thus the clustering coefficient ci of node i is defined as the ratio between the number ei of actually existing links examined by the degree of correlation of neighbours and the total number of links it is expressed as 5 c i 2 e i k i k i 1 as concluded by sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 the network of the streamflow assists hydrologists to build a generic theory of hydrology for modelling streamflow dynamics the theory of network provides a new perspective to move beyond the traditional modelling approach in this study we used the theory of network to build the relations of the streamflow in the xijiang river basin of china the wuzhou station is located in the lower reaches of the xijiang river and its streamflow is directly or indirectly affected by the outflows of the upstream reservoirs therefore each gaging station i e the wuzhou station and the cascade reservoirs is considered as a node and the observed streamflow of the wuzhou station and the outflows of the cascade reservoirs are used to evaluate their relations 2 4 scenario discovery with data mining in water resource management and environmental modelling the decision making processes and the model output are influenced by various uncertainties e g knowledge deficiencies inputs parameters and structures haasnoot et al 2013 eker and kwakkel 2018 the concept of scenario discovery adapted in these fields can be defined as the process of relating the regular and understandable patterns of a model input e g reservoir inflow and precipitation to output reservoir outflow and runoff the core of the process is to extract information from given or simulated data which is typically implemented by a data mining algorithm the extracted information pattern guides a decision maker to determine the parameters and inputs that are the most sensitive factors for improving the model and decision processes to make robust decisions in the presence of uncertainties in this context sensitivity analysis can only identify the sensitive factors in a dataset and cannot yield the quantitative relationships between the sensitive factors and the outputs however scenario discovery can achieve these tasks simultaneously in this study we used the prim friedman and fisher 1999 a statistical scenario discovery algorithm that determines the combinations of sensitive factors that are expected to produce a particular outcome relative to a user specific performance threshold the prim uses three reasonable measures of quality to evaluate the identified sets of scenarios coverage density and interpretability bryant and lempert 2010 coverage is the proportion of the total number of particular outcomes xi in scenario b to the total number of particular outcomes x which can be expressed as follows 6 coverage x i b y i x i x y i where y i 1 if xi b and y i 0 otherwise density is the proportion of the total number of particular outcomes xi in scenario b to the total number of outcomes x in the scenario which is expressed as follows 7 density x i b y i x b 1 as discussed by bryant and lempert 2010 interpretability is a highly subjective measure because the magnitude and complexity of the datasets that need to be identified are different the decision makers should consider the specific requirement of the information to choose a reasonable and user specific scenario therefore this measure depends on the characteristics of the problem and the explanatory power of the discovered scenarios for providing useful information a selected scenario should have a high coverage capturing maximal proportions of the total number of outcomes high density capturing primarily the outcomes that are main concerns for the decision makers and high interpretability however these measures are typically conflicting and cannot reach the maximum values simultaneously for a selected scenario for a given dataset these measures can formulate a multi dimensional efficiency frontier i e pareto optimal frontier based on this efficiency frontier the prim can exploit a bump hunting algorithm to generate alternative scenarios at different points of the frontier therefore the prim provides visualizations that help decision makers balance the three measures of scenario quality to select a user specific scenario numerous studies have explored the capabilities of this algorithm e g kasprzyk et al 2013 herman et al 2015 ray et al 2018 ren et al 2019 particularly bryant and lempert 2010 conducted an in depth exploration of the availability of the above mentioned algorithm 3 study area and cascade reservoirs the pearl river fig 1 is the third longest river in china with a total length of 2320 km and a basin area of 450 000 km2 the annual runoff of the pearl river is more than 330 billion m3 and is seven times that of the yellow river the pearl river includes three major tributaries xijiang beijiang and dongjiang rivers the longest among them is the xijiang river which is the study area of this study the pearl river basin is located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone and its climate characteristics are mild and rainy with an average annual precipitation of 1400 mm the precipitation has a high intensity and is concentrated in the wet season there is a continuous rainfall of more than 400 mm in the historical observation which can easily cause severe floods the distribution of precipitation clearly decreases gradually from the east to the west and has large regional and temporal variations fig 1 which leads to an extremely uneven distribution of the runoff during the year in this basin the runoff in the wet season from april to september accounts for approximately 80 of the total annual runoff the three tributaries of the pearl river meet at the pearl river delta prd where the pearl river flows into the south china sea the prd is one of the most densely urbanized and vigorous economic regions in china and had a high population of 69 million in 2017 although the area of the prd accounts for 0 58 of the total area of china its total gross domestic product gdp approximately accounts for 12 2 of the gdp of china numerous large cities e g shenzhen guangzhou macao and hong kong as shown in fig 1 are located in the prd which is frequently considered as a megacity i e the pearl river delta metropolitan region in the past decades numerous water conservancy projects have been built in the pearl river basin providing benefits for power generation water supply and flood control and concurrently causing severe environmental degradation owing to the construction and management of reservoirs and dams the sediment load of the river is reduced and there is severe erosion in the prd these aggravate the saltwater intrusion threatening the reliability of the water supply to the megacity during the dry season concurrently in the past decade the frequency of severe typhoons in the delta has increased resulting in an increased risk of flooding xu et al 2010 winsemius et al 2016 wu et al 2019 in this study we focused on the water management of cascade reservoirs including the eight major reservoirs in the xijiang river fig 1 because the xijiang river is the longest tributary of the pearl river where numerous reservoirs and dams have been built far exceeding those on the other two tributaries the operation problem of cascade reservoirs is more complex than that of a single reservoir however the integrated operation of cascade reservoirs has been proved to attenuate flood peaks for example in 2019 according to a report of the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the pearl river water resources commission prwrc urged the major reservoirs i e the tianyi longtan and baise reservoirs in fig 1 to empty their storage see at http www mwr gov cn xw sjzs 201908 t20190802 1352177 html this pre preparation and reasonable operation reduced the flood peak by more than 4000 m3 s at the wuzhou station fig 1 the annual streamflow sequence 1954 2017 of the wuzhou station showed a slight increasing trend fig 2 which was more evenly distributed throughout the year following the construction of the reservoirs as shown in fig 2 cascade reservoirs have been constructed and operated for numerous years and the runoff process at the wuzhou station is mainly impacted by the operation of the upstream reservoirs therefore in this study we chose the period during which all the reservoirs of concern were fully constructed and operating construction dates are shown in fig 2 all the data such as the observed reservoir daily inflows and outflows were collected from the prwrc from 2007 to 2017 except for the guangzhao reservoir 2010 2017 and the changzhou reservoir 2008 2017 the daily streamflow of the wuzhou station was collected from 1997 to 2017 to compare the variations in the streamflow with and without regulations we used the observed operational information of the cascade reservoirs as an example in the method proposed in this study to analyse their mechanism in response to flood and drought events 4 results and discussion 4 1 calculating natural and regulated patterns of flow variability the study presented in this section has two objectives first we use the method proposed by garcía de jalón et al 2017 to calculate the natural or regulated patterns of the flow variabilities of the eight reservoirs and the wuzhou station second depending on the calculated patterns low and high flow impacts are estimated during the historical operation periods the impacts are compared to the water levels of the reservoirs reflecting the historical operation strategies and verifying the rationality of the natural or regulated patterns of the flow variability the patterns of the flow variability are illustrated in fig 3 and appendix a fig a1 fig 3 shows the estimated natural patterns of the inflow variability of the guangzhao reservoir the red and blue lines are the high and low limits calculated from the daily flows for all the years plotted on a common axis in fig 3 constructing the natural patterns of the inflow variability of the guangzhao reservoir as displayed in fig 3 the range of the calculated patterns varies clearly with the variation in runoff with respect to the hydrological season moreover the maximum and minimum ranges are consistent with the wet and dry seasons respectively comparing the patterns of the flow variability considered in this study fig a1 the results indicate that these patterns reflect the intrinsic characteristics of the flow variability which are shaped by the regional factors it should be noted that the percentiles used in the calculations are subjectively pre defined and should be further examined in future studies fig 4 and appendix b fig b1 display the estimated impacts based on the patterns of the flow variability for comparison purposes the natural patterns of the inflow of the reservoirs are used to estimate the flow impacts of the inflows and the corresponding outflows if the current flow q is higher or lower than the upper or lower limit of the patterns the estimated impacts are the high flow red lines in figs 4 and b1 and low flow impacts blue lines in figs 4 and b1 respectively for plotting on a common axis the observed water levels of the reservoirs are normalized between their dead and maximum water levels as presented in fig 4 these impacts can only be under a specific condition i e high flow impact low flow impact or no flow impact at a certain moment the impacted degrees of high and low flow impacts increase with the decrease and increase in the reservoir water level respectively this result shows more clearly the effects of reservoir operation on the flow variability than the direct analysis of the flows to better illustrate the effects of reservoir operation on drought and flood we select the operation year of 2012 for further analysis in the range of panel a the reservoir discharges water to become empty in the dry season so that the high flow impacts of the inflow fig 4a are less than those of the outflow fig 4b moreover in the range of panel b the inflow of the reservoir is under a dry condition and the reservoir is emptied during the previous operation period see panel a however the reservoir stores water during this operation period so that the low flow impact of the outflow is severe fig 4b indicating that the reservoir operation may intensify the impact of the low flow or drought fig 4 is an example of all the reservoirs in appendix b and the above results can be verified in fig b1 4 2 analysis of flow trend during operation period to assess the operation strategies of the cascade reservoirs in shaping the downstream flow mechanism over the operation periods we first analyse the flow trends of the inflows of the four upstream reservoirs that are not affected by the reservoir operation these reservoirs are the guangzhao tianyi honhua and baise reservoirs fig 1 and their inflows reflect the natural conditions of the flow regimes of the xijiang river basin the variations in the daily unregulated natural inflows of the different hydrological seasons of the reservoirs are presented in fig 5 which are calculated using the mash method with w 15 days and y 5 years limited by the length of the time series the shifting horizon y of the inflow of the guangzhao reservoir is determined as 3 years by trial and error this figure highlights the long term inter annual trends and intra annual distributions of the flows and suggests that the inflows of the guangzhao tianyi and honhua reservoirs have not changed significantly in recent decades the variations in the inflows in the different hydrologic seasons present stable characteristics over the operation period no significant increase or decrease trends of the inflows of these reservoirs are found in particular the durations and magnitudes of the inflows during the dry season november to march are stable and they also present no significant changes during the wet season finally the range of the high inflow of the baise reservoir is expanded in recent years e g horizon 2013 2017 indicating that there is a trend for the sub basin to become wetter the annual inflow of the baise reservoir only accounts for 0 05 of the annual streamflow of the wuzhou station therefore this increased inflow has relatively little impact on the streamflow of the wuzhou station fig 6 shows the variations in the daily flow of the wuzhou station in different hydrological seasons of reflecting the effect of the cascade reservoir management on the flow variability fig 6 a and b present the daily and annual streamflow sequences of the wuzhou station respectively the red dash lines represent the trend lines indicating that the daily and annual streamflow sequences of the wuzhou station do not exhibit any significant trends fig 6c displays the results of the mash of the daily streamflow with w 15 days y 5 years and time horizon 1997 2017 for the wuzhou station the black dash lines divide the historical runoff sequence into unregulated and regulated periods compared to those in the unregulated period 1997 2006 the ranges of the high or extreme high and medium flows shrink and expand during the regulated period 2007 2017 respectively importantly comparing the results in fig 6 b and c show that when the annual streamflow is unchanged the streamflow distribution of the wuzhou station is more even throughout the year during the regulated period than during the unregulated period the flood magnitude and duration of the wuzhou station show clear decreasing trends during the regulated period of 2007 2017 in particular the magnitude of the extreme high15 day flow does not exceed 20 000 m3 s whereas the duration of the high 15 day flow event is significantly reduced during the regulated period furthermore the reservoir operation also shorten the duration of the low 15 day flow during the dry season whereas the 15 day flow range of 5000 to 10 000 m3 s is expanded more specifically as shown in fig 6b the minimum and maximum annual streamflows of the wuzhou station occurred from 2007 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2017 respectively however the results in fig 6c indicate that the wuzhou station faced higher risks of flood and drought during the period from 2007 to 2012 results indicate that the construction of the reservoirs enhances the storage capacities at the xijiang river basin for redistributing the streamflow mitigating the risks of drought and flood from the upstream to downstream areas finally for further studying the effect of the reservoir operation on the patterns of flow variability we calculated the patterns of the regulated and unregulated flow variabilities of the wuzhou station plotted in fig 7 the results show that regardless of high dark red line or low light red line flows the patterns of the unregulated flow variabilities are higher than those of the regulated flow variabilities green lines in the wet season however this result is opposite in the dry season magnified box in fig 7 indicating that the water management of the cascade reservoirs increases and decreases the magnitudes of the high and low flows in the wet and dry seasons respectively this is consistent with the conclusions presented in fig 6 which further illustrate the operation effect of the cascade reservoirs on the streamflow variability 4 3 network and clustering coefficient analysis the aim of this part of the study is first to evaluate which upstream reservoirs mainly affect the flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station fig 8 depicts the linear regression analysis of the variability patterns of the outflow of the cascade reservoirs instead of the inflow and the regulated flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station low fig 8a and high fig 8b flow values of the patterns are used for estimating the coefficient of determination r squared respectively the results show that as the distances from the reservoirs to the wuzhou station increase the determination coefficients decrease gradually clearly the low flow distributions are more scattered fig 8a than the high flow distributions and there are noticeable differences between the determination coefficients of the low and high flows for example the determination coefficient r2 0 0661 of the low outflow of the guangzhao reservoir is much smaller than that r2 0 2861 of its high outflow however an opposite result is obtained for the tianyi reservoir although both the reservoirs are located almost at the same distance from the wuzhou station their storage capacity and magnitude of inflows are different fig 1 therefore the characteristics of these determination coefficients are explained by multiple factors including the reservoirs located in different climatic zones having different storage capacities and other features furthermore the outflow patterns of the reservoirs are related which have not been revealed by simple linear regression analysis for revealing the full relations between the flow variability patterns a clustering coefficient analysis based on the theory of network is conducted for this the wuzhou station and the cascade reservoirs are considered as the nodes of the network and the connections between their flow variability patterns are the links the correlation considered here is the spearman correlation coefficient which is insensitive to outliers in the data and can estimate nonlinear connections as discussed in section 2 3 the nearest neighbours e g reservoirs of the wuzhou station in the network are identified based on a pre defined threshold value referring to the results presented in fig 8 four threshold values are considered in the cluster coefficient analysis 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 it should be noted that the changzhou reservoir was eliminated in this analysis because its outflow variability pattern is strongly correlated with the flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station fig 8 the geographical analysis also shows that they are shaped by the same factors fig 1 fig 9 presents the networks and clustering coefficient values for the wuzhou stations for the threshold values of 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 in a network all the links red and green lines denote the correlations exceeding a particular threshold value moreover regardless of the threshold values the clustering coefficient of 0 indicates that there are no actual connections between the neighbours and a higher clustering coefficient indicates that the network structure is more complex the results show that as the threshold values increase the clustering coefficients decrease and the actual connections within the neighborhoods also reduce for the different thresholds there are clear complex networks between the flow variability patterns of the wuzhou station and the outflow variability patterns of the upstream cascade reservoirs when the network threshold exceeds 0 8 the high flow of the wuzhou station and the outflows of the yantan xijing and honhua reservoirs are related indicating that the outflows of these reservoirs directly affect the flood risk of the wuzhou station concurrently when the network threshold exceeds 0 8 the low flow characteristic of the wuzhou station is only connected to the outflow of the honhua reservoir furthermore the low flow network is simpler than the high flow network which indicates that the reservoirs have different operation mechanisms for dealing with the low and high flow processes concurrently the low flow is more difficult to predict than the high flow using the links between the upstream and downstream flow patterns this result offers the locations and manner in which flow connections exist in the water management of the whole river basin and it provides decision makers with critical insight into managing drought and flood risks 4 4 discovering cascade reservoir operating scenario the influence of the cascade reservoirs on the regulated flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station was further analysed using historical operating strategies based on data mining technology this technology i e prim which can be interactively implemented with the r statistical toolkit available at http cran r project org web packages sdtoolkit index html with user specific performance thresholds was used to identify the cascade reservoir operating scenarios for the high and low flow of the flow variability patterns in this study the low flow threshold for the wuzhou station was determined as 1900 m3 s the minimum flow for preventing saltwater intrusion the high flow threshold was determined as 13 000 m3 s the flood warning threshold of the wuzhou station these thresholds were not arbitrarily selected they were determined by the decision makers of the water resource management of the pearl river basin in the scenario discovery process we discovered the scenarios that decrease the low flow to below the low flow threshold and increase the high flow to exceed the high flow threshold thus leading to the occurrence of drought and flood events at the wuzhou station the changzhou reservoir was also removed from this analysis see section 4 3 finally the cascade reservoir operating scenarios between the regulated flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station and the outflow variability patterns of the cascade reservoirs were obtained as follows fig 10 the prim identifies the ranges of the flow variability which cause system vulnerability in fig 10 the left graphs show the pareto optimal frontiers between the overall coverage and the density for alternative scenarios in the graphs the colours of the points from blue to red indicate increase in the number of components contained in the alternative scenarios for regulated high and low flows we selected scenarios a and b as the respective user specific scenarios the coloured overlaid bars represent the ranges of all the sensitive outflows that cause the vulnerabilities at the wuzhou station the high flow exceeding the high flow threshold selected scenario a and the low flow below the low flow threshold selected scenario b in the range when a sensitive outflow is high there is a high probability of this outflow leading to the streamflow conditions that fail to satisfy the criteria of the stakeholders the right tables summarise the density and coverage of the components of the selected scenarios and red and green arrows denote the boundary of the ranges greater and less than the specific values of a component respectively these selected scenarios which are shown in fig 10 right graphs were balanced among the three measures i e coverage density and interpretability of the scenario quality the results exhibit that the credibility values of the sensitivity outflows decay from top to bottom seen in the top right table according to the measures of the scenario quality the measure values of coverage and density are larger than 0 8 except for the density of the regulated low flow indicating that data mining can identify well the cascade reservoir operating scenarios under drought and flood thresholds in response to the regulated high flow fig 10a most of the cascade reservoirs from the upstream to the downstream have undertaken the corresponding tasks of regulation when the outflows of the guangzhao longtan tianyi yantan xijing and honhua reservoirs are higher than 166 m3 s 1530 m3 s 662 m3 s 2242 m3 s 1850 m3 s and 2415 m3 s respectively the synthetic flow is most expected to be higher than the high flow threshold at the wuzhou station concurrently the more the upstream locations of the reservoirs the larger the ranges of their outflows affecting the vulnerability of the wuzhou station this result indicates that the discharges from the upstream reservoirs may play indicative roles for the downstream flood control particularly a flood occurring over the whole river basin emphasizing the importance of the integrated operation of the multi reservoir system furthermore in response to the regulated low flow fig 10b the accuracy of the cascade reservoir operating scenario is slightly worse than that of the regulated high flow which is consistent with the accuracy of the network see fig 9 when the sensitive outflows of the tianyi xijing and honhua reservoirs are less than 302 m3 s 322 m3 s and 215 m3 s respectively whereas the low flow of the baise reservoir is greater than 48 m3 s the synthetic flow will most probably be lower than the low flow threshold at the wuzhou station finally these results suggest that reservoirs play different roles in dealing with droughts and floods according to their different tasks in the operating strategy this leads to strategy uncertainty when decision makers formulate integrated operating strategies for mitigating drought and flood impacts 5 further discussion in the anthropocene age the environment dynamics are reshaped by the integrated impacts of human activities and natural processes with inherent deterministic patterns and stochastic components sivakumar and singh 2012 sivakumar 2014 although the main objectives of environmental modelling are to simulate the time sequences maximally accurately the current models cannot accurately describe physical processes particularly during human affected periods sivapalan 2018 sociohydrology may provide a key perspective for resolving these issues and developing a generalized understanding of the environment controlled by the interactions between nature and human systems bhave et al 2018 di baldassarre et al 2019 therefore this study provides a basis for coupling management strategies and physically based approaches in a sociohydrological model furthermore coupling data driven techniques with physical process models is an important hybrid modelling approach for improving the predictive ability of environmental models reichstein et al 2019 additional studies using numerous observations and integrated models are required to evaluate the availability of our proposed framework deep learning technology will be used in water resource management shen 2018 ali et al 2018 2020a which can not only improve the knowledge of the behaviours of the decision makers but also assist them in identifying better management strategies this topic should also be investigated in depth in future studies 6 conclusions in this study we explored a cascade reservoir operation scenario at different magnitudes of the flow variability pattern for a large and complex river basin i e the pearl river basin for achieving this objective we first collected the historical data of a key streamflow station i e the wuzhou station and its cascade reservoirs eight major reservoirs to estimate the flow variability patterns that represent the inherent deterministic components of the flow variability the mash method evaluated whether the operation strategies of the cascade reservoirs affected the flow variability of the wuzhou station furthermore networks were constructed between the upstream and downstream runoff patterns which were compared to the cascade reservoir operation scenarios identified by a data mining technology i e prim for improving the reliability of the results a comprehensive investigation of the coupled dynamics of flow variability and human decisions motivates a better understanding of integrated water resource management this study shows that there are cumulative effects on the flow dynamics from the upstream to downstream reservoirs which redistribute the streamflow in space and time to mainly change the flow variability of the downstream reservoir under different thresholds the constructed networks present a clear relation between the upstream and downstream flow variability patterns which provide new avenues to understand and identify these cumulative effects the accuracies of the networks and the identified operation scenario of the high flow process are higher than those of the low flow process concurrently the cascade reservoir operation scenarios obtained from data mining clearly present differences in the reservoir operation strategies for dealing with high and low flow processes these differences will limit the actual application of the identified operation scenarios there are numerous purposes for building water reservoirs in a basin and water resource management needs to meet the diverse requirements of the different stakeholders zatarain salazar et al 2017 although multi objective reservoir optimization operation is successful for resolving the challenges of water resource management in theory the effect of its practical application needs to be further verified therefore this study provides a guidance for the practical application of reservoir optimization operation particularly clarifying the

4856,clearly water conservancy projects are advantageous for human beings however they significantly change the streamflow variability of rivers this change is a result of the complex and non linear interactions between natural processes and human activities thus far our understanding of these interactions is still inadequate in this study these interactions were evaluated for a large river basin i e the pearl river basin with numerous reservoirs to identify reservoir operation scenarios for mitigating drought and flood impacts to this end first the flow variability pattern was derived based on the concept of the admissible range of flow variability second the moving average over shifting horizon method was used to evaluate the effects of the reservoirs on the streamflow variability finally the network theory and data mining technology were applied to establish the streamflow relations between the upstream and downstream reservoirs the results show that the cascade reservoirs reshape the streamflow variability patterns of the pearl river in time and space and have a cumulative effect on the downstream runoff the constructed networks and the identified operation scenarios present that this effect is mainly influenced by the upstream critical reservoirs having different inflows and storage capacities this suggests the varied roles of the reservoirs for drought mitigation and flood control limiting the formulation and application of integrated operating strategies for the multi reservoir system keywords streamflow variability scenario discovery cascade reservoir operation water resources management pearl river basin 1 introduction human impact has pushed the earth into the anthropocene age in which high levels of volatility and unpredictability are common keys et al 2019 the effect on a river system is mainly caused by the construction of various water conservancy projects at present more than 50 000 dams heights greater than 15 m exist worldwide lehner et al 2011 which regulate the natural variability of the runoffs leading to a change in the natural flow regime richter 2010 poff and schmidt 2016 arthington et al 2018 liu et al 2018 li et al 2020 for runoffs under regulated conditions and induced by climatic forces time sequences cannot be accurately predicted and typically present statistical non stationarity serinaldi and kilsby 2015 poff 2018 ali et al 2020b huang et al 2020 traditional hydrologic frequency analysis based on stationary assumptions may incorrectly predict flood and drought risks under human and climatic factors rootzén and katz 2013 huang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 feng et al 2017 salas et al 2018 although water resource management e g reservoir optimization operation has been extensively studied for numerous years it is not conducted in practice because its optimized operating rules are based on the deterministic runoff processes i e stationary conditions feng et al 2019 ren et al 2020 furthermore the complexity of the reservoir optimization models and algorithms built by researchers make it difficult for decision makers to understand and apply them hejazi and cai 2011 libisch lehner et al 2019 smith et al 2019 feng et al 2020 for resolving this difficulty we argue that the effective structure of an operation model should be established by ensuring that the decision processes fit the needs of the decision makers to satisfy the above mentioned requirements or improve the management strategy we should first learn from the historical hydrologic information and the operating strategies for water management hejazi and cai 2011 used a data mining tool the maximum relevance minimum redundancy algorithm to identify the most important state variables from hydrologic information and reservoir operations these were incorporated with stochastic dynamic programming sdp to build a more realistic reservoir operation policy however sdp formulations are limited by the drawbacks of dimensionality and multiple objectives giuliani et al 2015a denaro et al 2017 used the information selection assessment framework proposed by giuliani et al 2015a to select the most relevant information e g hydro meteorological data which was directly used in the evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps method the emodps method combines data mining techniques i e non linear approximating networks with evolutionary algorithms which is an adaptive and reliable strategy to adapt to reservoir operation problems giuliani et al 2015b the chief advantage of these methods over traditional optimization models is that they incorporate multi source information to build increasing realistic operating rules which are also optimized by optimization algorithms although these methods are feasible in theory and practical applications of researchers decision makers still need to examine whether they satisfy the behaviour patterns and information requirements of water reservoir managers the flow dynamics of river systems are influenced not only by the natural flow regime but also by human behaviours the environmental models developed over the past decades have provided detailed analyses of river systems under natural conditions however they include human mechanisms in a relatively simple manner sivapalan 2018 therefore numerous approaches are emerging to consider the interaction between human activities and the natural flow regime e g socio hydrology di baldassarre et al 2019 the mechanism of a river system may be highly complex under the influence of the subjective factors of human activities giuliani and herman 2018 proposed a framework based on eigenbehaviour analysis to establish typical operating policies for a large set of water reservoirs from historical observations e g water level elevation and storage the proposed tool extracted the typical behavioural profiles of these reservoirs which comprehensively interpreted their drawdown stable and refill features although this study defined the characteristics of a reservoir operation coupling natural processes and human behaviour the proposed method cannot reproduce human decisions under different runoff conditions e g flood and drought events reservoirs built on rivers are mainly designed to generate electricity control floods and supply water to ensure the reliability of the water supply the reservoir water level is required to be maximally high however to ensure that the reservoir has adequate capacity for flood control the reservoir water level should be maximally low di baldassarre et al 2017 furthermore reservoir operation strategies influenced by the behaviours of decision makers also very significantly in response to drought and flood risks decision makers modify the operating rules by learning from the historical water management strategies for dealing with drought and flood events for example di baldassarre et al 2017 summarized an unprecedented and multi year drought that occurred in australia in the last decade triggered flood control reservoirs to modify their operating rules to raise water levels for mitigating drought conditions however paradoxically when the 2011 flooding occurred the local population suffered severe and catastrophic consequences which can be attributed to the combined effect of water management and flow dynamics concurrently the role of a reservoir in alleviating a drought depends on its size as well as the intensity and duration of the drought reservoirs can reduce the frequency of droughts having short durations and low intensity nevertheless they are ineffective against megadroughts which may be intensified by reservoir effects kuil et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2018 the natural flow regime alterations caused by dam and reservoir constructions and management have changed the characteristics of droughts and floods on spatial and temporal scales bunn and arthington 2002 acreman et al 2014 wang et al 2018 guo et al 2019 however detailed research on the mechanism of reservoirs for dealing with drought and flood risks is limited furthermore most of the current studies are focused on the effects of a single reservoir on downstream flow mechanisms whereas those of multiple reservoirs remain unresolved in this study we focus on a large river basin with a set of reservoirs in which the flow mechanisms affected by cascade reservoir operating strategies show cumulative or propagation effects e g domino effect from the upstream to downstream as mentioned above reservoir operating strategies differ in dealing with flood and drought risks therefore we use the admissible range of the flow variability method proposed by garcía de jalón et al 2017 and garcía de jalón et al 2019 to define the low and high flow processes i e drought and flood conditions of historical regulated flows furthermore the moving average over shifting horizon mash method is used to reveal the trend duration and intensity of the drought and flood events over the basin for determining the key factors affecting the downstream flow mechanism we apply the network theory and establish a network structure between the downstream flow and the outflows of the cascade reservoirs most importantly a scenario discovery method i e patient rule induction method prim based on a data mining algorithm is introduced in this study to build the operation patterns of the cascade reservoirs for mitigating flood and drought risks these patterns reflect the interaction between human behaviours and the natural flow dynamics and provide the basis for the construction of integrated drought and flood warning mechanisms 2 methods in this section we present in detail on the methods adopted in this study all the methods are for the given data i e historical observational information which form a complete framework from the problem definition to resolution 2 1 natural patterns of flow variability the natural flow regime paradigms of unregulated natural rivers are intrinsic attributes of natural flows which represent the regional character of the rivers and are the combined result of the hydro physical mechanisms and climate of the river basins acreman et al 2014 the construction and management of reservoirs and dams impound natural flow variability and their operation strategies are predetermined and fixed to guide the management during operation periods arthington et al 2006 the typical management strategy of reservoirs is to store water during the wet season and discharge the stored water in the dry season which significantly changes the difference between the minimum and maximum flows therefore the impounding flow variability depends not only on the reservoir operation but also on the regional hydrological conditions the current ecological environmental flow studies believe that the natural patterns of flow variability should be maintained in regulated flows for preserving the health of the river ecosystem garcía de jalón et al 2017 proposed the admissible range of the regulated flow variability for covering the range of daily flow fluctuations this admissible range is considered as the natural patterns of flow variability without human activities the upper and lower limits of this range are defined as the values of the 10th and 90th percentiles of each natural daily flow respectively however as stated by the authors the selection of the percentiles to calculate the range might be subjective therefore in this study we used the 25th and 75th percentiles to calculate the upper and lower limits of the range which is identified as the patterns of flow variability to exclude the extreme values note that the operation strategies of reservoirs may be unreasonable when dealing with extreme flows which can lead to decision making errors once the patterns of flow variability are determined the high or low flow impact i can be obtained as the current flow q higher or lower than the upper or lower limits of the patterns of the flow variability they are the divergence between the current flow and the patterns of the flow variability as follows 1 i high q current q high limit max q current q high limit and 2 i low q current q low limit max q current q low limit in reservoir operation the outflows of the reservoirs are the managed inflows which are in accordance with the initial operating rules therefore although the patterns of natural and regulated flow variabilities are governed by different factors they are considered as the inherent characteristics of the flow processes furthermore these patterns exclude the extreme flows and are formed by reservoir operations to largely mitigate the effects of moderate drought and flood events which correspond to the percentiles i e 25th and 75th more detailed calculation and interpretation of the flow patterns are presented in section 4 1 2 2 moving average over shifting horizon in water resource management trend detection methods are used to evaluate the changes in the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial distributions of water availability the statistical methods of trend detections e g mann kendall test spearman s rho test and regression techniques are frequently used to detect the trend of the time series depending on the selected time scale of the analysis however the natural processes e g temperature precipitation and river flow are influenced by different temporal factors and change differently on the time scales e g seasonal and interannual although these trends can be detected by repeated calculations on different time scales using the statistical method this is frequently complex when splitting the relations between the different timescales for dealing with these limitations anghileri et al 2014 proposed the mash method which can detect trends of seasonality and interannual variability simultaneously as the name suggests this method is based on two aspects 1 the values of the daily flow over a year represent the seasonal variability they are averaged over consecutive days in the same year and over the same consecutive days in consecutive years i e shifting horizon 2 the progressive shifting of the horizon of consecutive years ahead for determining the interannual variability the average daily flow μ t h on the tth day of a year in the hth horizon is calculated as follows 3 μ t h mean y h h y 1 mean d t w t w x d y where x d y is the observed flow on the dth day of the yth year of the observed time series w is the number of consecutive days 2w 1 is defined as the number of days and y is the length of the shifting horizon thus the mash can be represented as a matrix 4 mash μ 1 1 μ 1 2 μ 1 n h μ 2 1 μ 2 2 μ 2 n h μ 365 1 μ 365 2 μ 365 n h where n h is the number of horizons which is calculated as n h n y y 1 where n y is the length years of the observed time series in this method the appropriate number of consecutive days w and the shifting horizon y are determined by trial and error after determining the most appropriate magnitudes of these indicators the mash of the observed flow can be represented using visual tools e g line plot and matrix plot which yields the durations of the different hydrological seasons and the variations in the observed flow magnitude for a more detailed discussion and application of this method the reader is referred to the report by anghileri et al 2014 2 3 network and clustering coefficient a streamflow is a result of the complex and non linear interactions between the regional climate and the landscape characteristics which are the key inputs of environmental modelling and water resource management the objective of streamflow modelling based on statistical methods or hydro physical processes is to define the relations between the streamflow and its affecting factors however the current techniques of streamflow modelling cannot fully present these relations owing to the significant differences in the affecting factors in time and space sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 introduced the theory of network to evaluate the spatial relations in streamflow dynamics they used the observed streamflow series of 639 monitoring stations in the contiguous us as a case study to build the network structures of the streamflow whose clustering tendencies are examined by the clustering coefficient a network is composed of two basic components i e a node and a link which are related in a network if node i is more connected to some nodes than other nodes the more connected nodes are defined as the neighbours of the node these connections are frequently measured by the degree of correlation which can be quantified by the correlation coefficients e g pearson or spearman correlation coefficient given node i in the network has ki links which are connected to ki other nodes if the neighbours of this node are a part of the cluster the total number of the links between them can be calculated as k i k i 1 2 thus the clustering coefficient ci of node i is defined as the ratio between the number ei of actually existing links examined by the degree of correlation of neighbours and the total number of links it is expressed as 5 c i 2 e i k i k i 1 as concluded by sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 the network of the streamflow assists hydrologists to build a generic theory of hydrology for modelling streamflow dynamics the theory of network provides a new perspective to move beyond the traditional modelling approach in this study we used the theory of network to build the relations of the streamflow in the xijiang river basin of china the wuzhou station is located in the lower reaches of the xijiang river and its streamflow is directly or indirectly affected by the outflows of the upstream reservoirs therefore each gaging station i e the wuzhou station and the cascade reservoirs is considered as a node and the observed streamflow of the wuzhou station and the outflows of the cascade reservoirs are used to evaluate their relations 2 4 scenario discovery with data mining in water resource management and environmental modelling the decision making processes and the model output are influenced by various uncertainties e g knowledge deficiencies inputs parameters and structures haasnoot et al 2013 eker and kwakkel 2018 the concept of scenario discovery adapted in these fields can be defined as the process of relating the regular and understandable patterns of a model input e g reservoir inflow and precipitation to output reservoir outflow and runoff the core of the process is to extract information from given or simulated data which is typically implemented by a data mining algorithm the extracted information pattern guides a decision maker to determine the parameters and inputs that are the most sensitive factors for improving the model and decision processes to make robust decisions in the presence of uncertainties in this context sensitivity analysis can only identify the sensitive factors in a dataset and cannot yield the quantitative relationships between the sensitive factors and the outputs however scenario discovery can achieve these tasks simultaneously in this study we used the prim friedman and fisher 1999 a statistical scenario discovery algorithm that determines the combinations of sensitive factors that are expected to produce a particular outcome relative to a user specific performance threshold the prim uses three reasonable measures of quality to evaluate the identified sets of scenarios coverage density and interpretability bryant and lempert 2010 coverage is the proportion of the total number of particular outcomes xi in scenario b to the total number of particular outcomes x which can be expressed as follows 6 coverage x i b y i x i x y i where y i 1 if xi b and y i 0 otherwise density is the proportion of the total number of particular outcomes xi in scenario b to the total number of outcomes x in the scenario which is expressed as follows 7 density x i b y i x b 1 as discussed by bryant and lempert 2010 interpretability is a highly subjective measure because the magnitude and complexity of the datasets that need to be identified are different the decision makers should consider the specific requirement of the information to choose a reasonable and user specific scenario therefore this measure depends on the characteristics of the problem and the explanatory power of the discovered scenarios for providing useful information a selected scenario should have a high coverage capturing maximal proportions of the total number of outcomes high density capturing primarily the outcomes that are main concerns for the decision makers and high interpretability however these measures are typically conflicting and cannot reach the maximum values simultaneously for a selected scenario for a given dataset these measures can formulate a multi dimensional efficiency frontier i e pareto optimal frontier based on this efficiency frontier the prim can exploit a bump hunting algorithm to generate alternative scenarios at different points of the frontier therefore the prim provides visualizations that help decision makers balance the three measures of scenario quality to select a user specific scenario numerous studies have explored the capabilities of this algorithm e g kasprzyk et al 2013 herman et al 2015 ray et al 2018 ren et al 2019 particularly bryant and lempert 2010 conducted an in depth exploration of the availability of the above mentioned algorithm 3 study area and cascade reservoirs the pearl river fig 1 is the third longest river in china with a total length of 2320 km and a basin area of 450 000 km2 the annual runoff of the pearl river is more than 330 billion m3 and is seven times that of the yellow river the pearl river includes three major tributaries xijiang beijiang and dongjiang rivers the longest among them is the xijiang river which is the study area of this study the pearl river basin is located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone and its climate characteristics are mild and rainy with an average annual precipitation of 1400 mm the precipitation has a high intensity and is concentrated in the wet season there is a continuous rainfall of more than 400 mm in the historical observation which can easily cause severe floods the distribution of precipitation clearly decreases gradually from the east to the west and has large regional and temporal variations fig 1 which leads to an extremely uneven distribution of the runoff during the year in this basin the runoff in the wet season from april to september accounts for approximately 80 of the total annual runoff the three tributaries of the pearl river meet at the pearl river delta prd where the pearl river flows into the south china sea the prd is one of the most densely urbanized and vigorous economic regions in china and had a high population of 69 million in 2017 although the area of the prd accounts for 0 58 of the total area of china its total gross domestic product gdp approximately accounts for 12 2 of the gdp of china numerous large cities e g shenzhen guangzhou macao and hong kong as shown in fig 1 are located in the prd which is frequently considered as a megacity i e the pearl river delta metropolitan region in the past decades numerous water conservancy projects have been built in the pearl river basin providing benefits for power generation water supply and flood control and concurrently causing severe environmental degradation owing to the construction and management of reservoirs and dams the sediment load of the river is reduced and there is severe erosion in the prd these aggravate the saltwater intrusion threatening the reliability of the water supply to the megacity during the dry season concurrently in the past decade the frequency of severe typhoons in the delta has increased resulting in an increased risk of flooding xu et al 2010 winsemius et al 2016 wu et al 2019 in this study we focused on the water management of cascade reservoirs including the eight major reservoirs in the xijiang river fig 1 because the xijiang river is the longest tributary of the pearl river where numerous reservoirs and dams have been built far exceeding those on the other two tributaries the operation problem of cascade reservoirs is more complex than that of a single reservoir however the integrated operation of cascade reservoirs has been proved to attenuate flood peaks for example in 2019 according to a report of the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the pearl river water resources commission prwrc urged the major reservoirs i e the tianyi longtan and baise reservoirs in fig 1 to empty their storage see at http www mwr gov cn xw sjzs 201908 t20190802 1352177 html this pre preparation and reasonable operation reduced the flood peak by more than 4000 m3 s at the wuzhou station fig 1 the annual streamflow sequence 1954 2017 of the wuzhou station showed a slight increasing trend fig 2 which was more evenly distributed throughout the year following the construction of the reservoirs as shown in fig 2 cascade reservoirs have been constructed and operated for numerous years and the runoff process at the wuzhou station is mainly impacted by the operation of the upstream reservoirs therefore in this study we chose the period during which all the reservoirs of concern were fully constructed and operating construction dates are shown in fig 2 all the data such as the observed reservoir daily inflows and outflows were collected from the prwrc from 2007 to 2017 except for the guangzhao reservoir 2010 2017 and the changzhou reservoir 2008 2017 the daily streamflow of the wuzhou station was collected from 1997 to 2017 to compare the variations in the streamflow with and without regulations we used the observed operational information of the cascade reservoirs as an example in the method proposed in this study to analyse their mechanism in response to flood and drought events 4 results and discussion 4 1 calculating natural and regulated patterns of flow variability the study presented in this section has two objectives first we use the method proposed by garcía de jalón et al 2017 to calculate the natural or regulated patterns of the flow variabilities of the eight reservoirs and the wuzhou station second depending on the calculated patterns low and high flow impacts are estimated during the historical operation periods the impacts are compared to the water levels of the reservoirs reflecting the historical operation strategies and verifying the rationality of the natural or regulated patterns of the flow variability the patterns of the flow variability are illustrated in fig 3 and appendix a fig a1 fig 3 shows the estimated natural patterns of the inflow variability of the guangzhao reservoir the red and blue lines are the high and low limits calculated from the daily flows for all the years plotted on a common axis in fig 3 constructing the natural patterns of the inflow variability of the guangzhao reservoir as displayed in fig 3 the range of the calculated patterns varies clearly with the variation in runoff with respect to the hydrological season moreover the maximum and minimum ranges are consistent with the wet and dry seasons respectively comparing the patterns of the flow variability considered in this study fig a1 the results indicate that these patterns reflect the intrinsic characteristics of the flow variability which are shaped by the regional factors it should be noted that the percentiles used in the calculations are subjectively pre defined and should be further examined in future studies fig 4 and appendix b fig b1 display the estimated impacts based on the patterns of the flow variability for comparison purposes the natural patterns of the inflow of the reservoirs are used to estimate the flow impacts of the inflows and the corresponding outflows if the current flow q is higher or lower than the upper or lower limit of the patterns the estimated impacts are the high flow red lines in figs 4 and b1 and low flow impacts blue lines in figs 4 and b1 respectively for plotting on a common axis the observed water levels of the reservoirs are normalized between their dead and maximum water levels as presented in fig 4 these impacts can only be under a specific condition i e high flow impact low flow impact or no flow impact at a certain moment the impacted degrees of high and low flow impacts increase with the decrease and increase in the reservoir water level respectively this result shows more clearly the effects of reservoir operation on the flow variability than the direct analysis of the flows to better illustrate the effects of reservoir operation on drought and flood we select the operation year of 2012 for further analysis in the range of panel a the reservoir discharges water to become empty in the dry season so that the high flow impacts of the inflow fig 4a are less than those of the outflow fig 4b moreover in the range of panel b the inflow of the reservoir is under a dry condition and the reservoir is emptied during the previous operation period see panel a however the reservoir stores water during this operation period so that the low flow impact of the outflow is severe fig 4b indicating that the reservoir operation may intensify the impact of the low flow or drought fig 4 is an example of all the reservoirs in appendix b and the above results can be verified in fig b1 4 2 analysis of flow trend during operation period to assess the operation strategies of the cascade reservoirs in shaping the downstream flow mechanism over the operation periods we first analyse the flow trends of the inflows of the four upstream reservoirs that are not affected by the reservoir operation these reservoirs are the guangzhao tianyi honhua and baise reservoirs fig 1 and their inflows reflect the natural conditions of the flow regimes of the xijiang river basin the variations in the daily unregulated natural inflows of the different hydrological seasons of the reservoirs are presented in fig 5 which are calculated using the mash method with w 15 days and y 5 years limited by the length of the time series the shifting horizon y of the inflow of the guangzhao reservoir is determined as 3 years by trial and error this figure highlights the long term inter annual trends and intra annual distributions of the flows and suggests that the inflows of the guangzhao tianyi and honhua reservoirs have not changed significantly in recent decades the variations in the inflows in the different hydrologic seasons present stable characteristics over the operation period no significant increase or decrease trends of the inflows of these reservoirs are found in particular the durations and magnitudes of the inflows during the dry season november to march are stable and they also present no significant changes during the wet season finally the range of the high inflow of the baise reservoir is expanded in recent years e g horizon 2013 2017 indicating that there is a trend for the sub basin to become wetter the annual inflow of the baise reservoir only accounts for 0 05 of the annual streamflow of the wuzhou station therefore this increased inflow has relatively little impact on the streamflow of the wuzhou station fig 6 shows the variations in the daily flow of the wuzhou station in different hydrological seasons of reflecting the effect of the cascade reservoir management on the flow variability fig 6 a and b present the daily and annual streamflow sequences of the wuzhou station respectively the red dash lines represent the trend lines indicating that the daily and annual streamflow sequences of the wuzhou station do not exhibit any significant trends fig 6c displays the results of the mash of the daily streamflow with w 15 days y 5 years and time horizon 1997 2017 for the wuzhou station the black dash lines divide the historical runoff sequence into unregulated and regulated periods compared to those in the unregulated period 1997 2006 the ranges of the high or extreme high and medium flows shrink and expand during the regulated period 2007 2017 respectively importantly comparing the results in fig 6 b and c show that when the annual streamflow is unchanged the streamflow distribution of the wuzhou station is more even throughout the year during the regulated period than during the unregulated period the flood magnitude and duration of the wuzhou station show clear decreasing trends during the regulated period of 2007 2017 in particular the magnitude of the extreme high15 day flow does not exceed 20 000 m3 s whereas the duration of the high 15 day flow event is significantly reduced during the regulated period furthermore the reservoir operation also shorten the duration of the low 15 day flow during the dry season whereas the 15 day flow range of 5000 to 10 000 m3 s is expanded more specifically as shown in fig 6b the minimum and maximum annual streamflows of the wuzhou station occurred from 2007 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2017 respectively however the results in fig 6c indicate that the wuzhou station faced higher risks of flood and drought during the period from 2007 to 2012 results indicate that the construction of the reservoirs enhances the storage capacities at the xijiang river basin for redistributing the streamflow mitigating the risks of drought and flood from the upstream to downstream areas finally for further studying the effect of the reservoir operation on the patterns of flow variability we calculated the patterns of the regulated and unregulated flow variabilities of the wuzhou station plotted in fig 7 the results show that regardless of high dark red line or low light red line flows the patterns of the unregulated flow variabilities are higher than those of the regulated flow variabilities green lines in the wet season however this result is opposite in the dry season magnified box in fig 7 indicating that the water management of the cascade reservoirs increases and decreases the magnitudes of the high and low flows in the wet and dry seasons respectively this is consistent with the conclusions presented in fig 6 which further illustrate the operation effect of the cascade reservoirs on the streamflow variability 4 3 network and clustering coefficient analysis the aim of this part of the study is first to evaluate which upstream reservoirs mainly affect the flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station fig 8 depicts the linear regression analysis of the variability patterns of the outflow of the cascade reservoirs instead of the inflow and the regulated flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station low fig 8a and high fig 8b flow values of the patterns are used for estimating the coefficient of determination r squared respectively the results show that as the distances from the reservoirs to the wuzhou station increase the determination coefficients decrease gradually clearly the low flow distributions are more scattered fig 8a than the high flow distributions and there are noticeable differences between the determination coefficients of the low and high flows for example the determination coefficient r2 0 0661 of the low outflow of the guangzhao reservoir is much smaller than that r2 0 2861 of its high outflow however an opposite result is obtained for the tianyi reservoir although both the reservoirs are located almost at the same distance from the wuzhou station their storage capacity and magnitude of inflows are different fig 1 therefore the characteristics of these determination coefficients are explained by multiple factors including the reservoirs located in different climatic zones having different storage capacities and other features furthermore the outflow patterns of the reservoirs are related which have not been revealed by simple linear regression analysis for revealing the full relations between the flow variability patterns a clustering coefficient analysis based on the theory of network is conducted for this the wuzhou station and the cascade reservoirs are considered as the nodes of the network and the connections between their flow variability patterns are the links the correlation considered here is the spearman correlation coefficient which is insensitive to outliers in the data and can estimate nonlinear connections as discussed in section 2 3 the nearest neighbours e g reservoirs of the wuzhou station in the network are identified based on a pre defined threshold value referring to the results presented in fig 8 four threshold values are considered in the cluster coefficient analysis 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 it should be noted that the changzhou reservoir was eliminated in this analysis because its outflow variability pattern is strongly correlated with the flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station fig 8 the geographical analysis also shows that they are shaped by the same factors fig 1 fig 9 presents the networks and clustering coefficient values for the wuzhou stations for the threshold values of 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 in a network all the links red and green lines denote the correlations exceeding a particular threshold value moreover regardless of the threshold values the clustering coefficient of 0 indicates that there are no actual connections between the neighbours and a higher clustering coefficient indicates that the network structure is more complex the results show that as the threshold values increase the clustering coefficients decrease and the actual connections within the neighborhoods also reduce for the different thresholds there are clear complex networks between the flow variability patterns of the wuzhou station and the outflow variability patterns of the upstream cascade reservoirs when the network threshold exceeds 0 8 the high flow of the wuzhou station and the outflows of the yantan xijing and honhua reservoirs are related indicating that the outflows of these reservoirs directly affect the flood risk of the wuzhou station concurrently when the network threshold exceeds 0 8 the low flow characteristic of the wuzhou station is only connected to the outflow of the honhua reservoir furthermore the low flow network is simpler than the high flow network which indicates that the reservoirs have different operation mechanisms for dealing with the low and high flow processes concurrently the low flow is more difficult to predict than the high flow using the links between the upstream and downstream flow patterns this result offers the locations and manner in which flow connections exist in the water management of the whole river basin and it provides decision makers with critical insight into managing drought and flood risks 4 4 discovering cascade reservoir operating scenario the influence of the cascade reservoirs on the regulated flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station was further analysed using historical operating strategies based on data mining technology this technology i e prim which can be interactively implemented with the r statistical toolkit available at http cran r project org web packages sdtoolkit index html with user specific performance thresholds was used to identify the cascade reservoir operating scenarios for the high and low flow of the flow variability patterns in this study the low flow threshold for the wuzhou station was determined as 1900 m3 s the minimum flow for preventing saltwater intrusion the high flow threshold was determined as 13 000 m3 s the flood warning threshold of the wuzhou station these thresholds were not arbitrarily selected they were determined by the decision makers of the water resource management of the pearl river basin in the scenario discovery process we discovered the scenarios that decrease the low flow to below the low flow threshold and increase the high flow to exceed the high flow threshold thus leading to the occurrence of drought and flood events at the wuzhou station the changzhou reservoir was also removed from this analysis see section 4 3 finally the cascade reservoir operating scenarios between the regulated flow variability pattern of the wuzhou station and the outflow variability patterns of the cascade reservoirs were obtained as follows fig 10 the prim identifies the ranges of the flow variability which cause system vulnerability in fig 10 the left graphs show the pareto optimal frontiers between the overall coverage and the density for alternative scenarios in the graphs the colours of the points from blue to red indicate increase in the number of components contained in the alternative scenarios for regulated high and low flows we selected scenarios a and b as the respective user specific scenarios the coloured overlaid bars represent the ranges of all the sensitive outflows that cause the vulnerabilities at the wuzhou station the high flow exceeding the high flow threshold selected scenario a and the low flow below the low flow threshold selected scenario b in the range when a sensitive outflow is high there is a high probability of this outflow leading to the streamflow conditions that fail to satisfy the criteria of the stakeholders the right tables summarise the density and coverage of the components of the selected scenarios and red and green arrows denote the boundary of the ranges greater and less than the specific values of a component respectively these selected scenarios which are shown in fig 10 right graphs were balanced among the three measures i e coverage density and interpretability of the scenario quality the results exhibit that the credibility values of the sensitivity outflows decay from top to bottom seen in the top right table according to the measures of the scenario quality the measure values of coverage and density are larger than 0 8 except for the density of the regulated low flow indicating that data mining can identify well the cascade reservoir operating scenarios under drought and flood thresholds in response to the regulated high flow fig 10a most of the cascade reservoirs from the upstream to the downstream have undertaken the corresponding tasks of regulation when the outflows of the guangzhao longtan tianyi yantan xijing and honhua reservoirs are higher than 166 m3 s 1530 m3 s 662 m3 s 2242 m3 s 1850 m3 s and 2415 m3 s respectively the synthetic flow is most expected to be higher than the high flow threshold at the wuzhou station concurrently the more the upstream locations of the reservoirs the larger the ranges of their outflows affecting the vulnerability of the wuzhou station this result indicates that the discharges from the upstream reservoirs may play indicative roles for the downstream flood control particularly a flood occurring over the whole river basin emphasizing the importance of the integrated operation of the multi reservoir system furthermore in response to the regulated low flow fig 10b the accuracy of the cascade reservoir operating scenario is slightly worse than that of the regulated high flow which is consistent with the accuracy of the network see fig 9 when the sensitive outflows of the tianyi xijing and honhua reservoirs are less than 302 m3 s 322 m3 s and 215 m3 s respectively whereas the low flow of the baise reservoir is greater than 48 m3 s the synthetic flow will most probably be lower than the low flow threshold at the wuzhou station finally these results suggest that reservoirs play different roles in dealing with droughts and floods according to their different tasks in the operating strategy this leads to strategy uncertainty when decision makers formulate integrated operating strategies for mitigating drought and flood impacts 5 further discussion in the anthropocene age the environment dynamics are reshaped by the integrated impacts of human activities and natural processes with inherent deterministic patterns and stochastic components sivakumar and singh 2012 sivakumar 2014 although the main objectives of environmental modelling are to simulate the time sequences maximally accurately the current models cannot accurately describe physical processes particularly during human affected periods sivapalan 2018 sociohydrology may provide a key perspective for resolving these issues and developing a generalized understanding of the environment controlled by the interactions between nature and human systems bhave et al 2018 di baldassarre et al 2019 therefore this study provides a basis for coupling management strategies and physically based approaches in a sociohydrological model furthermore coupling data driven techniques with physical process models is an important hybrid modelling approach for improving the predictive ability of environmental models reichstein et al 2019 additional studies using numerous observations and integrated models are required to evaluate the availability of our proposed framework deep learning technology will be used in water resource management shen 2018 ali et al 2018 2020a which can not only improve the knowledge of the behaviours of the decision makers but also assist them in identifying better management strategies this topic should also be investigated in depth in future studies 6 conclusions in this study we explored a cascade reservoir operation scenario at different magnitudes of the flow variability pattern for a large and complex river basin i e the pearl river basin for achieving this objective we first collected the historical data of a key streamflow station i e the wuzhou station and its cascade reservoirs eight major reservoirs to estimate the flow variability patterns that represent the inherent deterministic components of the flow variability the mash method evaluated whether the operation strategies of the cascade reservoirs affected the flow variability of the wuzhou station furthermore networks were constructed between the upstream and downstream runoff patterns which were compared to the cascade reservoir operation scenarios identified by a data mining technology i e prim for improving the reliability of the results a comprehensive investigation of the coupled dynamics of flow variability and human decisions motivates a better understanding of integrated water resource management this study shows that there are cumulative effects on the flow dynamics from the upstream to downstream reservoirs which redistribute the streamflow in space and time to mainly change the flow variability of the downstream reservoir under different thresholds the constructed networks present a clear relation between the upstream and downstream flow variability patterns which provide new avenues to understand and identify these cumulative effects the accuracies of the networks and the identified operation scenario of the high flow process are higher than those of the low flow process concurrently the cascade reservoir operation scenarios obtained from data mining clearly present differences in the reservoir operation strategies for dealing with high and low flow processes these differences will limit the actual application of the identified operation scenarios there are numerous purposes for building water reservoirs in a basin and water resource management needs to meet the diverse requirements of the different stakeholders zatarain salazar et al 2017 although multi objective reservoir optimization operation is successful for resolving the challenges of water resource management in theory the effect of its practical application needs to be further verified therefore this study provides a guidance for the practical application of reservoir optimization operation particularly clarifying the

4857,soil moisture plays a pivotal role in terrestrial water circulation energy transfer and mass exchange the x band radiometer on board fengyun 3b and 3c satellites have been used for soil moisture retrieval since 2011 in this study the spatial and temporal integrity of all available fengyun 3 series soil moisture products were evaluated and the data accuracy was validated against four in situ measurements ascertained globally the validation results reveal that 1 the ascending fengyun 3b soil moisture retrievals express higher spatial coverage percentages than others and a higher temporal coverage percentage appears at 20 60 n and 20 50 s in summer 2 the soil moisture products derived from both fengyun 3b and 3c satellites reveal superior goodness of fit and smaller bias in the northern hemisphere in situ measurements than in the southern hemisphere in particular the satellite retrieved pixel scale soil moisture datasets possesses a better correlation to small scale networks with densely distributed stations in the southern hemisphere the bias was positively correlated with the vegetation index and negatively correlated to land surface temperature and this regularity may act as a reference for fengyun 3 soil moisture correction moreover the fengyun 3 soil moisture products reveal positive responses to precipitation and the memory of soil moisture to precipitation could last for at least 5 days 3 the x band signals were gradually impacted by increasing vegetation optical depth leading to obvious overestimations further corrections including hardware and software are urgently required to enhance the anti interference and robustness of the x band signal keywords fengyun 3 satellites soil moisture integrity accuracy evaluation 1 introduction soil moisture is prevalently recognized as a critical parameter in various earth science study fields such as agriculture engman 1991 climatology rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 ecology robinson et al 2008 hydrology wanders et al 2014 and meteorology koster et al 2004 acquisition of a soil moisture dataset with favorable quality is crucial to satisfy the research requirements in the aforementioned fields in recent decades significant effort has been devoted to measuring soil moisture satellite borne sensors have exhibited excellent performance in obtaining global scale soil moisture with good spatial representativeness cai et al 2007 denmead and shaw 1962 jackson et al 1982 leng et al 2017 2019 robock et al 2000 spennemann et al 2015 tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 a large variety of studies has proven that the microwave spectrum is suitable for retrieving soil moisture because of the sensitivity of microwave bandwidth to the variation of soil dielectric constant caused by soil water change gonzález zamora et al 2018 jackson et al 1996 further according to the working mode of the sensor remotely sensed soil moisture can be derived from the brightness temperature through passive radiometer sensors and from the radar backscatter coefficient through active radar sensors dorigo and de jeu 2016 zhang et al 2019 in contrast to active microwave sensors passive microwave sensors usually have shorter revisit periods simpler data processing steps and less sensitivity to surface roughness and vegetation cover all of which are more suitable for large scale soil moisture estimation kim et al 2018 among the microwave spectrums the x band centered at 10 65 ghz has illustrated good capability in the estimation of soil moisture with an accuracy ranging from 3 to 6 vol aubert et al 2011 hajj et al 2016 for instance the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e utilized x band signals in horizontal h and vertical v polarizations to retrieve 25 km spatial resolution soil moisture njoku et al 2003 since its inception the soil moisture data obtained via the amsr e has been widely evaluated worldwide and has been applied in surface hydrological studies chen et al 2013 im et al 2016 rüdiger et al 2009 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 as the successor of amsr e continued to retrieve soil moisture in the x band and a neighboring c band centered at 7 3 ghz was added to improve radio frequency interference rfi mitigation parinussa et al 2013 similarly amsr2 soil moisture has undergone comprehensive validation and has been used in simulation processes and scale conversions by scholars in related fields bindlish et al 2018 kwon et al 2018 santi et al 2018 the coriolis windsat datasets combining x band k band centered at 18 7 ghz and ka band centered at 37 ghz to retrieve soil moisture displayed significant improvement over amsr e li et al 2010 the tropical rainfall measuring mission microwave imager trmm tmi was used to map daily soil moisture through dual polarization observations in the x band the evaluation results of data acquired from the region over the us southern great plains proved that trmm tmi soil moisture retrievals could compare well with the in situ measurements bindlish et al 2003 drusch et al 2005 in addition the european space agency climate change initiative soil moisture esa cci sm that merged a host of microwave band including x band soil moisture retrievals has effectively advanced our understanding of earth system processes and climate change dorigo et al 2017 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa launched the soil moisture operational products system smops to provide a seamless soil moisture map of the globe by merging soil moisture products from six satellites since march 2017 wang et al 2021 furthermore recently the l band centered at 1 41 ghz revealed superior ability in land surface soil water content retrieval the outstanding performance of l band derived soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture has been testified globally ma et al 2019 in addition to satellite based soil moisture products data assimilation is also an important way to acquire soil moisture retrievals in comparison satellite based soil moisture products are derived from remotely sensed signals through a radiative transfer equation while data assimilation methods bring a host of ground observed and satellite received datasets into the assimilation model to obtain soil moisture reichle et al 2009 numerous soil moisture retrievals derived from assimilation models have been broadly applied in hydrological process analysis and climate change prediction chen et al 2013 spennemann et al 2015 sun et al 2016 apart from the above mentioned soil moisture retrievals the national satellite meteorological centre nsmc of the china meteorological administration cma developed and launched the fengyun 3 series satellites to monitor global land surface parameters which included soil moisture as a key parameter dong and zou 2019 xu et al 2016 fengyun 3 series satellites were the second generation of polar orbit meteorological satellites in china which contained four satellites namely fengyun 3a 3b 3c and 3d the micro wave radiation imager mwri was a passive microwave based instrument on board the fengyun 3 series satellites that had five frequencies centered at 10 65 18 7 23 8 36 5 and 89 ghz and 10 channels and land surface soil moisture was retrieved using x band 10 65 ghz echo signals from mwri with v and h polarizations the fengyun 3 soil moisture dataset released by nsmc was estimated using a modified single channel algorithm jackson 1993 in particular the surface emission model was applied to rectify impacts induced by surface roughness and the brightness temperatures of both v and h polarizations were used to retrieve soil moisture parinussa et al parinussa et al 2014 attempted to employ the land parameter retrieval model lprm to the mwri accepted signals to retrieve more reliable soil moisture detailed information about the lprm algorithm can be seen in de jeu et al 2009 a host of satellite based soil moisture datasets derived from the x k ka and l bands have been evaluated using well designed experiments and they were found to exhibit promising capability in fitting the values and dynamics of the in situ measurements worldwide albergel et al 2012 2009 dorigo et al 2017 liu and yang 2020 liu et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 however few studies have focused on remotely sensed soil moisture derived from the fengyun 3 satellites the fengyun 3 satellites not only serve the china meteorological department but also provide a series of meteorological products for over 2 600 users in 90 countries furthermore the world meteorological organization wmo has already brought them into the global operational application of meteorological satellite sequences which is an important member of the global integrated earth observation system in addition the fengyun 3 satellites play a vital role in the formation and implementation of international drought and flood disaster early warning and emergency rescue programs recently the fengyun 3c soil moisture products were validated using in situ data in the henan province china zhu et al 2019 however the verification was conducted for only one land cover type cropland with a single temperate monsoon climate a rigorous evaluation must contain multiple vegetation and climate conditions bi et al 2016 jackson et al 2012 the reliability and accuracy of soil water content must be comprehensively and objectively evaluated before applying them in practice among the four types of fengyun 3 satellites 3a 3b 3c and 3d the x band mwri onboard fengyun 3b and 3c were designed to retrieve land surface soil moisture therefore in this study the accuracy of fengyun 3b and 3c soil moisture estimations were evaluated using four networks across the globe meanwhile inter comparisons are performed to illuminate the divergence between ascending and descending retrievals and between fengyun 3b and fengyun 3c satellite retrieved datasets this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the case study areas fengyun 3 soil moisture datasets in situ measurements and ancillary datasets used in this study in addition section 2 introduces the data pre processing method and error parameters employed for soil moisture evaluation section 3 describes the evaluation results of fengyun 3 soil moisture against in situ measurements under different case study areas and the correlations between soil moisture and underlying surface properties in section 4 we discuss the possible reasons that may lead to different spatial and temporal evaluation accuracies the conclusions of this study are presented in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 study areas and in situ measurements this study investigates the performance of fengyun 3 satellites retrieved soil moisture products in fitting in situ measurements for multiple underlying surfaces four soil moisture monitor networks with stable long time series in situ measured data and representative physical geography background were selected for this research as depicted in fig 1 the little washita watershed lww network is located in the southwest oklahoma in the great plains region of the united states u s the remedhus network is situated in the northern part of the iberian peninsula soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central tibetan plateau ctp smtmn network lies in the naqu basin in a flat terrain with rolling hills at an average elevation of 4 500 m above mean sea level oznet network is on mountainous and coastal plains of south eastern australia these four rigorously designed networks are acknowledged for their reliable data quality and broad applications in soil moisture retrieval evaluations and hydrological model calibrations leroux et al 2014 liu et al 2020 2018 sanchez et al 2012 su et al 2011 the ctp smtmn is a valuable network because of its crucial role in understanding soil moisture variations in the tibetan plateau which is the regulator of climate change in the northern hemisphere both the lww and remedhus networks are distributed in the planting area but with quite different climate types it is imperative to illustrate seasonal soil moisture evolution patterns in the crop planting area the oznet was employed to clarify the quality of the fengyun 3 satellites retrieved soil moisture products in the southern hemisphere fig 2 illustrates the available time period of fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals and in situ measurements used in this study information about each network is detailed as follows and the main characteristics used in this study are listed in table 1 2 1 1 lww network the lww network was established by the agricultural research service sgrazinglands research laboratory of the u s department of agriculture in 1961 this region has a temperate climate and is covered majorly by grasslands peel et al 2007 the lww which could provide valuable measured soil moisture data has been broadly employed in hydrometeorological research owing to the remarkable seasonal dynamics of soil moisture and flat terrain this network has been extensively used to verify the quality of satellite retrieved and scale transformed soil moisture products jackson et al 2012 leroux et al 2014 zeng et al 2016 there are 20 densely distributed stations that monitor the meteorological conditions and soil moisture every 5 min in particular the soil moisture was monitored at depths of 5 10 15 and 30 cm given the penetration limitation of the x band mwri the top layer records of lww are utilized in this study to carry out assessment 2 1 2 remedhus network remedhus is a dense network set up in spain sanchez et al 2012 it is based in a region having a typical temperate marine climate with sufficient precipitation and the maximum and minimum elevations of this region are approximately 900 and 700 m respectively as the rainfall is mainly concentrated in winter the soil moisture was relatively high in winter and low in summer the remedhus network currently has 24 sites and 22 of them with long time series data records are utilized in this study in addition most of the stations are arranged in croplands suggesting that the institution attaches great importance to the plant products industry the remedhus network measures soil moisture through hydrologic probes at 0 5 cm on an hourly basis since 2005 apart from its application in soil moisture verification it has also been widely used for hydrological model calibrations sánchez et al 2010 2 1 3 ctp smtmn network the ctp smtmn network is located in a flat terrain with rolling hills in the central tibetan plateau su et al 2011 it has a typical cold and semiarid climate and an average elevation of 4 500 m all 57 stations were arranged in the dominant alpine meadow to monitor soil moisture at 0 5 10 20 and 40 cm depths through the ec tm and 5tm capacitance probes kizito et al 2008 the soil moisture measured at 0 5 cm was used in this study for evaluation considering the particularities in the climate and ecological fragility of the tibetan plateau the ctp smtmn network has been treated as a critical region for validating the accuracy level of various soil moisture products chen et al 2013 liu et al 2018 velde et al 2014 yang et al 2013 therefore this network was selected to systematically validate the applicability of fengyun 3 soil moisture data in expressing the soil moisture on the tibetan plateau ranging from residual to saturated 2 1 4 oznet network the oznet is a sparse hydrological monitoring network for soil moisture and micrometeorology situated in the maritime monsoon climate area of the mullenbiki river basin in south eastern australia smith et al 2012 in this network 24 of the 27 employed stations are situated less than 500 m above sea level and the other three sites are located at 500 1000 m above sea level the hourly soil moisture is monitored at depth of 0 5 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm and the 0 5 cm soil moisture data was adopted for study the oznet network greatly contributed to supporting land surface hydrological characteristics and ecological status analysis in the southern hemisphere through the continuous measurement of soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation liu et al 2018 mei et al 2016 peischl et al 2012 senanayake et al 2019 hence the oznet network in situ measurements were selected as the theoretical truth values to assess the performance of fengyun 3 soil moisture in the southern hemisphere 2 2 fengyun 3 satellites retrieved soil moisture the fengyun 3b and 3c satellites were launched by the nsmc of the cma to monitor surface environmental elements the mwri sensors onboard the fengyun 3b and 3c satellites are highly sensitive passive microwave radiometers operating at 10 65 18 7 23 8 36 5 and 89 ghz of which the 10 65 ghz signals are used to retrieve soil moisture the fengyun 3b satellite scans the earth s surface in an ascending orbit at 1 40p m local solar time and in descending orbit at 1 40 a m local solar time in comparison the fengyun 3c satellite passes in the ascending and descending orbits at 10 00p m and 10 00 a m local time respectively the fengyun 3b soil moisture products are available from 12th july 2011 to 19th august 2019 and currently the fengyun 3c provides soil moisture products from 29th may 2014 to 3rd february 2020 the fengyun 3 series soil moisture products were retrieved from a modified algorithm of the amsr e soil moisture retrieval method according to shi et al 2006 using the brightness temperature datasets for further details about the retrieving algorithm of fengyun 3 soil moisture readers may refer to zhu et al 2019 notwithstanding that fengyun 3 soil moisture is derived from the same algorithm globally the data accuracy could have evident regional heterogeneity in terms of properties of the underlying surface which vary significantly among multiple hydrothermal combinations and land cover types moreover because momentary scanning signals are expected to represent the soil moisture reality of an entire day it may be assumed that different satellite passing times could also induce accuracy level differences therefore in this study the volumetric water content daily scale including ascending and descending 25 km spatial resolution fengyun 3b and 3c soil moisture datasets were evaluated under different underlying surfaces and the datasets were acquired from the nsmc fengyun satellite data center http satellite nsmc org cn 2 3 ancillary datasets a host of research has demonstrated the interactional relationships between soil moisture and land surface parameters such as precipitation koster et al 2004 temperature mohseni and mokhtarzade 2020 and vegetation index chen et al 2014 it is assumed that a potential correlation may exist between fengyun 3 soil moisture accuracy and these parameters hence precipitation land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi datasets were employed to explore their relationships with soil moisture accuracy tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 precipitation estimates huffman et al 2007 were adopted in this study lst and ndvi were derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land products version 6 justice et al 1998 the spatial resolution and projection of the ancillary datasets were unified to the corresponding properties of the fengyun 3 soil moisture datasets the temporal resolution of precipitation was resampled to the daily scale by calculating the sum of the 3 hour value within a day meanwhile although precipitation processes had a marked impact on surface soil moisture we did not eliminate rainy days during the validation in an attempt to clarify the capability of fengyun 3 soil moisture datasets in responding to precipitation events the main information of the aforementioned parameters used in this study is listed in table 2 2 4 methods this study assessed both the ascending and descending retrieved soil moisture from fengyun 3b and 3c satellites across the diverse underlying surfaces described above considering that the effective penetration depth of x band is approximately 0 1 cm cui et al 2017 mei et al 2017 the in situ measured top layer soil moisture records were chosen to try to match in depth in addition this study aimed to quantify the agreement level between the fengyun 3 soil moisture and in situ measurements on a daily scale hence hourly and sub hourly monitored in situ measurements were averaged to represent the daily situation meanwhile in an effort to maintain stability and reliability only in situ records covering 12 h within a day can be treated as valid data and used for express daily value by calculating arithmetic means liu et al 2018 we used a day timescale rather than the moment when the satellites transit measured in situ values to evaluate the satellite derived soil moisture products the instantaneous transit satellite derived soil moisture products are expected to effectively present the daily dynamics of in situ measured data and carry out drought and flood monitoring furthermore exploration of the day timescale representation differences between ascending and descending time retrieved soil moisture products is a promising avenue of research in order to optimize hydrological model construction and process analysis in addition to the accuracy evaluation we also attempted to explore the applicability characteristics of different scale in situ measurements in verifying coarse resolution soil moisture retrievals in the ctp smtmn network among the four employed networks the average values of stations located in the same pixel were calculated to represent the soil moisture condition of this pixel covered region for dense networks there are usually more than four sites within a pixel whereas for sparse networks most stations were separately situated in a pixel to conduct an objective and systematic evaluation the correlation coefficient r bias root mean square error rmse and unbiased root mean square deviation ubrmsd were selected to jointly validate the quality of fengyun 3 soil moisture here r is a statistical index designed by the statistician carl pearson which is an efficient indicator of the linear correlation between variables taylor 1990 the bias is used to precisely describe the level of overestimation underestimation through positive negative values the rmse can quantify the degree of dispersion of the predictions the ubrmsd represents the difference in standard deviation between the satellite retrievals and observations in particular satellite based sm retrievals are expected to achieve a target accuracy of ubrmsd 0 04 m3 m3 which is defined by the soil moisture and ocean salinity kerr et al 2001 and smap entekhabi et al 2010 therefore the four error metrics could be employed to thoroughly analyze the capability of fengyun 3 soil moisture in fitting in situ measurements among various underlying surfaces in this study r was used to measure the agreement of temporal dynamics between two datasets hence the r value was expected to be high when the regional land surface soil moisture seasonality fluctuation could be precisely captured by fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals the bias described the error condition through positive and negative values and rmse reflected the degree of deviation therefore an accurate satellite based soil moisture product should have a bias and rmse close to zero as much as possible the ubrmsd depicted the probability density distribution difference between fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals and in situ measurements their equations are as follows 1 r i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 bias i 1 n x i i 1 n y i n 3 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 4 ubrmsd i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n where x i x y i and y represent the fengyun 3 soil moisture values at pixel i arithmetic means of all the fengyun 3 soil moisture pixels in situ measurement value at station i and averaged value of all the in situ measurements values respectively in addition to accuracy validation against in situ measurements cross correlation was utilized in this study to demonstrate the temporal variation of correlation before and after the precipitation processes the formula for the calculation of cross correlation is listed in equation 5 for further details about cross correlation readers can refer to podobnik and stanley 2008 yoo and han 2009 5 cross c o r r e l a t i o n n x n k y n where x is the soil moisture dataset from in situ measurements and feng 3 satellites y is the complex conjugate of precipitation n is the x array length and k is the number of lag days 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal soil moisture completeness previous studies have proposed that spatial and temporal data availability could be a critical component in the quality evaluation of the datasets retrieved from the satellite dorigo et al 2017 2015 therefore the data completeness over space and time was analyzed first as illustrated in fig 3 the valid soil moisture percentages derived from fengyun 3b and 3c satellites through ascending and descending orbits manifested similarity in spatial distribution throughout the entire available period in particular fengyun 3b a revealed a slightly higher coverage percentage than the others it can be clearly observed that regions located in the middle and low latitude zones with mild elevations were densely observed 50 such as africa australia india western europe eastern china central america and argentina in contrast the observations were relatively sparse less than40 at high latitudes and high altitude areas such as the tibetan plateau brazilian central plateau canada and siberia this phenomenon could mainly be due to ice snow cover or soil temperature below zero during the long freezing winter in addition to the spatial density heterogeneity the temporal evolutionary trends of observation percentages are presented in fig 4 for temporal completeness validation a pronounced seasonal cycle of percentage evolution was observed especially in winter when microwave signals were obstructed by frozen soil densely observed regions were mainly concentrated at 20 60 n and 20 50 s in summer which were basically in accordance with the conditions identified in fig 3 although each soil moisture product was retrieved from the same x band signal with a constant sensor crossing time and retrieval algorithm a few differences existed in the same season for different years because of varying rfi and vegetation canopy conditions owe et al 2001 piepmeier et al 2013 zou et al 2013 in addition as shown in fig 4 c and d a long strip gap appeared in the fengyun 3c soil moisture retrievals in june 2015 which was a result of sensor technical problems and downtime maintenance 3 2 in situ measurements based validation in situ measurements based validation is an essential part of verifying the satellite based soil moisture data the error metrics of each pixel were calculated and the accuracy results of all pixels formed an array table 3 lists the valid days for evaluation from different fengyun 3 satellites in each network the lww had the most valid days whereas the ctp smtmn had the least valid days because of the great thermal difference between day and night at the ctp smtmn the surface temperature often drops below zero even in summer as a result both fengyun 3b d and fengyun 3c a scanning the earth surface at midnight only recorded dozens of valid days at the ctp smtmn in terms of different soil moisture retrievals fengyun 3b a revealed a significant advantage in acquiring valid data followed by fengyun 3c d and fengyun 3b d ranked last this phenomenon suggests that the satellites that transit during daytime tend to receive more valid signals than night time transit satellites the accuracy evaluations were conducted through the corresponding overlapped periods and the results are clearly presented by boxplots in figs 5 8 boxplots are efficient and effective ways to visualize the properties of ensembles which have been employed in many applications mirzargar et al 2014 the horizontal solid lines from top to bottom express the maximum first quartile median third quartile and minimum values the horizontal dotted line represents the average and the red dots indicate potential outliers in this study the statistical properties of r bias rmse and ubrmsd were obtained using boxplots as displayed in figs 5 8 there was a pronounced variation in accuracy levels between and within the four networks in terms of different networks the validation results revealed favorable performances with high r and small rmse at the lww remedhus and ctp smtmn networks in specific the fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals obtained superior r 0 7 on average in the ctp smtmn network and a relatively small value error in the remedhus network in addition varying degrees of overestimations were observed except for the remedhus network however accompanied by low correlation and significant deviation it appeared that the fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals failed in fitting in situ measurements at the oznet network this phenomenon may indicate that the capability of fengyun 3 to correctly detect the top layer soil water content in the southern hemisphere requires further improvement therefore it is deduced that the fengyun 3 soil moisture products could favorably fit the dynamics of in situ data at polar regions and the smallest error reflected by bias can be achieved in the remedhus region in comparison the overestimation condition exists in the lww network which has a temperate climate with relatively sufficient precipitation the non ideal performance at the oznet may suggest that the soil moisture retrieval and correction algorithms in this region require further improvement the performance of the four kinds of fengyun 3 soil moisture products were to some extent aligned with each other because they were acquired from the same x band mwri and retrieval algorithms meanwhile it could be deduced that the different accuracy levels within each network mainly originated from different satellite transit times in particular the fengyun 3b a localequatorialcrossingtime was 1 40p m soil moisture retrievals expressed slightly better precision along with a higher fitting degree and smaller error therefore it was primarily summarized that the daytime derived products could be more competent in accurately representing day scale ground soil moisture than the nighttime ones in addition similar conclusions have been reached by a multitude of previous studies brocca et al 2011 chen et al 2013 liu et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 however the soil moisture retrieval algorithms generally assumed that the temperature between the land surface and the canopy could be less at night than during the day which was supposed to be a beneficial situation in accurately retrieving soil moisture it was argued that the vegetation became more transparent as a result of the relatively high temperature in the daytime and therefore the quality of the ascending passes mat is improved brocca et al 2011 we believe that further analysis must be performed on the mechanism for the soil moisture retrievals in order to understand the rule of accuracy in areas with different vegetation cover densities and the quality difference between daytime and nighttime 3 3 error correlation to land surface parameters ndvi and lst are two critical land surface parameters that have bidirectional interactive responses to soil moisture vegetation roots absorb water from the soil for transpiration and photosynthesis leading to a decrease in soil moisture meanwhile net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate decrease due to the rise in mesophyll resistance resulting from drying of the soil ndvi is responsive to changes in the chlorophyll content which means that higher ndvi values reflect greater photosynthetic capacity of the vegetation canopy whereas lower ndvi values reflect the degradation of chlorophyll content gu et al 2008 when root zone soil water content available for the vegetation becomes exhausted both evapotranspiration and photosynthesis are reduced and the temperature of the vegetation surface increases soer 1980 in addition because of their close relationship with soil moisture ndvi and lst have been extensively used in soil moisture simulation and drought monitoring bai et al 2019 kogan 1995 mallick et al 2009 sung gon et al 2009 therefore there may exist potential links between the accuracy of fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals and these two land surface parameters figs 9 10 display the scatterplots between fengyun 3 soil moisture bias and ndvi and lst across the four case study regions in fig 9 r was not significant in the cases of lww and remedhus however the ndvi was positively and remarkably correlated to soil moisture bias in ctp smtmn and oznet and bias from the ascending retrievals exhibited more significant goodness of fit to ndvi than the corresponding descending retrievals it was thought that the bias may vary regularly according to vegetation optical depth vod under natural conditions whereas artificial interventions i e irrigation and harvest in pasture and cropland can interfere with this regular pattern with varying degrees furthermore the vegetation canopy attenuated signals from soil surfaces which reduced the sensitivity of brightness temperature to soil moisture hence corrections of errors from diverse vegetation coverage types are crucial for acquiring robust and accurate soil moisture retrievals in terms of lst the bias appeared not to be significantly correlated to lst in the northern hemisphere case study regions in contrast the correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between the bias and lst in the southern hemisphere case study region therefore it was suggested that the accuracy of fengyun 3 soil moisture would likely be improved after rigorous and systematic corrections of the perturbing factors vegetation and surface temperature in the retrieval model especially in oznet and ctp smtmn regions 3 4 temporal responses to precipitation and vegetation condition several researchers have explored soil moisture precipitation feedback and demonstrated the promotion effect of precipitation on the rise of soil moisture qiu et al 2016 spennemann et al 2015 tuttle and salvucci 2016 yang et al 2018 in an effort to determine the response and memory of fengyun 3 soil moisutre to rainfall seasonal variations in soil moisture and precipitation from july 2011 to december 2019 were analyzed as depicted in fig 11 b c and d soil moisture exhibited a significant interannual fluctuation cycle varying from residual to saturated which was driven primarily by evapotranspiration and precipitation however the periodic regularity was not equally significant in the lww network this phenomenon was supposed to be deduced by sufficient artificial irrigation which could ensure the continuous growth of pasture satellite based soil moisture was absent in the ctp smtmn network in winter when the surface soil was frozen and there was a huge microwave spectrum difference between ice and liquid water zhang et al 2003 zhang and armstrong 2001 both the ascending and descending soil moisture retrievals from fengyun 3b and 3c presented analogous evolution trends the fengyun 3 derived soil moisture could represent values and temporal dynamics of in situ measurements with favorable performances except for the oznet network where obvious overestimations generally existed section 3 2 illustrates the overall estimated biases and uncertainties across different case study regions however considering that remotely sensed soil moisture can be markedly impacted by vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration the data accuracy is expected to vary strongly in time series gruber et al 2020 2019 zwieback et al 2018 the temporal accuracy regularity is critical in evaluating the reliability and robustness of a soil moisture product during a specific season fig 12 presents the time series bias of fengyun 3 soil moisture and ndvi and the evolution tendency revealed significant correlation to seasonal variation it was observed that the fengyun 3 data always overestimated in situ measurements during the vegetation growing season when there was proper temperature and precipitation or artificial irrigation previous studies have investigated the reasons that lead to errors in satellite retrieved soil moisture ma et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 vegetation conditions were proven to have an evident impact on the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval the microwave signals from surface soil could decrease because of the vegetation canopy which subsequently reduced the sensitivity of brightness to soil moisture zhu et al 2019 therefore the vegetation correction procedure played a critical role in the accurate retrieval of soil moisture data through microwave radiative transfer models in particular the vod revealed a positive correlation with the bias of microwave band derived surface temperature products originating from brightness temperature ma et al 2019 which was consistent with the overestimation condition shown in fig 12 a c currently the fengyun 3 soil moisture algorithm uses vegetation water content vwc as a proxy to present the vod in this study the ndvi was used to present vegetation conditions as the vwc used in fengyun 3 soil moisture retrieval was unavailable according to existing research the vwc could significantly affect the microwave radiative transfer and reliability of retrieved soil moisture in the c and x band calvet et al 2010 in addition a high vwc 0 3 kg m2 that had relatively dense canopies could attenuate the correlation between microwave signal and land surface soil moisture wagner et al 2007 in terms of the southern hemisphere fig 12 d the bias expressed violent overestimation fluctuations suggesting prevalent uncertainties of the echo signal besides the fitting degree between in situ records and fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals it is equally meaningful to discuss the capability of satellite based soil moisture in responding to the promoting effect of rainfall during a precipitation event under molecular capillary and gravitational forces the rain infiltrates into the pores of the soil and replenishes soil water content the top layer soil moisture increases rapidly and then decreases gradually the infiltration rate could be influenced by precipitation characteristics soil texture land cover and topography therefore it is suggested that the correlation between rainfall and soil moisture may change notably on different underlying surfaces moreover in terms of various infiltration rates there could be different lags in the four case study areas the temporal cross correlations between precipitation and soil moisture from different sources in every network are displayed in figs 13 17 the cross correlations changed considerably for the four selected regions for instance in ctp smtmn fig 13 a where precipitation was dominant in soil water recharge sources the cross correlations were significantly higher than that of the others in contrast in the mediterranean climate zone rainfall could be scarce in the growing season and artificial irrigation played a pivotal role in adjusting soil moisture to promote crop growth as illustrated in fig 13 b the cross correlations remained relatively low even after rainfall indicating that the change in soil moisture can be regulated by many factors such as vegetation status human activities rainfall and variations in soil properties caused by fertilization it can be observed from figs 14 17 that the fengyun 3 derived soil moisture revealed positive responses to rainfall events and their cross correlation dynamics were similar to those obtained from in situ measurements fig 13 this high similarity proved the competence of momentary scanned signal retrieved soil moisture in depicting the daily situation of hourly or sub hourly monitored records their cross correlations could immediately increase on the day when precipitation occurred the cross correlations usually achieved the maximum values with 1 2 days lag after the rain then presented gradual daily decline the soil moisture memory owing to precipitation could last for at least 5 days meanwhile cross correlations quickly increased at first and then gradually decreased to the level before rain in comparison cross correlations from fengyun 3b a exhibited a superior degree of fit to the values and dynamics of cross correlations from in situ measurements 3 5 performances of different scale in situ measurements few studies have investigated the degree to which spatial collocation mismatches contributes to validated accuracy gruber et al 2020 we compared and analyzed the performances of different scale in situ measurements to clarify their characteristics in depicting the accuracy of satellite soil moisture retrievals as depicted in fig 18 the ctp smtmn is a multi scale soil moisture network that measures hourly soil moisture in large medium and small scales with spatial extents of 1 0 1 0 0 3 0 3 and 0 1 0 1 the large medium and small scale networks have 36 21 and 9 in situ stations respectively the in situ station distribution density increases with decreasing network scale this study evaluated the accuracy of fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals against different scale in situ measurements at the ctp smtmn network the corresponding error parameters are plotted in fig 19 the validation results indicated that the accuracy gradually improved as the density of the in situ station increased in comparison the fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals expressed the best fitting degree to the small network accompanied by higher goodness of fit and smaller errors fengyun 3b a displayed superior performance therefore it is deduced that with the increase in spatial monitoring density the matching degree between point and pixel scale values improves so does the verification accuracy this phenomenon is observed in the ctp smtmn region which is dominantly covered by alpine meadow fig 18 a it is suggested that the relative denser in situ stations would achieve more remarkable improvement at the pixel that is composed of various vegetation types and has obvious inner heterogeneity this section shows that the spatial representativeness of ground observations could affect the accuracy of soil moisture product evaluation in an effort to solve this problem various algorithms have been implemented to realize point data upscaling some scholars have attempted to create thiessen polygons to recalculate in situ values using weights determined by the fraction of area covered by their thiessen polygons bindlish et al 2018 colliander et al 2017 fang et al 2018 this upscaling approach could produce reasonable in situ values by considering the area weight moreover classic spatial interpolation methods i e kriging interpolation spline interpolation and inverse distance weighted interpolation and artificial intelligence methods i e random forest extreme gradient boosting and recurrent neural network were also applied in the upscaling of point scale dataset clewley et al 2017 gruber et al 2020 mohanty et al 2017 qin et al 2013 however rigorously designed experiments and comprehensive analysis are required to determine the performance of each method 4 discussion the fengyun 3b and 3c soil moisture estimations were retrieved from the x band mwri for global drought monitoring the fengyun 3 series of soil moisture measurements has received some attention since its inception the soil moisture was evaluated by fengyun 3c using in situ measurements in henan province china the results suggested that the performance of fengyun 3c soil moisture generally decreased with increasing ground vegetation water content zhu et al 2019 sun et al 2017 compared soil moisture products from the fengyun 3b and cma land assimilation system over china and the two datasets exhibited analogous distribution and good correlation song and jia 2016 proposed a method for downscaling fengyun 3b soil moisture from 25 km to 1 km using the theory of apparent thermal inertia the results revealed that this method could be effectively applied to bare surfaces and sparsely vegetated land surfaces given that the fengyun 3 soil moisture is mostly assessed based on case studies in mainland china song and jia 2016 sun et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 there is a deficiency in quantitative evaluation of fengyun 3 soil moisture datasets under diverse underlying surface conditions and spatial distribution scales across different continents hence in this study an assessment was performed to determine the accuracy level and fitting degree of fengyun 3 soil moisture against in situ measurements globally a series of verifications were performed to demonstrate the spatiotemporal completeness and accuracy of the fengyun 3 soil moisture products the evaluation results indicated the following 1 the fengyun 3b a reveals a slightly higher spatial coverage percentage than the others densely observed regions were mainly concentrated at 20 60 n and 20 50 s in summer 2 all the fengyun 3 soil moisture products could display good performance in fitting the dynamics and values of the in situ measurements in the northern hemisphere while further corrections would be needed to improve data quality because most results do not achieve the ideal ubrmsd value 0 04 m3 m3 3 this study explores the correlation of soil moisture retrievals to ndvi lst and precipitation as the seasons change the results would be expected to offer a promising opportunity and regularity for fengyun 3 soil moisture correction 4 this study compares the performance of fengyun 3 soil moisture using multi scale in situ measurements in the same network the small scale with densely distributed stations achieves better validation accuracy than others proving the superiority of dense networks in representing regional soil moisture conditions compared with the existing studies this study systematically verified the completeness and accuracy of all available fengyun 3 satellites retrieved soil moisture retrievals we analyzed their accuracy characteristics under diverse underlying surfaces and seasons and found that both vod and lst impacted the errors which may serve as a useful reference for further data calibration in view of the current accuracy level and prevalent gap regions fengyun 3 soil moisture products must progress significantly before they can steadily correct bias and improve spatial coverage apart from vod veil of ice and relative motion between satellite revolution and earth rotation the rfi can be a critical reason that leads to outliers as well as gap regions in the satellite retrieved soil moisture products in fact direct broadcast and communication satellites especially around europe and japan cause considerable rfi above the 10 6 10 7 ghz band namely the x band draper 2018 zou et al 2013 effective rejection devices and algorithms are required to avoid the rfi in the x band numerous techniques have been used to mitigate rfi at microwave bands for instance the smap radiometer uses both on board and ground multiple signal detectors with digital signal processing algorithms for rfi mitigation in the l band centered at 1 41 ghz piepmeier et al 2014 the quality of smap has been validated by numerous studies the results proved the good performance of smap in accurately fitting the value and dynamics of in situ measurements chan et al 2018 liu and yang 2020 ma et al 2019 stillman and zeng 2018 the l band penetration depth can be close to 5 cm which is analogous to the measuring depth of ground observations in comparison in terms of different soil attributes the effective penetration depth of the x band is 0 1 cm observation depth mismatch would induce some error in the soil moisture product evaluation since the top soil layer could be typically drier than the deeper layer bindlish et al 2018 the esa cci sm as remotely sensed soil moisture products with the longest time series to date has been assessed by a host of experiments conducted globally chakravorty et al 2016 dorigo et al 2015 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 this multi band microwave retrievals combined with soil moisture products achieved a favorable correlation to in situ measurements and improved understanding of long term dynamics in coupled land surface hydrology and energy cycles dorigo et al 2017 compared to the single microwave band the combination of diverse microwave band signals from different satellites usually means more transit times within a day and better day scale representativeness hence it is suggested that constructing a fengyun 3 satellite network would be an efficient way to enhance the day scale land surface signal detection capability meanwhile new satellites such as fengyun 2h and fengyun 3d have been launched recently which could be promising for continuously retrieving sufficient soil moisture datasets minnett et al 2019 among the four selected in situ measurements three were located in the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere and the other one is situated in the middle latitude of the southern hemisphere the limited numbers and relatively concentrated locations of the in situ measurements may impact the evaluation outcomes the accuracy of fengyun 3 soil moisture products in different climates and underlying surfaces combined regions could be diverse moreover the influence derived from rfi can be irregular and unpredictable and would significantly affect the quality of fengyun 3 soil moisture globally therefore the spatial representativeness of the evaluation outcomes must be further enhanced through large scale distributed in situ measurements in the future 5 conclusions in this study the soil moisture retrieval data derived from fengyun 3 satellites were evaluated using the in situ measurements collected from four networks situated in different land cover and climate zones some new contributions were made compared to previous soil moisture evaluation studies first the spatial temporal integrity was intuitively displayed and analyzed which clarified the evolution patterns of the spatial temporal completeness of fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals second the in situ station based verification results indicated that the fengyun 3 soil moisture products achieved a good performance in fitting the dynamics and values of in situ measurements a relatively dense network exhibits superior representativeness and reliability in verification furthermore the fengyun 3 soil moisture could positively respond to the precipitation process and the memory of soil moisture to precipitation could last for at least 5 days third it was found that the bias in oznet was significantly positive for ndvi and negative for lst which could act as a valuable reference in fengyun 3 soil moisture rectification in the southern hemisphere in the future moreover the fengyun 3 soil moisture always overestimates in situ measurements with increasing vod overall the results and analysis of this study are helpful for understanding the quality of current fengyun 3 soil moisture products and can serve as a reference

4857,soil moisture plays a pivotal role in terrestrial water circulation energy transfer and mass exchange the x band radiometer on board fengyun 3b and 3c satellites have been used for soil moisture retrieval since 2011 in this study the spatial and temporal integrity of all available fengyun 3 series soil moisture products were evaluated and the data accuracy was validated against four in situ measurements ascertained globally the validation results reveal that 1 the ascending fengyun 3b soil moisture retrievals express higher spatial coverage percentages than others and a higher temporal coverage percentage appears at 20 60 n and 20 50 s in summer 2 the soil moisture products derived from both fengyun 3b and 3c satellites reveal superior goodness of fit and smaller bias in the northern hemisphere in situ measurements than in the southern hemisphere in particular the satellite retrieved pixel scale soil moisture datasets possesses a better correlation to small scale networks with densely distributed stations in the southern hemisphere the bias was positively correlated with the vegetation index and negatively correlated to land surface temperature and this regularity may act as a reference for fengyun 3 soil moisture correction moreover the fengyun 3 soil moisture products reveal positive responses to precipitation and the memory of soil moisture to precipitation could last for at least 5 days 3 the x band signals were gradually impacted by increasing vegetation optical depth leading to obvious overestimations further corrections including hardware and software are urgently required to enhance the anti interference and robustness of the x band signal keywords fengyun 3 satellites soil moisture integrity accuracy evaluation 1 introduction soil moisture is prevalently recognized as a critical parameter in various earth science study fields such as agriculture engman 1991 climatology rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 ecology robinson et al 2008 hydrology wanders et al 2014 and meteorology koster et al 2004 acquisition of a soil moisture dataset with favorable quality is crucial to satisfy the research requirements in the aforementioned fields in recent decades significant effort has been devoted to measuring soil moisture satellite borne sensors have exhibited excellent performance in obtaining global scale soil moisture with good spatial representativeness cai et al 2007 denmead and shaw 1962 jackson et al 1982 leng et al 2017 2019 robock et al 2000 spennemann et al 2015 tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 a large variety of studies has proven that the microwave spectrum is suitable for retrieving soil moisture because of the sensitivity of microwave bandwidth to the variation of soil dielectric constant caused by soil water change gonzález zamora et al 2018 jackson et al 1996 further according to the working mode of the sensor remotely sensed soil moisture can be derived from the brightness temperature through passive radiometer sensors and from the radar backscatter coefficient through active radar sensors dorigo and de jeu 2016 zhang et al 2019 in contrast to active microwave sensors passive microwave sensors usually have shorter revisit periods simpler data processing steps and less sensitivity to surface roughness and vegetation cover all of which are more suitable for large scale soil moisture estimation kim et al 2018 among the microwave spectrums the x band centered at 10 65 ghz has illustrated good capability in the estimation of soil moisture with an accuracy ranging from 3 to 6 vol aubert et al 2011 hajj et al 2016 for instance the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e utilized x band signals in horizontal h and vertical v polarizations to retrieve 25 km spatial resolution soil moisture njoku et al 2003 since its inception the soil moisture data obtained via the amsr e has been widely evaluated worldwide and has been applied in surface hydrological studies chen et al 2013 im et al 2016 rüdiger et al 2009 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 as the successor of amsr e continued to retrieve soil moisture in the x band and a neighboring c band centered at 7 3 ghz was added to improve radio frequency interference rfi mitigation parinussa et al 2013 similarly amsr2 soil moisture has undergone comprehensive validation and has been used in simulation processes and scale conversions by scholars in related fields bindlish et al 2018 kwon et al 2018 santi et al 2018 the coriolis windsat datasets combining x band k band centered at 18 7 ghz and ka band centered at 37 ghz to retrieve soil moisture displayed significant improvement over amsr e li et al 2010 the tropical rainfall measuring mission microwave imager trmm tmi was used to map daily soil moisture through dual polarization observations in the x band the evaluation results of data acquired from the region over the us southern great plains proved that trmm tmi soil moisture retrievals could compare well with the in situ measurements bindlish et al 2003 drusch et al 2005 in addition the european space agency climate change initiative soil moisture esa cci sm that merged a host of microwave band including x band soil moisture retrievals has effectively advanced our understanding of earth system processes and climate change dorigo et al 2017 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa launched the soil moisture operational products system smops to provide a seamless soil moisture map of the globe by merging soil moisture products from six satellites since march 2017 wang et al 2021 furthermore recently the l band centered at 1 41 ghz revealed superior ability in land surface soil water content retrieval the outstanding performance of l band derived soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture has been testified globally ma et al 2019 in addition to satellite based soil moisture products data assimilation is also an important way to acquire soil moisture retrievals in comparison satellite based soil moisture products are derived from remotely sensed signals through a radiative transfer equation while data assimilation methods bring a host of ground observed and satellite received datasets into the assimilation model to obtain soil moisture reichle et al 2009 numerous soil moisture retrievals derived from assimilation models have been broadly applied in hydrological process analysis and climate change prediction chen et al 2013 spennemann et al 2015 sun et al 2016 apart from the above mentioned soil moisture retrievals the national satellite meteorological centre nsmc of the china meteorological administration cma developed and launched the fengyun 3 series satellites to monitor global land surface parameters which included soil moisture as a key parameter dong and zou 2019 xu et al 2016 fengyun 3 series satellites were the second generation of polar orbit meteorological satellites in china which contained four satellites namely fengyun 3a 3b 3c and 3d the micro wave radiation imager mwri was a passive microwave based instrument on board the fengyun 3 series satellites that had five frequencies centered at 10 65 18 7 23 8 36 5 and 89 ghz and 10 channels and land surface soil moisture was retrieved using x band 10 65 ghz echo signals from mwri with v and h polarizations the fengyun 3 soil moisture dataset released by nsmc was estimated using a modified single channel algorithm jackson 1993 in particular the surface emission model was applied to rectify impacts induced by surface roughness and the brightness temperatures of both v and h polarizations were used to retrieve soil moisture parinussa et al parinussa et al 2014 attempted to employ the land parameter retrieval model lprm to the mwri accepted signals to retrieve more reliable soil moisture detailed information about the lprm algorithm can be seen in de jeu et al 2009 a host of satellite based soil moisture datasets derived from the x k ka and l bands have been evaluated using well designed experiments and they were found to exhibit promising capability in fitting the values and dynamics of the in situ measurements worldwide albergel et al 2012 2009 dorigo et al 2017 liu and yang 2020 liu et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 however few studies have focused on remotely sensed soil moisture derived from the fengyun 3 satellites the fengyun 3 satellites not only serve the china meteorological department but also provide a series of meteorological products for over 2 600 users in 90 countries furthermore the world meteorological organization wmo has already brought them into the global operational application of meteorological satellite sequences which is an important member of the global integrated earth observation system in addition the fengyun 3 satellites play a vital role in the formation and implementation of international drought and flood disaster early warning and emergency rescue programs recently the fengyun 3c soil moisture products were validated using in situ data in the henan province china zhu et al 2019 however the verification was conducted for only one land cover type cropland with a single temperate monsoon climate a rigorous evaluation must contain multiple vegetation and climate conditions bi et al 2016 jackson et al 2012 the reliability and accuracy of soil water content must be comprehensively and objectively evaluated before applying them in practice among the four types of fengyun 3 satellites 3a 3b 3c and 3d the x band mwri onboard fengyun 3b and 3c were designed to retrieve land surface soil moisture therefore in this study the accuracy of fengyun 3b and 3c soil moisture estimations were evaluated using four networks across the globe meanwhile inter comparisons are performed to illuminate the divergence between ascending and descending retrievals and between fengyun 3b and fengyun 3c satellite retrieved datasets this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the case study areas fengyun 3 soil moisture datasets in situ measurements and ancillary datasets used in this study in addition section 2 introduces the data pre processing method and error parameters employed for soil moisture evaluation section 3 describes the evaluation results of fengyun 3 soil moisture against in situ measurements under different case study areas and the correlations between soil moisture and underlying surface properties in section 4 we discuss the possible reasons that may lead to different spatial and temporal evaluation accuracies the conclusions of this study are presented in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 study areas and in situ measurements this study investigates the performance of fengyun 3 satellites retrieved soil moisture products in fitting in situ measurements for multiple underlying surfaces four soil moisture monitor networks with stable long time series in situ measured data and representative physical geography background were selected for this research as depicted in fig 1 the little washita watershed lww network is located in the southwest oklahoma in the great plains region of the united states u s the remedhus network is situated in the northern part of the iberian peninsula soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central tibetan plateau ctp smtmn network lies in the naqu basin in a flat terrain with rolling hills at an average elevation of 4 500 m above mean sea level oznet network is on mountainous and coastal plains of south eastern australia these four rigorously designed networks are acknowledged for their reliable data quality and broad applications in soil moisture retrieval evaluations and hydrological model calibrations leroux et al 2014 liu et al 2020 2018 sanchez et al 2012 su et al 2011 the ctp smtmn is a valuable network because of its crucial role in understanding soil moisture variations in the tibetan plateau which is the regulator of climate change in the northern hemisphere both the lww and remedhus networks are distributed in the planting area but with quite different climate types it is imperative to illustrate seasonal soil moisture evolution patterns in the crop planting area the oznet was employed to clarify the quality of the fengyun 3 satellites retrieved soil moisture products in the southern hemisphere fig 2 illustrates the available time period of fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals and in situ measurements used in this study information about each network is detailed as follows and the main characteristics used in this study are listed in table 1 2 1 1 lww network the lww network was established by the agricultural research service sgrazinglands research laboratory of the u s department of agriculture in 1961 this region has a temperate climate and is covered majorly by grasslands peel et al 2007 the lww which could provide valuable measured soil moisture data has been broadly employed in hydrometeorological research owing to the remarkable seasonal dynamics of soil moisture and flat terrain this network has been extensively used to verify the quality of satellite retrieved and scale transformed soil moisture products jackson et al 2012 leroux et al 2014 zeng et al 2016 there are 20 densely distributed stations that monitor the meteorological conditions and soil moisture every 5 min in particular the soil moisture was monitored at depths of 5 10 15 and 30 cm given the penetration limitation of the x band mwri the top layer records of lww are utilized in this study to carry out assessment 2 1 2 remedhus network remedhus is a dense network set up in spain sanchez et al 2012 it is based in a region having a typical temperate marine climate with sufficient precipitation and the maximum and minimum elevations of this region are approximately 900 and 700 m respectively as the rainfall is mainly concentrated in winter the soil moisture was relatively high in winter and low in summer the remedhus network currently has 24 sites and 22 of them with long time series data records are utilized in this study in addition most of the stations are arranged in croplands suggesting that the institution attaches great importance to the plant products industry the remedhus network measures soil moisture through hydrologic probes at 0 5 cm on an hourly basis since 2005 apart from its application in soil moisture verification it has also been widely used for hydrological model calibrations sánchez et al 2010 2 1 3 ctp smtmn network the ctp smtmn network is located in a flat terrain with rolling hills in the central tibetan plateau su et al 2011 it has a typical cold and semiarid climate and an average elevation of 4 500 m all 57 stations were arranged in the dominant alpine meadow to monitor soil moisture at 0 5 10 20 and 40 cm depths through the ec tm and 5tm capacitance probes kizito et al 2008 the soil moisture measured at 0 5 cm was used in this study for evaluation considering the particularities in the climate and ecological fragility of the tibetan plateau the ctp smtmn network has been treated as a critical region for validating the accuracy level of various soil moisture products chen et al 2013 liu et al 2018 velde et al 2014 yang et al 2013 therefore this network was selected to systematically validate the applicability of fengyun 3 soil moisture data in expressing the soil moisture on the tibetan plateau ranging from residual to saturated 2 1 4 oznet network the oznet is a sparse hydrological monitoring network for soil moisture and micrometeorology situated in the maritime monsoon climate area of the mullenbiki river basin in south eastern australia smith et al 2012 in this network 24 of the 27 employed stations are situated less than 500 m above sea level and the other three sites are located at 500 1000 m above sea level the hourly soil moisture is monitored at depth of 0 5 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm and the 0 5 cm soil moisture data was adopted for study the oznet network greatly contributed to supporting land surface hydrological characteristics and ecological status analysis in the southern hemisphere through the continuous measurement of soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation liu et al 2018 mei et al 2016 peischl et al 2012 senanayake et al 2019 hence the oznet network in situ measurements were selected as the theoretical truth values to assess the performance of fengyun 3 soil moisture in the southern hemisphere 2 2 fengyun 3 satellites retrieved soil moisture the fengyun 3b and 3c satellites were launched by the nsmc of the cma to monitor surface environmental elements the mwri sensors onboard the fengyun 3b and 3c satellites are highly sensitive passive microwave radiometers operating at 10 65 18 7 23 8 36 5 and 89 ghz of which the 10 65 ghz signals are used to retrieve soil moisture the fengyun 3b satellite scans the earth s surface in an ascending orbit at 1 40p m local solar time and in descending orbit at 1 40 a m local solar time in comparison the fengyun 3c satellite passes in the ascending and descending orbits at 10 00p m and 10 00 a m local time respectively the fengyun 3b soil moisture products are available from 12th july 2011 to 19th august 2019 and currently the fengyun 3c provides soil moisture products from 29th may 2014 to 3rd february 2020 the fengyun 3 series soil moisture products were retrieved from a modified algorithm of the amsr e soil moisture retrieval method according to shi et al 2006 using the brightness temperature datasets for further details about the retrieving algorithm of fengyun 3 soil moisture readers may refer to zhu et al 2019 notwithstanding that fengyun 3 soil moisture is derived from the same algorithm globally the data accuracy could have evident regional heterogeneity in terms of properties of the underlying surface which vary significantly among multiple hydrothermal combinations and land cover types moreover because momentary scanning signals are expected to represent the soil moisture reality of an entire day it may be assumed that different satellite passing times could also induce accuracy level differences therefore in this study the volumetric water content daily scale including ascending and descending 25 km spatial resolution fengyun 3b and 3c soil moisture datasets were evaluated under different underlying surfaces and the datasets were acquired from the nsmc fengyun satellite data center http satellite nsmc org cn 2 3 ancillary datasets a host of research has demonstrated the interactional relationships between soil moisture and land surface parameters such as precipitation koster et al 2004 temperature mohseni and mokhtarzade 2020 and vegetation index chen et al 2014 it is assumed that a potential correlation may exist between fengyun 3 soil moisture accuracy and these parameters hence precipitation land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi datasets were employed to explore their relationships with soil moisture accuracy tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 precipitation estimates huffman et al 2007 were adopted in this study lst and ndvi were derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land products version 6 justice et al 1998 the spatial resolution and projection of the ancillary datasets were unified to the corresponding properties of the fengyun 3 soil moisture datasets the temporal resolution of precipitation was resampled to the daily scale by calculating the sum of the 3 hour value within a day meanwhile although precipitation processes had a marked impact on surface soil moisture we did not eliminate rainy days during the validation in an attempt to clarify the capability of fengyun 3 soil moisture datasets in responding to precipitation events the main information of the aforementioned parameters used in this study is listed in table 2 2 4 methods this study assessed both the ascending and descending retrieved soil moisture from fengyun 3b and 3c satellites across the diverse underlying surfaces described above considering that the effective penetration depth of x band is approximately 0 1 cm cui et al 2017 mei et al 2017 the in situ measured top layer soil moisture records were chosen to try to match in depth in addition this study aimed to quantify the agreement level between the fengyun 3 soil moisture and in situ measurements on a daily scale hence hourly and sub hourly monitored in situ measurements were averaged to represent the daily situation meanwhile in an effort to maintain stability and reliability only in situ records covering 12 h within a day can be treated as valid data and used for express daily value by calculating arithmetic means liu et al 2018 we used a day timescale rather than the moment when the satellites transit measured in situ values to evaluate the satellite derived soil moisture products the instantaneous transit satellite derived soil moisture products are expected to effectively present the daily dynamics of in situ measured data and carry out drought and flood monitoring furthermore exploration of the day timescale representation differences between ascending and descending time retrieved soil moisture products is a promising avenue of research in order to optimize hydrological model construction and process analysis in addition to the accuracy evaluation we also attempted to explore the applicability characteristics of different scale in situ measurements in verifying coarse resolution soil moisture retrievals in the ctp smtmn network among the four employed networks the average values of stations located in the same pixel were calculated to represent the soil moisture condition of this pixel covered region for dense networks there are usually more than four sites within a pixel whereas for sparse networks most stations were separately situated in a pixel to conduct an objective and systematic evaluation the correlation coefficient r bias root mean square error rmse and unbiased root mean square deviation ubrmsd were selected to jointly validate the quality of fengyun 3 soil moisture here r is a statistical index designed by the statistician carl pearson which is an efficient indicator of the linear correlation between variables taylor 1990 the bias is used to precisely describe the level of overestimation underestimation through positive negative values the rmse can quantify the degree of dispersion of the predictions the ubrmsd represents the difference in standard deviation between the satellite retrievals and observations in particular satellite based sm retrievals are expected to achieve a target accuracy of ubrmsd 0 04 m3 m3 which is defined by the soil moisture and ocean salinity kerr et al 2001 and smap entekhabi et al 2010 therefore the four error metrics could be employed to thoroughly analyze the capability of fengyun 3 soil moisture in fitting in situ measurements among various underlying surfaces in this study r was used to measure the agreement of temporal dynamics between two datasets hence the r value was expected to be high when the regional land surface soil moisture seasonality fluctuation could be precisely captured by fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals the bias described the error condition through positive and negative values and rmse reflected the degree of deviation therefore an accurate satellite based soil moisture product should have a bias and rmse close to zero as much as possible the ubrmsd depicted the probability density distribution difference between fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals and in situ measurements their equations are as follows 1 r i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 bias i 1 n x i i 1 n y i n 3 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 4 ubrmsd i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n where x i x y i and y represent the fengyun 3 soil moisture values at pixel i arithmetic means of all the fengyun 3 soil moisture pixels in situ measurement value at station i and averaged value of all the in situ measurements values respectively in addition to accuracy validation against in situ measurements cross correlation was utilized in this study to demonstrate the temporal variation of correlation before and after the precipitation processes the formula for the calculation of cross correlation is listed in equation 5 for further details about cross correlation readers can refer to podobnik and stanley 2008 yoo and han 2009 5 cross c o r r e l a t i o n n x n k y n where x is the soil moisture dataset from in situ measurements and feng 3 satellites y is the complex conjugate of precipitation n is the x array length and k is the number of lag days 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal soil moisture completeness previous studies have proposed that spatial and temporal data availability could be a critical component in the quality evaluation of the datasets retrieved from the satellite dorigo et al 2017 2015 therefore the data completeness over space and time was analyzed first as illustrated in fig 3 the valid soil moisture percentages derived from fengyun 3b and 3c satellites through ascending and descending orbits manifested similarity in spatial distribution throughout the entire available period in particular fengyun 3b a revealed a slightly higher coverage percentage than the others it can be clearly observed that regions located in the middle and low latitude zones with mild elevations were densely observed 50 such as africa australia india western europe eastern china central america and argentina in contrast the observations were relatively sparse less than40 at high latitudes and high altitude areas such as the tibetan plateau brazilian central plateau canada and siberia this phenomenon could mainly be due to ice snow cover or soil temperature below zero during the long freezing winter in addition to the spatial density heterogeneity the temporal evolutionary trends of observation percentages are presented in fig 4 for temporal completeness validation a pronounced seasonal cycle of percentage evolution was observed especially in winter when microwave signals were obstructed by frozen soil densely observed regions were mainly concentrated at 20 60 n and 20 50 s in summer which were basically in accordance with the conditions identified in fig 3 although each soil moisture product was retrieved from the same x band signal with a constant sensor crossing time and retrieval algorithm a few differences existed in the same season for different years because of varying rfi and vegetation canopy conditions owe et al 2001 piepmeier et al 2013 zou et al 2013 in addition as shown in fig 4 c and d a long strip gap appeared in the fengyun 3c soil moisture retrievals in june 2015 which was a result of sensor technical problems and downtime maintenance 3 2 in situ measurements based validation in situ measurements based validation is an essential part of verifying the satellite based soil moisture data the error metrics of each pixel were calculated and the accuracy results of all pixels formed an array table 3 lists the valid days for evaluation from different fengyun 3 satellites in each network the lww had the most valid days whereas the ctp smtmn had the least valid days because of the great thermal difference between day and night at the ctp smtmn the surface temperature often drops below zero even in summer as a result both fengyun 3b d and fengyun 3c a scanning the earth surface at midnight only recorded dozens of valid days at the ctp smtmn in terms of different soil moisture retrievals fengyun 3b a revealed a significant advantage in acquiring valid data followed by fengyun 3c d and fengyun 3b d ranked last this phenomenon suggests that the satellites that transit during daytime tend to receive more valid signals than night time transit satellites the accuracy evaluations were conducted through the corresponding overlapped periods and the results are clearly presented by boxplots in figs 5 8 boxplots are efficient and effective ways to visualize the properties of ensembles which have been employed in many applications mirzargar et al 2014 the horizontal solid lines from top to bottom express the maximum first quartile median third quartile and minimum values the horizontal dotted line represents the average and the red dots indicate potential outliers in this study the statistical properties of r bias rmse and ubrmsd were obtained using boxplots as displayed in figs 5 8 there was a pronounced variation in accuracy levels between and within the four networks in terms of different networks the validation results revealed favorable performances with high r and small rmse at the lww remedhus and ctp smtmn networks in specific the fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals obtained superior r 0 7 on average in the ctp smtmn network and a relatively small value error in the remedhus network in addition varying degrees of overestimations were observed except for the remedhus network however accompanied by low correlation and significant deviation it appeared that the fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals failed in fitting in situ measurements at the oznet network this phenomenon may indicate that the capability of fengyun 3 to correctly detect the top layer soil water content in the southern hemisphere requires further improvement therefore it is deduced that the fengyun 3 soil moisture products could favorably fit the dynamics of in situ data at polar regions and the smallest error reflected by bias can be achieved in the remedhus region in comparison the overestimation condition exists in the lww network which has a temperate climate with relatively sufficient precipitation the non ideal performance at the oznet may suggest that the soil moisture retrieval and correction algorithms in this region require further improvement the performance of the four kinds of fengyun 3 soil moisture products were to some extent aligned with each other because they were acquired from the same x band mwri and retrieval algorithms meanwhile it could be deduced that the different accuracy levels within each network mainly originated from different satellite transit times in particular the fengyun 3b a localequatorialcrossingtime was 1 40p m soil moisture retrievals expressed slightly better precision along with a higher fitting degree and smaller error therefore it was primarily summarized that the daytime derived products could be more competent in accurately representing day scale ground soil moisture than the nighttime ones in addition similar conclusions have been reached by a multitude of previous studies brocca et al 2011 chen et al 2013 liu et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 however the soil moisture retrieval algorithms generally assumed that the temperature between the land surface and the canopy could be less at night than during the day which was supposed to be a beneficial situation in accurately retrieving soil moisture it was argued that the vegetation became more transparent as a result of the relatively high temperature in the daytime and therefore the quality of the ascending passes mat is improved brocca et al 2011 we believe that further analysis must be performed on the mechanism for the soil moisture retrievals in order to understand the rule of accuracy in areas with different vegetation cover densities and the quality difference between daytime and nighttime 3 3 error correlation to land surface parameters ndvi and lst are two critical land surface parameters that have bidirectional interactive responses to soil moisture vegetation roots absorb water from the soil for transpiration and photosynthesis leading to a decrease in soil moisture meanwhile net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate decrease due to the rise in mesophyll resistance resulting from drying of the soil ndvi is responsive to changes in the chlorophyll content which means that higher ndvi values reflect greater photosynthetic capacity of the vegetation canopy whereas lower ndvi values reflect the degradation of chlorophyll content gu et al 2008 when root zone soil water content available for the vegetation becomes exhausted both evapotranspiration and photosynthesis are reduced and the temperature of the vegetation surface increases soer 1980 in addition because of their close relationship with soil moisture ndvi and lst have been extensively used in soil moisture simulation and drought monitoring bai et al 2019 kogan 1995 mallick et al 2009 sung gon et al 2009 therefore there may exist potential links between the accuracy of fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals and these two land surface parameters figs 9 10 display the scatterplots between fengyun 3 soil moisture bias and ndvi and lst across the four case study regions in fig 9 r was not significant in the cases of lww and remedhus however the ndvi was positively and remarkably correlated to soil moisture bias in ctp smtmn and oznet and bias from the ascending retrievals exhibited more significant goodness of fit to ndvi than the corresponding descending retrievals it was thought that the bias may vary regularly according to vegetation optical depth vod under natural conditions whereas artificial interventions i e irrigation and harvest in pasture and cropland can interfere with this regular pattern with varying degrees furthermore the vegetation canopy attenuated signals from soil surfaces which reduced the sensitivity of brightness temperature to soil moisture hence corrections of errors from diverse vegetation coverage types are crucial for acquiring robust and accurate soil moisture retrievals in terms of lst the bias appeared not to be significantly correlated to lst in the northern hemisphere case study regions in contrast the correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between the bias and lst in the southern hemisphere case study region therefore it was suggested that the accuracy of fengyun 3 soil moisture would likely be improved after rigorous and systematic corrections of the perturbing factors vegetation and surface temperature in the retrieval model especially in oznet and ctp smtmn regions 3 4 temporal responses to precipitation and vegetation condition several researchers have explored soil moisture precipitation feedback and demonstrated the promotion effect of precipitation on the rise of soil moisture qiu et al 2016 spennemann et al 2015 tuttle and salvucci 2016 yang et al 2018 in an effort to determine the response and memory of fengyun 3 soil moisutre to rainfall seasonal variations in soil moisture and precipitation from july 2011 to december 2019 were analyzed as depicted in fig 11 b c and d soil moisture exhibited a significant interannual fluctuation cycle varying from residual to saturated which was driven primarily by evapotranspiration and precipitation however the periodic regularity was not equally significant in the lww network this phenomenon was supposed to be deduced by sufficient artificial irrigation which could ensure the continuous growth of pasture satellite based soil moisture was absent in the ctp smtmn network in winter when the surface soil was frozen and there was a huge microwave spectrum difference between ice and liquid water zhang et al 2003 zhang and armstrong 2001 both the ascending and descending soil moisture retrievals from fengyun 3b and 3c presented analogous evolution trends the fengyun 3 derived soil moisture could represent values and temporal dynamics of in situ measurements with favorable performances except for the oznet network where obvious overestimations generally existed section 3 2 illustrates the overall estimated biases and uncertainties across different case study regions however considering that remotely sensed soil moisture can be markedly impacted by vegetation coverage and evapotranspiration the data accuracy is expected to vary strongly in time series gruber et al 2020 2019 zwieback et al 2018 the temporal accuracy regularity is critical in evaluating the reliability and robustness of a soil moisture product during a specific season fig 12 presents the time series bias of fengyun 3 soil moisture and ndvi and the evolution tendency revealed significant correlation to seasonal variation it was observed that the fengyun 3 data always overestimated in situ measurements during the vegetation growing season when there was proper temperature and precipitation or artificial irrigation previous studies have investigated the reasons that lead to errors in satellite retrieved soil moisture ma et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 vegetation conditions were proven to have an evident impact on the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval the microwave signals from surface soil could decrease because of the vegetation canopy which subsequently reduced the sensitivity of brightness to soil moisture zhu et al 2019 therefore the vegetation correction procedure played a critical role in the accurate retrieval of soil moisture data through microwave radiative transfer models in particular the vod revealed a positive correlation with the bias of microwave band derived surface temperature products originating from brightness temperature ma et al 2019 which was consistent with the overestimation condition shown in fig 12 a c currently the fengyun 3 soil moisture algorithm uses vegetation water content vwc as a proxy to present the vod in this study the ndvi was used to present vegetation conditions as the vwc used in fengyun 3 soil moisture retrieval was unavailable according to existing research the vwc could significantly affect the microwave radiative transfer and reliability of retrieved soil moisture in the c and x band calvet et al 2010 in addition a high vwc 0 3 kg m2 that had relatively dense canopies could attenuate the correlation between microwave signal and land surface soil moisture wagner et al 2007 in terms of the southern hemisphere fig 12 d the bias expressed violent overestimation fluctuations suggesting prevalent uncertainties of the echo signal besides the fitting degree between in situ records and fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals it is equally meaningful to discuss the capability of satellite based soil moisture in responding to the promoting effect of rainfall during a precipitation event under molecular capillary and gravitational forces the rain infiltrates into the pores of the soil and replenishes soil water content the top layer soil moisture increases rapidly and then decreases gradually the infiltration rate could be influenced by precipitation characteristics soil texture land cover and topography therefore it is suggested that the correlation between rainfall and soil moisture may change notably on different underlying surfaces moreover in terms of various infiltration rates there could be different lags in the four case study areas the temporal cross correlations between precipitation and soil moisture from different sources in every network are displayed in figs 13 17 the cross correlations changed considerably for the four selected regions for instance in ctp smtmn fig 13 a where precipitation was dominant in soil water recharge sources the cross correlations were significantly higher than that of the others in contrast in the mediterranean climate zone rainfall could be scarce in the growing season and artificial irrigation played a pivotal role in adjusting soil moisture to promote crop growth as illustrated in fig 13 b the cross correlations remained relatively low even after rainfall indicating that the change in soil moisture can be regulated by many factors such as vegetation status human activities rainfall and variations in soil properties caused by fertilization it can be observed from figs 14 17 that the fengyun 3 derived soil moisture revealed positive responses to rainfall events and their cross correlation dynamics were similar to those obtained from in situ measurements fig 13 this high similarity proved the competence of momentary scanned signal retrieved soil moisture in depicting the daily situation of hourly or sub hourly monitored records their cross correlations could immediately increase on the day when precipitation occurred the cross correlations usually achieved the maximum values with 1 2 days lag after the rain then presented gradual daily decline the soil moisture memory owing to precipitation could last for at least 5 days meanwhile cross correlations quickly increased at first and then gradually decreased to the level before rain in comparison cross correlations from fengyun 3b a exhibited a superior degree of fit to the values and dynamics of cross correlations from in situ measurements 3 5 performances of different scale in situ measurements few studies have investigated the degree to which spatial collocation mismatches contributes to validated accuracy gruber et al 2020 we compared and analyzed the performances of different scale in situ measurements to clarify their characteristics in depicting the accuracy of satellite soil moisture retrievals as depicted in fig 18 the ctp smtmn is a multi scale soil moisture network that measures hourly soil moisture in large medium and small scales with spatial extents of 1 0 1 0 0 3 0 3 and 0 1 0 1 the large medium and small scale networks have 36 21 and 9 in situ stations respectively the in situ station distribution density increases with decreasing network scale this study evaluated the accuracy of fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals against different scale in situ measurements at the ctp smtmn network the corresponding error parameters are plotted in fig 19 the validation results indicated that the accuracy gradually improved as the density of the in situ station increased in comparison the fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals expressed the best fitting degree to the small network accompanied by higher goodness of fit and smaller errors fengyun 3b a displayed superior performance therefore it is deduced that with the increase in spatial monitoring density the matching degree between point and pixel scale values improves so does the verification accuracy this phenomenon is observed in the ctp smtmn region which is dominantly covered by alpine meadow fig 18 a it is suggested that the relative denser in situ stations would achieve more remarkable improvement at the pixel that is composed of various vegetation types and has obvious inner heterogeneity this section shows that the spatial representativeness of ground observations could affect the accuracy of soil moisture product evaluation in an effort to solve this problem various algorithms have been implemented to realize point data upscaling some scholars have attempted to create thiessen polygons to recalculate in situ values using weights determined by the fraction of area covered by their thiessen polygons bindlish et al 2018 colliander et al 2017 fang et al 2018 this upscaling approach could produce reasonable in situ values by considering the area weight moreover classic spatial interpolation methods i e kriging interpolation spline interpolation and inverse distance weighted interpolation and artificial intelligence methods i e random forest extreme gradient boosting and recurrent neural network were also applied in the upscaling of point scale dataset clewley et al 2017 gruber et al 2020 mohanty et al 2017 qin et al 2013 however rigorously designed experiments and comprehensive analysis are required to determine the performance of each method 4 discussion the fengyun 3b and 3c soil moisture estimations were retrieved from the x band mwri for global drought monitoring the fengyun 3 series of soil moisture measurements has received some attention since its inception the soil moisture was evaluated by fengyun 3c using in situ measurements in henan province china the results suggested that the performance of fengyun 3c soil moisture generally decreased with increasing ground vegetation water content zhu et al 2019 sun et al 2017 compared soil moisture products from the fengyun 3b and cma land assimilation system over china and the two datasets exhibited analogous distribution and good correlation song and jia 2016 proposed a method for downscaling fengyun 3b soil moisture from 25 km to 1 km using the theory of apparent thermal inertia the results revealed that this method could be effectively applied to bare surfaces and sparsely vegetated land surfaces given that the fengyun 3 soil moisture is mostly assessed based on case studies in mainland china song and jia 2016 sun et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 there is a deficiency in quantitative evaluation of fengyun 3 soil moisture datasets under diverse underlying surface conditions and spatial distribution scales across different continents hence in this study an assessment was performed to determine the accuracy level and fitting degree of fengyun 3 soil moisture against in situ measurements globally a series of verifications were performed to demonstrate the spatiotemporal completeness and accuracy of the fengyun 3 soil moisture products the evaluation results indicated the following 1 the fengyun 3b a reveals a slightly higher spatial coverage percentage than the others densely observed regions were mainly concentrated at 20 60 n and 20 50 s in summer 2 all the fengyun 3 soil moisture products could display good performance in fitting the dynamics and values of the in situ measurements in the northern hemisphere while further corrections would be needed to improve data quality because most results do not achieve the ideal ubrmsd value 0 04 m3 m3 3 this study explores the correlation of soil moisture retrievals to ndvi lst and precipitation as the seasons change the results would be expected to offer a promising opportunity and regularity for fengyun 3 soil moisture correction 4 this study compares the performance of fengyun 3 soil moisture using multi scale in situ measurements in the same network the small scale with densely distributed stations achieves better validation accuracy than others proving the superiority of dense networks in representing regional soil moisture conditions compared with the existing studies this study systematically verified the completeness and accuracy of all available fengyun 3 satellites retrieved soil moisture retrievals we analyzed their accuracy characteristics under diverse underlying surfaces and seasons and found that both vod and lst impacted the errors which may serve as a useful reference for further data calibration in view of the current accuracy level and prevalent gap regions fengyun 3 soil moisture products must progress significantly before they can steadily correct bias and improve spatial coverage apart from vod veil of ice and relative motion between satellite revolution and earth rotation the rfi can be a critical reason that leads to outliers as well as gap regions in the satellite retrieved soil moisture products in fact direct broadcast and communication satellites especially around europe and japan cause considerable rfi above the 10 6 10 7 ghz band namely the x band draper 2018 zou et al 2013 effective rejection devices and algorithms are required to avoid the rfi in the x band numerous techniques have been used to mitigate rfi at microwave bands for instance the smap radiometer uses both on board and ground multiple signal detectors with digital signal processing algorithms for rfi mitigation in the l band centered at 1 41 ghz piepmeier et al 2014 the quality of smap has been validated by numerous studies the results proved the good performance of smap in accurately fitting the value and dynamics of in situ measurements chan et al 2018 liu and yang 2020 ma et al 2019 stillman and zeng 2018 the l band penetration depth can be close to 5 cm which is analogous to the measuring depth of ground observations in comparison in terms of different soil attributes the effective penetration depth of the x band is 0 1 cm observation depth mismatch would induce some error in the soil moisture product evaluation since the top soil layer could be typically drier than the deeper layer bindlish et al 2018 the esa cci sm as remotely sensed soil moisture products with the longest time series to date has been assessed by a host of experiments conducted globally chakravorty et al 2016 dorigo et al 2015 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 this multi band microwave retrievals combined with soil moisture products achieved a favorable correlation to in situ measurements and improved understanding of long term dynamics in coupled land surface hydrology and energy cycles dorigo et al 2017 compared to the single microwave band the combination of diverse microwave band signals from different satellites usually means more transit times within a day and better day scale representativeness hence it is suggested that constructing a fengyun 3 satellite network would be an efficient way to enhance the day scale land surface signal detection capability meanwhile new satellites such as fengyun 2h and fengyun 3d have been launched recently which could be promising for continuously retrieving sufficient soil moisture datasets minnett et al 2019 among the four selected in situ measurements three were located in the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere and the other one is situated in the middle latitude of the southern hemisphere the limited numbers and relatively concentrated locations of the in situ measurements may impact the evaluation outcomes the accuracy of fengyun 3 soil moisture products in different climates and underlying surfaces combined regions could be diverse moreover the influence derived from rfi can be irregular and unpredictable and would significantly affect the quality of fengyun 3 soil moisture globally therefore the spatial representativeness of the evaluation outcomes must be further enhanced through large scale distributed in situ measurements in the future 5 conclusions in this study the soil moisture retrieval data derived from fengyun 3 satellites were evaluated using the in situ measurements collected from four networks situated in different land cover and climate zones some new contributions were made compared to previous soil moisture evaluation studies first the spatial temporal integrity was intuitively displayed and analyzed which clarified the evolution patterns of the spatial temporal completeness of fengyun 3 soil moisture retrievals second the in situ station based verification results indicated that the fengyun 3 soil moisture products achieved a good performance in fitting the dynamics and values of in situ measurements a relatively dense network exhibits superior representativeness and reliability in verification furthermore the fengyun 3 soil moisture could positively respond to the precipitation process and the memory of soil moisture to precipitation could last for at least 5 days third it was found that the bias in oznet was significantly positive for ndvi and negative for lst which could act as a valuable reference in fengyun 3 soil moisture rectification in the southern hemisphere in the future moreover the fengyun 3 soil moisture always overestimates in situ measurements with increasing vod overall the results and analysis of this study are helpful for understanding the quality of current fengyun 3 soil moisture products and can serve as a reference

4858,water reservoir operating rules are typically derived based on the assumption of streamflow stationarity however this assumption could be undermined by climate change adaptive reservoir operation is one of the most effective strategies to support water resources management under non stationarity yet until now adaptive strategies considering non stationarity across multiple time scales are rarely investigated we propose an adaptive reservoir operation framework that incorporates streamflow non stationarity across time scales simultaneously specifically we first decompose the streamflow into four frequency categories to detect non stationarity features through reservoir operation simulations next we incorporate the non stationarity information from each frequency category into adaptive reservoir operation by using bayesian model averaging we apply this framework to reservoir operation of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam on the blue nile river and evaluate its effectiveness with streamflow simulated from 21 general circulation models gcms for two greenhouse gases emission scenarios we find that streamflow non stationarity from all gcms varies by future period and frequency category the proposed bayesian adaptive reservoir operation framework can detect streamflow non stationarity across all frequency categories and predominantly outperforms conventional adaptive strategies especially in terms of firm power output in general firm output increases under the bayesian framework as the power generation reliability increases the proposed framework offers a robust approach to identify adaptive strategies for reservoir operation to address streamflow non stationarity keywords adaptive reservoir operation reservoir operating rules streamflow non stationarity bayesian model average time frequency analysis 1 introduction rapid socio economic development population growth and changes in preferences and consumption patterns continue to propel increasing global water demand wwap 2019 concurrently climate change is likely to alter water supply availability given expected changes to the hydrologic cycle including precipitation temperature and streamflow challenging water resources management allen and ingram 2002 gosling and arnell 2016 milly et al 2005 poff et al 2016 surface water reservoirs are effective infrastructure means to reallocate water resources spatially and temporally to address sectoral conflicts between agriculture power generation water supply tourism etc gaudard et al 2014 however as stressors on water demand and supply accelerate novel methods to improve reservoir management and efficiency are becoming increasingly valuable giuliani et al 2016 gleick 2003 in recent decades strategies to improve reservoir operations have been widely investigated including those based on neural networks algorithms e g cancelliere et al 2002 chaves and chang 2008 genetic programming e g ashofteh et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems e g soltani et al 2010 decision tree algorithms e g herman and giuliani 2018 yang et al 2016 and others although these methods have demonstrated improved effectiveness and efficiency in reservoir operations they are traditionally applied based on the assumption of future hydrologic stationarity given expected future large scale changes to the global climate system culley et al 2016 milly et al 2008 statistical properties e g expected value variance and coefficient of variation of hydrologic variables could change with time and be a deterministic function of time described as non stationarity koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 and this assumption could be problematic because of hydrologic non stationarity the statistical properties of reservoir inflow in the future could be different from historical levels in this way the reservoir operating rules optimized from observed streamflow data may not be suitable for reservoir decision making in the future to address this adaptive reservoir operation models have been developed modified and applied to assess the impacts of climate change and support long term reservoir operation strategies ahmadi et al 2015 block and strzepek 2010 borgomeo et al 2014 brown et al 2015 chang et al 2018 culley et al 2016 ehsani et al 2017 herman et al 2015 jeuland and whittington 2014 maier et al 2016 steinschneider and brown 2012 walsh et al 2016 xu et al 2014 for example xu et al 2014 propose reservoir hedging rules adaptive to non stationary inflow conditions based on an autoregressive integrated moving average model borgomeo et al 2014 develop a risk based decision making framework for long term reservoir operations under climate change by incorporating non stationary probabilistic climate projections obtained from a stochastic weather generator ahmadi et al 2015 simulate reservoir inflows based on hydrologic conditions from global general circulation models to derive reservoir operating rules for power generation under climate change culley et al 2016 design reservoir operating rules adaptive to climate change by using a bottom up approach brown et al 2012 and evaluate the upper limit of adaptive capacity in reservoir operations the adaptive reservoir operation framework here is also noted as dynamic planning or dynamic adaptive plan in some literatures haasnoot et al 2013 herman et al 2019 in adaptive framework detection based and simulation based approaches are typically used to overcome the hydrologic non stationarity and improve the adaptivity of reservoir operating rules detection based approaches first determine the presence of non stationarity e g by analyzing historical streamflow directly or detecting trends in the impacts of thermodynamic climate change such as snowpack decline ceres et al 2017 and sea level rise thorarinsdottir et al 2017 and subsequently generate synthetic streamflow considering detected non stationarity features such as a trend in historical streamflow to derive reservoir operating rules xu et al 2014 recently signposts or triggers for non stationarity detection have been investigated to determine when to adapt in water resources operation and planning fletcher et al 2019 raso et al 2019 robinson and herman 2019 simulation based approaches do not rely on non stationarity detection but rather determine reservoir operating rules based on streamflow simulated from future climate projections chang et al 2018 culley et al 2016 haasnoot et al 2013 ngo et al 2018 for example the representative concentration pathways rcps developed in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc taylor et al 2012 have been used to project climate scenarios subsequently streamflow simulated from the climate scenarios of precipitation temperature etc using a hydrological model is used to derive reservoir operating rules for both approaches reservoir operating rules are derived from synthetic or projected streamflow time series directly and only the impact of possible streamflow non stationarity at specific time scale is considered e g the reservoir operating rules derived from monthly projected streamflow data typically only consider non stationarity at a monthly scale however changes in climate may cause changes in streamflow variability at different time scale katz and brown 1992 potentially affecting reservoir operations uniquely for example long term variability low frequency information in streamflow typically has less impact than short term variability high frequency information on reservoir operations for flood control herman and giuliani 2018 also both the degree and the source of non stationarity in streamflow can vary at multiple timescales which indicates that the adaptive reservoir operating rules considering the impact of multiple timescale non stationarity need to be dynamic for example a dynamic reservoir operation strategy based on rolling decision procedure i e recalibrating reservoir operating rules every 5 10 years xu et al 2014 can be used to enhance the robustness to streamflow non stationarity yang and ng 2017 in recent years model merging techniques such as bayesian model averaging bma which have been widely applied in hydrologic predictions diks and vrugt 2010 duan et al 2007 huang et al 2019 rathinasamy et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 are also used in reservoir operations koppa et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 the bma method is able to provide less risky inferences or estimations hoeting et al 1999 by combining multiple models which can be also used to improve reservoir decision making for example zhang et al 2015 combine three individual reservoir operation models with bma and find this method can reduce the uncertainty of reservoir operating rules to consider streamflow non stationarity at multiple time scales simultaneously in reservoir decision making we develop a bayesian based adaptive reservoir operation framework using the bma method specifically we 1 decompose streamflow time series into multiple frequency categories e g high median and low frequency information representing seasonal annual and multi year streamflow variability respectively 2 evaluate their impacts on the robustness of reservoir operating rules to recognize the sources of non stationarity related to reservoir operation e g if the median frequency information has the greatest impact the non stationarity at annual scale is assumed most significant and 3 merge the impacts of non stationarity of different frequency categories into reservoir decision making using bayesian model averaging we select the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd on the blue nile river in ethiopia to demonstrate the framework and provide quantitative analysis as in simulation based approaches we simulate gerd reservoir inflow series in the future from global climate models gcms under a suite of representative concentration pathways developed in the fifth assessment report of ipcc taylor et al 2012 to evaluate the performance of our adaptive reservoir operation framework it is worth noting that we are not using the simulated streamflow to provide accurate projections of future conditions at gerd but to enhance the understanding of gerd reservoir operation under non stationary conditions this work contributes to an improved understanding of how possible non stationarity in streamflow may affect conventional water resources operations and provides a creative way to detect the impacts of non stationarity on reservoir operations and modify existing reservoir operating rules 2 study area and data 2 1 the blue nile basin and the grand ethiopian renaissance dam the blue nile river the most significant tributary of the nile river originates at tana lake in ethiopia and merges with the white nile river in khartoum sudan average annual rainfall in the upper part of the basin varies between 1200 and 1800 mm conway 2000 with a dominant rainy season in june september contributing approximately 70 of mean annual precipitation during this season the blue nile supplies nearly 80 of total nile river streamflow on average vital to livelihood and development in ethiopia sudan and egypt the gerd situated on the blue nile river in western ethiopia approximately 15 km upstream of the sudanese border and currently under construction will become the largest hydroelectric dam in africa king and block 2014 when completed the gerd will have a reservoir capacity of 74 billion cubic meters a rated power capacity of 6 000 mw and produce an average of 15 130 gwh of electricity annually nearly tripling ethiopia s current production tesfa 2013 with electricity demand in ethiopia projected to grow at a rate of approximately 30 per year ethiopia power sector market 2016 the gerd is expected to contribute to both ethiopia s national energy grid as well as benefit other countries in the east african power pool nile basin initiative 2012 ethiopia s 15 year growth and transformation plan national planning commission 2016 outlines a strategy to reach middle income country status by 2025 development of the gerd is a major centerpiece of this plan 2 2 streamflow data and climate change projections 2 2 1 historical analysis a daily record of blue nile river flow data was obtained for the el diem gauging station located just downstream of the gerd site and averaged to monthly flow estimates as the el diem record is only available through 2009 and contains significant gaps we performed a hydrological simulation of the blue nile basin using the noah land surface model noah lsm ek et al 2003 paired with the hydrological mapping and analysis platform getirana et al 2012 implemented with the nasa land information system kumar et al 2006 to supplement the historical record these simulations were implemented at a 10 km horizontal resolution for the period 1981 2016 and use meteorological forcing from the nasa modern era reanalysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 but with precipitation drawn from the climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations version 2 chirpsv2 funk et al 2015 satellite informed product monthly river flow estimates at the gerd site were bias corrected conditioned on the overlapping period with the el diem gauge record this record was compared to an independently collected streamflow record from the gerd site for 1954 to 2003 and agreement is strong nash sutcliffe efficiency nash 1970 of 0 76 for the common period the minimum daily temperature maximum daily temperature and precipitation forcing data used in the noah lsm simulations merra 2 temperature and chirpsv2 precipitation were extracted as basin wide monthly averages and used to train an artificial neural network ann model to predict streamflow at the gerd site as a function of precipitation and temperature the ann was implemented using the nnetar function from the forecast r package hyndman and khandakar 2007 it fits a single hidden layer feed forward ann with lagged inputs to predict log transformation of gerd streamflow as a function of meteorological predictors the model was trained to capture the relationship between gerd streamflow and different combinations of predictors including autoregression timeseries forecasting no predictors precipitation volume for the watershed area and air temperature the model parameters network size and weight decay are tuned based on the ann results from badr et al 2014 and the output from the ann is used as the historical streamflow 2 2 2 streamflow based on climate change projections to project future blue nile river flow at the gerd site we applied the ann using temperature and precipitation fields extracted from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp thrasher et al 2013 the nex gddp meteorological fields are 0 25 resolution gridded fields generated through a bias correction and statistical disaggregation of selected global climate model gcm outputs from the 5th coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 since nex gddp is bias corrected to a different meteorological reference from the one used in our study we performed an additional simple bias correction to provide consistency with our historical record nex gddp includes output for single runs from 21 cmip5 gcms table 1 for the historical simulations through 2005 and for two projections the high emissions representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 and moderate emissions rcp4 5 for the period 2006 2100 the nex gddp projections for precipitation and temperature extend beyond the historically observed range of these variables as expected under future climate conditions the predicted precipitation fields also appear to be unrealistic for some gcms particularly for rcp8 5 in the second half of the 21st century this is not uncommon for local to regional scale precipitation projections in gcms as the focus of this paper is to understand reservoir operation under non stationary conditions rather than to present specific predictions for future gerd observations we do not perform gcm selection or weighting to optimize realism of future projections fig 1 historical data 1954 to 2003 at the gerd site illustrate expected high reservoir inflows in july to october and comparatively low inflow in the remaining months fig 2 considering climate change scenario rcp4 5 median reservoir inflow for all 21 gcms in the future is similar to historical inflow especially for june to august however for scenario rcp8 5 their difference becomes evident fig 2 both scenarios project higher annual inflow volumes with the increase mainly occurring during the peak flow season for example the gcm median of august and september inflow during 2071 2100 is projected to be almost twice the historical inflow additionally inflow uncertainty is also highest during this season and particularly notable for rcp8 5 fig 2 b in this study the inflow data simulated from the two rcp scenarios are used in reservoir operation simulations which enables examining the adaptivity of the proposed reservoir operation framework under various streamflow patterns 3 models and methods 3 1 reservoir operation model hydropower production is the primary purpose of the gerd with an objective function as follows 1 max e t 1 t p t δ t p t η g ρ q t p h t p 1000 where e is the sum of hydroelectricity generation kw h p t is the power generation output in period t kw t is the total number of operational periods and δ t is the time h of a single period one month η is the dimensionless hydropower generation efficiency of the turbines set as 0 85 in this study g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 ρ is the water density kg m3 and q t p and h t p are the reservoir release m3 s and the average power head m in period t respectively physical and operational reservoir constraints are listed as below a water balance 2 s t 1 s t q t in q t out δ t e p t where s t and s t 1 are reservoir storage m3 in period t and t 1 respectively q t in represents reservoir inflow m3 s in period t q t out is reservoir release m3 s in period t and e p t is the sum of evaporation and seepage from the reservoir m3 in period t b reservoir capacity limits jameel 2014 the reservoir structural and operational constraints can be expressed as 3 s min s t s max where s min and s max are the minimum and maximum allowable reservoir storage m3 respectively additionally s begin and s end represent the initial and final reservoir storage m3 for simulations respectively and are prescribed as 4 s t s begin t 1 s end t t c reservoir release limits the reservoir release constraints are expressed as 5 q l t q t out q u t where q l t and q u t are the minimum and maximum release m3 s in period t respectively the expected guidelines for gerd reservoir water release are not explicitly available thus releases are set lower than the maximum reservoir inflow during the high flow

method large scale ocean climate phenomena e g the el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation and atlantic multi decadal oscillation modulate climate and hydrologic variables namely precipitation and streamflow at unique frequencies and timescales dettinger et al 2000 mccabe et al 2007 nalley et al 2016 nowak et al 2012 the influence of such phenomena at varying time scale is apparent on blue nile streamflow eldaw et al 2003 taye and willems 2012 zaroug et al 2014 which can be decomposed into many nonlinear oscillatory patterns with different frequencies numerous methods including fast fourier transform cochran et al 1967 wavelet transform torrence and compo 1998 and empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1998 huang and wu 2008 wu and huang 2004 are available for streamflow decomposition of these three methods only emd is not subject to linear and stationary assumptions wu et al 2007 the process for applying emd method is as follows step 1 select all local maxima and minima and connect them with two cubic splines as the upper and lower envelops respectively step 2 define the average of the upper and the lower envelops as the intrinsic mode function imf in which the difference between the number of maxima or minima and the zero crossings must be equal to zero or one step 3 obtain the residual by finding the difference between the original signal streamflow series i and the imf step 4 repeat steps 1 3 until the envelops are symmetric with respect to a zero mean at which point the streamflow signal is decomposed into several imfs and one residual to overcome mode mixing issues and redundant imfs the emd is modified into an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd form wu and huang 2009 by adding white noise to the original signal the eemd can avoid imfs with widely disparate scales and preserve the physical uniqueness of the decomposition however the sum of the decomposed modes and the final trend from the eemd will contain residual noise to address this and obtain components with less noise the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan as proposed by colominas et al 2014 is applied here for gerd reservoir inflow decomposition for more details about emd eemd and ceemdan please refer to wu and huang 2004 wu and huang 2009 and colominas et al 2014 respectively to isolate streamflow frequency information the streamflow time series is decomposed into unique frequency components using the improved ceemdan method e g gcm3 bnu esm fig 3 based on a 30 year streamflow series the frequency of the intrinsic mode functions imf decreases from sub annual to long term trend and are labeled as imf 1 to imf 8 imf 1 and imf 2 illustrate sub seasonal changes while imf 3 is annual explaining inter annual cycles imf 4 7 represent multi year to decadal frequencies and imf 8 represents the trend of the streamflow across the 30 year period imf 8 is close to the inflow trend obtained from linear regression fig 3 a and imf 3 has a 12 month cycle thus the improved ceemdan method may be able to accurately provide streamflow frequency information at least in terms of trend and 12 month cycles the decomposed imfs are further divided into 4 categories high frequency sub annual medium frequency annual low frequency multi year to decadal and trend to understand the impact of each frequency category it is removed and the streamflow series is reconstructed based on the remaining imfs this is denoted as frequency removed streamflow and reservoir operating rules extracted from this series as frequency removed rules note that frequency removed streamflow still corresponds to normal streamflow volume also the imf 8 here is not centered on zero thus the mean is added back into the streamflow data after it is removed the frequency removed streamflow results for 2021 2050 e g gcm3 bnu esm fig 3 b show that the high medium and low frequency categories explain much more of the variance in streamflow than the trend by removing one frequency category the frequency removed streamflow will not be affected by the removed frequency thus the performance difference between the frequency removed rules and the rules derived by streamflow data directly frequency complete rules indicates the impact of the removed frequency on reservoir operation 3 3 reservoir operating rules 3 3 1 rbf based reservoir operating rules the radial basis function rbf approach which can ensure flexibility to the structure of the reservoir operating rules and capability to deal with a large number of input variables deisenroth et al 2013 is adopted to determine water release decisions for more applications of rbf models in reservoir operation see giuliani et al 2015 with this approach the reservoir water release decision is defined as 7 q t out u 1 u ω u φ u x t t 1 t 0 ω u 1 8 φ u x t exp m 1 m x t m c m u 2 b u 2 c m u 1 1 b u 0 1 where u is the number of rbfs φ u represents the u th

within a water year are selected as input variables i e x t s t q t in τ t the number of rbfs is determined through a sensitivity analysis by increasing the rbfs until the power generation of optimal solutions do not change significantly here four rbfs are used thus m 3 three input variables u 4 four rbfs and 20 parameters in the rbfs based reservoir operating rules three types of reservoir operation strategy or rules are discussed here fig 4 the historical based rules and future based rules represent rules extracted from historical and future reservoir inflow by optimizing the parameters in eqs 7 and 8 with the inputs of historical and future streamflow respectively both approaches produce static rules derived only once during a specific period the future based rules approach is conditioned on perfect future foresight and therefore prescribes operations leading to optimal power generation in the future clearly this represents an upper unrealistic bound on performance of the rbf based rules as a compromise we derive adaptive operating rules based on streamflow data proximal to when decisions are made for example reservoir operating rules extracted from 30 years of streamflow e g 2020 2049 are used for the period 2050 2054 the periods 2020 2049 and 2050 2054 in the example are denoted as the extraction and application periods respectively we recalibrate and validate the rules every 5 10 years and find that updating the rules at 5 year increments performs best and thus this strategy is used for all adaptive rules in this study the comparison of historical based adaptive and future based rules in monthly power generation can be found in appendix s1 fig s1 3 3 2 bma based reservoir operating rules bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical approach to infer a probabilistic scheme by combining multiple possible competing models and has been implemented in reservoir operating rules derivations zhang et al 2015 suppose there exists k adaptive reservoir operating rules r 1 r 2 rk from which k different reservoir release strategies are available at each time period by using the improved ceemdan method streamflow data can be decomposed into many imfs with varying frequency and classified into several categories e g high medium and low frequency and trend in this study k is equal to five r 1 refers to frequency complete rules derived by streamflow data directly and r 2 r 3 r 4 and r 5 refer to frequency removed rules derived by excluding high medium and low frequency and trend information respectively more specifically for r 2 r 3 r 4 and r 5 the associated category of imfs e g high frequency for r 2 is removed from the original streamflow data and the remaining imfs are summed together to form a streamflow series without the corresponding e g high frequency information as described in eqs 7 and 8 the rules r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 and r 5 share the same structure and same number of parameters however their parameters are optimized based on different types of streamflow time series e g complete streamflow and streamflow without high frequency information in this study we optimize the parameters of rules r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 and r 5 individually by using the dynamically dimensioned search dds evolutionary algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 according to the law of total probability the reservoir release probability density function is expressed as follows 9 p q out q in k 1 k p q out r k q in p r k q in where p q out r k q in is the release probability density function based on rule rk and streamflow series qin given the adaptive rule rk qout is the deterministic function of qin i e q out f r k q in thus the p q out r k q in equals one for q out f r k q in otherwise it equals zero p r k q in is the posterior probability of rule rk given the streamflow series qin which describes the probability that rk is suitable to the reservoir operation with qin the p r k q in is an unknown variable and must be estimated from the performance of adaptive rule rk the better rk performs with qin the higher the p r k q in the sum of the posterior model probabilities is equal to one i e k 1 k p r k q in 1 and the p r k q in can be regarded as a weight w k the reservoir release is then the posterior mean of the bma model values 10 q out e q out q in k 1 k f r k q in w k where f r k q in refers to the water release obtained from rule rk by comparing the reservoir operation performance of rules rk k 2 3 4 5 with r 1 during the application period the impact of the frequency high medium and low and trend information can be evaluated the value of the frequency information fk on reservoir operations during the period t 1 t 2 δ t t 2 t 1 in this study is defined as 11 v a l u e f k δ t t t 1 t 2 p q t in r 1 p q t in r k k 2 3 k where p is the function to calculate power generation given a reservoir state both the average power head h t p and reservoir release q t p in eq 1 can be calculated from reservoir inflow q t in and rules rk to get the power generation p q t in r k in most cases frequency complete rules r 1 can capture the main features of frequency information in future streamflow and the v a l u e f k δ t is generally positive however if the k th frequency signal is strong and changes significantly from the extraction to the application periods then the rules derived from the extraction period with that k th frequency signal will perform poorly in the application period for the rules extraction with that signal removed it will do better in the application period and the v a l u e f k δ t can be negative in this case the r 1 will be misleading and the weight applied to the rules extracted without the categorical frequency information should be increased to detect and mitigate the non stationarity associated with different frequency information the bma model is extended to a dynamic model by updating the weight wk based on the value of frequency information through eqs 12 and 13 because rk is obtained from the streamflow during the extraction period q in k the more similar streamflow during application period qin is to q in k the higher the wk thus wk here also reflects the degree of non stationarity in streamflow between q in k and qin 12 z k j r a n k v a l u e f k j 1 values 1 0 5 k 1 k w k j 1 k 1 2 k 13 w k j z k j k 1 k z k j where w k j is the weight applied to releases at stage j r a n k v a l u e f k j 1 values is the descending rank of the frequency information value v a l u e f k j 1 among all ensemble members k members in total more specifically the r a n k v a l u e f k j 1 values will be 1 k for the greatest least information value as defined in eq 11 in this study the weight is updated annually according to the performance of bma based rules considering that the weights are updated much more frequently than the parameters of reservoir operating rules bma model parameters and rbf based rule parameters are not optimized simultaneously initially the weight of r 1 is equal to one i e frequency complete rules are fully trusted w 1 0 is set to one while w k 0 k 2 3 k is set to zero then w k j is updated according to v a l u e f k x a lower v a l u e f k x will lead to a higher weight on the rules extracted without the frequency information f k in this way the p r k q in in eq 9 can be estimated from the performance of reservoir operating rules rk k 1 2 3 4 5 because the frequency complete rules r 1 are effective in most cases additional weight w a is added for each update of z 1 j in the eq 12 as 14 z 1 j r a n k v a l u e f 1 j 1 values 1 0 5 k 1 k w 1 j 1 w a where w a ranges from 0 to 1 and is determined from the validation of the bma based rules at stage j 1 for maximum power generation more specifically increasing w a from 0 to 1 e g 0 0 1 0 2 1 and validating the performance of bma based rules at stage j 1 the w a values that produce the greatest power generation are selected for the stage j fig 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 impacts of streamflow frequency information on adaptive reservoir operations to evaluate the impact of streamflow frequency information on adaptive reservoir operations the frequency removed rules are applied across 2020 2100 for each category and gcm independently and compared against frequency complete rules fig 6 the power generation output brought from all types of frequency information which is calculated by subtracting the output of frequency removed rules with the output of frequency complete rules is predominantly greater than zero implying that including all types of frequency information has a beneficial impact on power generation on average fig 6 additionally the output of frequency removed rules pwof is occasionally greater than the output of frequency complete rules pnorm more specifically pwof pnorm occurs for 32 43 38 and 48 25 36 35 and 44 of operational periods years for high medium low frequency and trend removed rules respectively under scenario rcp4 5 rcp8 5 see bottom fig 6 thus trend information leads to the highest percentage of periods with pwof pnorm which indicates that the trend information is more likely to be non stationary than other frequency categories the average of frequency information value v a l u e f k δ t in eq 11 the difference between power generation of frequency removed rules and frequency complete rules across all gcms lines in fig 7 and the rank of frequency information value bars in fig 7 indicate that high frequency information typically contributes the most to power output whereas the trend provides the least i e the sub seasonal variability short term variability in streamflow has greater impact than the trend long term variability on reservoir operation which is consistent with the findings from herman and giuliani 2018 the medium and low frequency information although contributing less than the high frequency are still appreciable more specifically high frequency removed rules produce approximately 120 mw 200 mw and 180 mw power output more than frequency complete rules during the periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively for rcp4 5 140 mw 240 mw and 290 mw respectively for rcp8 5 except for 2071 2100 under scenario rcp8 5 low frequency information contributes more to power output than the medium frequency information on average for example medium frequency contributes 157 mw and 124 mw surpassing 130 mw and 100 mw from low frequency information annually during 2020 2100 for gcm3 and gcm15 respectively under scenario rcp4 5 the reason is that the medium frequency information has been partially included in the rbf based rules in eqs 7 and 8 in which the input variable τ t the position of the current period t within a water year shares the same annual cycle as the medium frequency the lack of frequency information clearly affects how the adaptive reservoir operating rules are constructed when a certain frequency is removed from the streamflow series during rules extraction the derived reservoir operating rules will fail to appropriately adapt to future streamflow when this feature frequency is influential for reservoir decision making however if the frequency removed rules perform better than the frequency complete rules pwof pnorm in the application period table 2 it can be inferred that non stationarity exists streamflow in the rules extraction period is not consistent with that in the rules application period for the removed frequency it is worth noting that not all situations with pwof pnorm in table 2 indicate streamflow non stationarity instead pwof pnorm during some times could be caused by noise especially when pwof and pnorm are close to each other e g the median frequency for gcm21 under scenario rcp4 5 during 2071 2100 table 2 but the more frequently pwof pnorm occurs the more likely streamflow non stationarity exists it can be inferred that streamflow non stationarity is significant when considering the trend category specifically for 12 gcms during 2011 2040 under scenario rcp4 5 table 2 removing streamflow information at appropriate frequencies e g when pwof pnorm could possibly improve adaptive reservoir operations 4 2 bma based adaptive reservoir operating rules 4 2 1 non stationarity and adaptive reservoir operating rules given the apparent non stationarity in streamflow specified by period gcm and frequency category table 2 future reservoir operations will likely benefit if the non stationarity is detected and considered in the rules extraction stage detection however is challenging given that future streamflow is unknown and the non stationarity characteristics may change throughout the reservoir operation period thus it is assumed that the probability of non stationarity occurrence in the future is related with that in the past more specifically if streamflow non stationarity at one frequency is detected in the past it can be assumed to exist similarly in the future after detection of possible streamflow non stationarity eq 11 water release decision weights for the different rules are updated eqs 12 and 13 fig 8 the weight of frequency complete rules fluctuates with the time but it is always greater than the weight of frequency removed rules also trend removed rules receive the largest weight for most gcms in comparison to other frequency removed rules indicating that streamflow non stationarity is likely most significant for the trend category consistent with the findings in fig 6 and table 2 by updating the weight w k j and merging the water releases obtained from different types of rules through eq 10 the bma based rules incorporate non stationarity from different frequency categories into reservoir decision making in a dynamic way the cumulative mean power output from the bma based rules is compared with normal rules frequency complete rules fig 8 except for gcm3 12 16 and 19 under scenario rcp4 5 and gcm3 9 12 15 18 and 21 under scenario rcp8 5 the bma based outcomes are equal to or superior to outcomes utilizing normal rules more specifically the increase in power output through 2100 from the bma based rules is greater than 10 000 mw month 7 3 gw h for gcm1 2 8 10 11 13 and 20 under rcp4 5 and greater than 20 000 mw month 14 6 gw h for gcm8 and gcm10 under rcp8 5 this increase in power generation cannot necessarily be generalized as different frequency removed categories contribute uniquely by gcm which can be inferred from the weights of different types of reservoir operating rules in fig 8 for example the increase in cumulative output during 2020 2030 for gcm2 under rcp4 5 is mainly supplied by the high frequency removed and low frequency removed rules whereas increases during 2040 2050 for gcm8 under rcp4 5 is attributable to the trend removed and medium frequency removed rules respectively fig 8 a in some cases e g gcm 15 under rcp8 5 bma based rules produce less overall power than normal rules fig 8 b implying that non stationarity is minimally evident throughout the period the weight of normal adaptive rules has its highest value and does not change during 2025 2100 and bma based rules could be inferior to normal rule the performance of bma based rules is further investigated by analyzing changes in monthly mean output fig 9 generally power generation based on the high frequency removed rules illustrates the largest negative difference with normal adaptive rules trend removed rules illustrate the least closest to zero since normal adaptive rules have their parameters updated every 5 years in this case study the streamflow trend becomes mostly insignificant and thus has no measurable impact on power generation although the bma based rules predominantly perform better than or similar to normal rules in cumulative or mean output the improvement is limited and bma based rules may be even inferior to normal rules in some cases the reason is that normal adaptive rules have partially considered possible non stationarity especially based on trend information by recalibrating the parameters every 5 years 4 2 2 performance of bma based rules in firm output in addition to considering maximum power generation the bma based rules are also evaluated for their ability to improve firm power generation for various reliability levels fig 10 reliability is conditioned on each gcm time series individually a 95 reliability implies that a power output threshold is met or exceeded in 95 of the months during the given period for that gcm in general bma based rules improve firm output across most gcms and reliability levels with the largest increase in firm output for reliability of 95 during 2011 2100 greater than350 mw 105 per month for rcp4 5 and 450 mw 180 per month for rcp8 5 fig 10 considering rcp8 5 only the bma based model is superior in nearly all cases thus the bma based rules obtain an advantage over normal adaptive rules mainly in terms of firm output instead of total or mean output as shown in fig 9 b bma based rules could perform worse than normal rules in terms of mean output during 2011 2020 for some gcms such as gcm18 in scenario rcp8 5 the comparison between the bma based and normal rules in density distribution and boxplot of monthly output during 2011 2020 under gcm18 in scenario rcp8 5 fig 11 b and d bma based model results in lower mean output than the model conditioned on normal rules illustrates that bma based rules tend to increase low level 3000 mw outputs and the increment mainly occurs in june july and august comparing the case when the bma based model results in higher mean output than the model using normal rules fig 11 a and c also illustrates the advantage of bma based rules in obtaining greater power generation when the output is lower than 2000 mw this occurs because the bma based rules can avoid extremely high or low releases in mistake by averaging releases from normal frequency complete and frequency removed rules thus the bma based rules can avoid extremely low output and obtain more consistent outputs than normal rules see the density distribution of monthly output in fig 11 a averaging across all gcms the bma based rules produce more firm power output than normal adaptive reservoir operating rules for all levels of reliability from 80 to 100 table 3 for example the percentage increase in firm power output of bma based rules during 2011 2100 ranges from 3 9 to 69 1 and 5 4 to 129 4 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively additionally the percentage increase in firm output increases as the reliability increases to over 35 and 50 during all time periods for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively when the reliability is close to 100 this advantage in firm output is particularly significant when considering demand for high power generation reliability which can be crucial in the manufacturing sector allcott et al 2016 and may lead to economic benefits now and into the future 5 conclusions adaptive reservoir operating rules generally outperform static or historical based rules in water resources management under non stationary conditions however conventional adaptive rules do not consider potential non stationarity at multiple time scales which is rarely investigated this study illustrates a strategy to incorporate streamflow non stationarity information for different time scales simultaneously into adaptive reservoir operating rules and potential value over conventional normal adaptive rules to detect the streamflow non stationarity at different time scales streamflow time series are decomposed into different frequency categories and their impacts on reservoir operation is evaluated subsequently the non stationarity information of different frequency categories is incorporated into adaptive reservoir operating rules using a bma method the performance of the bayesian adaptive reservoir operation framework is evaluated for the gerd reservoir operation in ethiopia using monthly streamflow simulated from 21 gcms under scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 high medium low and trend information extracted from the streamflow time series is shown to affect gerd reservoir operations diversely recognizing streamflow non stationarity at different frequencies and removing it from the original streamflow time series can improve adaptive reservoir operations overall high frequency sub seasonal information has the greatest impact on power generation while the most significant non stationarity in streamflow is associated with the trend information for adaptive gerd reservoir operation additionally the bayesian adaptive framework can recognize streamflow non stationarity at different frequency categories and mitigate its impacts on normal adaptive reservoir operating rules thus the bayesian adaptive rules predominantly outperform normal adaptive rules considering power generation especially in terms of firm power output in general firm output increases under the bayesian framework as the power generation reliability increases this implies that the bayesian adaptive rules are preferable when high power generation reliability is required although the bayesian adaptive rules can outperform conventional adaptive rules in terms of total power generation and firm power output simultaneously for some gcms such as gcm10 under rcp4 5 and gcm8 under rcp8 5 overall the bayesian adaptive rules do not consistently provide superior performance given that streamflow non stationarity may be attributed to many factors e g emission of greenhouse gases changes in catchment characteristics it is challenging to accurately identify all non stationary components and incorporate them into water resources management the findings in this paper not only illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed bayesian adaptive framework but also reveal the possibility of tackling adaptive water resources operation problems in the future from the perspective of time and frequency domains in that way the non stationary features in streamflow at multiple time scales can be recognized with the support of time frequency analysis and incorporated into water resources decision making future research efforts could focus on expanding and improving non stationarity source detection and considering broader envelops of uncertainty e

4858,water reservoir operating rules are typically derived based on the assumption of streamflow stationarity however this assumption could be undermined by climate change adaptive reservoir operation is one of the most effective strategies to support water resources management under non stationarity yet until now adaptive strategies considering non stationarity across multiple time scales are rarely investigated we propose an adaptive reservoir operation framework that incorporates streamflow non stationarity across time scales simultaneously specifically we first decompose the streamflow into four frequency categories to detect non stationarity features through reservoir operation simulations next we incorporate the non stationarity information from each frequency category into adaptive reservoir operation by using bayesian model averaging we apply this framework to reservoir operation of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam on the blue nile river and evaluate its effectiveness with streamflow simulated from 21 general circulation models gcms for two greenhouse gases emission scenarios we find that streamflow non stationarity from all gcms varies by future period and frequency category the proposed bayesian adaptive reservoir operation framework can detect streamflow non stationarity across all frequency categories and predominantly outperforms conventional adaptive strategies especially in terms of firm power output in general firm output increases under the bayesian framework as the power generation reliability increases the proposed framework offers a robust approach to identify adaptive strategies for reservoir operation to address streamflow non stationarity keywords adaptive reservoir operation reservoir operating rules

continue to propel increasing global water demand wwap 2019 concurrently climate change is likely to alter water supply availability given expected changes to the hydrologic cycle including

stressors on water demand and supply accelerate novel methods to improve reservoir management and efficiency are becoming increasingly valuable giuliani et al 2016 gleick 2003 in recent decades strategies to improve reservoir operations have been widely investigated including those based on neural networks algorithms e g cancelliere et al 2002 chaves and chang 2008 genetic programming e g ashofteh et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems e g soltani et al 2010 decision tree algorithms e g herman and giuliani 2018 yang et al 2016 and others although these methods have demonstrated improved effectiveness and efficiency in reservoir operations they are traditionally applied based on the assumption of future hydrologic stationarity given expected future large scale changes to the global climate system culley et al 2016 milly et al 2008 statistical properties e g expected value variance and coefficient of variation of hydrologic variables could change with time and be a deterministic function of time described as non stationarity koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 and this assumption could be problematic because of hydrologic non stationarity the statistical properties of reservoir inflow in the future could be different from historical levels in this way the reservoir operating rules optimized from observed streamflow data may not be suitable for reservoir decision making in the future to address this adaptive reservoir operation models have been developed modified and applied to assess the impacts of climate change and support long term reservoir operation strategies ahmadi et al 2015 block and strzepek 2010 borgomeo et al 2014 brown et al 2015 chang et al 2018 culley et al 2016 ehsani et al 2017 herman et al 2015 jeuland and whittington 2014 maier et al 2016 steinschneider and brown 2012 walsh et al 2016 xu et al 2014 for example xu et al 2014 propose reservoir hedging rules adaptive to non stationary inflow conditions based on an autoregressive integrated moving average model borgomeo et al 2014 develop a risk based decision making framework for long term reservoir operations under climate change by incorporating non stationary probabilistic climate projections obtained from a stochastic weather generator ahmadi et al 2015 simulate reservoir inflows based on hydrologic conditions from global general circulation models to derive reservoir operating rules for power generation under climate change culley et al 2016 design reservoir operating rules adaptive to climate change by using a bottom up approach brown et al 2012 and evaluate the upper limit of adaptive capacity in reservoir operations the adaptive reservoir operation framework here is also noted as dynamic planning or dynamic adaptive plan in some literatures haasnoot et al 2013 herman et al 2019 in adaptive framework detection based and simulation based approaches are typically used to overcome the hydrologic non stationarity and improve the adaptivity of reservoir operating rules detection based approaches first determine the presence of non stationarity e g by analyzing historical streamflow directly or detecting trends in the impacts of thermodynamic climate change such as snowpack decline ceres et al 2017 and sea level rise thorarinsdottir et al 2017 and subsequently generate synthetic streamflow considering detected non stationarity features such as a trend in historical streamflow to derive reservoir operating rules xu et al 2014 recently signposts or triggers for non stationarity detection have been investigated to determine when to adapt in water resources operation and planning fletcher et al 2019 raso et al 2019 robinson and herman 2019 simulation based approaches do not rely on non stationarity detection but rather determine reservoir operating rules based on streamflow simulated from future climate projections chang et al 2018 culley et al 2016 haasnoot et al 2013 ngo et al 2018 for example the representative concentration pathways rcps developed in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc taylor et al 2012 have been used to project climate scenarios subsequently streamflow simulated from the climate scenarios of precipitation temperature etc using a hydrological model is used to derive reservoir operating rules for both approaches reservoir operating rules are derived from synthetic or projected streamflow time series directly and only the impact of possible streamflow non stationarity at specific time scale is considered e g the reservoir operating rules derived from monthly projected streamflow data typically only consider non stationarity at a monthly scale however changes in climate may cause changes in streamflow variability at different time scale katz and brown 1992 potentially affecting reservoir operations uniquely for example long term variability low frequency information in streamflow typically has less impact than short term variability high frequency information on reservoir operations for flood control herman and giuliani 2018 also both the degree and the source of non stationarity in streamflow can vary at multiple timescales which indicates that the adaptive reservoir operating rules considering the impact of multiple timescale non stationarity need to be dynamic for example a dynamic reservoir operation strategy based on rolling decision procedure i e recalibrating reservoir operating rules every 5 10 years xu et al 2014 can be used to enhance the robustness to streamflow non stationarity yang and ng 2017 in recent years model merging techniques such as bayesian model averaging bma which have been widely applied in hydrologic predictions diks and vrugt 2010 duan et al 2007 huang et al 2019 rathinasamy et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 are also used in reservoir operations koppa et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 the bma method is able to provide less risky inferences or estimations hoeting et al 1999 by combining multiple models which can be also used to improve reservoir decision making for example zhang et al 2015 combine three individual reservoir operation models with bma and find this method can reduce the uncertainty of reservoir operating rules to consider streamflow non stationarity at multiple time scales simultaneously in reservoir decision making we develop a bayesian based adaptive reservoir operation framework using the bma method specifically we 1 decompose streamflow time series into multiple frequency categories e g high median and low frequency information representing seasonal annual and multi year streamflow variability respectively 2 evaluate their impacts on the robustness of reservoir operating rules to recognize the sources of non stationarity related to reservoir operation e g if the median frequency information has the greatest impact the non stationarity at annual scale is assumed most significant and 3 merge the impacts of non stationarity of different frequency categories into reservoir decision making using bayesian model averaging we select the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd on the blue nile river in ethiopia to demonstrate the framework and provide quantitative analysis as in simulation based approaches we simulate gerd reservoir inflow series in the future from global climate models gcms under a suite of representative concentration pathways developed in the fifth assessment report of ipcc taylor et al 2012 to evaluate the performance of our adaptive reservoir operation framework it is worth noting that we are not using the simulated streamflow to provide accurate projections of future conditions at gerd but to enhance the understanding of gerd reservoir operation under non stationary conditions this work contributes to an improved understanding of how possible non stationarity in streamflow may affect conventional water resources operations and provides a creative way to detect the impacts of non stationarity on reservoir operations and modify existing reservoir operating rules 2 study area and data 2 1 the blue nile basin and the grand

record of blue nile river flow data was obtained for the el diem gauging station located just downstream of the gerd site and averaged to monthly flow estimates as the el diem record is only available through 2009 and contains significant gaps we performed a hydrological simulation of the blue nile basin using the noah land surface model noah lsm ek et al 2003 paired with the hydrological mapping

decay are tuned based on the ann results from badr et al 2014 and the output from the ann is used as the historical streamflow 2 2 2 streamflow based on climate change projections to project future blue nile river flow at the gerd site we applied the ann using temperature and precipitation fields extracted from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp thrasher et al 2013 the nex gddp meteorological fields are 0 25 resolution gridded fields generated through a bias correction and statistical disaggregation of selected global climate model gcm outputs from the 5th coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 since nex gddp is bias corrected to a different meteorological reference from the one used in our study we performed an additional simple bias correction to provide consistency with our historical record nex gddp includes output for single runs from 21 cmip5 gcms table 1 for the historical simulations through 2005 and for two projections the high emissions representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 and moderate emissions rcp4 5 for the period 2006 2100 the nex gddp projections for precipitation and temperature extend beyond the historically observed range of these variables as expected under future climate conditions the predicted precipitation fields also appear to be unrealistic for some gcms particularly for rcp8 5 in the second half of the 21st century this is not uncommon for local to regional scale precipitation projections in gcms as the focus of this paper is to understand reservoir operation under non stationary conditions rather than to present specific predictions for future gerd observations we do not perform gcm selection or weighting to optimize realism of future projections fig 1 historical data 1954 to 2003 at the gerd site illustrate expected high reservoir inflows in july to october and comparatively low inflow in the remaining months fig 2 considering climate change scenario rcp4 5 median reservoir inflow for all 21 gcms in the future is similar to historical inflow especially for june to august however for scenario rcp8 5 their difference becomes evident fig 2 both scenarios project higher annual inflow volumes with the increase mainly occurring during the peak flow season for example the gcm median of august and september inflow during 2071 2100 is projected to be almost twice the historical inflow additionally inflow uncertainty is also highest during this season and particularly notable for rcp8 5 fig 2 b in this study the inflow data simulated from the two rcp scenarios are used in reservoir operation simulations which enables examining the adaptivity of the proposed reservoir operation framework under various streamflow patterns 3 models and methods 3 1 reservoir operation model hydropower production is the primary purpose of the gerd with an objective function as follows 1 max e t 1 t p t δ t p t η g ρ q t p h t p 1000 where e is the sum of hydroelectricity generation kw h p t is the power generation output in period t kw t is the total number of operational periods and δ t is the time h of a single period one month η is the dimensionless hydropower generation efficiency of the turbines set as 0 85 in this study g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 ρ is the water density kg m3 and q t p and h t p are the reservoir release m3 s and the average power head m in period t respectively physical and operational reservoir constraints are listed as below a water balance 2 s t 1 s t q t in q t out δ t e p t where s t and s t 1 are reservoir storage m3 in period t and t 1 respectively q t in represents reservoir inflow m3 s in period t q t out is reservoir release m3 s in period t and e p t is the sum of evaporation and seepage from the reservoir m3 in period t b reservoir capacity limits jameel 2014 the reservoir structural and operational constraints can be expressed as 3 s min s t s max where s min and s max are the minimum and maximum allowable reservoir storage m3 respectively additionally s begin and s end represent the initial and final reservoir storage m3 for simulations respectively and are prescribed as 4 s t s begin t 1 s end t t c reservoir release limits the reservoir release constraints are expressed as 5 q l t q t out q u t where q l t and q u t are the minimum and maximum release m3 s in period t respectively the expected guidelines for gerd reservoir water release are not explicitly available thus releases are set lower than the maximum reservoir inflow during the high flow

method large scale ocean climate phenomena e g the el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation and atlantic multi decadal oscillation modulate climate and hydrologic variables namely precipitation and streamflow at unique frequencies and timescales dettinger et al 2000 mccabe et al 2007 nalley et al 2016 nowak et al 2012 the influence of such phenomena at varying time scale is apparent on blue nile streamflow eldaw et al 2003 taye and willems 2012 zaroug et al 2014 which can be decomposed into many nonlinear oscillatory patterns with different frequencies numerous methods including fast fourier transform cochran et al 1967 wavelet transform torrence and compo 1998 and empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1998 huang and wu 2008 wu and huang 2004 are available for streamflow decomposition of these three methods only emd is not subject to linear and stationary assumptions wu et al 2007 the process for applying emd method is as follows step 1 select all local maxima and minima and connect them with two cubic splines as the upper and lower envelops respectively step 2 define the average of the upper and the lower envelops as the intrinsic mode function imf in which the difference between the number of maxima or minima and the zero crossings must be equal to zero or one step 3 obtain the residual by finding the difference between the original signal streamflow series i and the imf step 4 repeat steps 1 3 until the envelops are symmetric with respect to a zero mean at which point the streamflow signal is decomposed into several imfs and one residual to overcome mode mixing issues and redundant imfs the emd is modified into an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd form wu and huang 2009 by adding white noise to the original signal the eemd can avoid imfs with widely disparate scales and preserve the physical uniqueness of the decomposition however the sum of the decomposed modes and the final trend from the eemd will contain residual noise to address this and obtain components with less noise the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan as proposed by colominas et al 2014 is applied here for gerd reservoir inflow decomposition for more details about emd eemd and ceemdan please refer to wu and huang 2004 wu and huang 2009 and colominas et al 2014 respectively to isolate streamflow frequency information the streamflow time series is decomposed into unique frequency components using the improved ceemdan method e g gcm3 bnu esm fig 3 based on a 30 year streamflow series the frequency of the intrinsic mode functions imf decreases from sub annual to long term trend and are labeled as imf 1 to imf 8 imf 1 and imf 2 illustrate sub seasonal changes while imf 3 is annual explaining inter annual cycles imf 4 7 represent multi year to decadal frequencies and imf 8 represents the trend of the streamflow across the 30 year period imf 8 is close to the inflow trend obtained from linear regression fig 3 a and imf 3 has a 12 month cycle thus the improved ceemdan method may be able to accurately provide streamflow frequency information at least in terms of trend and 12 month cycles the decomposed imfs are further divided into 4 categories high frequency sub annual medium frequency annual low frequency multi year to decadal and trend to understand the impact of each frequency category it is removed and the streamflow series is reconstructed based on the remaining imfs this is denoted as frequency removed streamflow and reservoir operating rules extracted from this series as frequency removed rules note that frequency removed streamflow still corresponds to normal streamflow volume also the imf 8 here is not centered on zero thus the mean is added back into the streamflow data after it is removed the frequency removed streamflow results for 2021 2050 e g gcm3 bnu esm fig 3 b show that the high medium and low frequency categories explain much more of the variance in streamflow than the trend by removing one frequency category the frequency removed streamflow will not be affected by the removed frequency thus the performance difference between the frequency removed rules and the rules derived by streamflow data directly frequency complete rules indicates the impact of the removed frequency on reservoir operation 3 3 reservoir operating rules 3 3 1 rbf based reservoir operating rules the radial basis function rbf approach which can ensure flexibility to the structure of the reservoir operating rules and capability to deal with a large number of input variables deisenroth et al 2013 is adopted to determine water release decisions for more applications of rbf models in reservoir operation see giuliani et al 2015 with this approach the reservoir water release decision is defined as 7 q t out u 1 u ω u φ u x t t 1 t 0 ω u 1 8 φ u x t exp m 1 m x t m c m u 2 b u 2 c m u 1 1 b u 0 1 where u is the number of rbfs φ u represents the u th rbf and ω u is the weight of the rbf m is the number of input variables x t and c u and bu are the m dimensional center and radius vectors of the u th rbf respectively reservoir storage inflow and seasonal information τ t where τ t refers to the position of the current period t within a water year e g it equals 1 when t is 1 12 0 1 13 12 1 1 25 12 2 1 considering that there are 12 periods within a water year are selected as input variables i e x t s t q t in τ t the number of rbfs is determined through a sensitivity analysis by increasing the rbfs until the power generation of optimal solutions do not change significantly here four rbfs are used thus m 3 three input variables u 4 four rbfs and 20 parameters in the rbfs based reservoir operating rules three types of reservoir operation strategy or rules are discussed here fig 4 the historical based rules and future based rules represent rules extracted from historical and future reservoir inflow by optimizing the parameters in eqs 7 and 8 with the inputs of historical and future streamflow respectively both approaches produce static rules derived only once during a specific period the future based rules approach is conditioned on perfect future foresight and therefore prescribes operations leading to optimal power generation in the future clearly this represents an upper unrealistic bound on performance of the rbf based rules as a compromise we derive adaptive operating rules based on streamflow data proximal to when decisions are made for example reservoir operating rules extracted from 30 years of streamflow e g 2020 2049 are used for the period 2050 2054 the periods 2020 2049 and 2050 2054 in the example are denoted as the extraction and application periods respectively we recalibrate and validate the rules every 5 10 years and find that updating the rules at 5 year increments performs best and thus this strategy is used for all adaptive rules in this study the comparison of historical based adaptive and future based rules in monthly power generation can be found in appendix s1 fig s1 3 3 2 bma based reservoir operating rules bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical approach to infer a probabilistic scheme by combining multiple possible competing models and has been implemented in reservoir operating rules derivations zhang et al 2015 suppose there exists k adaptive reservoir operating rules r 1 r 2 rk from which k different reservoir release strategies are available at each time period by using the improved ceemdan method streamflow data can be decomposed into many imfs with varying frequency and classified into several categories e g high medium and low frequency and trend in this study k is equal to five r 1 refers to frequency complete rules derived by streamflow data directly and r 2 r 3 r 4 and r 5 refer to frequency removed rules derived by excluding high medium and low frequency and trend information respectively more specifically for r 2 r 3 r 4 and r 5 the associated category of imfs e g high frequency for r 2 is removed from the original streamflow data and the remaining imfs are summed together to form a streamflow series without the corresponding e g high frequency information as described in eqs 7 and 8 the rules r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 and r 5 share the same structure and same number of parameters however their parameters are optimized based on different types of streamflow time series e g complete streamflow and streamflow without high frequency information in this study we optimize the parameters of rules r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 and r 5 individually by using the dynamically dimensioned search dds evolutionary algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 according to the law of total probability the reservoir release probability density function is expressed as follows 9 p q out q in k 1 k p q out r k q in p r k q in where p q out r k q in is the release probability density function based on rule rk and streamflow series qin given the adaptive rule rk qout is the deterministic function of qin i e q out f r k q in thus the p q out r k q in equals one for q out f r k q in otherwise it equals zero p r k q in is the posterior probability of rule rk given the streamflow series qin which describes the probability that rk is suitable to the reservoir operation with qin the p r k q in is an unknown variable and must be estimated from the performance of adaptive rule rk the better rk performs with qin the higher the p r k q in the sum of the posterior model probabilities is equal to one i e k 1 k p r k q in 1 and the p r k q in can be regarded as a weight w k the reservoir release is then the posterior mean of the bma model values 10 q out e q out q in k 1 k f r k q in w k where f r k q in refers to the water release obtained from rule rk by comparing the reservoir operation performance of rules rk k 2 3 4 5 with r 1 during the application period the impact of the frequency high medium and low and trend information can be evaluated the value of the frequency information fk on reservoir operations during the period t 1 t 2 δ t t 2 t 1 in this study is defined as 11 v a l u e f k δ t t t 1 t 2 p q t in r 1 p q t in r k k 2 3 k where p is the function to calculate power generation given a reservoir state both the average power head h t p and reservoir release q t p in eq 1 can be calculated from reservoir inflow q t in and rules rk to get the power generation p q t in r k in most cases frequency complete rules r 1 can capture the main features of frequency information in future streamflow and the v a l u e f k δ t is generally positive however if the k th frequency signal is strong and changes significantly from the extraction to the application periods then the rules derived from the extraction period with that k th frequency signal will perform poorly in the application period for the rules extraction with that signal removed it will do better in the application period and the v a l u e f k δ t can be negative in this case the r 1 will be misleading and the weight applied to the rules extracted without the categorical frequency information should be increased to detect and mitigate the non stationarity associated with different frequency information the bma model is extended to a dynamic model by updating the weight wk based on the value of frequency information through eqs 12 and 13 because rk is obtained from the streamflow during the extraction period q in k the more similar streamflow during application period qin is to q in k the higher the wk thus wk here also reflects the degree of non stationarity in streamflow between q in k and qin 12 z k j r a n k v a l u e f k j 1 values 1 0 5 k 1 k w k j 1 k 1 2 k 13 w k j z k j k 1 k z k j where w k j is the weight applied to releases at stage j r a n k v a l u e f k j 1 values is the descending rank of the frequency information value v a l u e f k j 1 among all ensemble members k members in total more specifically the r a n k v a l u e f k j 1 values will be 1 k for the greatest least information value as defined in eq 11 in this study the weight is updated annually according to the performance of bma based rules considering that the weights are updated much more frequently than the parameters of reservoir operating rules bma model parameters and rbf based rule parameters are not optimized simultaneously initially the weight of r 1 is equal to one i e frequency complete rules are fully trusted w 1 0 is set to one while w k 0 k 2 3 k is set to zero then w k j is updated according to v a l u e f k x a lower v a l u e f k x will lead to a higher weight on the rules extracted without the frequency information f k in this way the p r k q in in eq 9 can be estimated from the performance of reservoir operating rules rk k 1 2 3 4 5 because the frequency complete rules r 1 are effective in most cases additional weight w a is added for each update of z 1 j in the eq 12 as 14 z 1 j r a n k v a l u e f 1 j 1 values 1 0 5 k 1 k w 1 j 1 w a where w a ranges from 0 to 1 and is determined from the validation of the bma based rules at stage j 1 for maximum power generation more specifically increasing w a from 0 to 1 e g 0 0 1 0 2 1 and validating the performance of bma based rules at stage j 1 the w a values that produce the greatest power generation are selected for the stage j fig 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 impacts of streamflow frequency information on adaptive reservoir operations to evaluate the impact of streamflow frequency information on adaptive reservoir operations the frequency removed rules are applied across 2020 2100 for each category and gcm independently and compared against frequency complete rules fig 6 the power generation output brought from all types of frequency information which is calculated by subtracting the output of frequency removed rules with the output of frequency complete rules is predominantly greater than zero implying that including all types of frequency information has a beneficial impact on power generation on average fig 6 additionally the output of frequency removed rules pwof is occasionally greater than the output of frequency complete rules pnorm more specifically pwof pnorm occurs for 32 43 38 and 48 25 36 35 and 44 of operational periods years for high medium low frequency and trend removed rules respectively under scenario rcp4 5 rcp8 5 see bottom fig 6 thus trend information leads to the highest percentage of periods with pwof pnorm which indicates that the trend information is more likely to be non stationary than other frequency categories the average of frequency information value v a l u e f k δ t in eq 11 the difference between power generation of frequency removed rules and frequency complete rules across all gcms lines in fig 7 and the rank of frequency information value bars in fig 7 indicate that high frequency information typically contributes the most to power output whereas the trend provides the least i e the sub seasonal variability short term variability in streamflow has greater impact than the trend long term variability on reservoir operation which is consistent with the findings from herman and giuliani 2018 the medium and low frequency information although contributing less than the high frequency are still appreciable more specifically high frequency removed rules produce approximately 120 mw 200 mw and 180 mw power output more than frequency complete rules during the periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively for rcp4 5 140 mw 240 mw and 290 mw respectively for rcp8 5 except for 2071 2100 under scenario rcp8 5 low frequency information contributes more to power output than the medium frequency information on average for example medium frequency contributes 157 mw and 124 mw surpassing 130 mw and 100 mw from low frequency information annually during 2020 2100 for gcm3 and gcm15 respectively under scenario rcp4 5 the reason is that the medium frequency information has been partially included in the rbf based rules in eqs 7 and 8 in which the input variable τ t the position of the current period t within a water year shares the same annual cycle as the medium frequency the lack of frequency information clearly affects how the adaptive reservoir operating rules are constructed when a certain frequency is removed from the streamflow series during rules extraction the derived reservoir operating rules will fail to appropriately adapt to future streamflow when this feature frequency is influential for reservoir decision making however if the frequency removed rules perform better than the frequency complete rules pwof pnorm in the application period table 2 it can be inferred that non stationarity exists streamflow in the rules extraction period is not consistent with that in the rules application period for the removed frequency it is worth noting that not all situations with pwof pnorm in table 2 indicate streamflow non stationarity instead pwof pnorm during some times could be caused by noise especially when pwof and pnorm are close to each other e g the median frequency for gcm21 under scenario rcp4 5 during 2071 2100 table 2 but the more frequently pwof pnorm occurs the more likely streamflow non stationarity exists it can be inferred that streamflow non stationarity is significant when considering the trend category specifically for 12 gcms during 2011 2040 under scenario rcp4 5 table 2 removing streamflow information at appropriate frequencies e g when pwof pnorm could possibly improve adaptive reservoir operations 4 2 bma based adaptive reservoir operating rules 4 2 1 non stationarity and adaptive reservoir operating rules given the apparent non stationarity in streamflow specified by period gcm and frequency category table 2 future reservoir operations will likely benefit if the non stationarity is detected and considered in the rules extraction stage detection however is challenging given that future streamflow is unknown and the non stationarity characteristics may change throughout the reservoir operation period thus it is assumed that the probability of non stationarity occurrence in the future is related with that in the past more specifically if streamflow non stationarity at one frequency is detected in the past it can be assumed to exist similarly in the future after detection of possible streamflow non stationarity eq 11 water release decision weights for the different rules are updated eqs 12 and 13 fig 8 the weight of frequency complete rules fluctuates with the time but it is always greater than the weight of frequency removed rules also trend removed rules receive the largest weight for most gcms in comparison to other frequency removed rules indicating that streamflow non stationarity is likely most significant for the trend category consistent with the findings in fig 6 and table 2 by updating the weight w k j and merging the water releases obtained from different types of rules through eq 10 the bma based rules incorporate non stationarity from different frequency categories into reservoir decision making in a dynamic way the cumulative mean power output from the bma based rules is compared with normal rules frequency complete rules fig 8 except for gcm3 12 16 and 19 under scenario rcp4 5 and gcm3 9 12 15 18 and 21 under scenario rcp8 5 the bma based outcomes are equal to or superior to outcomes utilizing normal rules more specifically the increase in power output through 2100 from the bma based rules is greater than 10 000 mw month 7 3 gw h for gcm1 2 8 10 11 13 and 20 under rcp4 5 and greater than 20 000 mw month 14 6 gw h for gcm8 and gcm10 under rcp8 5 this increase in power generation cannot necessarily be generalized as different frequency removed categories contribute uniquely by gcm which can be inferred from the weights of different types of reservoir operating rules in fig 8 for example the increase in cumulative output during 2020 2030 for gcm2 under rcp4 5 is mainly supplied by the high frequency removed and low frequency removed rules whereas increases during 2040 2050 for gcm8 under rcp4 5 is attributable to the trend removed and medium frequency removed rules respectively fig 8 a in some cases e g gcm 15 under rcp8 5 bma based rules produce less overall power than normal rules fig 8 b implying that non stationarity is minimally evident throughout the period the weight of normal adaptive rules has its highest value and does not change during 2025 2100 and bma based rules could be inferior to normal rule the performance of bma based rules is further investigated by analyzing changes in monthly mean output fig 9 generally power generation based on the high frequency removed rules illustrates the largest negative difference with normal adaptive rules trend removed rules illustrate the least closest to zero since normal adaptive rules have their parameters updated every 5 years in this case study the streamflow trend becomes mostly insignificant and thus has no measurable impact on power generation although the bma based rules predominantly perform better than or similar to normal rules in cumulative or mean output the improvement is limited and bma based rules may be even inferior to normal rules in some cases the reason is that normal adaptive rules have partially considered possible non stationarity especially based on trend information by recalibrating the parameters every 5 years 4 2 2 performance of bma based rules in firm output in addition to considering maximum power generation the bma based rules are also evaluated for their ability to improve firm power generation for various reliability levels fig 10 reliability is conditioned on each gcm time series individually a 95 reliability implies that a power output threshold is met or exceeded in 95 of the months during the given period for that gcm in general bma based rules improve firm output across most gcms and reliability levels with the largest increase in firm output for reliability of 95 during 2011 2100 greater than350 mw 105 per month for rcp4 5 and 450 mw 180 per month for rcp8 5 fig 10 considering rcp8 5 only the bma based model is superior in nearly all cases thus the bma based rules obtain an advantage over normal adaptive rules mainly in terms of firm output instead of total or mean output as shown in fig 9 b bma based rules could perform worse than normal rules in terms of mean output during 2011 2020 for some gcms such as gcm18 in scenario rcp8 5 the comparison between the bma based and normal rules in density distribution and boxplot of monthly output during 2011 2020 under gcm18 in scenario rcp8 5 fig 11 b and d bma based model results in lower mean output than the model conditioned on normal rules illustrates that bma based rules tend to increase low level 3000 mw outputs and the increment mainly occurs in june july and august comparing the case when the bma based model results in higher mean output than the model using normal rules fig 11 a and c also illustrates the advantage of bma based rules in obtaining greater power generation when the output is lower than 2000 mw this occurs because the bma based rules can avoid extremely high or low releases in mistake by averaging releases from normal frequency complete and frequency removed rules thus the bma based rules can avoid extremely low output and obtain more consistent outputs than normal rules see the density distribution of monthly output in fig 11 a averaging across all gcms the bma based rules produce more firm power output than normal adaptive reservoir operating rules for all levels of reliability from 80 to 100 table 3 for example the percentage increase in firm power output of bma based rules during 2011 2100 ranges from 3 9 to 69 1 and 5 4 to 129 4 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively additionally the percentage increase in firm output increases as the reliability increases to over 35 and 50 during all time periods for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively when the reliability is close to 100 this advantage in firm output is particularly significant when considering demand for high power generation reliability which can be crucial in the manufacturing sector allcott et al 2016 and may lead to economic benefits now and into the future 5 conclusions adaptive reservoir operating rules generally outperform static or historical based rules in water resources management under non stationary conditions however conventional adaptive rules do not consider potential non stationarity at multiple time scales which is rarely investigated this study illustrates a strategy to incorporate streamflow non stationarity information for different time scales simultaneously into adaptive reservoir operating rules and potential value over conventional normal adaptive rules to detect the streamflow non stationarity at different time scales streamflow time series are decomposed into different frequency categories and their impacts on reservoir operation is evaluated subsequently the non stationarity information of different frequency categories is incorporated into adaptive reservoir operating rules using a bma method the performance of the bayesian adaptive reservoir operation framework is evaluated for the gerd reservoir operation in ethiopia using monthly streamflow simulated from 21 gcms under scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 high medium low and trend information extracted from the streamflow time series is shown to affect gerd reservoir operations diversely recognizing streamflow non stationarity at different frequencies and removing it from the original streamflow time series can improve adaptive reservoir operations overall high frequency sub seasonal information has the greatest impact on power generation while the most significant non stationarity in streamflow is associated with the trend information for adaptive gerd reservoir operation additionally the bayesian adaptive framework can recognize streamflow non stationarity at different frequency categories and mitigate its impacts on normal adaptive reservoir operating rules thus the bayesian adaptive rules predominantly outperform normal adaptive rules considering power generation especially in terms of firm power output in general firm output increases under the bayesian framework as the power generation reliability increases this implies that the bayesian adaptive rules are preferable when high power generation reliability is required although the bayesian adaptive rules can outperform conventional adaptive rules in terms of total power generation and firm power output simultaneously for some gcms such as gcm10 under rcp4 5 and gcm8 under rcp8 5 overall the bayesian adaptive rules do not consistently provide superior performance given that streamflow non stationarity may be attributed to many factors e g emission of greenhouse gases changes in catchment characteristics it is challenging to accurately identify all non stationary components and incorporate them into water resources management the findings in this paper not only illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed bayesian adaptive framework but also reveal the possibility of tackling adaptive water resources operation problems in the future from the perspective of time and frequency domains in that way the non stationary features in streamflow at multiple time scales can be recognized with the support of time frequency analysis and incorporated into water resources decision making future research efforts could focus on expanding and improving non stationarity source detection and considering broader envelops of uncertainty e

4859,accurate quantitative precipitation forecasts qpf at high spatial and temporal resolution are a perquisite for urban flood prediction commonly lagrangian extrapolation of the rainfall patterns recognized by radar data forms the basis of such forecasts for the near future up to 2 h lead time referred here as nowcasting nevertheless due to the intermittent nature of the rainfall at such fine scales the predictability of storms is limited to about 20 min the predictability loss is caused mainly by the inability of the radar to capture the true rainfall field and because the lagrangian persistence is unable to model the temporal evolution of the rainfall field in this study we focus on the first problem on how to extend the predictability limit of rainfall at such scales by improving the rainfall field fed into the nowcast model to overcome the errors associated with the radar intensities merging techniques between radar and gauge measurements are advised among different employed techniques mean field bias kriging with external drift and quantile mapping based correction the conditional merging between the radar and rainfall gauge measurements seems to capture at best the spatial and temporal patterns of the rainfall at the desired fine scales 1 km2 and 5 min moreover when fed to two nowcast models the conditional merging doesn t only increase the predictability of storms from 20 min to longer than 1 h but as well it improves the agreement of radar based qpf with the gauge measurements the results are drawn from 110 events observed in the period 2000 2018 by the hannover radar germany in an area with a radius of 115 km where 100 recording gauges were available as the urban hydrological models are commonly validated on gauge measurements nowcasting with conditionally merged data provides a useful tool for urban flood prediction for lead times up to 1 h keywords radar data conditional merging rainfall nowcast lagrangian persistence urban flood forecast 1 introduction urban models are built and used to model the dynamics of pluvial floods from the given rainfall input data as the models simulate processes that are quite fast and at specific locations the rainfall input fed to the model should be provided at very fine resolution typically at 1 5 min and 100 m2 1 km2 berne et al 2004 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015b therefore quantitative precipitation forecasts qpf at such resolution should also be provided when forecasting pluvial floods hence the numerical weather predictions nwp are of little value for direct urban flood forecasting as they can only produce reliable results for 10 km2 and hourly volumes of rainfall golding 2009 kato et al 2017 šálek et al 2006 surcel et al 2015 gauge recordings are typically considered the ground truth even though they have an error of 7 depending of the rainfall intensity due to the wind wetting and evaporations effect ciach 2003 they capture quite well the temporal variability of rainfall at 1 min time steps nevertheless gauge recordings are point measurements that don t provide sufficient information about the spatial variability quirmbach schultz 2002 radar data on the other hand can capture the spatial temporal variability of rainfall at 1 km2 and 5 min time steps and form the basis for tracking and extrapolating rainfall storms in the near future berenguer et al 2012 jensen et al 2015 lin et al 2005 zahraei et al 2012 the radar based nowcast is typically done in three steps 1 rainfall identification initializing the nowcast 2 rainfall tracking calculating the displacement vectors of the storm and 3 rainfall prediction extrapolating the rainfall field into the future at different lead times based on the displacement vectors since the rainfall has to be observed in order to be nowcasted the radar based nowcasts are not able to predict the birth of rainfall storms and hence their skill is mostly useful for lead times up to 3 h hence radar nowcasting and not forecasting dixon wiener 1993 han et al 2009 johnson et al 1998 rinehart garvey 1978 for the extrapolation in the future two types of persistence are commonly employed a eulerian keeping rainfall position and intensity constant and b lagrangian keeping the motion and intensity constant germann et al 2006 as suggested first by lorenz 1973 and then approved by different studies the eulerian persistence can be useful only at very short lead times 5 10 min while the lagrangian persistence up to 20 25 min lead times grecu krajewski 2000 kato et al 2017 ruzanski et al 2011 lagrangian persistence even though a better option than the eulerian one is still far from a perfect model it doesn t represent the true ever changing nature of the rainfall and thus it is not able to provide useful qpf for lead times longer than 30 min hence there is a predictability limit that this model independent of the event type either stratiform or convective cannot overpass further attempts have been made to increase the predictability limits of radar nowcast models by employing either a blending of the nwp with radar data or a stochastic generator bowler et al 2006 seed 2003 a nwp blending with lagrangian based radar nowcast can give insight about the storm birth while a stochastic generator can add noise to the lagrangian persistence to account for the erratic nature of the rainfall due to the high uncertainty of the rainfall nowcast at such fine scales probabilistic nowcasts are more preferred than deterministic ones and usually are tackled by generating ensemble nowcast foresti et al 2016 codo and rico ramirez 2018 and jasper tönnies et al 2018 used such blending probabilistic models to increase the predictability limit of relatively low intensity thresholds up to 1 h even though the blending with nwp and the stochastic generator improve the nowcast when compared to the simple lagrangian persistence it is clear that there is a limit that these more complex models cannot overcome mainly due to our inability of knowing the true rainfall field therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the improvement that can be reached in the rainfall predictability and qpf due to an improved rainfall product even though the target is clear there are still some questions that need to be addressed before the investigation i determining the predictability limit first and the most important is to determine the estimation of the predictability limit the easiest way to define it is as the lead time when the nowcast skill becomes useless for the application at hand typically in rainfall nowcast or forecast categorical criteria are used to assess the ability of the model to predict intensities higher or lower than a fixed threshold for example roc score 0 5 as in codo and rico ramirez 2018 and jasper tönnies et al 2018 or ets score 0 3 as in foresti et al 2016 and ruzanski et al 2011 nevertheless it is still arguable if these tools are useful in evaluating qpf for urban flood prediction for various reasons i it is very difficult to associate urban floods with an intensity threshold ii in order to predict the flood levels and inundation areas the temporal distribution is very important iii the intensities considered for the categorical criteria are quite low as for high intensities that may cause pluvial floods the nowcast skill decreases very rapidly with the lead time pulkkinen et al 2019 and iv as the gauge data are considered the truth for validation these fraction skill scores cannot be calculated from discrete point measurements contrary to the categorical criteria germann and zawadzki 2002 used the cross correlation between the nowcasted and observed rainfall fields at each lead time as a tool to measure the nowcast skill this cross correlation is assumed to follow an exponential law and thus the predictability limit is considered as the de correlation time or the lead time when the integral of this cross correlation function falls below the value 1 e 0 37 zawadzki 1973 the de correlation time seems to give a better insight about the skill of the nowcast for urban flood application than the categorical criteria nevertheless the temporal structure of the rainfall is still not accounted for therefore there is a need for other additional criteria to evaluate the skill of the model to capture the temporal structure of rainfall at fine scales typically when radar data are assessed for urban application continuous criteria are calculated like the correlation mean squared errors or the volume bias of course there are no limits known for the mean squared errors and the volume bias as for the correlation but when used together with the de correlation time it can give a wider view on how the nowcast model is behaving in regard to the urban flood application ii determining the reference true rainfall second it is important to determine the true observed rainfall to use as a reference most of the nowcast studies assess the model skill based on the radar data fed to the model nevertheless due to the indirect measurement of the intensities radar data are prone to various sources of errors which usually cause an underestimation of the rainfall intensities berne krajewski 2013 curry 2012 needless to point it out underestimated intensities fed to the nowcast will not be useful at all for the urban flood application of course an urban model can be calibrated on radar data with observed water levels in the city but however as the underestimation of the radar measurements is not consistent throughout event types it will cause an additional bias in the predicted flood levels lau et al 2006 moreover water level monitoring in the city are scarce which is an ongoing problem in urban model calibration and validation van dijk et al 2014 often urban models are calibrated only partially or not at all and typically validated on gauge recordings codo rico ramirez 2018 quirmbach schultz 2002 thorndahl et al 2016 thus for the time being it seems that if a rainfall nowcast exhibits a good skill compared to gauge measurements there is a good probability that the urban flood forecast will be useful however it is important to note that the radar based nowcasts should not be expected to be exactly the same with gauge measurements due to the scale inconsistency between radar scans and gauge recordings the former represents a scan of the atmosphere while the other a volume accumulation at a point location iii improving radar gauge agreement issuing urban flood nowcasts when radar data are fed into an urban model validated on gauge recordings is quite problematic the assessment is not fair and the nowcasting skill will suffer greatly thus it is crucial to achieve a better radar product by improving the agreement between radar and gauge measurements typically in nowcasting the radar data are adjusted with a factor variable or constant in space or time to meet the gauge observations the simplest and most famous of such application is the mean field bias correction mfb as it is quite easy and fast nanding et al 2015 smith krajewski 1991 nevertheless the main drawback of mfb is that scaling with one single factor the whole radar image can cause very high bias in the temporal structure of the rainfall at the point scale depending on the event type and on the distribution of the gauge network shehu 2020 contrary to the nowcast application many other methods have been investigated in hind cast mode in order to achieve a better radar product these methods as stated in ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 can be classified in three groups a correcting radar data based on the gauge information where mfb also is included another method is the correction based on the quantile mapping qq of both radar and gauge data as implemented in rabiei and haberlandt 2015 the application on daily data proved to be useful nevertheless an application on fine scales has not yet been reported b adding the radar information to the gauge interpolation typically ordinary kriging ok is used for the interpolation of gauge intensities but as the method is unbiased in space it tends to smooth and underestimate the spatial variability of rainfall especially for fine scales lebrenz and bárdossy 2019 thus instead of ok kriging with external drift ked is used haberlandt 2007 it has been proven that ked with radar data yields better results than the ok berndt et al 2014 c merging the two sources with equal importance the most mentioned methods in the literature are the cokriging cok bayesian merging bm and conditional merging cm the cok goes a step further than ked and models the spatial variability between gauges based on the linear relationship between the two data sources krajewski 1987 nevertheless even though the cok represents a more complex system than ked it cannot outperform the ked schuurmans et al 2007 velasco forero et al 2009 bm on the other side accounts the uncertainties of both radar and gauge recordings and implements a kalman filter to combine both sources in proportion to their uncertainties wang et al 2013 applied on the 5 min and 1 km2 scales ochoa rodriguez et al 2015a found out that bm and ked have very similar performances lastly the cm combines the interpolation of gauges with the spatial variance of the radar data sinclair pegram 2005 berndt et al 2014 investigated the use of cm towards ked on 10 min and 1 km2 and the results indicate that the cm outperforms the ked other studies done by nanding et al 2015 and kumar et al 2016 using another version of cm on coarser resolution found out that the ked is in fact the superior method it seems that the most popular method for the merging of the two data sources is ked ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 nevertheless the cm application as proposed by berndt et al 2014 and the qq proposed by rabiei and haberlandt 2015 seem promising methods however their performance on fine scales has still to be proven therefore four methods will be tested in this study to check their ability to yield a better rainfall field for the nowcast model the mfb qq ked and cm the best merging method will then be used to investigate how an improved rainfall field is affecting the predictability limit of rainfall nowcasting at fine scales suitable for the urban flood prediction even though a probabilistic nowcast is more desired at such scales here only deterministic nowcasts will be used for the investigation the reason behind this is that the effects of an improved rainfall field on the deterministic nowcast can be estimated fast and easy if an improved rainfall field leads to an improved deterministic nowcast it will open the door for investigating the role of an improved input to the probabilistic nowcast two simple nowcast models based on the lagrangian persistence are used for the investigation a hyratrac which is an object oriented approach where individual storms are tracked and extrapolated independently into the future krämer 2008 schellart et al 2014 b lucas kanade which is a field oriented approach where an optical flow is computed for the whole radar image and each radar grid cell is moved into the future according to the local displacement vectors lucas kanade 1981 luk et al 2001 the reason why two different rainfall tracking approaches are used is that to the authors knowledge there is no clear evidence in the literature on which one performs better while the object oriented approach is considered better mainly for convective events it still has issues with the adequate estimation of the velocities and managing the splitting merging of storm cells pierce et al 2004 on the other hand the field based approach is better for distinctive movements for stratiform events and has gained popularity in the recent years han et al 2009 thus an additional objective of the study is to investigate how the different nowcast models respond to the improved rainfall field under different storm types 2 study area and data the study area is located in northern germany as shown in fig 1 left and lies within the hannover radar range as indicated in fig 1 right the radar station is situated at the hannover airport and it covers an area with a radius of 115 km as illustrated in fig 1 right the majority of the region is flat with elevation barely reaching 200 m the only mountains present in the region are in the south east where the harz mountains are located with an elevation up to 1141 m a s l the study area is in the proximity of the north sea and thus the dominant climate is the maritime characterized by cool summers and not so cold winters with high humidity throughout the year and low sunshine duration in winter the precipitation is mainly of a stratiform type in winter caused by the westerlies air masses coming from the atlantic ocean that are characterized by long and low intensity rainfall b convective type in summer caused by the radiation instabilities at local scales that sometimes reach high intensity for a short duration of time and c orographic type throughout the year at the south east of the region caused by the presence of the harz mountains all together 100 recording gauges at 1 min resolution were available from german weather service dwd and are shown in fig 1 right the measuring devices are tipping buckets mainly from period 2000 2004 with resolution 0 1 mm error 2 and weighting gravimeter gauges period 2004 2018 with resolution 0 01 mm error 0 02 0 04 mm the gauge data have been checked for their plausibility and are accumulated to 5 min time steps in agreement with the radar data the hannover c band radar data were also provided by dwd with reflectivity measured at an azimuth angle of 1 and at 5 min scans winterrath et al 2012 the reflectivity measurements were converted to intensity according to marshall palmer relationship with the coefficients a 256 and b 1 42 the radar data were corrected from the static clutters and erroneous beams and converted to cartesian coordinate system 1 km2 and 5 min as described in berndt et al 2014 since the radar data are available from 2000 and on 110 events were extracted from the period 2000 2018 which are characterized by different intensities and duration the events were grouped into 5 categories according to their properties 1 simple convective c rainfall storms that are quite small 100 km2 short in duration 4 h and have varying intensities 2 meso scale type 1 convective events sc1 rainfall storms that are large 100 km2 have high intensity 7 mm 5 min but are short in duration 4 h 3 meso scale type 2 convective events sc2 rainfall storms that are large 100 km2 have low intensity 7 mm 5 min and are short in duration 4 h 4 stratiform events s rainfall storms that are very large 100 km2 have low intensity 7 mm 5 min and long duration 4 h and finally 5 mixed events m rainfall events that are large 100 km2 have long duration 4 h and high intensity 7 mm 5 min the number of each event group and the respective properties are illustrated in fig 2 3 methods 3 1 merging methods from the five methods employed here to improve the rainfall field three of them are based on kriging systems it should be mentioned that kriging systems assume that the rainfall is normally distributed in space however this is not the case for the rainfall fields at very fine temporal scales 5 min and especially for convective events as the kriging systems use an unbiased estimator blue best linear unbiased estimator to optimize their weights over and under estimation may occur lebrenz and bárdossy 2019 a transformation to normality may be implemented to the rainfall data in order to improve such kriging estimates for instance a log transformation sideris et al 2014 square root transformation schuurmans et al 2007 or a box cox transformation erdin 2013 however following the work of some other studies berndt et al 2014 ehret 2002 goudenhoofdt delobbe 2009 kumar et al 2016 nanding et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015a velasco forero et al 2009 and the risk of introducing instabilities due to the transformation jewell gaussiat 2015 no transformation of the rainfall field is performed here prior to the application of the kriging methods 3 1 1 ordinary kriging ok ordinary kriging ok is one of the most favourite and simple geostatistics techniques used for rainfall interpolation in the geostatistics techniques the expected value of the random process e is assumed to be constant m throughout the field and the covariance c of two random variables depends only on the distance vector between them h this statement forms the second order hypothesis and is illustrated by eqs 1 and 2 however often the second order hypothesis is difficult to meet that is why the intrinsic hypothesis is used instead in ok interpolation the intrinsic hypothesis is less restricting as it assumes that the variance var at two locations at distance h u and u h is only dependent at the distance between them h eq 3 1 e z u h e z u m 2 c h e z u h m z u m 3 var z u h z u e z u h z u 2 2 γ h a semi variogram ɣ h here referred for simplicity as a variogram can describe the change of the variance as a function of the distance h between every two locations the typical used theoretical variogram for the interpolation of rainfall is the exponential one as described in the eq 4 haberlandt 2007 4 γ h c o c 1 e x p h a where c is the sill co the nugget and a the range of the variogram ideally the theoretic variogram is fitted independently for each time step to the empirical values nevertheless as concluded by verworn and haberlandt 2011 the choice of variogram has little effect on the interpolation performance following the work done by berndt et al 2014 seasonal theoretical variograms were fitted to the winter and summer empirical variograms through the method of least squares the empirical variograms were averaged for the winters and summers of the years 2011 2012 according to eq 5 5 γ avg h 1 n t 1 n γ t h var z t where t is a given time step n number of time steps in a season var zt the variance of the target variable z at time step t the achieved parameter values are given in table 1 for a the summer variogram displaying the spatial structure of convective events under the assumption that convective events mainly occur in summer and b the winter variogram displaying the spatial structure of stratiform events under the assumption that they occur mainly in winter 3 1 2 kriging with external drift ked in the kriging with external drift ked a secondary variable is introduced in the system unlike the ok the intrinsic hypothesis is left out and the expected value e of the target variable z at a location u is depending linearly on a second variable y as illustrated in eq 6 theoretically the variogram of the ked is computed from the residuals between the target and the secondary variable nevertheless for simplicity as shown in delrieu et al 2014 the ok variograms can be used instead and still produce very similar results thus here the seasonal variograms are used to perform the ked interpolation with radar data as a secondary variable 6 e z u y 1 u y 2 u y m u b 0 k 1 m b k y k u 3 1 3 conditional merging cm in conditional merging cm the combination of the radar and gauge intensities is done in five steps as described in berndt et al 2014 for a given time step t the gauge data information is interpolated with ok see parameters at table 1 then the gauge respective grid cells from the radar data are as well interpolated with the same method as in the ok of the gauges same variograms are used a deviation grid is calculated between the original radar and the obtained field from the interpolation of gauge respective grid cells this deviation grid is finally added to the ok interpolation of gauge data additionally to these five steps two further conditions are added to the product in order to avoid negative rainfall and to keep the storm structures as dictated by the radar data at the first case all the negative rainfall is set to zero while at the second case all the locations where no rainfall was detected from the radar are assigned as zero this means that the final product is not completely unbiased in space as the ok as it might contain errors at the station locations depending on whether the conversion of radar reflectively to intensity was good enough to capture the rain non rain process the final step is different from the conditional merging employed in berndt et al 2014 however it is necessary to ensure a proper recognition and tracking of the rainfall storms 3 1 4 mean field bias correction mfb the mean field bias mfb or the correction factor is calculated for each gauge based on the one hour accumulated rainfall the gauge correction factors are then averaged over the whole area to obtain a single average correction factor or mean field bias as illustrated by the eq 7 for a current time step the radar image at time t is corrected by the rainfall accumulations of the past hour the period from time t 60 min to time t 7 b t j 0 w i 1 n g i t j j 0 w i 1 n r i t j where t is the current time step n the number of available gauges w 12 as number of time steps in the one hour accumulation g represents the gauge intensities and r the radar intensities for the location i 3 1 5 quantile mapping based correction qq as described in rabiei and haberlandt 2015 the intensities of the radar image are manipulated by the probability distribution function pdf of the gauge data the procedure is based on the theoretical fitted gamma distribution on both the radar and gauge data sets for a given radar image at time step t the quantile based on the radar pdf corresponding at each grid cell intensity is used to find the respective intensity from the gauge pdf the corresponding gauge intensity is used to substitute the original intensity of the grid cell as illustrated in eq 8 8 z r x t f obs t 1 f rad t z r x t where zr is the radar intensity at location x and time step t frad is the quantile from the non exceeding probability of radar data at time step t corresponding to zr fobs 1 is the gauge intensity corresponding to the quantile frad taken from the non exceeding probability of gauge data at time step t and the z r is the replaced radar intensity at the location x and time step t for the method to be successful enough observations should be available for both data sets in order to ensure a proper fit of the theoretical gamma distribution for radar data there are enough grid cells to ensure a proper fit nevertheless the fitting of the gauge pdf can be problematic since for each time step at most 100 observations are available this problem can either be solved by increasing the sample size in space through the interpolation of gauge data or by increasing the sample size in time by pooling the gauge observations from a fixed time window the interpolation of gauge data would introduce new uncertainty to the correction method that is why here the assimilation of the data from a fixed time window is employed prior results for this case study indicated that a window of three hours is enough to ensure that the data can yield stable parameters for the gamma distribution and that intensities from different rainfall mechanisms are not pooled together shehu 2020 the method of l moments is used to estimate the parameters of the gamma distribution 3 1 6 online application of the merging methods as documented in berndt et al 2014 the spatial and temporal smoothing of radar data improves the agreement between radar and gauge data a prior investigation indicated that the smoothed radar data are a better product than the raw ones shehu 2020 thus temporally over last 10 min and spatially 5 by 5 km filter smoothed radar data were used as an input to the merging methods since the methods are run on nowcasting mode or online mode only past information to the current time step t 0 can be used for the merging the two kriging methods cm and ked do not need additional data from the past to merge the two data sources however since the smoothed radar data are used as an input for both of them they indirectly include radar information from the last observed two time steps 10 min for the mfb correction the time window from t 60 min to t 0 is used while for the qq correction from t 180 min to t 0 these windows were chosen based on a prior study shehu 2020 among different temporal windows as they showed the best performance criteria 3 2 radar based nowcast models the hyratrac nowcast model was developed by krämer 2008 and it performs the nowcast in three steps a identification of individual storms b tracking of individual storms and c extrapolation with lagrangian persistence of the individual storms at different lead times in the future the nowcast is initialized if a group of radar grid cells 64 has a reflectivity higher than z 20dbz while storms are recognized as convective if a group bigger than 16 radar grid cells has an intensity higher than 25 dbz and as stratiform if a group bigger than 128 radar grid cells has an intensity higher than 20 dbz the tracking of the individual storms in consecutive images is done by the optimization of the cross correlation between the last 2 images t 0 and t 5 min and local displacement vectors for each storm are calculated in case a storm is just recognized then global displacement vectors based on cross correlation of the entire radar image are assigned to the storm lastly the storm region is moved to the future using the last observed displacement vector without any changes in the inner structure of the storm the intensities are held constant the lucas kanade flow model unlike hyratrac calculates the optical flow on the entire radar image as illustrated in eq 9 the nowcast is initialized when a threshold of 20 dbz is reached by at least 25 grid cells the equation of the optical flow is solved according to the lucas kanade solution where the last 3 radar images are used as input t t 5 min and t 10 min lucas kanade 1981 once the flow field has been determined the radar grid cells are moved inside the image with the respective flow vectors here the lk method implemented in pysteps a python library for nowcasting was employed for the nowcast pulkkinen et al 2019 9 i x y t i x dx y dy t dt where i is the intensity at location x y and time step t and the displacement vector is expressed by dx dy for the period dt the intensity i is considered constant from the time t to t dt and only the position is changing 3 3 measuring predictability and performance 3 3 1 nowcast performance and predictability the predictability limit is referred here as the lead time where the observed and the nowcasted radar images become de correlated the spatial cross correlation between the two falls below the limit value 1 e 0 37 as illustrated in eq 10 since the gauge recordings used as a reference are available only at specific location only the respective 100 grid cells of the radar data are used for the estimation of the predictability and performance the predictability is then calculated based on the input radar data here referred to as radar predictability and based on the reference gauge data here referred to as gauge predictability the former describes the predictability limit of the model while the latter indicates the practical predictability limit of the rainfall the end goal for urban flood applications in additional to the de correlation time the root mean square error is also calculated in space for both reference data radar input and gauges according to eq 11 de correlation time τtl the lead time when the spatial cross correlation between nowcasted and observed data becomes lower than 0 37 unlike the germann and zawadzki 2002 here the pearson correlation is used pixel wise based on the 100 gauge grid cells locations instead of the integral of the cross correlation function over the

corresponding to gauge location j in gauge predictability performance the obs represent the gauge measurement at location j the performance criteria in eqs 10 11 are calculated for each event as averages from the gauge locations over all the 5 min time steps in an event to investigate how well the nowcast model can predict the temporal distribution of rainfall at specific locations four additional criteria were introduced as indicated below the temporal time series for each grid cell corresponding to each gauge location as nowcasted for a specific lead time and observed either by gauge or radar input are used to compute the temporal criteria and later are averaged over the gauge locations per each event temporal correlation between the nowcasted and observed time series at each gauge location as described by eq 12 it can be useful as well as an indicator about the de correlation time the lead time when the temporal correlation falls below the limit 0 37 to distinguish from the spatial predictability limit in eq 10 the de correlation time from the temporal correlation will be referred to as the temporal predictability limit and it is calculated both on gauge and

the same performance criteria as illustrated by the eqs 10 15 are employed to investigate which merging method is providing the best rainfall field in the case of merging method performance the lead time is set to zero tl 0 and the for symbol represents the merged or the radar rainfall field as a cross validation is computational demanding a split sampling validation is used instead thus from 100 gauge locations 68 gauges were used for the merging of the methods and 32 for the validation of the methods the gauges for each group were selected randomly and are illustrated in fig 1 right note that the split sampling of the gauges is only necessary for the comparison of the merging methods and not for the performance assessment of the nowcast models a summary of the merging methods used in this study is given in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 radar and gauge discrepancy the radar based qpf cannot display a better agreement with the gauge observation than the one displayed by the radar input rr in other words the radar input and the gauge already display a discrepancy that in the radar based qpf will propagate and increase with the lead time thus before applying the nowcast models it is important to check what is the actual performance of the radar when compared to the ground truth the gauge data for the 5 events types fig 3 illustrates the performance criteria of the radar data as expected for convective events which have high intensity due to the reflectively loss this discrepancy is quite high and characterized by very low temporal and spatial correlation 0 2 and 0 3 respectively and high peak bias almost 100 the rmse is low compared to the other types of the events but this is because the ratio of no rain time steps is higher in this type of event for stratiform events that have a very large coverage due to the attenuation of the radar signal the performance is quite poor this is displayed by the low spatial correlation value of 0 4 a very high peak bias 100 and the highest peak shift recorded 10 20 min among the different events of course the rmse is low around 2 mm h for both temporal and spatial rmse but this is affected by the low intensities that characterize this type of events the meso scale type 2 convective events which are not small in coverage but small in intensity seem to be best captured from the radar data with spatial correlation reaching 0 5 low temporal and spatial rmse at the range of 2 3 mm h as in the stratiform events on the other hand the meso scale type 1 convective events that are larger in coverage but with higher intensity are captured a bit worse than the type 2 convective these events suffer mainly from high rmse 3 6 mm h due to the presence of very high intensities nevertheless they show the best peak bias with some events showing 10 underestimation of the peak volume lastly the mixed events characterized by very large coverage and very high intensities display low correlation at range 0 3 0 4 and high rmse as in the case of the meso scale type 1 convective events a consistent temporal peak shift of 10 min is visible throughout most of the events this is in accordance with the expected wind drift discrepancy as reported by bárdossy and pegram 2013 and as well supports the temporal smoothing of the radar data with a 10 min window in terms of spatial predictability only the meso scale type 2 convective events display a cross correlation higher than the predictability limit followed up by the stratiform type opposite to this the temporal correlation is much lower than the threshold 0 37 where only some of the stratiform events exhibit correlations higher than this limit as the results indicate there is a big gap between the gauge and radar data and since the correlation is quite low it is not possible to expect gauge predictability from the two nowcast models for lead times longer than 10 min next both nowcast models were run with radar data as input in order to assess the predictability limit averaged for each event type fig 4 illustrates the gauge predictability and the performance of the two selected models while fig 5 illustrates the radar predictability limit and the respective performance as expected due to the discrepancy between radar and gauge data the gauge predictability is below the limit within 5 min lead time for both of the models it is clear that due to the discrepancy of the input radar data with the gauge recordings shown in fig 3 independent of the nowcast model either an object oriented or a field approach the qpf are useless neither temporal or spatial cross correlation is higher than the threshold 0 37 for any type of events the temporal distribution of the rainfall at the local scales seems to be captured quit poorly even for the 5 min lead times with peak bias starting from a 100 underestimation and peak shifts increasing greatly with longer lead times thus a merging method between the radar and gauge is essential to provide better qpf at the point scale nevertheless when comparing the nowcast models with the radar input the models exhibit spatial radar predictability limit up to 30 min depending on the event type and the model type what is interesting to see is that the storms that display higher radar predictability in the hyratrac model are not the same as in the lk model for instance in hyratrac the meso scale convective events are the ones to be best predicted but they display the lowest predictability when nowcasted with lk method vice versa for the small convective events the lk predictability is much higher than for the hyratrac one the inconsistencies between the model responses emphasize the differences caused by different advection calculation schemes and that for specific storms the object oriented might be better than the field oriented one 4 2 merging methods performance the results from the split validation of the selected merging methods from table 2 together with the respective single source data rr and ok interpolation of gauge data are shown in fig 6 for each of the event types first even though the gauge data are considered the ground truth when interpolating the gauge intensities the temporal and spatial cross correlation is lost both are lower than 0 3 for ok and the bias even though small in space is quite high in the time from 100 to 50 estimated bias at the temporal peak most of the merging methods are dominant to the single source data either gauge or radar which emphasizes once again the need for merging the two data sources in order to obtain a better rainfall product among all the methods the cm and the qq are the ones that stand out as they can maintain a high temporal and spatial cross correlation higher than 0 5 while displaying relative low errors qq is good particularly in reducing the spatial errors rmse lower than 2 mm h and maintaining a high correlation higher than 0 5 nevertheless the peak suffers greatly from underestimation more than 90 and 10 to 15 min delay this is also the case for the mfb correction the spatial cross correlation is as good as the qq higher than 0 5 and rmse roughly 1 mm h higher than qq nevertheless the temporal peak bias is high 70 although better than qq this makes sense as the methods are applied spatially with no regards to the temporal distribution of the rainfall at a local scale ked on the other side improves the performance towards the ok however the correlation is not as high as in qq cm or mfb 0 2 0 3 units lower than these three methods and the peak shift is greatly anticipated more than 10 15 min earlier it seems that the ked inherits the poor performance of the ok and the inclusion of the radar data as an external drift only improves the correlation towards ok cm on the other hand stands out from the group as it can maintain a high temporal and spatial correlation 0 5 0 7 for all the event types while having a low peak shift 0 5 min delay and bias 20 40 underestimation even though not the same can be said for the rmse generally 0 1 to 1 mm h higher than the qq but dependent on the event type the method is the most promising one as it can capture the temporal patterns of the local rainfall quite well since this is important for the urban flood forecasting the cm method is chosen as the most adequate method for yielding better qpf regarding the application of the merging methods on different event types the stratiform mixed and the meso scale convective events display higher correlation than the simple convective ones thus a higher predictability should be expected from these storms although the simple convective events display lower peak bias and shift among the merging methods like mfb qq and cm the performance seems to be relatively same for all event types ked is performing poorly particularly for the small convective events whilst it performs better for the large scale events it seems that the variogram describing the summer events is unable to represent correctly the spatial distribution of the small scale events for these events the use of radar data is clearly a plus the findings of this study may be surprising as ked is often the best performing kriging method in the literature e g ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 it is worth to mention that most of the studies have done a comparison of the ked and cm at coarser resolution hourly or daily temporal resolutions based on corrected and adjusted radar data high quality radar data such as schuurmans et al 2007 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 velasco forero et al 2009 erdin 2013 nanding et al 2015 as suggested by berndt et al 2014 the performance of ked is quite sensitive to the temporal resolution and the quality of the radar data thus the results shown here do not contradict the fact that at hourly accumulations on better quality radar data and specific station density the ked may perform better than the cm other studies comparing these methods in finer temporal scales are for instance sideris et al 2014 jewell and gaussiat 2015 berndt et al 2014 and ehret 2002 in both berndt et al 2014 and ehret 2002 the cm outperformed the edk for 10 min temporal resolutions nevertheless this was not the case in sideris et al 2014 and jewell and gaussiat 2015 it should be noted that the performance of the ked in this study is not worse than the ked performance displayed by these two studies in jewell and gaussiat 2015 the rmse of ked ranges from 1 to 2 to 2 4 mm h for 15 min time steps and in sideris et al 2014 from 0 2 to 0 4 at one case 0 9 mm per 10 min while in the present study the spatial rmse of the ked ranges from 1 to 3 mm h or 0 15 0 5 mm 10 min depending of the event type the difference is not in the performance of the ked but actually in the performance of the cm for the case study at hand and in berndt et al 2014 and ehret 2002 the cm performed much better than in the other two studies the difference lays in the temporal and spatial smoothing of the radar data prior to merging in order to account for the wind drift at point scales the investigation done by shehu 2020 for different temporal and spatial smoothing windows indicated that the performance of the cm improves significantly by smoothing the radar data over last 10 min and over 25 grid cells lastly in terms of rmse the ked performs actually better than cm the advantages of the cm are mainly in the temporal performances lower peak bias and shift and higher correlation which are not typical performances used in these studies as stated in erdin 2013 the cm is better in terms of dry wet distinction and representation of intense rainfall of course the ked results may improve if a log or box cox transformation is done to the data nevertheless this would favour as well the application of the cm more research has to be conducted in order to estimate which one is the superior method and the reader has to keep in mind that the results shown here are valid for the given study area station density and radar data quality 4 3 nowcast performance and predictability the cm is selected as the best performing merging method the whole available gauges in total 100 are used here to perform the conditional merging between the radar and gauge intensities which serves as an input for the nowcasting models the radar predictability and performance are then calculated with the input merged radar as a reference thus here it will be referred to as merged radar predictability performance since as described in section 3 1 3 errors are expected at the gauge locations due to the reflectivity intensity conversion fig 7 illustrates the resulting discrepancy between the merged and the gauge data in contrast to the discrepancy results from fig 3 the performance of the merged data is clearly improved for all the event types both temporal correlation and spatial cross correlation are above the predictability limit 0 8 indicating thus that the gauge predictability will be much higher than in the case of the radar based qpf moreover the peak shift is completely eliminated 0 min the temporal rmse is clearly reduced 1 5 2 mm h and the bias is very close to zero 20 the large scale events seem to be better represented from the merged data with the simple convective events displaying the worst performance among all event types such performance should as well be expected on the merged radar and gauge predictability of the nowcast models fed on cm data fig 8 illustrates the results from the hyratrac and lk nowcasts when compared to the gauge data thus the gauge predictability as expected the predictability limit has increased to beyond 30 min the lk qpfs seem to be the most affected by the implementation of the merged data for all the events the predictability and performance has increased considerably beyond 30 min the stratiform events are the ones that profit the most from the merging technique with predictability limit reaching up to 60 min followed up by the large scale convective and mixed events whose predictability limit reaches up to 30 min lastly the simple convective events show the worst performance with predictability limit up to 20 min within the first hour the peak shift remains between 10 min and the peak bias below 50 indicating that even for the urban flood forecast the qpf can yield reasonable results for lead times between 30 and 60 min this however is not the case for the hyratrac derived qpfs the spatial gauge predictability has increased up to 20 min while the temporal one up to 10 min still the small scale convective events with high intensity are represented very poorly from the hyratrac this indicates that the identification matching and tracking of convective storm cells is not done appropriately which compromises the performance of this nowcast approach moreover within 30 min there is an almost linear increment of the peak bias up to 100 and peak shift up to 30 min fig 9 illustrates the predictability and the performance compared to the merged radar input for both of the nowcast models as seen with the gauge predictability the merged radar predictability has as well improved considerably due to the merged data and displays a similar pattern among the events as in the gauge predictability the lk yields the best results the spatial de correlation time has been extended beyond 60 min for the larger scale events and to more than 45 min for small scale convective events the peak shift is kept very small up to 10 min delay for most events for lead times up to one hour while the peak bias has improved mainly for the large scale events opposite to lk hyratrac displays an improved predictability mainly for the stratiform events with predictability limits reaching up to 60 min whilst for the small convective events up to 5 min temporal and to 20 min spatial the peak shift and bias have improved for all the events when compared to fig 5 nevertheless it is clear that the hyratrac is not as robust as the lk while the lk method is able to adapt the flow field to different storm types the hyratrac the object oriented approach in general is affected by the identification matching and splitting merging of storms at different time steps 5 conclusions accurate qpf at fine temporal 5 min and spatial 1 km2 scales required for urban pluvial flood predictions are quite challenging to achieve due to our inability to measure the true rainfall field and due to our imperfect models the predictability limit of the rainfall storms at such scales cannot pass 20 min lead time thus the scope of this study was to investigate to what degree the predictability limit can be improved by introducing to our imperfect models a new improved rainfall field two radar based nowcasts models hyratrac and lk were employed to nowcast a total of 110 events in the area within the hannover radar range in germany four different merging techniques were selected to provide a better rainfall product both in space and time mean field bias mfb quantile mapping based bias qq kriging with radar as external drift ked and conditional merging cm the performance was checked both in space and in time in respect to gauge measurements considered here the ground truth among all the methods cm stood out as the most reliable one yielding high correlation and low temporal peak bias and shift the qq and mfb exhibit high correlation but nevertheless still suffer from a high temporal bias these methods seem promising but further post correction needs to be performed in order to account for the temporal underestimation of the rainfall volume on the other hand ked even though it displays a low spatial error and bias does not capture well the temporal patterns of the rainfall at the point scale as shown by the low correlation and high peak bias a future improvement of ked might involve gaussian transformation of the rainfall data or to include the temporal patterns of the rainfall as implemented for instance in cassiraga et al 2020 lastly cm is proposed for the rainfall nowcast through all types of events for the urban application objective when fed with radar data the hyratrac qpf display better predictability and performance than the lk nowcast the radar predictability can reach up to 20 min while when compared directly to the gauge both nowcast models show no predictability level thus models fed with raw radar data are not useful for urban flood forecasts as they have very high peak bias shift and display very low correlation with the gauge recordings especially for urban hydrological models calibrated with gauge data the non merged radar based qpf should be used with caution on the other hand the predictability limit increases greatly when the merged data are fed into the nowcast model in contrast to the performance exhibited by the raw radar data the lk seems to profit the most from the merged data and shows a consistent improvement of the performance criteria for all the event types the predictability of most storms is extended up to one hour for both input merged data and gauge reference on the other side hyratrac didn t respond so well to the merged data the predictability was improved mainly for stratiform events up to 60 min but for convective events it lies within 30 45 min overall it seems that the hyratrac is not as robust as lk among different event types as it displays a great difference between stratiform and convective performance the predictability of stratiform events is much higher than that of the convective ones nonetheless a further study on the threshold sensitivity of the hyratrac nowcast and tracking algorithm should be done in order to understand fully why hyratrac or object oriented approach in general doesn t take full advantage of the merging product like lk model moreover an advection correction prior to the merging procedure might be useful in improving the response from hyratrac to conclude the use of the cm is advised to be used for the pluvial flood forecast only in conjunction with field based nowcast approach if gauge data are not available the object based approach seems to yield better qpf nevertheless in such a case one should not couple the rainfall nowcasts with an urban model calibrated on gauge data as the rainfall nowcast will fail to capture the temporal structure at such scales funding this research was funded by the german federal ministry of education and research bmbf grant number

4859,accurate quantitative precipitation forecasts qpf at high spatial and temporal resolution are a perquisite for urban flood prediction commonly lagrangian extrapolation of the rainfall patterns recognized by radar data forms the basis of such forecasts for the near future up to 2 h lead time referred here as nowcasting nevertheless due to the intermittent nature of the rainfall at such fine scales the predictability of storms is limited to about 20 min the predictability loss is caused mainly by the inability of the radar to capture the true rainfall field and because the lagrangian persistence is unable to model the temporal evolution of the rainfall field in this study we focus on the first problem on how to extend the predictability limit of rainfall at such scales by improving the rainfall field fed into the nowcast model to overcome the errors associated with the radar intensities merging techniques between radar and gauge measurements are advised among different employed techniques mean field bias kriging with external drift and quantile mapping based correction the conditional merging between the radar and rainfall gauge measurements seems to capture at best the spatial and temporal patterns of the rainfall at the desired fine scales 1 km2 and 5 min moreover when fed to two nowcast models the conditional merging doesn t only increase the predictability of storms from 20 min to longer than 1 h but as well it improves the agreement of radar based qpf with the gauge measurements the results are drawn from 110 events observed in the period 2000 2018 by the hannover radar germany in an area with a radius of 115 km where 100 recording gauges were available as the urban hydrological models are commonly validated on gauge measurements nowcasting with conditionally merged data provides a useful tool for urban flood prediction for lead times up to 1 h keywords radar data conditional merging rainfall nowcast lagrangian persistence urban flood forecast 1 introduction urban models are built and used to model the dynamics of pluvial floods from the given rainfall input data as the models simulate processes that are quite fast and at specific locations the rainfall input fed to the model should be provided at very fine resolution typically at 1 5 min and 100 m2 1 km2 berne et al 2004 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015b therefore quantitative precipitation forecasts qpf at such resolution should also be provided when forecasting pluvial floods hence the numerical weather predictions nwp are of little value for direct urban flood forecasting as they can only produce reliable results for 10 km2 and hourly volumes of rainfall golding 2009 kato et al 2017 šálek et al 2006 surcel et al 2015 gauge recordings are typically considered the ground truth even though they have an error of 7 depending of the rainfall intensity due to the wind wetting and evaporations effect ciach 2003 they capture quite well the temporal variability of rainfall at 1 min time steps nevertheless gauge recordings are point measurements that don t provide sufficient information about the spatial variability quirmbach schultz 2002 radar data on the other hand can capture the spatial temporal variability of rainfall at 1 km2 and 5 min time steps and form the basis for tracking and extrapolating rainfall storms in the near future berenguer et al 2012 jensen et al 2015 lin et al 2005 zahraei et al 2012 the radar based nowcast is typically done in three steps 1 rainfall identification initializing the nowcast 2 rainfall tracking calculating the displacement vectors of the storm and 3 rainfall prediction extrapolating the rainfall field into the future at different lead times based on the displacement vectors since the rainfall has to be observed in order to be nowcasted the radar based nowcasts are not able to predict the birth of rainfall storms and hence their skill is mostly useful for lead times up to 3 h hence radar nowcasting and not forecasting dixon wiener 1993 han et al 2009 johnson et al 1998 rinehart garvey 1978 for the extrapolation in the future two types of persistence are commonly employed a eulerian keeping rainfall position and intensity constant and b lagrangian keeping the motion and intensity constant germann et al 2006 as suggested first by lorenz 1973 and then approved by different studies the eulerian persistence can be useful only at very short lead times 5 10 min while the lagrangian persistence up to 20 25 min lead times grecu krajewski 2000 kato et al 2017 ruzanski et al 2011 lagrangian persistence even though a better option than the eulerian one is still far from a perfect model it doesn t represent the true ever changing nature of the rainfall and thus it is not able to provide useful qpf for lead times longer than 30 min hence there is a predictability limit that this model independent of the event type either stratiform or convective cannot overpass further attempts have been made to increase the predictability limits of radar nowcast models by employing either a blending of the nwp with radar data or a stochastic generator bowler et al 2006 seed 2003 a nwp blending with lagrangian based radar nowcast can give insight about the storm birth while a stochastic generator can add noise to the lagrangian persistence to account for the erratic nature of the rainfall due to the high uncertainty of the rainfall nowcast at such fine scales probabilistic nowcasts are more preferred than deterministic ones and usually are tackled by generating ensemble nowcast foresti et al 2016 codo and rico ramirez 2018 and jasper tönnies et al 2018 used such blending probabilistic models to increase the predictability limit of relatively low intensity thresholds up to 1 h even though the blending with nwp and the stochastic generator improve the nowcast when compared to the simple lagrangian persistence it is clear that there is a limit that these more complex models cannot overcome mainly due to our inability of knowing the true rainfall field therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the improvement that can be reached in the rainfall predictability and qpf due to an improved rainfall product even though the target is clear there are still some questions that need to be addressed before the investigation i determining the predictability limit first and the most important is to determine the estimation of the predictability limit the easiest way to define it is as the lead time when the nowcast skill becomes useless for the application at hand typically in rainfall nowcast or forecast categorical criteria are used to assess the ability of the model to predict intensities higher or lower than a fixed threshold for example roc score 0 5 as in codo and rico ramirez 2018 and jasper tönnies et al 2018 or ets score 0 3 as in foresti et al 2016 and ruzanski et al 2011 nevertheless it is still arguable if these tools are useful in evaluating qpf for urban flood prediction for various reasons i it is very difficult to associate urban floods with an intensity threshold ii in order to predict the flood levels and inundation areas the temporal distribution is very important iii the intensities considered for the categorical criteria are quite low as for high intensities that may cause pluvial floods the nowcast skill decreases very rapidly with the lead time pulkkinen et al 2019 and iv as the gauge data are considered the truth for validation these fraction skill scores cannot be calculated from discrete point measurements contrary to the categorical criteria germann and zawadzki 2002 used the cross correlation between the nowcasted and observed rainfall fields at each lead time as a tool to measure the nowcast skill this cross correlation is assumed to follow an exponential law and thus the predictability limit is considered as the de correlation time or the lead time when the integral of this cross correlation function falls below the value 1 e 0 37 zawadzki 1973 the de correlation time seems to give a better insight about the skill of the nowcast for urban flood application than the categorical criteria nevertheless the temporal structure of the rainfall is still not accounted for therefore there is a need for other additional criteria to evaluate the skill of the model to capture the temporal structure of rainfall at fine scales typically when radar data are assessed for urban application continuous criteria are calculated like the correlation mean squared errors or the volume bias of course there are no limits known for the mean squared errors and the volume bias as for the correlation but when used together with the de correlation time it can give a wider view on how the nowcast model is behaving in regard to the urban flood application ii determining the reference true rainfall second it is important to determine the true observed rainfall to use as a reference most of the nowcast studies assess the model skill based on the radar data fed to the model nevertheless due to the indirect measurement of the intensities radar data are prone to various sources of errors which usually cause an underestimation of the rainfall intensities berne krajewski 2013 curry 2012 needless to point it out underestimated intensities fed to the nowcast will not be useful at all for the urban flood application of course an urban model can be calibrated on radar data with observed water levels in the city but however as the underestimation of the radar measurements is not consistent throughout event types it will cause an additional bias in the predicted flood levels lau et al 2006 moreover water level monitoring in the city are scarce which is an ongoing problem in urban model calibration and validation van dijk et al 2014 often urban models are calibrated only partially or not at all and typically validated on gauge recordings codo rico ramirez 2018 quirmbach schultz 2002 thorndahl et al 2016 thus for the time being it seems that if a rainfall nowcast exhibits a good skill compared to gauge measurements there is a good probability that the urban flood forecast will be useful however it is important to note that the radar based nowcasts should not be expected to be exactly the same with gauge measurements due to the scale inconsistency between radar scans and gauge recordings the former represents a scan of the atmosphere while the other a volume accumulation at a point location iii improving radar gauge agreement issuing urban flood nowcasts when radar data are fed into an urban model validated on gauge recordings is quite problematic the assessment is not fair and the nowcasting skill will suffer greatly thus it is crucial to achieve a better radar product by improving the agreement between radar and gauge measurements typically in nowcasting the radar data are adjusted with a factor variable or constant in space or time to meet the gauge observations the simplest and most famous of such application is the mean field bias correction mfb as it is quite easy and fast nanding et al 2015 smith krajewski 1991 nevertheless the main drawback of mfb is that scaling with one single factor the whole radar image can cause very high bias in the temporal structure of the rainfall at the point scale depending on the event type and on the distribution of the gauge network shehu 2020 contrary to the nowcast application many other methods have been investigated in hind cast mode in order to achieve a better radar product these methods as stated in ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 can be classified in three groups a correcting radar data based on the gauge information where mfb also is included another method is the correction based on the quantile mapping qq of both radar and gauge data as implemented in rabiei and haberlandt 2015 the application on daily data proved to be useful nevertheless an application on fine scales has not yet been reported b adding the radar information to the gauge interpolation typically ordinary kriging ok is used for the interpolation of gauge intensities but as the method is unbiased in space it tends to smooth and underestimate the spatial variability of rainfall especially for fine scales lebrenz and bárdossy 2019 thus instead of ok kriging with external drift ked is used haberlandt 2007 it has been proven that ked with radar data yields better results than the ok berndt et al 2014 c merging the two sources with equal importance the most mentioned methods in the literature are the cokriging cok bayesian merging bm and conditional merging cm the cok goes a step further than ked and models the spatial variability between gauges based on the linear relationship between the two data sources krajewski 1987 nevertheless even though the cok represents a more complex system than ked it cannot outperform the ked schuurmans et al 2007 velasco forero et al 2009 bm on the other side accounts the uncertainties of both radar and gauge recordings and implements a kalman filter to combine both sources in proportion to their uncertainties wang et al 2013 applied on the 5 min and 1 km2 scales ochoa rodriguez et al 2015a found out that bm and ked have very similar performances lastly the cm combines the interpolation of gauges with the spatial variance of the radar data sinclair pegram 2005 berndt et al 2014 investigated the use of cm towards ked on 10 min and 1 km2 and the results indicate that the cm outperforms the ked other studies done by nanding et al 2015 and kumar et al 2016 using another version of cm on coarser resolution found out that the ked is in fact the superior method it seems that the most popular method for the merging of the two data sources is ked ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 nevertheless the cm application as proposed by berndt et al 2014 and the qq proposed by rabiei and haberlandt 2015 seem promising methods however their performance on fine scales has still to be proven therefore four methods will be tested in this study to check their ability to yield a better rainfall field for the nowcast model the mfb qq ked and cm the best merging method will then be used to investigate how an improved rainfall field is affecting the predictability limit of rainfall nowcasting at fine scales suitable for the urban flood prediction even though a probabilistic nowcast is more desired at such scales here only deterministic nowcasts will be used for the investigation the reason behind this is that the effects of an improved rainfall field on the deterministic nowcast can be estimated fast and easy if an improved rainfall field leads to an improved deterministic nowcast it will open the door for investigating the role of an improved input to the probabilistic nowcast two simple nowcast models based on the lagrangian persistence are used for the investigation a hyratrac which is an object oriented approach where individual storms are tracked and extrapolated independently into the future krämer 2008 schellart et al 2014 b lucas kanade which is a field oriented approach where an optical flow is computed for the whole radar image and each radar grid cell is moved into the future according to the local displacement vectors lucas kanade 1981 luk et al 2001 the reason why two different rainfall tracking approaches are used is that to the authors knowledge there is no clear evidence in the literature on which one performs better while the object oriented approach is considered better mainly for convective events it still has issues with the adequate estimation of the velocities and managing the splitting merging of storm cells pierce et al 2004 on the other hand the field based approach is better for distinctive movements for stratiform events and has gained popularity in the recent years han et al 2009 thus an additional objective of the study is to investigate how the different nowcast models respond to the improved rainfall field under different storm types 2 study area and data the study area is located in northern germany as shown in fig 1 left and lies within the hannover radar range as indicated in fig 1 right the radar station is situated at the hannover airport and it covers an area with a radius of 115 km as illustrated in fig 1 right the majority of the region is flat with elevation barely reaching 200 m the only mountains present in the region are in the south east where the harz mountains are located with an elevation up to 1141 m a s l the study area is in the proximity of the north sea and thus the dominant climate is the maritime characterized by cool summers and not so cold winters with high humidity throughout the year and low sunshine duration in winter the precipitation is mainly of a stratiform type in winter caused by the westerlies air masses coming from the atlantic ocean that are characterized by long and low intensity rainfall b convective type in summer caused by the radiation instabilities at local scales that sometimes reach high intensity for a short duration of time and c orographic type throughout the year at the south east of the region caused by the presence of the harz mountains all together 100 recording gauges at 1 min resolution were available from german weather service dwd and are shown in fig 1 right the measuring devices are tipping buckets mainly from period 2000 2004 with resolution 0 1 mm error 2 and weighting gravimeter gauges period 2004 2018 with resolution 0 01 mm error 0 02 0 04 mm the gauge data have been checked for their plausibility and are accumulated to 5 min time steps in agreement with the radar data the hannover c band radar data were also provided by dwd with reflectivity measured at an azimuth angle of 1 and at 5 min scans winterrath et al 2012 the reflectivity measurements were converted to intensity according to marshall palmer relationship with the coefficients a 256 and b 1 42 the radar data were corrected from the static clutters and erroneous beams and converted to cartesian coordinate system 1 km2 and 5 min as described in berndt et al 2014 since the radar data are available from 2000 and on 110 events were extracted from the period 2000 2018 which are characterized by different intensities and duration the events were grouped into 5 categories according to their properties 1 simple convective c rainfall storms that are quite small 100 km2 short in duration 4 h and have varying intensities 2 meso scale type 1 convective events sc1 rainfall storms that are large 100 km2 have high intensity 7 mm 5 min but are short in duration 4 h 3 meso scale type 2 convective events sc2 rainfall storms that are large 100 km2 have low intensity 7 mm 5 min and are short in duration 4 h 4 stratiform events s rainfall storms that are very large 100 km2 have low intensity 7 mm 5 min and long duration 4 h and finally 5 mixed events m rainfall events that are large 100 km2 have long duration 4 h and high intensity 7 mm 5 min the number of each event group and the respective properties are illustrated in fig 2 3 methods 3 1 merging methods from the five methods employed here to improve the rainfall field three of them are based on kriging systems it should be mentioned that kriging systems assume that the rainfall is normally distributed in space however this is not the case for the rainfall fields at very fine temporal scales 5 min and especially for convective events as the kriging systems use an unbiased estimator blue best linear unbiased estimator to optimize their weights over and under estimation may occur lebrenz and bárdossy 2019 a transformation to normality may be implemented to the rainfall data in order to improve such kriging estimates for instance a log transformation sideris et al 2014 square root transformation schuurmans et al 2007 or a box cox transformation erdin 2013 however following the work of some other studies berndt et al 2014 ehret 2002 goudenhoofdt delobbe 2009 kumar et al 2016 nanding et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015a velasco forero et al 2009 and the risk of introducing instabilities due to the transformation jewell gaussiat 2015 no transformation of the rainfall field is performed here prior to the application of the kriging methods 3 1 1 ordinary kriging ok ordinary kriging ok is one of the most favourite and simple geostatistics techniques used for rainfall interpolation in the geostatistics techniques the expected value of the random process e is assumed to be constant m throughout the field and the covariance c of two random variables depends only on the distance vector between them h this statement forms the second order hypothesis and is illustrated by eqs 1 and 2 however often the second order hypothesis is difficult to meet that is why the intrinsic hypothesis is used instead in ok interpolation the intrinsic hypothesis is less restricting as it assumes that the variance var at two locations at distance h u and u h is only dependent at the distance between them h eq 3 1 e z u h e z u m 2 c h e z u h m z u m 3 var z u h z u e z u h z u 2 2 γ h a semi variogram ɣ h here referred for simplicity as a variogram can describe the change of the variance as a function of the distance h between every two locations the typical used theoretical variogram for the interpolation of rainfall is the exponential one as described in the eq 4 haberlandt 2007 4 γ h c o c 1 e x p h a where c is the sill co the nugget and a the range of the variogram ideally the theoretic variogram is fitted independently for each time step to the empirical values nevertheless as concluded by verworn and haberlandt 2011 the choice of variogram has little effect on the interpolation performance following the work done by berndt et al 2014 seasonal theoretical variograms were fitted to the winter and summer empirical variograms through the method of least squares the empirical variograms were averaged for the winters and summers of the years 2011 2012 according to eq 5 5 γ avg h 1 n t 1 n γ t h var z t where t is a given time step n number of time steps in a season var zt the variance of the target variable z at time step t the achieved parameter values are given in table 1 for a the summer variogram displaying the spatial structure of convective events under the assumption that convective events mainly occur in summer and b the winter variogram displaying the spatial structure of stratiform events under the assumption that they occur mainly in winter 3 1 2 kriging with external drift ked in the kriging with external drift ked a secondary variable is introduced in the system unlike the ok the intrinsic hypothesis is left out and the expected value e of the target variable z at a location u is depending linearly on a second variable y as illustrated in eq 6 theoretically the variogram of the ked is computed from the residuals between the target and the secondary variable nevertheless for simplicity as shown in delrieu et al 2014 the ok variograms can be used instead and still produce very similar results thus here the seasonal variograms are used to perform the ked interpolation with radar data as a secondary variable 6 e z u y 1 u y 2 u y m u b 0 k 1 m b k y k u 3 1 3 conditional merging cm in conditional merging cm the combination of the radar and gauge intensities is done in five steps as described in berndt et al 2014 for a given time step t the gauge data information is interpolated with ok see parameters at table 1 then the gauge respective grid cells from the radar data are as well interpolated with the same method as in the ok of the gauges same variograms are used a deviation grid is calculated between the original radar and the obtained field from the interpolation of gauge respective grid cells this deviation grid is finally added to the ok interpolation of gauge data additionally to these five steps two further conditions are added to the product in order to avoid negative rainfall and to keep the storm structures as dictated by the radar data at the first case all the negative rainfall is set to zero while at the second case all the locations where no rainfall was detected from the radar are assigned as zero this means that the final product is not completely unbiased in space as the ok as it might contain errors at the station locations depending on whether the conversion of radar reflectively to intensity was good enough to capture the rain non rain process the final step is different from the conditional merging employed in berndt et al 2014 however it is necessary to ensure a proper recognition and tracking of the rainfall storms 3 1 4 mean field bias correction mfb the mean field bias mfb or the correction factor is calculated for each gauge based on the one hour accumulated rainfall the gauge correction factors are then averaged over the whole area to obtain a single average correction factor or mean field bias as illustrated by the eq 7 for a current time step the radar image at time t is corrected by the rainfall accumulations of the past hour the period from time t 60 min to time t 7 b t j 0 w i 1 n g i t j j 0 w i 1 n r i t j where t is the current time step n the number of available gauges w 12 as number of time steps in the one hour accumulation g represents the gauge intensities and r the radar intensities for the location i 3 1 5 quantile mapping based correction qq as described in rabiei and haberlandt 2015 the intensities of the radar image are manipulated by the probability distribution function pdf of the gauge data the procedure is based on the theoretical fitted gamma distribution on both the radar and gauge data sets for a given radar image at time step t the quantile based on the radar pdf corresponding at each grid cell intensity is used to find the respective intensity from the gauge pdf the corresponding gauge intensity is used to substitute the original intensity of the grid cell as illustrated in eq 8 8 z r x t f obs t 1 f rad t z r x t where zr is the radar intensity at location x and time step t frad is the quantile from the non exceeding probability of radar data at time step t corresponding to zr fobs 1 is the gauge intensity corresponding to the quantile frad taken from the non exceeding probability of gauge data at time step t and the z r is the replaced radar intensity at the location x and time step t for the method to be successful enough observations should be available for both data sets in order to ensure a proper fit of the theoretical gamma distribution for radar data there are enough grid cells to ensure a proper fit nevertheless the fitting of the gauge pdf can be problematic since for each time step at most 100 observations are available this problem can either be solved by increasing the sample size in space through the interpolation of gauge data or by increasing the sample size in time by pooling the gauge observations from a fixed time window the interpolation of gauge data would introduce new uncertainty to the correction method that is why here the assimilation of the data from a fixed time window is employed prior results for this case study indicated that a window of three hours is enough to ensure that the data can yield stable parameters for the gamma distribution and that intensities from different rainfall mechanisms are not pooled together shehu 2020 the method of l moments is used to estimate the parameters of the gamma distribution 3 1 6 online application of the merging methods as documented in berndt et al 2014 the spatial and temporal smoothing of radar data improves the agreement between radar and gauge data a prior investigation indicated that the smoothed radar data are a better product than the raw ones shehu 2020 thus temporally over last 10 min and spatially 5 by 5 km filter smoothed radar data were used as an input to the merging methods since the methods are run on nowcasting mode or online mode only past information to the current time step t 0 can be used for the merging the two kriging methods cm and ked do not need additional data from the past to merge the two data sources however since the smoothed radar data are used as an input for both of them they indirectly include radar information from the last observed two time steps 10 min for the mfb correction the time window from t 60 min to t 0 is used while for the qq correction from t 180 min to t 0 these windows were chosen based on a prior study shehu 2020 among different temporal windows as they showed the best performance criteria 3 2 radar based nowcast models the hyratrac nowcast model was developed by krämer 2008 and it performs the nowcast in three steps a identification of individual storms b tracking of individual storms and c extrapolation with lagrangian persistence of the individual storms at different lead times in the future the nowcast is initialized if a group of radar grid cells 64 has a reflectivity higher than z 20dbz while storms are recognized as convective if a group bigger than 16 radar grid cells has an intensity higher than 25 dbz and as stratiform if a group bigger than 128 radar grid cells has an intensity higher than 20 dbz the tracking of the individual storms in consecutive images is done by the optimization of the cross correlation between the last 2 images t 0 and t 5 min and local displacement vectors for each storm are calculated in case a storm is just recognized then global displacement vectors based on cross correlation of the entire radar image are assigned to the storm lastly the storm region is moved to the future using the last observed displacement vector without any changes in the inner structure of the storm the intensities are held constant the lucas kanade flow model unlike hyratrac calculates the optical flow on the entire radar image as illustrated in eq 9 the nowcast is initialized when a threshold of 20 dbz is reached by at least 25 grid cells the equation of the optical flow is solved according to the lucas kanade solution where the last 3 radar images are used as input t t 5 min and t 10 min lucas kanade 1981 once the flow field has been determined the radar grid cells are moved inside the image with the respective flow vectors here the lk method implemented in pysteps a python library for nowcasting was employed for the nowcast pulkkinen et al 2019 9 i x y t i x dx y dy t dt where i is the intensity at location x y and time step t and the displacement vector is expressed by dx dy for the period dt the intensity i is considered constant from the time t to t dt and only the position is changing 3 3 measuring predictability and performance 3 3 1 nowcast performance and predictability the predictability limit is referred here as the lead time where the observed and the nowcasted radar images become de correlated the spatial cross correlation between the two falls below the limit value 1 e 0 37 as illustrated in eq 10 since the gauge recordings used as a reference are available only at specific location only the respective 100 grid cells of the radar data are used for the estimation of the predictability and performance the predictability is then calculated based on the input radar data here referred to as radar predictability and based on the reference gauge data here referred to as gauge predictability the former describes the predictability limit of the model while the latter indicates the practical predictability limit of the rainfall the end goal for urban flood applications in additional to the de correlation time the root mean square error is also calculated in space for both reference data radar input and gauges according to eq 11 de correlation time τtl the lead time when the spatial cross correlation between nowcasted and observed data becomes lower than 0 37 unlike the germann and zawadzki 2002 here the pearson correlation is used pixel wise based on the 100 gauge grid cells locations instead of the integral of the cross correlation function over the

averages from the gauge locations over all the 5 min time steps in an event to investigate how well the nowcast model can predict the temporal distribution of rainfall at specific locations four additional criteria were introduced as indicated below the temporal time series for each grid cell corresponding to each gauge location as nowcasted for a specific lead time and observed either by gauge or radar input are used to compute the temporal criteria and later are averaged over the gauge locations per each event temporal correlation between the nowcasted and observed time series at each gauge location as described by eq 12 it can be useful as well as an indicator about the de correlation time the lead time when the temporal correlation falls below the limit 0 37 to distinguish from the spatial predictability limit in eq 10 the de correlation time from the temporal correlation will be referred to as the temporal predictability limit and it is calculated both on gauge and

the same performance criteria as illustrated by the eqs 10 15 are employed to investigate which merging method is providing the best rainfall field in the case of merging method performance the lead time is set to zero tl 0 and the for symbol represents the merged or the radar rainfall field as a cross validation is computational demanding a split sampling validation is used instead thus from 100 gauge locations 68 gauges were used for the merging of the methods and 32 for the validation of the methods the gauges for each group were selected randomly and are illustrated in fig 1 right note that the split sampling of the gauges is only necessary for the comparison of the merging methods and not for the performance assessment of the nowcast models a summary of the merging methods used in this study is given in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 radar and gauge discrepancy the radar based qpf cannot display a better agreement with the gauge observation than the one displayed by the radar input rr in other words the radar input and the gauge already display a discrepancy that in the radar based qpf will propagate and increase with the lead time thus before applying the nowcast models it is important to check what is the actual performance of the radar when compared to the ground truth the gauge data for the 5 events types fig 3 illustrates the performance criteria of the radar data as expected for convective events which have high intensity due to the reflectively loss this discrepancy is quite high and characterized by very low temporal and spatial correlation 0 2 and 0 3 respectively and high peak bias almost 100 the rmse is low compared to the other types of the events but this is because the ratio of no rain time steps is higher in this type of event for stratiform events that have a very large coverage due to the attenuation of the radar signal the performance is quite poor this is displayed by the low spatial correlation value of 0 4 a very high peak bias 100 and the highest peak shift recorded 10 20 min among the different events of course the rmse is low around 2 mm h for both temporal and spatial rmse but this is affected by the low intensities that characterize this type of events the meso scale type 2 convective events which are not small in coverage but small in intensity seem to be best captured from the radar data with spatial correlation reaching 0 5 low temporal and spatial rmse at the range of 2 3 mm h as in the stratiform events on the other hand the meso scale type 1 convective events that are larger in coverage but with higher intensity are captured a bit worse than the type 2 convective these events suffer mainly from high rmse 3 6 mm h due to the presence of very high intensities nevertheless they show the best peak bias with some events showing 10 underestimation of the peak volume lastly the mixed events characterized by very large coverage and very high intensities display low correlation at range 0 3 0 4 and high rmse as in the case of the meso scale type 1 convective events a consistent temporal peak shift of 10 min is visible throughout most of the events this is in accordance with the expected wind drift discrepancy as reported by bárdossy and pegram 2013 and as well supports the temporal smoothing of the radar data with a 10 min window in terms of spatial predictability only the meso scale type 2 convective events display a cross correlation higher than the predictability limit followed up by the stratiform type opposite to this the temporal correlation is much lower than the threshold 0 37 where only some of the stratiform events exhibit correlations higher than this limit as the results indicate there is a big gap between the gauge and radar data and since the correlation is quite low it is not possible to expect gauge predictability from the two nowcast models for lead times longer than 10 min next both nowcast models were run with radar data as input in order to assess the predictability limit averaged for each event type fig 4 illustrates the gauge predictability and the performance of the two selected models while fig 5 illustrates the radar predictability limit and the respective performance as expected due to the discrepancy between radar and gauge data the gauge predictability is below the limit within 5 min lead time for both of the models it is clear that due to the discrepancy of the input radar data with the gauge recordings shown in fig 3 independent of the nowcast model either an object oriented or a field approach the qpf are useless neither temporal or spatial cross correlation is higher than the threshold 0 37 for any type of events the temporal distribution of the rainfall at the local scales seems to be captured quit poorly even for the 5 min lead times with peak bias starting from a 100 underestimation and peak shifts increasing greatly with longer lead times thus a merging method between the radar and gauge is essential to provide better qpf at the point scale nevertheless when comparing the nowcast models with the radar input the models exhibit spatial radar predictability limit up to 30 min depending on the event type and the model type what is interesting to see is that the storms that display higher radar predictability in the hyratrac model are not the same as in the lk model for instance in hyratrac the meso scale convective events are the ones to be best predicted but they display the lowest predictability when nowcasted with lk method vice versa for the small convective events the lk predictability is much higher than for the hyratrac one the inconsistencies between the model responses emphasize the differences caused by different advection calculation schemes and that for specific storms the object oriented might be better than the field oriented one 4 2 merging methods performance the results from the split validation of the selected merging methods from table 2 together with the respective single source data rr and ok interpolation of gauge data are shown in fig 6 for each of the event types first even though the gauge data are considered the ground truth when interpolating the gauge intensities the temporal and spatial cross correlation is lost both are lower than 0 3 for ok and the bias even though small in space is quite high in the time from 100 to 50 estimated bias at the temporal peak most of the merging methods are dominant to the single source data either gauge or radar which emphasizes once again the need for merging the two data sources in order to obtain a better rainfall product among all the methods the cm and the qq are the ones that stand out as they can maintain a high temporal and spatial cross correlation higher than 0 5 while displaying relative low errors qq is good particularly in reducing the spatial errors rmse lower than 2 mm h and maintaining a high correlation higher than 0 5 nevertheless the peak suffers greatly from underestimation more than 90 and 10 to 15 min delay this is also the case for the mfb correction the spatial cross correlation is as good as the qq higher than 0 5 and rmse roughly 1 mm h higher than qq nevertheless the temporal peak bias is high 70 although better than qq this makes sense as the methods are applied spatially with no regards to the temporal distribution of the rainfall at a local scale ked on the other side improves the performance towards the ok however the correlation is not as high as in qq cm or mfb 0 2 0 3 units lower than these three methods and the peak shift is greatly anticipated more than 10 15 min earlier it seems that the ked inherits the poor performance of the ok and the inclusion of the radar data as an external drift only improves the correlation towards ok cm on the other hand stands out from the group as it can maintain a high temporal and spatial correlation 0 5 0 7 for all the event types while having a low peak shift 0 5 min delay and bias 20 40 underestimation even though not the same can be said for the rmse generally 0 1 to 1 mm h higher than the qq but dependent on the event type the method is the most promising one as it can capture the temporal patterns of the local rainfall quite well since this is important for the urban flood forecasting the cm method is chosen as the most adequate method for yielding better qpf regarding the application of the merging methods on different event types the stratiform mixed and the meso scale convective events display higher correlation than the simple convective ones thus a higher predictability should be expected from these storms although the simple convective events display lower peak bias and shift among the merging methods like mfb qq and cm the performance seems to be relatively same for all event types ked is performing poorly particularly for the small convective events whilst it performs better for the large scale events it seems that the variogram describing the summer events is unable to represent correctly the spatial distribution of the small scale events for these events the use of radar data is clearly a plus the findings of this study may be surprising as ked is often the best performing kriging method in the literature e g ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 it is worth to mention that most of the studies have done a comparison of the ked and cm at coarser resolution hourly or daily temporal resolutions based on corrected and adjusted radar data high quality radar data such as schuurmans et al 2007 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 velasco forero et al 2009 erdin 2013 nanding et al 2015 as suggested by berndt et al 2014 the performance of ked is quite sensitive to the temporal resolution and the quality of the radar data thus the results shown here do not contradict the fact that at hourly accumulations on better quality radar data and specific station density the ked may perform better than the cm other studies comparing these methods in finer temporal scales are for instance sideris et al 2014 jewell and gaussiat 2015 berndt et al 2014 and ehret 2002 in both berndt et al 2014 and ehret 2002 the cm outperformed the edk for 10 min temporal resolutions nevertheless this was not the case in sideris et al 2014 and jewell and gaussiat 2015 it should be noted that the performance of the ked in this study is not worse than the ked performance displayed by these two studies in jewell and gaussiat 2015 the rmse of ked ranges from 1 to 2 to 2 4 mm h for 15 min time steps and in sideris et al 2014 from 0 2 to 0 4 at one case 0 9 mm per 10 min while in the present study the spatial rmse of the ked ranges from 1 to 3 mm h or 0 15 0 5 mm 10 min depending of the event type the difference is not in the performance of the ked but actually in the performance of the cm for the case study at hand and in berndt et al 2014 and ehret 2002 the cm performed much better than in the other two studies the difference lays in the temporal and spatial smoothing of the radar data prior to merging in order to account for the wind drift at point scales the investigation done by shehu 2020 for different temporal and spatial smoothing windows indicated that the performance of the cm improves significantly by smoothing the radar data over last 10 min and over 25 grid cells lastly in terms of rmse the ked performs actually better than cm the advantages of the cm are mainly in the temporal performances lower peak bias and shift and higher correlation which are not typical performances used in these studies as stated in erdin 2013 the cm is better in terms of dry wet distinction and representation of intense rainfall of course the ked results may improve if a log or box cox transformation is done to the data nevertheless this would favour as well the application of the cm more research has to be conducted in order to estimate which one is the superior method and the reader has to keep in mind that the results shown here are valid for the given study area station density and radar data quality 4 3 nowcast performance and predictability the cm is selected as the best performing merging method the whole available gauges in total 100 are used here to perform the conditional merging between the radar and gauge intensities which serves as an input for the nowcasting models the radar predictability and performance are then calculated with the input merged radar as a reference thus here it will be referred to as merged radar predictability performance since as described in section 3 1 3 errors are expected at the gauge locations due to the reflectivity intensity conversion fig 7 illustrates the resulting discrepancy between the merged and the gauge data in contrast to the discrepancy results from fig 3 the performance of the merged data is clearly improved for all the event types both temporal correlation and spatial cross correlation are above the predictability limit 0 8 indicating thus that the gauge predictability will be much higher than in the case of the radar based qpf moreover the peak shift is completely eliminated 0 min the temporal rmse is clearly reduced 1 5 2 mm h and the bias is very close to zero 20 the large scale events seem to be better represented from the merged data with the simple convective events displaying the worst performance among all event types such performance should as well be expected on the merged radar and gauge predictability of the nowcast models fed on cm data fig 8 illustrates the results from the hyratrac and lk nowcasts when compared to the gauge data thus the gauge predictability as expected the predictability limit has increased to beyond 30 min the lk qpfs seem to be the most affected by the implementation of the merged data for all the events the predictability and performance has increased considerably beyond 30 min the stratiform events are the ones that profit the most from the merging technique with predictability limit reaching up to 60 min followed up by the large scale convective and mixed events whose predictability limit reaches up to 30 min lastly the simple convective events show the worst performance with predictability limit up to 20 min within the first hour the peak shift remains between 10 min and the peak bias below 50 indicating that even for the urban flood forecast the qpf can yield reasonable results for lead times between 30 and 60 min this however is not the case for the hyratrac derived qpfs the spatial gauge predictability has increased up to 20 min while the temporal one up to 10 min still the small scale convective events with high intensity are represented very poorly from the hyratrac this indicates that the identification matching and tracking of convective storm cells is not done appropriately which compromises the performance of this nowcast approach moreover within 30 min there is an almost linear increment of the peak bias up to 100 and peak shift up to 30 min fig 9 illustrates the predictability and the performance compared to the merged radar input for both of the nowcast models as seen with the gauge predictability the merged radar predictability has as well improved considerably due to the merged data and displays a similar pattern among the events as in the gauge predictability the lk yields the best results the spatial de correlation time has been extended beyond 60 min for the larger scale events and to more than 45 min for small scale convective events the peak shift is kept very small up to 10 min delay for most events for lead times up to one hour while the peak bias has improved mainly for the large scale events opposite to lk hyratrac displays an improved predictability mainly for the stratiform events with predictability limits reaching up to 60 min whilst for the small convective events up to 5 min temporal and to 20 min spatial the peak shift and bias have improved for all the events when compared to fig 5 nevertheless it is clear that the hyratrac is not as robust as the lk while the lk method is able to adapt the flow field to different storm types the hyratrac the object oriented approach in general is affected by the identification matching and splitting merging of storms at different time steps 5 conclusions accurate qpf at fine temporal 5 min and spatial 1 km2 scales required for urban pluvial flood predictions are quite challenging to achieve due to our inability to measure the true rainfall field and due to our imperfect models the predictability limit of the rainfall storms at such scales cannot pass 20 min lead time thus the scope of this study was to investigate to what degree the predictability limit can be improved by introducing to our imperfect models a new improved rainfall field two radar based nowcasts models hyratrac and lk were employed to nowcast a total of 110 events in the area within the hannover radar range in germany four different merging techniques were selected to provide a better rainfall product both in space and time mean field bias mfb quantile mapping based bias qq kriging with radar as external drift ked and conditional merging cm the performance was checked both in space and in time in respect to gauge measurements considered here the ground truth among all the methods cm stood out as the most reliable one yielding high correlation and low temporal peak bias and shift the qq and mfb exhibit high correlation but nevertheless still suffer from a high temporal bias these methods seem promising but further post correction needs to be performed in order to account for the temporal underestimation of the rainfall volume on the other hand ked even though it displays a low spatial error and bias does not capture well the temporal patterns of the rainfall at the point scale as shown by the low correlation and high peak bias a future improvement of ked might involve gaussian transformation of the rainfall data or to include the temporal patterns of the rainfall as implemented for instance in cassiraga et al 2020 lastly cm is proposed for the rainfall nowcast through all types of events for the urban application objective when fed with radar data the hyratrac qpf display better predictability and performance than the lk nowcast the radar predictability can reach up to 20 min while when compared directly to the gauge both nowcast models show no predictability level thus models fed with raw radar data are not useful for urban flood forecasts as they have very high peak bias shift and display very low correlation with the gauge recordings especially for urban hydrological models calibrated with gauge data the non merged radar based qpf should be used with caution on the other hand the predictability limit increases greatly when the merged data are fed into the nowcast model in contrast to the performance exhibited by the raw radar data the lk seems to profit the most from the merged data and shows a consistent improvement of the performance criteria for all the event types the predictability of most storms is extended up to one hour for both input merged data and gauge reference on the other side hyratrac didn t respond so well to the merged data the predictability was improved mainly for stratiform events up to 60 min but for convective events it lies within 30 45 min overall it seems that the hyratrac is not as robust as lk among different event types as it displays a great difference between stratiform and convective performance the predictability of stratiform events is much higher than that of the convective ones nonetheless a further study on the threshold sensitivity of the hyratrac nowcast and tracking algorithm should be done in order to understand fully why hyratrac or object oriented approach in general doesn t take full advantage of the merging product like lk model moreover an advection correction prior to the merging procedure might be useful in improving the response from hyratrac to conclude the use of the cm is advised to be used for the pluvial flood forecast only in conjunction with field based nowcast approach if gauge data are not available the object based approach seems to yield better qpf nevertheless in such a case one should not couple the rainfall nowcasts with an urban model calibrated on gauge data as the rainfall nowcast will fail to capture the temporal structure at such scales funding this research was funded by the german federal ministry of education and research bmbf grant number
