water crisis climate change and energy transition however the core concept of these studies remained the basin scale system approach of groundwater flow as these flow systems interact with the rock framework and all other geofluids resulting in a systematic distribution of the related environmental and geological processes and phenomena the presented methodological developments and mostly general results have been and can be utilized in the future in any sedimentary basins these cover the following fields of hydrogeology and geofluid research carbonate and karst hydrogeology asymmetric basin and flow pattern geothermal and petroleum hydrogeology radioactivity of groundwater groundwater and surface water interaction groundwater dependent ecosystems effects of climate change on

of geology institute of geography and earth sciences eötvös loránd university elte budapest hungary is a majority 70 women team led by professor judit mádl szőnyi she started to establish the education of hydrogeological courses at the elte in the 1990 s and built up an internationally acknowledged research group from her mentees in the last 20 years since 2016 the group works in the framework of the józsef and erzsébet tóth endowed hydrogeology jeteh chair which was initiated and supported by professor józsef joe tóth university of alberta edmonton canada the hungarian born world class hydrogeologist mentioned such by deming 2002 tóth helped mádl szőnyi to introduce the so called modern hydrogeology and fostered cooperation and discussion with the international scientific community thanks to the systematic building mádl szőnyi initiated a scientific commission in the international association of hydrogeologists iah named regional groundwater flow commission in 2011 where she has been serving since that as a chair with networking all over the world her contribution was acknowledged by the iah presidents award in 2021 the strong international background helps her to manage research as the head of the jeteh chair at elte where the members are hydrogeologists and geophysicists mostly her former and current mentees and her mentees students the group originally focused on the basin scale system approach of groundwater flow and the related natural phenomena based on the theory of hydraulic continuity tóth 1995 1980 this approach differs significantly from the earlier artesian approach which focuses only on confined flow in aquifers jiang et al 2020 understanding the basin scale hydraulic connections and groundwater flow systems is particularly indispensable nowadays when demand for groundwater resources is highly increasing worldwide in the population explosion and global climate change induced water crisis world economic forum 2022 world economic forum 2021 world meteorological organization 2021 furthermore the multifaceted utilization of the underground space e g managed aquifer recharge soil improvement irrigation sewerage controlling of contaminations petroleum exploitation geothermal energy production geological storage of carbon dioxide mineral exploration etc the resulting conflicts of interests and environmental consequences as well as demands of the circular economy and energy transition raise further issues e g howarth et al 2011 martens et al 2020 van ree and van beukering 2016 recognizing these global challenges and the possibilities of the groundwater flow system approach the group extended its research and consequently the educational activity to other geofluids such as geothermal fluids and petroleum within the framework of an h2020 project excellency network building for comprehensive research and assessment of geofluids enerag we worked out the novelty dynamic system approach for geofluids and their resources dsa gr czauner et al 2022 this concept provides a framework for integrated geofluid research and consequently can efficiently combine and optimize the research and utilization of geofluids and the related groundwater geothermal energy and mineral resources the base of dsa gr is provided by the basin scale groundwater flow system concept which is the core concept of all research activities of the group in this review paper we intend to present summarily i the basic concept of the basin scale system approach of groundwater flow and its relation to geofluid research ii the methodology introduced by our group for the evaluation iii the contribution of our research group on the further development of the basic concept and iv its practical applications by our research group for many fields of hydrogeology and geofluid research the briefly presented studies were conducted in the pannonian basin hungary which is a perfect research laboratory due to its complex geological build up with deep sedimentary basins and limited mountain ranges however our studies usually provide general models and solutions which have been and can be utilized in the future in any sedimentary basins all over the world 2 the basic concept of basin scale system approach of groundwater flow and geofluid research basin scale or modern hydrogeology is based on the recognition of nonexistence of impermeable rocks i e aquicludes that could completely inhibit groundwater flow brace 1980 jiang et al 2020 neuzil 1994 1986 tissot and welte 1978 namely all kind of rocks have some permeability just the lower permeability rocks i e aquitards contain and transmit less fluid than higher permeability rocks i e aquifers as a result regional hydraulic continuity is a phenomenological property of the rock framework whilst its observability depends on the spatial and time scale of the monitoring bredehoeft et al 1983 tóth 1995 witherspoon and neuman 1967 as the most significant consequence of the regional hydraulic continuity basin scale groundwater flow systems can evolve bredehoeft 2018 gassiat et al 2013 heath 1983 tóth 2009 zijl 2019 the most general fluid flow driving force near surface in terrestrial regions in mature non deforming basins garven 1995 is provided by the elevational differences of the water table which form the so called topography driven or gravity driven or gravitational flow systems deming 2002 tóth 2009 wang et al 2011 zijl 1999 since fluids flow from higher to lower fluid potentials hubbert 1940 in these systems topographical highs represent recharge areas where infiltrating rainwater flows dominantly downward on the other hand topographical lows represent discharge areas where groundwater flows upward towards the land surface the recharge and discharge areas are connected by midline or through flow areas where the prevailing flow direction is horizontal fig 1 undulation of land surface results in hierarchically nested flow systems namely local intermediate and regional scale flow systems tóth 1963 fig 1 whilst geological heterogeneities e g structural elements heterogeneity and anisotropy of sediments cause an even more complex flow pattern in fact infinite variability of flow systems can exist due to the differences in topography climate and geology e g cardenas and jiang 2010 freeze and witherspoon 1967 gleeson and manning 2008 tóth 1971 wang et al 2018 2017 winter 2001 zlotnik et al 2011 moreover regional fluid flow driving forces other than topography could also work particularly in juvenile i e deforming basins such as compaction tectonic compression erosion rebound buoyancy garven 1995 ingebritsen et al 2006 interactions of superimposed flow systems with different driving forces can result the most complex flow pattern with specific situations e g harrison and summa 1991 tóth and almási 2001 such as in the pannonian basin as a result of the spatial basin scale and time span 1 10 million years of operation the cross formational flow and fluid rock interactions groundwater flow modifies its subsurface and surface environment therefore it behaves as a geologic agent namely it mobilizes transports and deposits matter and heat in a distributed manner tóth 1999 mobilization and deposition accumulation are typical of zones of high and low fluid potentials respectively hubbert 1956 jiang et al 2014 2012 tóth 1999 1980 consequently groundwater flow systems result in the systematic distribution of the related environmental and geological processes and phenomena in other words these genetically related manifestations of groundwater flow are different and characteristic for the hydraulic regimes recharge midline discharge as well as for the penetration depth i e order of the flow systems local intermediate regional fig 1 it means that an observed phenomenon or process and particularly a group of that refer to the hydraulic regime of the area and the penetration depth of the related flow system since groundwater flow paths can be evaluated quantitatively and in a distributed manner this approach allows site specific i solutions for geofluid related issues and ii search for geofluid related resources e g groundwater geothermal energy hydrothermal minerals which can be viewed simply as products of groundwater flows and fluid rock interactions accordingly groundwater interacting with all other fluids during its movement thus understanding of the groundwater flow pattern on basin scale can supply the common base for the more necessary interdisciplinary approach of harmonized geofluid research and utilization dsa gr czauner et al 2022 3 introduced methodology we developed a workflow for basin scale groundwater flow evaluation czauner et al 2022 containing the elements of the hydraulic methodology of tóth 2009 complemented by further methods retrospective analysis evaluation of the manifestations of flowing groundwater numerical flow and transport simulations etc in all our studies we applied a similar methodology i e workflow focusing on the understanding of the pathways and processes of basin scale groundwater flow the speciality of this approach goes beyond the aquifer based confined flow of the artesian paradigm jiang et al 2020 and based on the hydraulic continuity assumes impermeable aquicludes only in numerical simulations as boundary condition accordingly groundwater flow as the subsurface part of the water cycle is determined by the hydraulic connections of aquifers and aquitards and by the fluid flow driving forces these regional or basin scale i e areas of 1 000 10 000 km2 depths of 1000 m relationships also control the local scale processes which should always be evaluated in the framework of the basin scale results czauner et al 2022 mádlné szőnyi 2020 the methodology contains the complex analysis of i pre production measured data hydraulic temperature hydro geo chemical ii hydrostratigraphic build up characterization of aquifers and aquitards and iii the past and present groundwater flow related surface and subsurface phenomena and processes the fundamental part of the workflow is the understanding of natural flow conditions i e the basin scale analysis of pre production measured hydraulic well data which reveals the fluid potential field thus direction and magnitude of the fluid flow driving force these should be jointly interpreted with the qualitative analysis of the hydrostratigraphic build up which genetically influences the distribution of fluid potentials as a result a real flow system model could be set up which is the 3d systemic interpretation of the real measured hydraulic data mádlné szőnyi 2020 this could be complemented with the evaluation of measured hydro geo chemical isotope and temperature data from wells and with the mapping and analysis of past i e retrospective research and present groundwater flow related geological and environmental processes and phenomena in this way these phenomena could be interpreted allowing site specific search for geofluid related resources e g groundwater geothermal energy hydrothermal minerals finally numerical flow and transport simulations could be founded on and validated by the real flow system model i e interpreted measured data for instance to study the decisive processes and flow driving forces it is worth highlighting that basin hydraulics aim to evaluate the fluid flow driving force i e fluid potential field while flow intensities and directions could be interpreted only in numerical simulations where hydraulic properties of the rock framework are quantitatively combined with the driving force field czauner et al 2022 4 development of the basic concept regarding groundwater flow 4 1 adaptation to unconfined confined carbonates the basin scale groundwater flow concept was developed originally tóth 1963 1962 and since then mostly applied for siliciclastic sedimentary basins e g cardenas and jiang 2010 freeze and witherspoon 1968 1967 tóth 2009 though it was assumed that thick carbonate systems are also characterized by cross formational flow and hydraulic continuity klimchouk 2007 klimchouk and ford 2009 however this assumption has never been physically confirmed our group initiated goldscheider et al 2010 and carried out the adaptation of the concept for confined and unconfined outcropping carbonates and particularly for their marginal areas mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 in this context the elevated unconfined carbonate ranges adjoin with sedimentary basins where the carbonates continuously deepen below a thick and dominantly siliciclastic cover with lower hydraulic conductivity we investigated three study areas fig 2 by the approaches and methods described in chapter 3 based on the adaptation of the basic concept csondor et al 2020b erhardt et al 2017 mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádlné szőnyi 2020 tóth 2018 tóth et al 2020 as a general result thick carbonate units could be characterized by higher hydraulic connectivity compared to siliciclastic basins which results in recharge controlled differences haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 in water table elevation and normal i e close to hydrostatic pressure conditions in addition though confined carbonate units are traditionally considered to be aquifer systems hydraulically independent of their siliciclastic cover by the application of the adapted concept regional hydraulic communication between the confined carbonates and their cover was revealed mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádlné szőnyi 2020 case study buda thermal karst and hungarian paleogene basin in the buda thermal karst btk elevated maximum 559 m asl pre tertiary carbonates are mostly unconfined while the same carbonates continuously deepen below 2000 m siliciclastic cover in the hungarian paleogene basin hpb figs 2 3 topography driven basin scale groundwater flow systems can be detected down to about 500 m asl mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádlné szőnyi 2020 recharge areas of the different orders of flow systems local intermediate regional were determined based on the vertical flow components mádlné szőnyi 2020 basin hydraulic interpretation of the respective discharge areas was also completed with the hierarchic cluster analysis of groups of springs in terms of the related discharge phenomena mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádlné szőnyi 2020 tóth et al 2022 based on these results we could delineate the subsurface catchment area of the btk this area differs from the surface catchment which is a significant issue from the point of view of groundwater quality and management mádlné szőnyi 2020 below 500 m asl through flow conditions dominate which refers to the recharge controlled character of topography driven basin scale groundwater flow systems this could be explained by the usually higher hydraulic diffusivity of carbonates as compared to siliciclastic sediments which means faster spread of pore pressure changes and stronger hydraulic connections mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 as a result we found on one hand that flow systems are less hierarchic and lateral i e through flow conditions dominate on the other hand barrier faults and regional aquitards can impede fluid flow more effectively than in siliciclastic sediments below 1000 m asl lateral flows still prevail but underpressured conditions 1 2 mpa deficit can be observed in the confined pre tertiary carbonates in the basement of the hpb mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádl szőnyi et al 2015 development of this underpressured regime could be explained by the joint effect of more processes such as the recharge hampering effect of the confining layers and some barrier fault systems mádl szőnyi et al 2019 erosional decompaction of the confining layer mádl szőnyi et al 2015 and termohaline groundwater flows galsa et al 2022 in addition underpressures generate downward flow from the overlying siliciclastic cover into the confined carbonates including downward petroleum migration from the source rocks of the siliciclastic cover the combined interpretation of the hydraulic hydrogeochemical and temperature data allowed us to spatially differentiate two previously known groundwater components in the system namely meteoric karst waters coming from the unconfined carbonates of the btk and nacl type basinal fluids arriving from the confining siliciclastic layers of the hpb erőss et al 2012a erőss et al 2012b 2011 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 poros et al 2012 poros et al 2010 moreover we could also identify a third component of hydrothermal waters mádlné szőnyi 2020 mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 it was originally a meteoric karst water which evolved in the basin scale groundwater flow systems due to the long subsurface residence time and fluid rock interactions then also mixed with basinal fluids in the discharge area finally results of the basin scale data analysis and numerical modelling allowed the interpretation of the differences temperature hydrochemical isotopic in discharging waters of wells and springs in the btk the biogeochemical and mineral precipitates and the processes of porosity enlargement such as mixing corrosion hypogenic karstification erőss et al 2012a erőss et al 2012b 2011 kovács bodor et al 2019 2018 ötvös et al 2017 furthermore our numerical flow heat and mass transport simulations revealed that also the thermal and salinity driving forces have to be taken into account galsa et al 2022 szijártó et al 2021 2019 though their significance is decreasing in the btk due to its uplift and the consequent intensification of the topography driven flows havril et al 2016 case study bakony mountains balaton highland and somogy hills the bakony mountains maximum 709 m asl and balaton highland maximum 440 m asl divided by a narrow elongated basin fig 2 can be handled as a hydrogeologically complex unconfined carbonate aquifer system tóth and mádl szőnyi 2016 it is hydraulically continuous and topography driven basin scale groundwater flow systems exist induced by the recharge controlled differences in water table elevation tóth 2018 tóth et al 2020 as a methodological development in the hydraulic evaluation beside the few well data we also used springs data 57 of the hydraulic data since springs represent the end points of flow systems and thus the water table itself the elevations of spring orifices can be handled as hydraulic heads tóth et al 2022 furthermore combined cluster and discriminant analysis ccda and linear discriminant analysis lda of groups of springs were also carried out in terms of the related discharge phenomena mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 tóth et al 2022 as a result we revealed that hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems penetrate down to about 200 m asl then in greater depth lateral flow conditions dominate it was also proven that groundwaters of the bakony mountains and balaton highland also discharge into lake balaton the largest lake in central europe fig 2 on the southern side of the lake groundwater flow systems of the siliciclastic somogy hills maximum 316 m asl fig 2 also discharge around the lake tóth et al 2020 case study southern mecsek mountains villány hills and dráva basin mecsek mountains maximum 682 m asl represent a complex pre tertiary geological build up while villány hills maximum 442 m asl form an unconfined pre tertiary carbonate ridge pre tertiary formations continuously deepen below 2 3000 m siliciclastic cover in the studied hungarian part of the adjoining dráva basin fig 2 thus villány hills and its southern foreland towards the dráva basin represent the unconfined and adjoining confined carbonate system in the area respectively however interpretation of this local scale study area also requires the understanding of the regional scale systems in this regard we could identified topography driven groundwater flow systems also in this study area irrespectively of the geological build up down to about 1500 2000 m csondor et al 2020b in the pannonian basin s east southeastern sub basins in the great hungarian plain a regionally extensive overpressured regime is known below about this depth interval of the gravitational flow systems tóth and almási 2001 this overpressured regime was first identified in the dráva basin by our group below the topography driven flow systems with maximum 66 excess pressure csondor et al 2020b more pressure generating mechanisms could be assumed like in the great hungarian plain such as non equilibrium compaction and tectonic compression tóth and almási 2001 we also found that the regional aquitard units of the neogene siliciclastic sediments of the basin fill below about 2000 m asl could be put in charge for the maintenance of the overpressure since these units can effectively impede upward fluid flow and thus pressure dissipation csondor et al 2020b in the overpressured regime upward flows dominate while the lateral flow components tend toward the basin margins however in the local scale study area of the villány hills and its southern foreland i e southeastern part of the dráva basin hydraulic data were available only from shallower depth than 200 m asl in this way demonstration of the deep overpressured regime could be based on the related processes and phenomena which show significant similarities with the buda thermal karst area namely based on the hydraulic hydrochemical and speleogenetic phenomena we could also identify beside a karst water component coming from the unconfined carbonates of the villány hills the effects of a basinal fluid component coming from the overpressured regime in the southwestern foreland of the villány hills csondor et al 2020b 4 2 asymmetric basin and flow pattern since the beginnings of basin scale groundwater flow system studies tóth 1963 1962 etc the base of investigation is the 2d half basin extending from the water divide to the central valley which are the axes of symmetry in a symmetrical basin fig 1 tóth 2009 with a few exceptions zhang et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 based on the studies carried out in the buda thermal karst btk we revealed new aspects of the concept therefore we studied the effects of basin asymmetry and the generated interbasin flow between the two halves mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 tóth et al 2020 then we also extended the understanding of this issue in general by analyzing the effects of anisotropy asymmetry of the topographical driving force for groundwater flow and basin heterogeneity in numerical simulations tóth et al 2020 as a result we demonstrated that basin asymmetry has a critical role in flow discharge and accumulation of heat mass patterns thus analysis of half basins is not sufficient but can lead to misinterpretations case studies buda thermal karst and hungarian paleogene basin bakony balaton highland and somogy hills asymmetry of groundwater flow pathways in the btk has already been assumed by several early authors based on the observed hydrochemical and temperature phenomena e g alföldi 1981 schafarzik 1928 our group confirmed first this hypothesis by basin hydraulic data interpretation see chapter 4 1 erhardt et al 2017 mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádlné szőnyi 2020 and basin scale numerical modelling havril et al 2016 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 szijártó et al 2021 accordingly the central valley or main discharge area is the river danube which also represents the boundary of the unconfined and confined carbonate regions regional groundwater flow systems coming from the btk flow through below the danube below 0 m asl toward the hungarian paleogene basin hpb then turn back and discharge in the danube valley fig 3 however below 1000 m asl all regional groundwater flow coming from the btk flow toward the hpb due to its underpressured regime which behaves as a sink the evolved asymmetric flow pattern could be explained by the differences in driving forces and recharge on the two sides of river danube i e in the unconfined and confined basin halves the btk and hpb namely water table elevation and thus potential energy is higher in the unconfined or partially confined btk while thermal driving force mixed thermal convection is more intensive in the hpb where carbonates have a thick siliciclastic cover which slows down meteoric water recharge the asymmetric flow pattern contributes to the evolution of the hydrothermal flow component convergence of meteoric and basinal fluids and the related hydrochemical and temperature phenomena along the danube particularly that of the springs and caves of budapest mádlné szőnyi 2020 mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 we could reveal a similar situation in the bakony balaton highland and adjoining somogy hills area tóth et al 2020 deeper regional groundwater flow systems coming from the higher and unconfined bakony balaton highland area flow through below lake balaton toward the lower and siliciclastic somogy hills area then turn back due to the meeting with gravitational flows coming from the somogy hills and finally discharge around the lake 4 3 hypogene speleogenesis in the context of basin scale groundwater flow the basin scale groundwater flow concept and the understanding of its geological consequences i e related processes and phenomena opened a new path for scientific evolution in karst studies namely karst phenomena including caves springs and the karst system itself can be interpreted as manifestations of flowing groundwater the connection between topography driven groundwater flow systems and potential dissolution processes in carbonates was firstly supposed by klimchouk 2007 he distinguished epigene karstification which is connected to local flow systems and hypogene cave formation which is related to intermediate or regional flow systems klimchouk 2007 klimchouk et al 2017 we significantly completed this definition by the evidences of our studies in the btk hpg system see chapter 4 1 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 szijártó et al 2019 tóth et al 2020 namely a confined basin half is also necessary to provide hydrothermal or basinal fluids to produce hypogene caves fig 3 in the btk geometry of the two connected basin halves of unconfined and confined carbonates and the consequent asymmetric flow pattern and heat distribution determine the occurrence of various springs and caves hypogene karstification is triggered and controlled by the hydrothermal and basinal fluid upwelling mixing corrosion microbially mediated dissolution etc anda et al 2017 2014 borsodi et al 2012 erhardt et al 2017 erőss et al 2012a 2011 erőss et al 2008 though basinal fluid contribution is decreasing poros et al 2012 with uplift of the btk and consequent intensification of the topography driven groundwater flow systems havril et al 2016 active hypogene caves can be found at recent discharge areas for comparison in the southern foreland of villány hills only inactive hypogene caves are known which refer to less intense basinal fluid contribution than in earlier times of basin evolution csondor et al 2020b erőss et al 2020 or recently in the btk 5 adaptation of the basic concept for further geofluids 5 1 understanding basin scale heat transport processes significance of basin scale heat transport processes was already mentioned in chapter 4 during our studies we produced also general results regarding the evaluation of the interaction of different fluid flow driving forces and their effects on groundwater flow systems and temperature distribution at basin scale in hyperthermal basins such as the pannonian basin heat transport processes have a significant effect on groundwater flow systems beside the driving force of water table elevational differences i e topography heat conduction is generally significant in geological formations of reduced porosity and permeability i e in aquitards where there is no intense groundwater flow e g clauser 2009 deming 2002 przybycin et al 2017 in most studies the effect of forced thermal convection i e advection and heat conduction is noted regarding groundwater flow where temperature field evolve following the flow pattern e g an et al 2015 clauser and villinger 1990 domenico and palciauskas 1973 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 pure free thermal convection i e buoyancy force has been revealed to generate groundwater flow both in sedimentary basins e g lenkey 1993 lopez et al 2016 and in deep confined carbonate reservoirs e g licour 2014 lipsey et al 2016 pasquale et al 2013 however a comprehensive basin scale investigation of the combined effects of topography driven forced and buoyancy driven free thermal convection mixed thermal convection has long remained an open question to examine this issue first we carried out two dimensional numerical simulations in theoretical groundwater flow basins szijártó et al 2019 in most synthetic models the appearance of thermal buoyancy was noticed which caused a complex and time dependent flow pattern with hot upwellings and cold downwellings namely we could recognize that higher geothermal gradients and greater model depths facilitate the evolution of time dependent free thermal convection which mainly affects the deeper part of midline and discharge zones however increasing water table slope and anisotropy coefficient favor the formation of stationary forced thermal convection in addition we realized the position of the maximum hydraulic head shifts from the highest point of the water table downward in the recharge zone in all cases of realistic geothermal gradients finally besides the thermal rayleigh number we introduced a non dimensional modified péclet number for the classification of the flow systems into forced and free thermal convection dominated types szijártó et al 2019 we also studied the effects of basin asymmetry and intrabasin flow see chapter 4 2 on the temperature distribution tóth et al 2020 as a result we revealed the effects of asymmetric water table distribution anisotropy heterogeneity and basal heat flow on basin scale heat accumulation e g location of basin parts bearing the highest geothermal potential locations of thermal spring discharge and prevailing mechanisms of heat transfer during preliminary geothermal exploration these generalized and simplified groundwater flow and heat transport models can support the identification of prospective areas and planning of shallow and deep geothermal energy utilization also with respect to reinjection possibilities in addition these can provide starting points for realistic 3d models finally based on these results we also defined for the first time the scope of geothermal hydrogeology which is to examine and explain the basin scale flow pattern and temperature distribution in addition to the occurrence of possible thermal springs tóth et al 2020 as a result hydrogeologically favorable regions for sustainable long term geothermal energy exploitation could be delineated case study buda thermal karst and hungarian paleogene basin our numerical analysis of the buda thermal karst btk hungarian paleogene basin hpb system revealed that in each simulation scenario independently of the model parameters time dependent mixed thermal convection evolved both in the deep and the confined part of the system fig 4 b szijártó et al 2021 the difference is significant compared to the sole effect of topography driven steady state groundwater flow and forced thermal convection fig 4 a the revealed time dependent behavior of the temperature field can also be confirmed by observation data dövényi 1994 hydrogeological interpretations mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 former numerical simulations havril et al 2016 and speleological observations virág 2019 5 2 basin hydraulics in geothermal exploration basin scale groundwater flow system concept and basin scale evaluation of measured hydraulic data i e basin hydraulics can also be used in geothermal potential evaluation in case of water based solutions in the framework of geothermal hydrogeology we worked out a methodology to propose the involvement of hydrodynamic analysis in preliminary geothermal exploration mádl szőnyi and simon 2016 mádlné szőnyi 2019 beside the investigation of the other elements of the geothermal system heat reservoir dickson and fanelli 2015 the approach focuses on the aspects of pore pressure regimes to increase energy efficiency and sustainability of water production and injection accordingly topography driven groundwater flow systems representing the upper flow regime in most sedimentary basins worldwide can be handled as regionally unconfined aquifer systems these systems are hydraulically open unconfined and we can suppose their supply from recharge if it is available consequently they are a priori renewable groundwater resources which can be produced by a rate being in balance with the meteoric water supply of the recharge areas from injection point of view in regional recharge areas characterized by downward flow injection wells can be operated without energy investment while in midline and discharge areas characterized by through and upward flow respectively low pressure injection is needed overpressured regimes have no recharge or water supply because surface water is not able to enter due to the high excess pressure compared to hydrostatic thus these hold non renewable resources it means that their water production is the function of specific storage and sustainable production requires high pressure reinjection underpressured reservoirs have restricted water supply recharge and are basically unproductive because of the underpressure but these conditions are favorable for free reinjection identification and characterization of the different pressure regimes is possible by basin hydraulic evaluation as we demonstrated it in all our study areas while its basin scale application for preliminary geothermal exploration purposes was demonstrated in the duna tisza interfluve mádl szőnyi and simon 2016 and the btk hpb system mádlné szőnyi 2019 fig 2 beside the geothermal utilization results can also be used in water management regarding groundwater production and water reinjection see chapter 8 2 in addition we also proposed a structured concept workflow to investigate injection related issues including pressure regimes markó et al 2021b particularly in case of low pressure reinjection into siliciclastic reservoirs which is usually challenging ungemach 2003 namely the potential problem sources of reinjection acting on different scales were examined such as groundwater flow conditions basin hydraulics reservoir properties and local clogging processes particle migration mineral precipitation microbial activity markó et al 2021b we applied the methodology in the local scale investigation of an existing geothermal site mezőberény se hungary fig 2 suffering from low injectivity markó et al 2021b markó et al 2021a as a result insufficient reservoir properties i e low transmissivity and significant clogging by microbial pollution were identified while hydraulic conditions were proved to be not unfavorable we also follow this workflow during the estimation of the reinjection potential on a further study area zala basin sw hungary fig 2 where hydraulic analysis revealed beneficial conditions in the studied aquifer for reinjection markó et al n d 5 3 considering advection in shallow geothermal utilization beside deep geothermal exploration we also deal with the preliminary estimation of shallow geothermal potential it is required to predict the extractable thermal energy and the best locations for system installation e g for borehole heat exchangers and to prepare the proper system design in our joint research with the geological survey of finland we introduced a novel method termed infinite borehole field model to estimate and map the technical shallow geothermal potential markó et al 2022 the model uses the finite element method to create ground models and to find the maximum annually extractable geothermal energy by solving an optimization problem namely the temperature of the borehole wall is not allowed to drop below a certain minimum temperature during the operation markó et al 2022 the main novelty of the method is its ability of considering the interaction of neighboring boreholes by simulating a simplified borehole field this can significantly influence the thermal yield of borehole heat exchangers in urban regions but being neglected by most of the previous methods e g casasso and sethi 2016 garcía gil et al 2015 ondreka et al 2007 another advantage of the method is the simulation of the effect of advective heat transport due to groundwater flow which is usually also neglected in potential estimations our specific analysis showed a positive effect in the presence of significant flow velocities this means that groundwater flow can transport heat to the boreholes however with closely spaced boreholes increasing flow velocities decrease the thermal yield i e the cold plume generated by the heat extraction reaches the neighboring boreholes as a case study we applied the method in budapest hungary fig 2 markó et al 2022 these results support the intent of involving groundwater flow and system approach into shallow geothermal analyses as well 5 4 petroleum hydrogeology 5 4 1 thermogenic hydrocarbons certain types of petroleum accumulations can also be handled as the manifestations of flowing groundwater tóth 1999 therefore understanding of migration and accumulation processes requires the knowledge of groundwater flow conditions these have crucial role in hydrodynamic hubbert 1956 and hydraulic tóth 1980 hydrocarbon entrapment hence petroleum hydrogeology uses hydrogeological methods for petroleum exploration case studies hungarian paleogene basin dráva basin southeastern great hungarian plain we applied the groundwater flow concept and our methodology in the already mentioned hungarian paleogene basin hpb and dráva basin see chapter 4 1 as well as in sub basins of the southeastern great hungarian plain derecske trough békés basin battonya high berekfürdő high fig 2 topography driven regional groundwater flow systems are underlaid by an overpressured regime in these basins except the underpressured regime in the hpg see chapter 4 1 where gravitational downward flows in the recharge zones meet with overpressured upward flows i e in the converging zone we identified hydraulic entrapment zones which represent the upper boundary of vertical petroleum migration and hydraulically favorable conditions potential for entrapment csondor et al 2020b czauner and mádl szőnyi 2013 furthermore we determined the hydraulic function of fault systems in the upward dissipation of overpressure and since this can be materialized by fluid flow in petroleum migration as well czauner et al 2008 czauner and mádl szőnyi 2013 2011 in the hpb underpressure driven downward flows from the source rocks toward the pre tertiary karstified carbonate reservoirs determine the distribution of accumulations mádl szőnyi et al 2019a in addition our studies in the buda thermal karst see chapter 4 1 contributed to the understanding of the porosity evolution in carbonate reservoirs erőss et al 2011 poros et al 2012 poros et al 2010 5 4 2 biogenic gas these studies were focused on thermogenic hydrocarbons but the basin scale groundwater flow concept and our methodology are even more effective in the exploration of biogenic gases approximately 20 of the discovered natural gas reserves around the world are of biogenic origin mostly methane and their importance as a primary energy source is rapidly increasing biogenic methane could be generated also from sediments with low total organic carbon content 0 4 and in lower temperature 0 75 c thus in shallower depth usually above 2000 m compared to thermogenic gases however the generated methane is thought to be able to migrate for larger distances and thus form larger accumulations only in aqueous solution with flowing groundwater e g bartha et al 2018 cramer et al 1999 based on this assumption we built a novel simplistic 2d model in ms excel including a methane solubility database to determine the amount of dissolved and transported methane in flowing groundwater and the amount of the released free gas in the discharge area which could be trapped and accumulated adonya et al 2022 some significant input parameters of the model and the 3d upscaling of the estimations require the evaluation of groundwater flow systems in the studied area e g linear flow velocities recharge midline and discharge areas we applied the model in eastern hungary fig 2 based on our previous hydrogeological evaluation ben mahrez et al 2020 szabó et al 2019 as a result we revealed that the biogenic part 65 of the largest natural gas accumulation of hungary hajdúszoboszló 1 3 tcf original gas in place prior to production which can be found in a topography driven regional discharge area could be fully charged by biogenic methane generated in the respective recharge and midline areas and transported by groundwater flows in the last 1 million year adonya et al 2022 6 adaptation of groundwater flow concept for the radioactivity of groundwater during fluid rock interactions the natural geological and geochemical environment in addition to providing beneficial mineral content and bioessential elements to groundwater may also give rise to undesirable or toxic properties through an excess of various elements edmunds and smedley 1996 groundwater may also contain different natural alpha 238u 234u 232th 226ra and 210po and beta emitters 40k 228ra and 210pb from non detectable levels to concentrations of concern for human health increasing use of groundwater resources for drinking purposes calls for careful evaluation of this aspect chau et al 2011 jobbágy et al 2022 lapworth et al 2022 vengosh et al 2022 who 2017 however identification and assessment of risks to health from drinking water relies often excessively on analysis of water samples e g chmielewska et al 2020 piñero garcía et al 2021 who 2007 thus the origin of the eventually measured elevated activity is not explained which is a considerable shortage in finding the appropriate risk management method the radionuclide content of groundwater is usually explained mainly by geological hydrochemical and anthropogenic factors birke et al 2010 bonotto 2017 liesch et al 2015 riedel and kübeck 2018 vengosh et al 2022 vinson et al 2009 in general however there is no apparent relationship between the type of rock constituting the water bearing formation and the observed activity concentration levels of the radionuclides chau et al 2011 since wide ranges of activity concentrations of the radioisotopes are observed within the same aquifer from fraction of mbql 1 to several hundred mbql 1 erőss et al 2018 the basin scale groundwater flow concept however helps to understand the origin and distribution of the different physicochemical characteristics and components of groundwater areas of different hydraulic regimes recharge midline discharge even within the same aquifer are characterized by different geochemical environment from oxidizing to reducing respectively therefore in case of redox sensitive parameters such as uranium or radium which are the most common radionuclides in groundwater understanding groundwater flow systems is imperative osmond and cowart 2000 on the other hand the occurrence of certain radionuclides in groundwater can be used as environmental tracers and can help to identify groundwater flow dynamics regime type flow rate hierarchically nested flow systems etc gainon et al 2007 ji et al 2022 porcelli and swarzenski 2003 swarzenski 2007 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 to this end the basin scale groundwater flow concept and our methodology were introduced in the research of natural radioactivity of groundwater by our group in the bükk mountains erőss et al 2015 in the buda thermal karst area erőss et al 2015 erőss et al 2012b kovács bodor et al 2019 in lake velence and its catchment area fig 2 baják et al 2022a 2022b erőss et al 2018 and in a riverbank filtered system along river danube csondor et al 2021 2020a as a result we could explain the origin and occurrence of high activity values in groundwater used for drinking water supply in the studied sites namely elevated uranium activity concentrations were found in areas characterized by recharge regimes with oxidizing conditions whereas elevated radium activity was found in higher order flow systems intermediate regional characterized by reducing conditions baják et al 2022a erőss et al 2018 erőss et al 2012b fig 1 high radon content was found in those places where iron hydroxide biogeochemical precipitates occurred as a specific manifestation of flowing groundwater which efficiently adsorb radium and act as local radon source causing high radon content in the waters csondor et al 2017 dobosy et al 2016 erőss 2010 erőss et al 2012b kovács bodor et al 2019 mádlné szőnyi 2020 on the other hand due to its short half life radon is a useful time tracer for hydrogeological systems with relatively short flow paths and or high flow velocities e g for local flow systems fig 1 and karst aquifers criss et al 2007 eisenlohr and surbeck 1995 where its source is the weathered soil zone in addition our research also demonstrated related to transient water resources such as riverbank filtered water supply systems that the measured activity values can strongly depend on the timing of monitoring i e on the river stage which determines the ratio of river water and groundwater in the well and thus the quality of produced water thus using basin scale groundwater flow system approach in the evaluation of natural radioactivity and in the assessment of drinking water quality parameters such as radionuclides are indispensable to take proper actions and to choose the right approach to minimise health risk as climate change and growing water demand will increase the role of groundwater future water resources can be evaluated regarding their quality by this approach case study lake velence and its catchment area lake velence fig 2 is a shallow soda lake situated in a tectonic depression in the southern foreland of the granitic outcrop of velence hills the lake has recently suffered from a significant lake level drop and related water quality problems severely affecting the ecosystem of the lake in the annual report on water budget of the lake groundwater inflow outflow has been left out of consideration by the authority central transdanubian water management directorate 2020 to prove that lake velence has an interconnection with groundwater and to integrate the lake into groundwater flow systems we applied the groundwater flow concept and our hydraulic methodology baják et al 2022b in addition to validate the results of the hydraulic evaluation we took groundwater samples from the miocene quaternary siliciclastic aquifer system in the vicinity of the lake the samples were analyzed for stable isotope composition δ2h and δ18o and radioactive isotope concentration σu 226ra and 222rn as a result in shallow depth 0 250 m asl local flow systems were identified flowing from elevated areas toward adjacent lowlands e g from velence hills and local highs in south of lake velence toward the lake δ18o and δ2h composition and variability of the δ values measured in shallow groundwater samples indicate direct recharge from precipitation of the present climate oxidizing conditions and short residence time is indicated by high uranium and radon activity measured both in shallow groundwater and springs baják et al 2022a 2022b the lake has also high uranium activity 392 mbql 1 most likely originating from groundwater inflow into the lake other studies also proved that radionuclide content measured in lake waters originates from groundwater liao et al 2020a 2020b below 0 m asl an intermediate or regional flow system flowing from the water divide in south of the lake toward the eastern river danube and western regional erosional bases could be identified groundwater samples taken from deep wells or from wells located close to the presumed regional discharge areas are characterized by a more depleted δ composition and high 226ra activity concentrations up to 999 mbql 1 along with negative orp oxidation reduction potential values which properties suggest older groundwater i e longer travel time in conclusion the results of our research indicated that lake velence is the discharge area of local groundwater flow systems known to be more sensitive to climate changes and anthropogenic activities e g contamination overexploitation based on our findings the groundwater component should also be taken into consideration in the lakes water budget and its management 7 significance of groundwater flow in groundwater surface water interaction and in groundwater dependent ecosystems surface waters have been investigated as connected systems to groundwater since the 1960 s e g hancock et al 2005 meyboom 1967 sophocleous 2002 winter et al 1998 zurek et al 2015 groundwater not only supplies water but transports heat nutrients and dissolved salts to surface waters and vice versa determining the chemical composition nutrient budget trophic status and presence of different species hayashi and rosenberry 2002 yihdego et al 2017 thus during the investigation of groundwater and surface water interactions and the related ecosystems understanding of the connected groundwater flow systems and their surface manifestations are crucial regarding both water quantity and quality basin scale groundwater flow concept and our methodology could effectively reveal these connections in our studies in lake velence and its catchment area baják et al 2022a 2022b see chapter 6 in the tihany peninsula tóth et al 2016 see chapter 8 1 and in the duna tisza interfluve where scale dependent complexity of groundwater flow systems and its significance were highlighted in particular case study duna tisza interfluve the scale dependence of groundwater flow systems and their effects on the surface are highly considered in our studies these issues are crucial particularly in the investigation of groundwater dependent ecosystems gde of the duna tisza interfluve dti this area is located in the western part of the great hungarian plain between river danube duna and tisza fig 2 we investigated here the connection of groundwater flow with the different wetland types vegetation and salinization phenomena by applying the basin scale groundwater flow concept and our methodology mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 as a result of the regional scale analyses we revealed that topography driven groundwater flow systems are characterized by meteoric water and are underlaid by the overpressured regime of basinal fluids also known from other parts of the great hungarian plain see chapter 5 4 and the dráva basin see chapter 4 1 the elevated north south directed ridge region in the central part of the dti represents the recharge area of topography driven regional groundwater flow systems which tend toward the river valleys and force also the basinal fluid upwellings into these directions as a result meteoric waters of the topography driven groundwater flow systems discharge mixing with the saline basinal fluids in the river valleys consequently in the gravitational flow system s discharge areas we can find fresh water type meadows and wetlands while in the regional discharge area of the mixed waters saline wetlands vegetation and soils can be found fig 5 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 simon et al 2015 the hydraulic and hydrochemical investigation also gave the base for a salinization model in the area we found that saline water upwelling from the overpressured regime contributes to the surface salinization providing the salt for the processes however the amount of the rising saline water is negligible compared to the water moving in the topography driven system simon et al 2011 we studied in detail some wetlands in the western half of the area representing the scale dependent complexity of groundwater and surface water interactions in the ridge region freshwater type wetlands can be found e g ágasegyháza lake on fig 5 which are influenced only by the topography driven systems these are recharge type lakes losing water to the groundwater system on the western flank of the ridge the kolon lake fig 5 is also connected only to the topography driven system in a through flow situation namely it is gaining water from east and losing towards west around the saline kelemen szék lake in the danube valley topography driven meteoric and basinal saline water discharge together fig 5 as a third scale we also investigated local scale groundwater surface water connections seeming to be more complex around this lake in the upper 20 m the lake is in a through flow situation caused by an artificial canal in the east of the lake simon 2010 thus the lake is in a regional discharge situation which is superimposed by a local through flow condition the through flow provides water supply and the deep upwelling determines the saline character on local scale simon et al 2011 8 effects of climate change on groundwater flow systems and mitigation possibilities 8 1 impact of climate change on groundwater flow systems most of the above described processes and phenomena are expected to be highly affected by global climate change for instance future alteration of recharge would have significant consequences on groundwater levels and flow dynamics chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 consequently scientific interest in understanding the effects of changing climatic conditions on groundwater replenishment has grown rapidly over the last decade aguilera and murillo 2009 kundzewicz et al 2008 however studies which focus on the impacts of climate change on the fragmentation and hierarchy of groundwater flow systems e g havril et al 2018 trásy havril et al 2022 and its implications on groundwater and surface water interaction persaud et al 2020 are still under represented in the literature therefore our group intended to evaluate the influence of climate change altered recharge on groundwater levels and coupled effects on the connected groundwater flow systems using transient numerical flow simulations special emphasis is placed on how flow system hierarchy may change to examine possible consequences on groundwater related shallow surface water bodies and on groundwater surface water interaction case study tihany peninsula we started the climate related evaluation through an example of the tihany peninsula bakony balaton highland region hungary fig 2 havril et al 2018 our hydrogeological and shallow geophysical studies revealed that the three minor wetlands of this peninsula are groundwater dependent ecosystems gde while their groundwater levels determine the flow directions between them tóth et al 2016 based on regional climate change modelling predictions for hungary bartholy et al 2014 pieczka et al 2011 20 decrease in precipitation and 4 c increase in temperature was taken into account in the numerical simulation by the end of the century it is expected to cause 67 decrease in recharge within this time frame based on our previous findings regarding the vertical extent of active groundwater flow at the study site tóth et al 2016 the numerical flow system analysis focused on the processes acting in the upper approximately 100 m where the most significant changes in the flow field are expected due to climate change as a result by the end of the simulated period elevational i e hydraulic head differences along the water table had decreased due to climatic recharge reduction and horizontal flow became dominant fig 6 this resulted in the dissipation of transient local groundwater flow systems while the characteristics of flow system hierarchy changed from nested flow systems to a set of single flow cells these changes could have significant effects on gdes since a decrease in groundwater level could change the character of groundwater discharge into a surface water body as occurred in case of the outer lake fig 6 havril et al 2018 8 2 managed aquifer recharge and groundwater flow systems for the mitigation of the effect of climate change and overexploitation the number of managed aquifer recharge mar systems is increasing worldwide and the range of applications is getting wider stefan and ansems 2018 however groundwater flow systems are generally not considered in mar site selection and research our group aims to integrate basin scale groundwater flow concept into this topic as well we investigated the effect of water table inclination and topography on mar efficiency by saturated unsaturated transient numerical model simulations szabó et al 2021b the results strengthened that high horizontal hydraulic gradient is often not favored for mar implementation as it causes higher water loss and mixing of recharge water with native groundwater gale et al 2002 however in the rehabilitation of groundwater dependent ecosystems gde these processes can be advantageous we revealed that if water is infiltrated at the local recharge area groundwater level also increases at the connected local discharge area the research results proved that for water replenishment of gdes the volume of recharging water is less important than the hydraulic gradient between the recharge structure and the discharge area which is also advantageous szabó et al 2021b case study duna tisza interfluve these results can be well applied for the duna tisza interfluve dti fig 2 where we have already revealed the connections between groundwater flow systems and gdes see chapter 7 this area and especially the semi arid ridge region have been suffering from severe water level decline and water shortage for several decades mostly due to climate change 50 and groundwater overproduction 30 nagy et al 2016 it causes environmental problems for instance many lakes and wetlands degraded or completely disappeared over the years most of the dti s replenishment plans focus on distant recharge water possibilities e g from river danube and water transport by surface canals however water quality is also a crucial aspect in the sensitive balance of gdes see chapter 7 thus managed increase of natural recharge using the only available local water sources of runoff and rainwater would be more favorable based on our simulation results application of mar techniques in the local recharge areas could also raise the water table in the respective discharge areas szabó et al 2021b furthermore due to the physical chemical and biological processes along the subsurface flow pathways quality of the discharging water could be close to that of the native groundwater of the given area we also carried out mar site suitability mapping in baluchistan pakistan hayat et al 2021 and in the central part of the dti mádl szőnyi et al 2019b szabó et al 2020 here we also set up a field experiment in a favorable location to examine the effects of rooftop rainwater harvesting through a shallow well rrwh sw szabó et al 2022 2021a water level specific electric conductivity temperature and chemical composition were monitored in the infiltration well and two monitoring wells located down gradient from the experiment the first results after 20 months of infiltration showed that the method is favorable both in terms of groundwater quality and quantity based on our further gis analysis the potential of rrwh on settlement level is significant consequently rrwh sw could be a local scale nature based solution to complement natural recharge szabó et al 2022 2021a and to rehabilitate a nearby dried up gde szabó et al 2021b 9 summary and conclusion the hydrogeology research group named józsef and erzsébet tóth endowed hydrogeology chair of the department of geology institute of geography and earth sciences eötvös loránd university elte budapest hungary is a majority 70 women team led by professor judit mádl szőnyi the members are hydrogeologists and geophysicists mostly her former and current mentees and her mentees students the group had originally focused on the basin scale system approach of groundwater flows then gradually extended its research activity to other geofluids in answer to emerging global challenges however the basin scale groundwater flow concept remained the base of all our studies as these flow systems interact with the rock framework and all other geofluids resulting in systematic distribution of the related environmental and geological processes and phenomena our studies demonstrated that understanding of groundwater flow systems and their scale dependent complexity from basin to local scales is essential during the investigation of subsurface and several surface processes and phenomena without this knowledge water ecosystem and resource management cannot be handled effectively or in a sustainable way in this review paper we briefly summarized the basic concept of basin scale groundwater flow our methodological developments and the wide range of successful applications in hydrogeological and other geofluid research basin scale or modern hydrogeology is based on the recognition of nonexistence of impermeable rocks i e aquicludes as a result regional hydraulic continuity is a phenomenological property of the rock framework depending on time and space scale of monitoring therefore basin scale groundwater flow systems can evolve driven by different diving forces the most significant one in terrestrial areas is provided by the elevational differences of the water table i e topography or gravity driven flow groundwater flow systems result in the systematic distribution of the related environmental and geological processes and phenomena depending on the type of flow systems local intermediate regional and regimes recharge through flow discharge groundwater interacting with all other fluids thus understanding of the groundwater flow pattern at basin scale can provide the common base for harmonized geofluid research and utilization dsa gr we developed a workflow for basin scale groundwater flow evaluation based on hydraulic methodology and complemented by retrospective analysis evaluation of the manifestations of flowing groundwater numerical flow and transport simulations in our studies we applied this workflow focusing on the understanding of basin scale groundwater flow the groundwater flow related phenomena were interpreted for geofluid related resources as well e g groundwater geothermal energy hydrothermal minerals we furtherly developed the basic concept and adapted it to thick confined and unconfined outcropping carbonates and particularly to their marginal areas as a subsidiary consequence of the examination of these areas which represent full basins with the elevated unconfined carbonates in one half of the basin and the confined carbonates below a siliciclastic cover in the other half of the basin we also revealed the importance of asymmetric basin and flow pattern over against the generally used symmetric basin or half basin approach we also extended this issue later in general based on numerical simulations as an application in the related field of karst hydrogeology we significantly developed the concept of hypogene speleogenesis furthermore we adapted the basic concept for the understanding of basin scale heat transport processes revealing the significance of mixed thermal convection we defined different pressure regimes based on hydraulic evaluation which method allows of the delineation of hydrogeologically favorable regions for sustainable utilization of deep and shallow geothermal resources in preliminary geothermal exploration accordingly we also defined the scope of geothermal hydrogeology which is to examine and explain the basin scale flow pattern and temperature distribution similar application of the basic concept in petroleum exploration has already founded the field of petroleum hydrogeology for decades we also achieved results and developments in this field regarding both thermogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons and intend to use and integrate our experiences and methods into geothermal hydrogeology in answer to the demands of energy transition in addition our investigation of natural radioactivity in groundwater and drinking water revealed the connections between the geological background geochemical processes and flow dynamics besides our results also strengthen the applicability of radionuclides mainly uranium radium and radon as natural tracers of groundwater as another issue of groundwater quality and also quantity one of our first research fields is the study of groundwater and surface water interactions with a particular interest in groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes our results demonstrated the significance of scale dependent complexity of groundwater flow systems and their effects on surface processes and phenomena understanding of these relationships is indispensable in the protection and restoration of gdes these issues are of increasing importance due to the effects of global climate change consequently we also study the effects of climate change on groundwater flow systems and our results predict severe changes in the flow pattern hierarchy and the connected gdes within a few decades in case of water shortage and groundwater level decline managed aquifer recharge mar methods are the most promising water replenishment techniques our studies which integrate the basin scale groundwater flow concept into mar research proved that managed increase of natural recharge can cause improvement in groundwater quantity and quality furthermore even in larger distances if the transport systems of groundwater flows are properly utilized the presented case studies from the pannonian basin as a natural laboratory demonstrate the methodology of basin scale groundwater flow evaluation interpretation and application for practical purposes our studies usually provide general models and solutions which can be utilized in any sedimentary basins all over the world in conclusion all these studies are based on the basin scale groundwater flow system concept and related methodology and were mostly supervised by professor mádl szőnyi while her mentees specialized in different fields of hydrogeology and other disciplines as well but finally each research proved to be one part of the geofluid research puzzle which allow of the systematic exploration and harmonized and sustainable exploitation of geofluid related resources the complex

had originally focused on basin scale groundwater flow systems and the related processes and phenomena but extended its research activity to other geofluids in answer to global challenges such as the

of geology institute of geography and earth sciences eötvös loránd university elte budapest hungary is a majority 70 women team led by professor judit mádl szőnyi she started to establish the education of hydrogeological courses at the elte in the 1990 s and built up an internationally acknowledged research group from her mentees in the last 20 years since 2016 the group works in the framework of the józsef and erzsébet tóth endowed hydrogeology jeteh chair which was initiated and supported by professor józsef joe tóth university of alberta edmonton canada the hungarian born world class hydrogeologist mentioned such by deming 2002 tóth helped mádl szőnyi to introduce the so called modern hydrogeology and fostered cooperation and discussion with the international scientific community thanks to the systematic building mádl szőnyi initiated a scientific commission in the international association of hydrogeologists iah named regional groundwater flow commission in 2011 where she has been serving since that as a chair with networking all over the world her contribution was acknowledged by the iah presidents award in 2021 the strong international background helps her to manage research as the head of the jeteh chair at elte where the members are hydrogeologists and geophysicists mostly her former and current mentees and her mentees students the group originally focused on the basin scale system approach of groundwater flow and the related natural phenomena based on the theory of hydraulic continuity tóth 1995 1980 this approach differs significantly from the earlier artesian approach which focuses only on confined flow in aquifers jiang et al 2020 understanding the basin scale hydraulic connections and groundwater flow systems is particularly indispensable nowadays when demand for groundwater resources is highly increasing worldwide in the population explosion and global climate change induced water crisis world economic forum 2022 world economic forum 2021 world meteorological organization 2021 furthermore the multifaceted utilization of the underground space e g managed aquifer recharge soil improvement irrigation sewerage controlling of contaminations petroleum exploitation geothermal energy production geological storage of carbon dioxide mineral exploration etc the resulting conflicts of interests and environmental consequences as well as demands of the circular economy and energy transition raise further issues e g howarth et al 2011 martens et al 2020 van ree and van beukering 2016 recognizing these global challenges and the possibilities of the groundwater flow system approach the group extended its research and consequently the educational activity to other geofluids such as geothermal fluids and petroleum within the framework of an h2020 project excellency network building for comprehensive research and assessment of geofluids enerag we worked out the novelty dynamic system approach for geofluids and their resources dsa gr czauner et al 2022 this concept provides a framework for integrated geofluid research and consequently can efficiently combine and optimize the research and utilization of geofluids and the related groundwater geothermal energy and mineral resources the base of dsa gr is provided by the basin scale groundwater flow system concept which is the core concept of all research activities of the group in this review paper we intend to present summarily i the basic concept of the basin scale system approach of groundwater flow and its relation to geofluid research ii the methodology introduced by our group for the evaluation iii the contribution of our research group on the further development of the basic concept and iv its practical applications by our research group for many fields of hydrogeology and geofluid research the briefly presented studies were conducted in the pannonian basin hungary which is a perfect research laboratory due to its complex geological build up with deep sedimentary basins and limited mountain ranges however our studies usually provide general models and solutions which have been and can be utilized in the future in any sedimentary basins all over the world 2 the basic concept of basin scale system approach of groundwater flow and geofluid research basin scale or modern hydrogeology is based on the recognition of nonexistence of impermeable rocks i e aquicludes that could completely inhibit groundwater flow brace 1980 jiang et al 2020 neuzil 1994 1986 tissot and welte 1978 namely all kind of rocks have some permeability just the lower permeability rocks i e aquitards contain and transmit less fluid than higher permeability rocks i e aquifers as a result regional hydraulic continuity is a phenomenological property of the rock framework whilst its observability depends on the spatial and time scale of the monitoring bredehoeft et al 1983 tóth 1995 witherspoon and neuman 1967 as the most significant consequence of the regional hydraulic continuity basin scale groundwater flow systems can evolve bredehoeft 2018 gassiat et al 2013 heath 1983 tóth 2009 zijl 2019 the most general fluid flow driving force near surface in terrestrial regions in mature non deforming basins garven 1995 is provided by the elevational differences of the water table which form the so called topography driven or gravity driven or gravitational flow systems deming 2002 tóth 2009 wang et al 2011 zijl 1999 since fluids flow from higher to lower fluid potentials hubbert 1940 in these systems topographical highs represent recharge areas where infiltrating rainwater flows dominantly downward on the other hand topographical lows represent discharge areas where groundwater flows upward towards the land surface the recharge and discharge areas are connected by midline or through flow areas where the prevailing flow direction is horizontal fig 1 undulation of land surface results in hierarchically nested flow systems namely local intermediate and regional scale flow systems tóth 1963 fig 1 whilst geological heterogeneities e g structural elements heterogeneity and anisotropy of sediments cause an even more complex flow pattern in fact infinite variability of flow systems can exist due to the differences in topography climate and geology e g cardenas and jiang 2010 freeze and witherspoon 1967 gleeson and manning 2008 tóth 1971 wang et al 2018 2017 winter 2001 zlotnik et al 2011 moreover regional fluid flow driving forces other than topography could also work particularly in juvenile i e deforming basins such as compaction tectonic compression erosion rebound buoyancy garven 1995 ingebritsen et al 2006 interactions of superimposed flow systems with different driving forces can result the most complex flow pattern with specific situations e g harrison and summa 1991 tóth and almási 2001 such as in the pannonian basin as a result of the spatial basin scale and time span 1 10 million years of operation the cross formational flow and fluid rock interactions groundwater flow modifies its subsurface and surface environment therefore it behaves as a geologic agent namely it mobilizes transports and deposits matter and heat in a distributed manner tóth 1999 mobilization and deposition accumulation are typical of zones of high and low fluid potentials respectively hubbert 1956 jiang et al 2014 2012 tóth 1999 1980 consequently groundwater flow systems result in the systematic distribution of the related environmental and geological processes and phenomena in other words these genetically related manifestations of groundwater flow are different and characteristic for the hydraulic regimes recharge midline discharge as well as for the penetration depth i e order of the flow systems local intermediate regional fig 1 it means that an observed phenomenon or process and particularly a group of that refer to the hydraulic regime of the area and the penetration depth of the related flow system since groundwater flow paths can be evaluated quantitatively and in a distributed manner this approach allows site specific i solutions for geofluid related issues and ii search for geofluid related resources e g groundwater geothermal energy hydrothermal minerals which can be viewed simply as products of groundwater flows and fluid rock interactions accordingly groundwater interacting with all other fluids during its movement thus understanding of the groundwater flow pattern on basin scale can supply the common base for the more necessary interdisciplinary approach of harmonized geofluid research and utilization dsa gr czauner et al 2022 3 introduced methodology we developed a workflow for basin scale groundwater flow evaluation czauner et al 2022 containing the elements of the hydraulic methodology of tóth 2009 complemented by further methods retrospective analysis evaluation of the manifestations of flowing groundwater numerical flow and transport simulations etc in all our studies we applied a similar methodology i e workflow focusing on the understanding of the pathways and processes of basin scale groundwater flow the speciality of this approach goes beyond the aquifer based confined flow of the artesian paradigm jiang et al 2020 and based on the hydraulic continuity assumes impermeable aquicludes only in numerical simulations as boundary condition accordingly groundwater flow as the subsurface part of the water cycle is determined by the hydraulic connections of aquifers and aquitards and by the fluid flow driving forces these regional or basin scale i e areas of 1 000 10 000 km2 depths of 1000 m relationships also control the local scale processes which should always be evaluated in the framework of the basin scale results czauner et al 2022 mádlné szőnyi 2020 the methodology contains the complex analysis of i pre production measured data hydraulic temperature hydro geo chemical ii hydrostratigraphic build up characterization of aquifers and aquitards and iii the past and present groundwater flow related surface and subsurface phenomena and processes the fundamental part of the workflow is the understanding of natural flow conditions i e the basin scale analysis of pre production measured hydraulic well data which reveals the fluid potential field thus direction and magnitude of the fluid flow driving force these should be jointly interpreted with the qualitative analysis of the hydrostratigraphic build up which genetically influences the distribution of fluid potentials as a result a real flow system model could be set up which is the 3d systemic interpretation of the real measured hydraulic data mádlné szőnyi 2020 this could be complemented with the evaluation of measured hydro geo chemical isotope and temperature data from wells and with the mapping and analysis of past i e retrospective research and present groundwater flow related geological and environmental processes and phenomena in this way these phenomena could be interpreted allowing site specific search for geofluid related resources e g groundwater geothermal energy hydrothermal minerals finally numerical flow and transport simulations could be founded on and validated by the real flow system model i e interpreted measured data for instance to study the decisive processes and flow driving forces it is worth highlighting that basin hydraulics aim to evaluate the fluid flow driving force i e fluid potential field while flow intensities and directions could be interpreted only in numerical simulations where hydraulic properties of the rock framework are quantitatively combined with the driving force field czauner et al 2022 4 development of the basic concept regarding groundwater flow 4 1 adaptation to unconfined confined carbonates the basin scale groundwater flow concept was developed originally tóth 1963 1962 and since then mostly applied for siliciclastic sedimentary basins e g cardenas and jiang 2010 freeze and witherspoon 1968 1967 tóth 2009 though it was assumed that thick carbonate systems are also characterized by cross formational flow and hydraulic continuity klimchouk 2007 klimchouk and ford 2009 however this assumption has never been physically confirmed our group initiated goldscheider et al 2010 and carried out the adaptation of the concept for confined and unconfined outcropping carbonates and particularly for their marginal areas mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 in this context the elevated unconfined carbonate ranges adjoin with sedimentary basins where the carbonates continuously deepen below a thick and dominantly siliciclastic cover with lower hydraulic conductivity we investigated three study areas fig 2 by the approaches and methods described in chapter 3 based on the adaptation of the basic concept csondor et al 2020b erhardt et al 2017 mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádlné szőnyi 2020 tóth 2018 tóth et al 2020 as a general result thick carbonate units could be characterized by higher hydraulic connectivity compared to siliciclastic basins which results in recharge controlled differences haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 in water table elevation and normal i e close to hydrostatic pressure conditions in addition though confined carbonate units are traditionally considered to be aquifer systems hydraulically independent of their siliciclastic cover by the application of the adapted concept regional hydraulic communication between the confined carbonates and their cover was revealed mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádlné szőnyi 2020 case study buda thermal karst and hungarian paleogene basin in the buda thermal karst btk elevated maximum 559 m asl pre tertiary carbonates are mostly unconfined while the same carbonates continuously deepen below 2000 m siliciclastic cover in the hungarian paleogene basin hpb figs 2 3 topography driven basin scale groundwater flow systems can be detected down to about 500 m asl mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádlné szőnyi 2020 recharge areas of the different orders of flow systems local intermediate regional were determined based on the vertical flow components mádlné szőnyi 2020 basin hydraulic interpretation of the respective discharge areas was also completed with the hierarchic cluster analysis of groups of springs in terms of the related discharge phenomena mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádlné szőnyi 2020 tóth et al 2022 based on these results we could delineate the subsurface catchment area of the btk this area differs from the surface catchment which is a significant issue from the point of view of groundwater quality and management mádlné szőnyi 2020 below 500 m asl through flow conditions dominate which refers to the recharge controlled character of topography driven basin scale groundwater flow systems this could be explained by the usually higher hydraulic diffusivity of carbonates as compared to siliciclastic sediments which means faster spread of pore pressure changes and stronger hydraulic connections mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 as a result we found on one hand that flow systems are less hierarchic and lateral i e through flow conditions dominate on the other hand barrier faults and regional aquitards can impede fluid flow more effectively than in siliciclastic sediments below 1000 m asl lateral flows still prevail but underpressured conditions 1 2 mpa deficit can be observed in the confined pre tertiary carbonates in the basement of the hpb mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádl szőnyi et al 2015 development of this underpressured regime could be explained by the joint effect of more processes such as the recharge hampering effect of the confining layers and some barrier fault systems mádl szőnyi et al 2019 erosional decompaction of the confining layer mádl szőnyi et al 2015 and termohaline groundwater flows galsa et al 2022 in addition underpressures generate downward flow from the overlying siliciclastic cover into the confined carbonates including downward petroleum migration from the source rocks of the siliciclastic cover the combined interpretation of the hydraulic hydrogeochemical and temperature data allowed us to spatially differentiate two previously known groundwater components in the system namely meteoric karst waters coming from the unconfined carbonates of the btk and nacl type basinal fluids arriving from the confining siliciclastic layers of the hpb erőss et al 2012a erőss et al 2012b 2011 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 poros et al 2012 poros et al 2010 moreover we could also identify a third component of hydrothermal waters mádlné szőnyi 2020 mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 it was originally a meteoric karst water which evolved in the basin scale groundwater flow systems due to the long subsurface residence time and fluid rock interactions then also mixed with basinal fluids in the discharge area finally results of the basin scale data analysis and numerical modelling allowed the interpretation of the differences temperature hydrochemical isotopic in discharging waters of wells and springs in the btk the biogeochemical and mineral precipitates and the processes of porosity enlargement such as mixing corrosion hypogenic karstification erőss et al 2012a erőss et al 2012b 2011 kovács bodor et al 2019 2018 ötvös et al 2017 furthermore our numerical flow heat and mass transport simulations revealed that also the thermal and salinity driving forces have to be taken into account galsa et al 2022 szijártó et al 2021 2019 though their significance is decreasing in the btk due to its uplift and the consequent intensification of the topography driven flows havril et al 2016 case study bakony mountains balaton highland and somogy hills the bakony mountains maximum 709 m asl and balaton highland maximum 440 m asl divided by a narrow elongated basin fig 2 can be handled as a hydrogeologically complex unconfined carbonate aquifer system tóth and mádl szőnyi 2016 it is hydraulically continuous and topography driven basin scale groundwater flow systems exist induced by the recharge controlled differences in water table elevation tóth 2018 tóth et al 2020 as a methodological development in the hydraulic evaluation beside the few well data we also used springs data 57 of the hydraulic data since springs represent the end points of flow systems and thus the water table itself the elevations of spring orifices can be handled as hydraulic heads tóth et al 2022 furthermore combined cluster and discriminant analysis ccda and linear discriminant analysis lda of groups of springs were also carried out in terms of the related discharge phenomena mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 tóth et al 2022 as a result we revealed that hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems penetrate down to about 200 m asl then in greater depth lateral flow conditions dominate it was also proven that groundwaters of the bakony mountains and balaton highland also discharge into lake balaton the largest lake in central europe fig 2 on the southern side of the lake groundwater flow systems of the siliciclastic somogy hills maximum 316 m asl fig 2 also discharge around the lake tóth et al 2020 case study southern mecsek mountains villány hills and dráva basin mecsek mountains maximum 682 m asl represent a complex pre tertiary geological build up while villány hills maximum 442 m asl form an unconfined pre tertiary carbonate ridge pre tertiary formations continuously deepen below 2 3000 m siliciclastic cover in the studied hungarian part of the adjoining dráva basin fig 2 thus villány hills and its southern foreland towards the dráva basin represent the unconfined and adjoining confined carbonate system in the area respectively however interpretation of this local scale study area also requires the understanding of the regional scale systems in this regard we could identified topography driven groundwater flow systems also in this study area irrespectively of the geological build up down to about 1500 2000 m csondor et al 2020b in the pannonian basin s east southeastern sub basins in the great hungarian plain a regionally extensive overpressured regime is known below about this depth interval of the gravitational flow systems tóth and almási 2001 this overpressured regime was first identified in the dráva basin by our group below the topography driven flow systems with maximum 66 excess pressure csondor et al 2020b more pressure generating mechanisms could be assumed like in the great hungarian plain such as non equilibrium compaction and tectonic compression tóth and almási 2001 we also found that the regional aquitard units of the neogene siliciclastic sediments of the basin fill below about 2000 m asl could be put in charge for the maintenance of the overpressure since these units can effectively impede upward fluid flow and thus pressure dissipation csondor et al 2020b in the overpressured regime upward flows dominate while the lateral flow components tend toward the basin margins however in the local scale study area of the villány hills and its southern foreland i e southeastern part of the dráva basin hydraulic data were available only from shallower depth than 200 m asl in this way demonstration of the deep overpressured regime could be based on the related processes and phenomena which show significant similarities with the buda thermal karst area namely based on the hydraulic hydrochemical and speleogenetic phenomena we could also identify beside a karst water component coming from the unconfined carbonates of the villány hills the effects of a basinal fluid component coming from the overpressured regime in the southwestern foreland of the villány hills csondor et al 2020b 4 2 asymmetric basin and flow pattern since the beginnings of basin scale groundwater flow system studies tóth 1963 1962 etc the base of investigation is the 2d half basin extending from the water divide to the central valley which are the axes of symmetry in a symmetrical basin fig 1 tóth 2009 with a few exceptions zhang et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 based on the studies carried out in the buda thermal karst btk we revealed new aspects of the concept therefore we studied the effects of basin asymmetry and the generated interbasin flow between the two halves mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 tóth et al 2020 then we also extended the understanding of this issue in general by analyzing the effects of anisotropy asymmetry of the topographical driving force for groundwater flow and basin heterogeneity in numerical simulations tóth et al 2020 as a result we demonstrated that basin asymmetry has a critical role in flow discharge and accumulation of heat mass patterns thus analysis of half basins is not sufficient but can lead to misinterpretations case studies buda thermal karst and hungarian paleogene basin bakony balaton highland and somogy hills asymmetry of groundwater flow pathways in the btk has already been assumed by several early authors based on the observed hydrochemical and temperature phenomena e g alföldi 1981 schafarzik 1928 our group confirmed first this hypothesis by basin hydraulic data interpretation see chapter 4 1 erhardt et al 2017 mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádlné szőnyi 2020 and basin scale numerical modelling havril et al 2016 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 szijártó et al 2021 accordingly the central valley or main discharge area is the river danube which also represents the boundary of the unconfined and confined carbonate regions regional groundwater flow systems coming from the btk flow through below the danube below 0 m asl toward the hungarian paleogene basin hpb then turn back and discharge in the danube valley fig 3 however below 1000 m asl all regional groundwater flow coming from the btk flow toward the hpb due to its underpressured regime which behaves as a sink the evolved asymmetric flow pattern could be explained by the differences in driving forces and recharge on the two sides of river danube i e in the unconfined and confined basin halves the btk and hpb namely water table elevation and thus potential energy is higher in the unconfined or partially confined btk while thermal driving force mixed thermal convection is more intensive in the hpb where carbonates have a thick siliciclastic cover which slows down meteoric water recharge the asymmetric flow pattern contributes to the evolution of the hydrothermal flow component convergence of meteoric and basinal fluids and the related hydrochemical and temperature phenomena along the danube particularly that of the springs and caves of budapest mádlné szőnyi 2020 mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 we could reveal a similar situation in the bakony balaton highland and adjoining somogy hills area tóth et al 2020 deeper regional groundwater flow systems coming from the higher and unconfined bakony balaton highland area flow through below lake balaton toward the lower and siliciclastic somogy hills area then turn back due to the meeting with gravitational flows coming from the somogy hills and finally discharge around the lake 4 3 hypogene speleogenesis in the context of basin scale groundwater flow the basin scale groundwater flow concept and the understanding of its geological consequences i e related processes and phenomena opened a new path for scientific evolution in karst studies namely karst phenomena including caves springs and the karst system itself can be interpreted as manifestations of flowing groundwater the connection between topography driven groundwater flow systems and potential dissolution processes in carbonates was firstly supposed by klimchouk 2007 he distinguished epigene karstification which is connected to local flow systems and hypogene cave formation which is related to intermediate or regional flow systems klimchouk 2007 klimchouk et al 2017 we significantly completed this definition by the evidences of our studies in the btk hpg system see chapter 4 1 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 szijártó et al 2019 tóth et al 2020 namely a confined basin half is also necessary to provide hydrothermal or basinal fluids to produce hypogene caves fig 3 in the btk geometry of the two connected basin halves of unconfined and confined carbonates and the consequent asymmetric flow pattern and heat distribution determine the occurrence of various springs and caves hypogene karstification is triggered and controlled by the hydrothermal and basinal fluid upwelling mixing corrosion microbially mediated dissolution etc anda et al 2017 2014 borsodi et al 2012 erhardt et al 2017 erőss et al 2012a 2011 erőss et al 2008 though basinal fluid contribution is decreasing poros et al 2012 with uplift of the btk and consequent intensification of the topography driven groundwater flow systems havril et al 2016 active hypogene caves can be found at recent discharge areas for comparison in the southern foreland of villány hills only inactive hypogene caves are known which refer to less intense basinal fluid contribution than in earlier times of basin evolution csondor et al 2020b erőss et al 2020 or recently in the btk 5 adaptation of the basic concept for further geofluids 5 1 understanding basin scale heat transport processes significance of basin scale heat transport processes was already mentioned in chapter 4 during our studies we produced also general results regarding the evaluation of the interaction of different fluid flow driving forces and their effects on groundwater flow systems and temperature distribution at basin scale in hyperthermal basins such as the pannonian basin heat transport processes have a significant effect on groundwater flow systems beside the driving force of water table elevational differences i e topography heat conduction is generally significant in geological formations of reduced porosity and permeability i e in aquitards where there is no intense groundwater flow e g clauser 2009 deming 2002 przybycin et al 2017 in most studies the effect of forced thermal convection i e advection and heat conduction is noted regarding groundwater flow where temperature field evolve following the flow pattern e g an et al 2015 clauser and villinger 1990 domenico and palciauskas 1973 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 pure free thermal convection i e buoyancy force has been revealed to generate groundwater flow both in sedimentary basins e g lenkey 1993 lopez et al 2016 and in deep confined carbonate reservoirs e g licour 2014 lipsey et al 2016 pasquale et al 2013 however a comprehensive basin scale investigation of the combined effects of topography driven forced and buoyancy driven free thermal convection mixed thermal convection has long remained an open question to examine this issue first we carried out two dimensional numerical simulations in theoretical groundwater flow basins szijártó et al 2019 in most synthetic models the appearance of thermal buoyancy was noticed which caused a complex and time dependent flow pattern with hot upwellings and cold downwellings namely we could recognize that higher geothermal gradients and greater model depths facilitate the evolution of time dependent free thermal convection which mainly affects the deeper part of midline and discharge zones however increasing water table slope and anisotropy coefficient favor the formation of stationary forced thermal convection in addition we realized the position of the maximum hydraulic head shifts from the highest point of the water table downward in the recharge zone in all cases of realistic geothermal gradients finally besides the thermal rayleigh number we introduced a non dimensional modified péclet number for the classification of the flow systems into forced and free thermal convection dominated types szijártó et al 2019 we also studied the effects of basin asymmetry and intrabasin flow see chapter 4 2 on the temperature distribution tóth et al 2020 as a result we revealed the effects of asymmetric water table distribution anisotropy heterogeneity and basal heat flow on basin scale heat accumulation e g location of basin parts bearing the highest geothermal potential locations of thermal spring discharge and prevailing mechanisms of heat transfer during preliminary geothermal exploration these generalized and simplified groundwater flow and heat transport models can support the identification of prospective areas and planning of shallow and deep geothermal energy utilization also with respect to reinjection possibilities in addition these can provide starting points for realistic 3d models finally based on these results we also defined for the first time the scope of geothermal hydrogeology which is to examine and explain the basin scale flow pattern and temperature distribution in addition to the occurrence of possible thermal springs tóth et al 2020 as a result hydrogeologically favorable regions for sustainable long term geothermal energy exploitation could be delineated case study buda thermal karst and hungarian paleogene basin our numerical analysis of the buda thermal karst btk hungarian paleogene basin hpb system revealed that in each simulation scenario independently of the model parameters time dependent mixed thermal convection evolved both in the deep and the confined part of the system fig 4 b szijártó et al 2021 the difference is significant compared to the sole effect of topography driven steady state groundwater flow and forced thermal convection fig 4 a the revealed time dependent behavior of the temperature field can also be confirmed by observation data dövényi 1994 hydrogeological interpretations mádl szőnyi et al 2019a mádlné szőnyi et al 2018 former numerical simulations havril et al 2016 and speleological observations virág 2019 5 2 basin hydraulics in geothermal exploration basin scale groundwater flow system concept and basin scale evaluation of measured hydraulic data i e basin hydraulics can also be used in geothermal potential evaluation in case of water based solutions in the framework of geothermal hydrogeology we worked out a methodology to propose the involvement of hydrodynamic analysis in preliminary geothermal exploration mádl szőnyi and simon 2016 mádlné szőnyi 2019 beside the investigation of the other elements of the geothermal system heat reservoir dickson and fanelli 2015 the approach focuses on the aspects of pore pressure regimes to increase energy efficiency and sustainability of water production and injection accordingly topography driven groundwater flow systems representing the upper flow regime in most sedimentary basins worldwide can be handled as regionally unconfined aquifer systems these systems are hydraulically open unconfined and we can suppose their supply from recharge if it is available consequently they are a priori renewable groundwater resources which can be produced by a rate being in balance with the meteoric water supply of the recharge areas from injection point of view in regional recharge areas characterized by downward flow injection wells can be operated without energy investment while in midline and discharge areas characterized by through and upward flow respectively low pressure injection is needed overpressured regimes have no recharge or water supply because surface water is not able to enter due to the high excess pressure compared to hydrostatic thus these hold non renewable resources it means that their water production is the function of specific storage and sustainable production requires high pressure reinjection underpressured reservoirs have restricted water supply recharge and are basically unproductive because of the underpressure but these conditions are favorable for free reinjection identification and characterization of the different pressure regimes is possible by basin hydraulic evaluation as we demonstrated it in all our study areas while its basin scale application for preliminary geothermal exploration purposes was demonstrated in the duna tisza interfluve mádl szőnyi and simon 2016 and the btk hpb system mádlné szőnyi 2019 fig 2 beside the geothermal utilization results can also be used in water management regarding groundwater production and water reinjection see chapter 8 2 in addition we also proposed a structured concept workflow to investigate injection related issues including pressure regimes markó et al 2021b particularly in case of low pressure reinjection into siliciclastic reservoirs which is usually challenging ungemach 2003 namely the potential problem sources of reinjection acting on different scales were examined such as groundwater flow conditions basin hydraulics reservoir properties and local clogging processes particle migration mineral precipitation microbial activity markó et al 2021b we applied the methodology in the local scale investigation of an existing geothermal site mezőberény se hungary fig 2 suffering from low injectivity markó et al 2021b markó et al 2021a as a result insufficient reservoir properties i e low transmissivity and significant clogging by microbial pollution were identified while hydraulic conditions were proved to be not unfavorable we also follow this workflow during the estimation of the reinjection potential on a further study area zala basin sw hungary fig 2 where hydraulic analysis revealed beneficial conditions in the studied aquifer for reinjection markó et al n d 5 3 considering advection in shallow geothermal utilization beside deep geothermal exploration we also deal with the preliminary estimation of shallow geothermal potential it is required to predict the extractable thermal energy and the best locations for system installation e g for borehole heat exchangers and to prepare the proper system design in our joint research with the geological survey of finland we introduced a novel method termed infinite borehole field model to estimate and map the technical shallow geothermal potential markó et al 2022 the model uses the finite element method to create ground models and to find the maximum annually extractable geothermal energy by solving an optimization problem namely the temperature of the borehole wall is not allowed to drop below a certain minimum temperature during the operation markó et al 2022 the main novelty of the method is its ability of considering the interaction of neighboring boreholes by simulating a simplified borehole field this can significantly influence the thermal yield of borehole heat exchangers in urban regions but being neglected by most of the previous methods e g casasso and sethi 2016 garcía gil et al 2015 ondreka et al 2007 another advantage of the method is the simulation of the effect of advective heat transport due to groundwater flow which is usually also neglected in potential estimations our specific analysis showed a positive effect in the presence of significant flow velocities this means that groundwater flow can transport heat to the boreholes however with closely spaced boreholes increasing flow velocities decrease the thermal yield i e the cold plume generated by the heat extraction reaches the neighboring boreholes as a case study we applied the method in budapest hungary fig 2 markó et al 2022 these results support the intent of involving groundwater flow and system approach into shallow geothermal analyses as well 5 4 petroleum hydrogeology 5 4 1 thermogenic hydrocarbons certain types of petroleum accumulations can also be handled as the manifestations of flowing groundwater tóth 1999 therefore understanding of migration and accumulation processes requires the knowledge of groundwater flow conditions these have crucial role in hydrodynamic hubbert 1956 and hydraulic tóth 1980 hydrocarbon entrapment hence petroleum hydrogeology uses hydrogeological methods for petroleum exploration case studies hungarian paleogene basin dráva basin southeastern great hungarian plain we applied the groundwater flow concept and our methodology in the already mentioned hungarian paleogene basin hpb and dráva basin see chapter 4 1 as well as in sub basins of the southeastern great hungarian plain derecske trough békés basin battonya high berekfürdő high fig 2 topography driven regional groundwater flow systems are underlaid by an overpressured regime in these basins except the underpressured regime in the hpg see chapter 4 1 where gravitational downward flows in the recharge zones meet with overpressured upward flows i e in the converging zone we identified hydraulic entrapment zones which represent the upper boundary of vertical petroleum migration and hydraulically favorable conditions potential for entrapment csondor et al 2020b czauner and mádl szőnyi 2013 furthermore we determined the hydraulic function of fault systems in the upward dissipation of overpressure and since this can be materialized by fluid flow in petroleum migration as well czauner et al 2008 czauner and mádl szőnyi 2013 2011 in the hpb underpressure driven downward flows from the source rocks toward the pre tertiary karstified carbonate reservoirs determine the distribution of accumulations mádl szőnyi et al 2019a in addition our studies in the buda thermal karst see chapter 4 1 contributed to the understanding of the porosity evolution in carbonate reservoirs erőss et al 2011 poros et al 2012 poros et al 2010 5 4 2 biogenic gas these studies were focused on thermogenic hydrocarbons but the basin scale groundwater flow concept and our methodology are even more effective in the exploration of biogenic gases approximately 20 of the discovered natural gas reserves around the world are of biogenic origin mostly methane and their importance as a primary energy source is rapidly increasing biogenic methane could be generated also from sediments with low total organic carbon content 0 4 and in lower temperature 0 75 c thus in shallower depth usually above 2000 m compared to thermogenic gases however the generated methane is thought to be able to migrate for larger distances and thus form larger accumulations only in aqueous solution with flowing groundwater e g bartha et al 2018 cramer et al 1999 based on this assumption we built a novel simplistic 2d model in ms excel including a methane solubility database to determine the amount of dissolved and transported methane in flowing groundwater and the amount of the released free gas in the discharge area which could be trapped and accumulated adonya et al 2022 some significant input parameters of the model and the 3d upscaling of the estimations require the evaluation of groundwater flow systems in the studied area e g linear flow velocities recharge midline and discharge areas we applied the model in eastern hungary fig 2 based on our previous hydrogeological evaluation ben mahrez et al 2020 szabó et al 2019 as a result we revealed that the biogenic part 65 of the largest natural gas accumulation of hungary hajdúszoboszló 1 3 tcf original gas in place prior to production which can be found in a topography driven regional discharge area could be fully charged by biogenic methane generated in the respective recharge and midline areas and transported by groundwater flows in the last 1 million year adonya et al 2022 6 adaptation of groundwater flow concept for the radioactivity of groundwater during fluid rock interactions the natural geological and geochemical environment in addition to providing beneficial mineral content and bioessential elements to groundwater may also give rise to undesirable or toxic properties through an excess of various elements edmunds and smedley 1996 groundwater may also contain different natural alpha 238u 234u 232th 226ra and 210po and beta emitters 40k 228ra and 210pb from non detectable levels to concentrations of concern for human health increasing use of groundwater resources for drinking purposes calls for careful evaluation of this aspect chau et al 2011 jobbágy et al 2022 lapworth et al 2022 vengosh et al 2022 who 2017 however identification and assessment of risks to health from drinking water relies often excessively on analysis of water samples e g chmielewska et al 2020 piñero garcía et al 2021 who 2007 thus the origin of the eventually measured elevated activity is not explained which is a considerable shortage in finding the appropriate risk management method the radionuclide content of groundwater is usually explained mainly by geological hydrochemical and anthropogenic factors birke et al 2010 bonotto 2017 liesch et al 2015 riedel and kübeck 2018 vengosh et al 2022 vinson et al 2009 in general however there is no apparent relationship between the type of rock constituting the water bearing formation and the observed activity concentration levels of the radionuclides chau et al 2011 since wide ranges of activity concentrations of the radioisotopes are observed within the same aquifer from fraction of mbql 1 to several hundred mbql 1 erőss et al 2018 the basin scale groundwater flow concept however helps to understand the origin and distribution of the different physicochemical characteristics and components of groundwater areas of different hydraulic regimes recharge midline discharge even within the same aquifer are characterized by different geochemical environment from oxidizing to reducing respectively therefore in case of redox sensitive parameters such as uranium or radium which are the most common radionuclides in groundwater understanding groundwater flow systems is imperative osmond and cowart 2000 on the other hand the occurrence of certain radionuclides in groundwater can be used as environmental tracers and can help to identify groundwater flow dynamics regime type flow rate hierarchically nested flow systems etc gainon et al 2007 ji et al 2022 porcelli and swarzenski 2003 swarzenski 2007 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 to this end the basin scale groundwater flow concept and our methodology were introduced in the research of natural radioactivity of groundwater by our group in the bükk mountains erőss et al 2015 in the buda thermal karst area erőss et al 2015 erőss et al 2012b kovács bodor et al 2019 in lake velence and its catchment area fig 2 baják et al 2022a 2022b erőss et al 2018 and in a riverbank filtered system along river danube csondor et al 2021 2020a as a result we could explain the origin and occurrence of high activity values in groundwater used for drinking water supply in the studied sites namely elevated uranium activity concentrations were found in areas characterized by recharge regimes with oxidizing conditions whereas elevated radium activity was found in higher order flow systems intermediate regional characterized by reducing conditions baják et al 2022a erőss et al 2018 erőss et al 2012b fig 1 high radon content was found in those places where iron hydroxide biogeochemical precipitates occurred as a specific manifestation of flowing groundwater which efficiently adsorb radium and act as local radon source causing high radon content in the waters csondor et al 2017 dobosy et al 2016 erőss 2010 erőss et al 2012b kovács bodor et al 2019 mádlné szőnyi 2020 on the other hand due to its short half life radon is a useful time tracer for hydrogeological systems with relatively short flow paths and or high flow velocities e g for local flow systems fig 1 and karst aquifers criss et al 2007 eisenlohr and surbeck 1995 where its source is the weathered soil zone in addition our research also demonstrated related to transient water resources such as riverbank filtered water supply systems that the measured activity values can strongly depend on the timing of monitoring i e on the river stage which determines the ratio of river water and groundwater in the well and thus the quality of produced water thus using basin scale groundwater flow system approach in the evaluation of natural radioactivity and in the assessment of drinking water quality parameters such as radionuclides are indispensable to take proper actions and to choose the right approach to minimise health risk as climate change and growing water demand will increase the role of groundwater future water resources can be evaluated regarding their quality by this approach case study lake velence and its catchment area lake velence fig 2 is a shallow soda lake situated in a tectonic depression in the southern foreland of the granitic outcrop of velence hills the lake has recently suffered from a significant lake level drop and related water quality problems severely affecting the ecosystem of the lake in the annual report on water budget of the lake groundwater inflow outflow has been left out of consideration by the authority central transdanubian water management directorate 2020 to prove that lake velence has an interconnection with groundwater and to integrate the lake into groundwater flow systems we applied the groundwater flow concept and our hydraulic methodology baják et al 2022b in addition to validate the results of the hydraulic evaluation we took groundwater samples from the miocene quaternary siliciclastic aquifer system in the vicinity of the lake the samples were analyzed for stable isotope composition δ2h and δ18o and radioactive isotope concentration σu 226ra and 222rn as a result in shallow depth 0 250 m asl local flow systems were identified flowing from elevated areas toward adjacent lowlands e g from velence hills and local highs in south of lake velence toward the lake δ18o and δ2h composition and variability of the δ values measured in shallow groundwater samples indicate direct recharge from precipitation of the present climate oxidizing conditions and short residence time is indicated by high uranium and radon activity measured both in shallow groundwater and springs baják et al 2022a 2022b the lake has also high uranium activity 392 mbql 1 most likely originating from groundwater inflow into the lake other studies also proved that radionuclide content measured in lake waters originates from groundwater liao et al 2020a 2020b below 0 m asl an intermediate or regional flow system flowing from the water divide in south of the lake toward the eastern river danube and western regional erosional bases could be identified groundwater samples taken from deep wells or from wells located close to the presumed regional discharge areas are characterized by a more depleted δ composition and high 226ra activity concentrations up to 999 mbql 1 along with negative orp oxidation reduction potential values which properties suggest older groundwater i e longer travel time in conclusion the results of our research indicated that lake velence is the discharge area of local groundwater flow systems known to be more sensitive to climate changes and anthropogenic activities e g contamination overexploitation based on our findings the groundwater component should also be taken into consideration in the lakes water budget and its management 7 significance of groundwater flow in groundwater surface water interaction and in groundwater dependent ecosystems surface waters have been investigated as connected systems to groundwater since the 1960 s e g hancock et al 2005 meyboom 1967 sophocleous 2002 winter et al 1998 zurek et al 2015 groundwater not only supplies water but transports heat nutrients and dissolved salts to surface waters and vice versa determining the chemical composition nutrient budget trophic status and presence of different species hayashi and rosenberry 2002 yihdego et al 2017 thus during the investigation of groundwater and surface water interactions and the related ecosystems understanding of the connected groundwater flow systems and their surface manifestations are crucial regarding both water quantity and quality basin scale groundwater flow concept and our methodology could effectively reveal these connections in our studies in lake velence and its catchment area baják et al 2022a 2022b see chapter 6 in the tihany peninsula tóth et al 2016 see chapter 8 1 and in the duna tisza interfluve where scale dependent complexity of groundwater flow systems and its significance were highlighted in particular case study duna tisza interfluve the scale dependence of groundwater flow systems and their effects on the surface are highly considered in our studies these issues are crucial particularly in the investigation of groundwater dependent ecosystems gde of the duna tisza interfluve dti this area is located in the western part of the great hungarian plain between river danube duna and tisza fig 2 we investigated here the connection of groundwater flow with the different wetland types vegetation and salinization phenomena by applying the basin scale groundwater flow concept and our methodology mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 as a result of the regional scale analyses we revealed that topography driven groundwater flow systems are characterized by meteoric water and are underlaid by the overpressured regime of basinal fluids also known from other parts of the great hungarian plain see chapter 5 4 and the dráva basin see chapter 4 1 the elevated north south directed ridge region in the central part of the dti represents the recharge area of topography driven regional groundwater flow systems which tend toward the river valleys and force also the basinal fluid upwellings into these directions as a result meteoric waters of the topography driven groundwater flow systems discharge mixing with the saline basinal fluids in the river valleys consequently in the gravitational flow system s discharge areas we can find fresh water type meadows and wetlands while in the regional discharge area of the mixed waters saline wetlands vegetation and soils can be found fig 5 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 simon et al 2015 the hydraulic and hydrochemical investigation also gave the base for a salinization model in the area we found that saline water upwelling from the overpressured regime contributes to the surface salinization providing the salt for the processes however the amount of the rising saline water is negligible compared to the water moving in the topography driven system simon et al 2011 we studied in detail some wetlands in the western half of the area representing the scale dependent complexity of groundwater and surface water interactions in the ridge region freshwater type wetlands can be found e g ágasegyháza lake on fig 5 which are influenced only by the topography driven systems these are recharge type lakes losing water to the groundwater system on the western flank of the ridge the kolon lake fig 5 is also connected only to the topography driven system in a through flow situation namely it is gaining water from east and losing towards west around the saline kelemen szék lake in the danube valley topography driven meteoric and basinal saline water discharge together fig 5 as a third scale we also investigated local scale groundwater surface water connections seeming to be more complex around this lake in the upper 20 m the lake is in a through flow situation caused by an artificial canal in the east of the lake simon 2010 thus the lake is in a regional discharge situation which is superimposed by a local through flow condition the through flow provides water supply and the deep upwelling determines the saline character on local scale simon et al 2011 8 effects of climate change on groundwater flow systems and mitigation possibilities 8 1 impact of climate change on groundwater flow systems most of the above described processes and phenomena are expected to be highly affected by global climate change for instance future alteration of recharge would have significant consequences on groundwater levels and flow dynamics chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 consequently scientific interest in understanding the effects of changing climatic conditions on groundwater replenishment has grown rapidly over the last decade aguilera and murillo 2009 kundzewicz et al 2008 however studies which focus on the impacts of climate change on the fragmentation and hierarchy of groundwater flow systems e g havril et al 2018 trásy havril et al 2022 and its implications on groundwater and surface water interaction persaud et al 2020 are still under represented in the literature therefore our group intended to evaluate the influence of climate change altered recharge on groundwater levels and coupled effects on the connected groundwater flow systems using transient numerical flow simulations special emphasis is placed on how flow system hierarchy may change to examine possible consequences on groundwater related shallow surface water bodies and on groundwater surface water interaction case study tihany peninsula we started the climate related evaluation through an example of the tihany peninsula bakony balaton highland region hungary fig 2 havril et al 2018 our hydrogeological and shallow geophysical studies revealed that the three minor wetlands of this peninsula are groundwater dependent ecosystems gde while their groundwater levels determine the flow directions between them tóth et al 2016 based on regional climate change modelling predictions for hungary bartholy et al 2014 pieczka et al 2011 20 decrease in precipitation and 4 c increase in temperature was taken into account in the numerical simulation by the end of the century it is expected to cause 67 decrease in recharge within this time frame based on our previous findings regarding the vertical extent of active groundwater flow at the study site tóth et al 2016 the numerical flow system analysis focused on the processes acting in the upper approximately 100 m where the most significant changes in the flow field are expected due to climate change as a result by the end of the simulated period elevational i e hydraulic head differences along the water table had decreased due to climatic recharge reduction and horizontal flow became dominant fig 6 this resulted in the dissipation of transient local groundwater flow systems while the characteristics of flow system hierarchy changed from nested flow systems to a set of single flow cells these changes could have significant effects on gdes since a decrease in groundwater level could change the character of groundwater discharge into a surface water body as occurred in case of the outer lake fig 6 havril et al 2018 8 2 managed aquifer recharge and groundwater flow systems for the mitigation of the effect of climate change and overexploitation the number of managed aquifer recharge mar systems is increasing worldwide and the range of applications is getting wider stefan and ansems 2018 however groundwater flow systems are generally not considered in mar site selection and research our group aims to integrate basin scale groundwater flow concept into this topic as well we investigated the effect of water table inclination and topography on mar efficiency by saturated unsaturated transient numerical model simulations szabó et al 2021b the results strengthened that high horizontal hydraulic gradient is often not favored for mar implementation as it causes higher water loss and mixing of recharge water with native groundwater gale et al 2002 however in the rehabilitation of groundwater dependent ecosystems gde these processes can be advantageous we revealed that if water is infiltrated at the local recharge area groundwater level also increases at the connected local discharge area the research results proved that for water replenishment of gdes the volume of recharging water is less important than the hydraulic gradient between the recharge structure and the discharge area which is also advantageous szabó et al 2021b case study duna tisza interfluve these results can be well applied for the duna tisza interfluve dti fig 2 where we have already revealed the connections between groundwater flow systems and gdes see chapter 7 this area and especially the semi arid ridge region have been suffering from severe water level decline and water shortage for several decades mostly due to climate change 50 and groundwater overproduction 30 nagy et al 2016 it causes environmental problems for instance many lakes and wetlands degraded or completely disappeared over the years most of the dti s replenishment plans focus on distant recharge water possibilities e g from river danube and water transport by surface canals however water quality is also a crucial aspect in the sensitive balance of gdes see chapter 7 thus managed increase of natural recharge using the only available local water sources of runoff and rainwater would be more favorable based on our simulation results application of mar techniques in the local recharge areas could also raise the water table in the respective discharge areas szabó et al 2021b furthermore due to the physical chemical and biological processes along the subsurface flow pathways quality of the discharging water could be close to that of the native groundwater of the given area we also carried out mar site suitability mapping in baluchistan pakistan hayat et al 2021 and in the central part of the dti mádl szőnyi et al 2019b szabó et al 2020 here we also set up a field experiment in a favorable location to examine the effects of rooftop rainwater harvesting through a shallow well rrwh sw szabó et al 2022 2021a water level specific electric conductivity temperature and chemical composition were monitored in the infiltration well and two monitoring wells located down gradient from the experiment the first results after 20 months of infiltration showed that the method is favorable both in terms of groundwater quality and quantity based on our further gis analysis the potential of rrwh on settlement level is significant consequently rrwh sw could be a local scale nature based solution to complement natural recharge szabó et al 2022 2021a and to rehabilitate a nearby dried up gde szabó et al 2021b 9 summary and conclusion the hydrogeology research group named józsef and erzsébet tóth endowed hydrogeology chair of the department of geology institute of geography and earth sciences eötvös loránd university elte budapest hungary is a majority 70 women team led by professor judit mádl szőnyi the members are hydrogeologists and geophysicists mostly her former and current mentees and her mentees students the group had originally focused on the basin scale system approach of groundwater flows then gradually extended its research activity to other geofluids in answer to emerging global challenges however the basin scale groundwater flow concept remained the base of all our studies as these flow systems interact with the rock framework and all other geofluids resulting in systematic distribution of the related environmental and geological processes and phenomena our studies demonstrated that understanding of groundwater flow systems and their scale dependent complexity from basin to local scales is essential during the investigation of subsurface and several surface processes and phenomena without this knowledge water ecosystem and resource management cannot be handled effectively or in a sustainable way in this review paper we briefly summarized the basic concept of basin scale groundwater flow our methodological developments and the wide range of successful applications in hydrogeological and other geofluid research basin scale or modern hydrogeology is based on the recognition of nonexistence of impermeable rocks i e aquicludes as a result regional hydraulic continuity is a phenomenological property of the rock framework depending on time and space scale of monitoring therefore basin scale groundwater flow systems can evolve driven by different diving forces the most significant one in terrestrial areas is provided by the elevational differences of the water table i e topography or gravity driven flow groundwater flow systems result in the systematic distribution of the related environmental and geological processes and phenomena depending on the type of flow systems local intermediate regional and regimes recharge through flow discharge groundwater interacting with all other fluids thus understanding of the groundwater flow pattern at basin scale can provide the common base for harmonized geofluid research and utilization dsa gr we developed a workflow for basin scale groundwater flow evaluation based on hydraulic methodology and complemented by retrospective analysis evaluation of the manifestations of flowing groundwater numerical flow and transport simulations in our studies we applied this workflow focusing on the understanding of basin scale groundwater flow the groundwater flow related phenomena were interpreted for geofluid related resources as well e g groundwater geothermal energy hydrothermal minerals we furtherly developed the basic concept and adapted it to thick confined and unconfined outcropping carbonates and particularly to their marginal areas as a subsidiary consequence of the examination of these areas which represent full basins with the elevated unconfined carbonates in one half of the basin and the confined carbonates below a siliciclastic cover in the other half of the basin we also revealed the importance of asymmetric basin and flow pattern over against the generally used symmetric basin or half basin approach we also extended this issue later in general based on numerical simulations as an application in the related field of karst hydrogeology we significantly developed the concept of hypogene speleogenesis furthermore we adapted the basic concept for the understanding of basin scale heat transport processes revealing the significance of mixed thermal convection we defined different pressure regimes based on hydraulic evaluation which method allows of the delineation of hydrogeologically favorable regions for sustainable utilization of deep and shallow geothermal resources in preliminary geothermal exploration accordingly we also defined the scope of geothermal hydrogeology which is to examine and explain the basin scale flow pattern and temperature distribution similar application of the basic concept in petroleum exploration has already founded the field of petroleum hydrogeology for decades we also achieved results and developments in this field regarding both thermogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons and intend to use and integrate our experiences and methods into geothermal hydrogeology in answer to the demands of energy transition in addition our investigation of natural radioactivity in groundwater and drinking water revealed the connections between the geological background geochemical processes and flow dynamics besides our results also strengthen the applicability of radionuclides mainly uranium radium and radon as natural tracers of groundwater as another issue of groundwater quality and also quantity one of our first research fields is the study of groundwater and surface water interactions with a particular interest in groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes our results demonstrated the significance of scale dependent complexity of groundwater flow systems and their effects on surface processes and phenomena understanding of these relationships is indispensable in the protection and restoration of gdes these issues are of increasing importance due to the effects of global climate change consequently we also study the effects of climate change on groundwater flow systems and our results predict severe changes in the flow pattern hierarchy and the connected gdes within a few decades in case of water shortage and groundwater level decline managed aquifer recharge mar methods are the most promising water replenishment techniques our studies which integrate the basin scale groundwater flow concept into mar research proved that managed increase of natural recharge can cause improvement in groundwater quantity and quality furthermore even in larger distances if the transport systems of groundwater flows are properly utilized the presented case studies from the pannonian basin as a natural laboratory demonstrate the methodology of basin scale groundwater flow evaluation interpretation and application for practical purposes our studies usually provide general models and solutions which can be utilized in any sedimentary basins all over the world in conclusion all these studies are based on the basin scale groundwater flow system concept and related methodology and were mostly supervised by professor mádl szőnyi while her mentees specialized in different fields of hydrogeology and other disciplines as well but finally each research proved to be one part of the geofluid research puzzle which allow of the systematic exploration and harmonized and sustainable exploitation of geofluid related resources the complex utilization of the underground space and its resources is a key issue for the 21th century current members of the hydrogeology research group of eötvös loránd university józsef and erzsébet tóth

8551,as glaciers across the world continue to recede there is a concern that their loss as a fresh water reservoir within mountainous basins will have a negative impact on stream temperatures and downstream water resources currently there are relatively few glacio hydrological models ghms appropriate to study such phenomena and studies that have used ghms generally acknowledge the high uncertainty associated with their simulations calibration techniques present a particular issue in ghms as available glacier observations are limited and errors in the glacierized portion of a basin can be compensated by errors in the non glacierized portion using as a study site the cheakamus basin in british columbia canada we 1 present a new fully coupled ghm 2 analyze the effects different calibration techniques have on the model s summer streamflow projections and 3 compare the fully coupled ghm results to projections using a one way ghm the calibration techniques studied vary in terms of glacier representation dynamic static and glacier constraint mass balance thinning rates thinning rates and area change we find projected future climate forcings are sufficiently strong in the cheakamus basin so as to generally make the sign and significance of changes to the basin s hydrology insensitive to the calibration and projection procedures studied however the variation among these procedures produces significant changes in the projected magnitude of future hydrological changes and therefore should be carefully considered in studies where precision beyond the sign and significance of change is required based on analysis of the variation within each procedure s set of model outputs we conclude 1 the two way ghm has benefits over the one way model 2 calibration using dynamic glaciers and a thinning rate constraint is preferable for the new ghm and 3 there is a need for additional studies on the uncertainties associated with the calibration of glacio hydrological models keywords glacier dynamics glacio hydrological model calibration uncertainty hydrological projections data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction alpine glaciers worldwide are generally thought to be in a state of recession gardner et al 2013 kaser et al 2006 that is expected to continue through the end of the century radić and hock 2011 from a water resources and environmental perspective the global impact of this continued glacial loss may be substantial barnett et al 2005 huss and hock 2018 over one sixth of the world s population depends on glacier and snowmelt for their water supply barnett et al 2005 and in even modestly glacierized basins 2 5 glacial coverage glacier melt has been shown to play a significant role in seasonal streamflow stahl and moore 2006 glacial melt usually coincides with the warm dry weather that is typically associated with low flow periods in the non glacierized portions of the basin meier 1969 and warm stream temperatures brown et al 2005 moore 2006 hence in partially glacierized basins glaciers can compensate for otherwise low flow conditions and act to attenuate stream temperatures and variability in the streamflow signal fountain and tangborn 1985 as a basin s glacial area decreases its ability to attenuate stream properties may ultimately diminish while initially glacier loss is associated with an increase in melt and subsequent streamflow this benefit is not sustained as the supply of glacier ice is eventually exhausted huss et al 2008 stahl and moore 2006 in those regions dependent on melt from diminishing glaciers estimating the current and future stages of the basin s streamflow relative to this changing glacier signal is an important task frans et al 2015 despite the importance of understanding a region s streamflow response to glacier loss projecting the future hydrology of partially glacierized watersheds remains a difficult challenge amongst other facets long term simulations must model how the glacier volume and area evolve over time this requirement is juxtaposed with the common practice of hydrological models assuming a static glacier coverage and glacier dynamics models not being linked to other hydrological processes naz et al 2014 while recent studies have developed and deployed coupled glacio hydrological models ghms e g immerzeel et al 2012 ismail et al 2020 jost et al 2012 naz et al 2014 seibert et al 2018 there are still relatively few models available that use physically based representations to simulate both glacier dynamics and hydrological processes of the studies focused on ghms many have raised the issue of the high uncertainty associated with their simulations for hydrological models in general uncertainty in the future forcings blöschl and montanari 2010 the representation of hydrological processes orth et al 2015 and the calibration validation approach troin et al 2016 all contribute to uncertainty in simulation results in partially glacierized basins uncertainty in calibration is exacerbated by relatively limited observations of the processes controlling glacier dynamics van tiel et al 2020 and the possibility that errors in the glacier portion of the basin may compensate for errors in the non glacierized portion ismail et al 2020 for proper interpretation of projection results from ghms the relative magnitude of each source of uncertainty should be understood recently some progress has been made towards understanding and better constraining the uncertainty in ghms naz et al 2014 compared the metric performance over a 22 year historical period of streamflow from the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model when using 1 static glaciers 2 prescribed glaciers based on observations and 3 glaciers simulated using a dynamics model in that study the authors found that including a glacier dynamics representation improved prediction of streamflow as simulation length increased and that the hydrographs produced using prescribed and modelled glacier changes were similar over the historic period in ismail et al 2020 the future hydrology in the upper indus basin was projected using two ghms each parameterized using 1 a simple calibration validation approach that only used streamflow observations at the basin s outlet and 2 an enhanced calibration validation approach that incorporated sub catchment gauge data different climate conditions and glacier mass balance the study found some differences in the projected streamflow between the two methods at the annual scale up to 10 as well as larger monthly differences up to 19 during colder months october march using analysis of variance ismail et al 2020 also found that by the end of the century uncertainty associated with parameterization using the enhanced method was very small relative to overall uncertainty and therefore concluded that an enhanced calibration approach may help constrain hydrological projections in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 the authors analyzed the variability in projected streamflow from a one way ghm with prescribed glaciers that stemmed from choice of 1 glacier evolution 2 parameterization amongst pareto optimal sets and 3 climate forcings the study found the uncertainty associated with choice of climate forcings to be largest and the uncertainty associated with choice of parameterization among pareto optimal solutions from the same calibration procedure to generally be larger than the uncertainty associated with choice of glacier evolution while these previous studies have provided useful insights regarding ghm uncertainty our collective understanding of the impacts of calibration validation approaches and glacier dynamics representations on ghm uncertainty is still relatively underdeveloped recently van tiel et al 2020 performed a thorough review of calibration procedures currently used for ghms and concluded there is need for a systematic analysis of best practices for ghm calibration to better understand model simulations in glacierized basins to this end we explore the impact that different calibration procedures have on the streamflow changes projected by a fully coupled ghm in the partially glacierized cheakamus river basin for simulations we use a new ghm that represents the full coupling of the ubc watershed model ubcwm to the regional glaciation model clarke et al 2015 the three procedures were selected based on available data and the methodology of previous studies i e ismail et al 2020 jost et al 2012 lutz et al 2016 meyer et al 2019 tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 all of the procedures use the same optimization algorithms and streamflow targets but vary in the glacier data used to constrain simulations and the treatment of glacier dynamics during the calibration period see fig 1 and section 2 4 to compare the fully coupled ghm model structure to our previous work s methodology we also analyze projections that use the one way coupled model from tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 wherein prescribed changes to glacier landcover based on clarke et al 2015 results are forced annually onto ubcwm simulations 2 methods 2 1 study site we simulate the hydrological processes of the cheakamus basin up to its gauging station approximately 6 km north of its confluence with the squamish river near the southwestern coast of british columbia fig 2 the cheakamus basin was selected for this study because of the availability of observational glacier and hydrological data projected glacier dynamics i e clarke et al 2015 simulations and historic and projected forcing data it was also selected because it is of operational interest the basin is regulated roughly 24 km upstream of its squamish river confluence by the daisy lake dam which is operated by bc hydro the simulated basin has a drainage area of 965 km 2 with elevation ranging between roughly 2300 m and 50 m hydrologically the basin is considered a hybrid regime snowmelt dominates the annual streamflow signal but is superimposed by short intense fall and winter rain on snow events that typically account for the highest daily flows the basin is mostly forested 60 with modest glacier coverage 5 that is thought to be in a state of recession bolch et al 2010 only a small portion 1 of the basin is considered urban 2 2 models in our study we generate projections of the hydrology of the cheakamus basin in two ways 1 with a fully coupled glacio hydrological model and 2 with a one way coupled glacio hydrological model the two approaches vary only in the method used to calculate the change in the glacier coverage in the fully coupled approach the basin s glacier coverage is updated at the end of each water year based on simulations using the regional glaciation model rgm which is driven by annual mass balance states of the hydrological model in the one way approach annual glacier coverage is dictated by the results of the simulations described in clarke et al 2015 see section 2 3 of this paper in both approaches we discretize the cheakamus basin into 200 m 200 m hydrological response units hrus this resolution was chosen to match that of the rgm simulations and clarke et al 2015 results allowing for straightforward interfacing of the hydrological and glacier components of the ghm we model the hydrology of an individual hru using the university of british columbia watershed model ubcwm routing within and between subbasins and calculations of streamflow contributions are handled by raven s internal algorithms below we provide a brief overview of the main components of our modeling framework 2 2 1 raven raven is a modular hydrological modeling framework described in craig et al 2020 in its original design raven was capable of applying landuse change only if the changes were known prior to the beginning of the simulation for our purposes we modified raven s source code to allow landuse change to be determined during a simulation based on output from an external program e g rgm this modification allows one to create within raven a ghm consisting of any combination of hydrological process representations available within the framework and a compatible external glacier dynamics model in our study for each simulated year changes to glacier coverage are made within raven on october 1st when snow accumulation and glacier melt are generally thought to be minimal in the one way coupling scheme these changes are dictated by the clarke et al 2015 results in the two way scheme ice thickness is updated annually by rgm based on surface mass balance and corresponding 200 m 200 m glacier coverage maps are built using a one meter threshold for glaciated cells raven then updates landcover for the hydrological model by comparing the current glacier coverage map with that of the previous year s when an hru loses its glacier coverage the landuse type is changed from glacier to barren and the glacier reservoir within the hru which conceptually is depleted becomes inaccessible for simplicity newly barren hrus are initialized with a soil moisture of zero as simulations show that the hydrology at a basin s outlet is insensitive to this initialization raven s tracer routing feature provides a method for tracking source contributions throughout a simulation in our study we use this feature to trace the contribution of glacier melt to streamflow at the basin s outlet raven tracks this contribution by treating it as a pollutant that is sourced from glacier melt and is mixed uniformly with other sources of water within all subsequent reservoirs it enters pollutants and water from an hru are routed to the corresponding subbasin s outlet using a discrete transfer function subbasin to subbasin routing is determined by iteratively using newton s root finding algorithm to solve the discrete form of the reach s storage expression v q out n 1 v q out n δ t 1 2 q in n q in n 1 1 2 q out n q out n 1 here q in n and q out n are the upstream inflow and the outflow from the subbasin at the end of the nth step and v q is the channel volume for flow rate q 2 2 2 ubcwm all hydrological processes within an hru are simulated using ubcwm quick and pipes 1977 quick 1995 in its review of hydrological models applied over western canada beckers et al 2009 identified ubcwm as one of the preferred models for research focused on climate related changes to mass balance in the region s mountainous and glacierized basins like beckers et al 2009 we chose ubcwm for this study because it is physically based and analytically represents snow and glacier melt additionally the model can be run within raven s interface ubcwm calculates an hru s climatic forcings and hydrology using three sub models 1 a meteorological sub model where precipitation is quantified and divided into snow and rain based on climatic forcings elevation and atmospheric conditions 2 a soil sub model that determines evaporation and distributes the remaining available snow melt and rain into reservoirs representing surface runoff shallow groundwater deep groundwater and interflow based on antecedent conditions and 3 a routing sub model that moves water between reservoirs and to the outlet of the hru for glacier hrus the distribution of snow due to the effects of wind and gravity are not considered and glacier melt is distributed solely to surface runoff typically ubcwm expects an hru to be divided into elevation bands that experience different forcings based on orographic corrections to the climatic drivers here we consider the high resolution hrus to have uniform elevation as a result ubcwm s orographic correction algorithms are not used within a cell but rather applied to each hru based on its elevation relative to the 1 16 cell in the forcing data containing the majority of the hru s area 2 2 3 rgm glacier evolution is modeled using the ice dynamics component of the regional glaciation model rgm described in clarke et al 2015 this is a two dimensional vertically integrated i e 2 5 d model that assumes the shallow ice approximation and isothermal ice the equations of the shallow ice model are solved as a non linear diffusion equation using a super implicit numerical scheme conservation of mass is enforced using a flux limiting scheme jarosch et al 2013 the model is run on a 200 m 200 m grid that matches that of the ubcwm simulations and is forced with annual average surface mass balance and is run at a timestep of 0 2 years 2 3 data for calibration and validation historical simulations are forced using pnwnamet werner et al 2019 a 1 16 gridded data set while operational simulations suggest that climate station forcings may produce better goodness of fit results over historical periods georg jost personal communication may 12 2021 we choose to use the gridded pnwnamet data because of its similarity in structure to the gridded gcm forcings that drive both baseline and future period projections simulated streamflow at the outlet is compared to naturalized flows provided by bc hydro simulated glacier volume and area change are evaluated relative to the basin scale thinning rate and glacier area change values developed in schiefer et al 2007 using topographical differences from bias corrected shuttle radar topography mission data and digital terrain models from aerial photography initial glaciers are determined using the estimated subglacial digital elevation maps developed in clarke et al 2015 combined with the terrain resource information management surface digital elevation map circa 1985 for calibration and the bias corrected shuttle radar topography mission map circa 2000 for validation glaciers are identified as those cells for which the surface elevation is at least one meter larger than the subsurface elevation as in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 all other grid cells are assigned a landuse type based on majority area relative to a modified version of the north america land cover dataset edition 2 natural resources canada the canada centre for mapping and earth observation 2013 from the north america land change monitoring system the original map classifies land use in north america at a 250 m resolution using 19 vegetative classes in british columbia most regions are classified as temperate or sub polar needle leaf to reflect the variation within this class four sub classes of temperate or sub polar needle leaf are identified and assigned based on leaf area index from geov1 baret et al 2013 camacho et al 2013 and vegetative height from simard et al 2011 the cheakamus basin s future hydrology under representative concentration pathway 8 5 is simulated using forcing data from six coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 global climate models gcms access1 3 canesm2 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es and mpi esm lr these gcms are selected based on their ability to represent model uncertainty in the projections of change in a collection of western north american climate extremes cannon 2015 the outputs of these gcms are statistically downscaled to 1 16 using bias corrected constructed analogues with quantile delta mapping reordering bccaqv2 werner and cannon 2016 with pnwnamet used as the target data set bccaqv2 is a hybrid method that combines results from bias corrected constructed analogs bcca maurer et al 2010 and quantile delta mapping qdm cannon et al 2015 bcca uses spatial aggregation from a linear combination of historical analogues for daily large scale fields qdm applies a form of quantile mapping where relative changes in gcm quantiles are preserved to avoid inflationary effects that can occur with standard quantile mapping bccaqv2 is an updated version of bccaq version 1 which employed standard quantile mapping for all of the fully coupled projections initial land cover is the same as that of the calibration simulations from the initial land cover map glacier coverage can change based on the dynamics simulated by the fully coupled model for one way coupled projections annual glacier coverage is determined by the results of clarke et al 2015 in that study six possible glacier evolutions were projected based on different gcm forcings however tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 found the choice of glacier evolution negligible relative to the variation associated with meteorological forcings and parameterization hence we only use one glacier evolution in our one way coupled projections which is selected based on its proximity to the median of the evolutionary paths 2 4 calibration procedures note for clarity here and throughout the paper we use the term parameterization to refer to a single point in the parameter space of our ghm i e a unique array of parameter values used to simulate the ghm we use the terms set of parameterizations or parameterization set to refer to a collection of such points we simulate projections of the future hydrology of the cheakamus basin using three separate sets of parameterizations obtained through three different calibration procedures summarized in table 1 and fig 1 the first procedure nd is based on the methodology of jost et al 2012 and tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 the glacier dynamics model is turned off i e only the hydrological model is run during calibration and the glacier melt simulated over the static glaciers by the hydrological model is constrained based on thinning rates converted to mass balance although the results of tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 suggest that streamflow properties are insensitive to the precise path of glacier area dynamics within a prescribed range we nonetheless wish to explore the effects of running the fully coupled model with glacier dynamics on during the calibration period because a it allows for direct constraint of glacier melt based on thinning rates and b the internal dynamics model may produce a range of glacier dynamics much larger than the one studied in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 hence in the second procedure z we follow studies such as ismail et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 and lutz et al 2016 and run the fully coupled model during calibration with glacier melt constrained directly based on observed versus simulated thinning rates our third procedure za follows the z methodology but constrains glacier melt by both observed thinning rates and observed surface area change to minimize the compensating effects of errors within these two properties rather than generate a separate set of parameterizations for the one way projections we use the nd parameterization set the nd calibration procedure varies slightly from that of tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 in that its glacier coverage is static during the entire simulation whereas glacier coverage in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 is switched mid way through the calibration period from glacier observations circa the first year of simulation to glacier observations circa the last year of simulation we use the nd set for one way simulations 1 to save on computational cost 2 because observed cheakamus glacier area change from 1985 1999 is minimal 1 km 2 and 3 to directly analyze the effects of one way versus two way coupling on hydrological projections calibration simulations for all of the procedures are for 1985 1999 water years while this period is small relative to the timescale of glacier dynamics it was chosen based on the availability of glacier volume and area change observations a common limiting factor in calibration naz et al 2014 for each of the procedures the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 is used to find pareto optimal parameterizations consisting of 15 calibrated parameters these parameters were selected based on a sensitivity analysis and are allowed to vary within ranges determined by a combination of prescription from quick and pipes 1977 internal bc hydro ubcwm simulations of the cheakamus georg jost personal communication may 12 2021 and the authors experience calibrating ubcwm in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 in the optimization algorithm points in the parameter space are evaluated based on a multi objective function composed of each calibration procedure s specific glacier metrics and the following four streamflow metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nash sutcliffe efficiency of the log of streamflow percent bias and kling gupta efficiency the uniform basin wide thinning rate in z is constrained using the absolute error metric in za the thinning rate and the glacier surface area change are constrained using absolute error for nd we follow the procedure described in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 because no simulated thinning rate is available we first make upper b u and lower b l estimates of glacier net mass balance based on observed thinning rates the uncertainty associated with those observations 3 m schiefer et al 2007 and the uncertainty in the glaciers bulk density dyurgerov et al 2009 huss 2013 1 b l min 0 7 δ h 3 0 85 δ h 3 2 b u max 0 7 δ h 3 0 85 δ h 3 where δ h is average change in glacier height across the basin in meters we then constrain simulated mass balance b s using a bell shaped membership function zhao and bose 2002 3 bmf b 1 1 b s b m b u b l 2 where b m is the midpoint between b u and b l because the optimization algorithm is designed to find pareto optimal i e non inferior solutions each metric in a given set of constraints is considered to have equal weight the calibration algorithm is iterated 30 times and generates 60 parameterizations each iterate after the final iteration we verify that the algorithm has converged in the sense that each of the 60 parameterizations is pareto optimal for each calibration procedure a subset of six of the 60 pareto optimal parameterizations are selected for validation and projections based on combined metric performance validation is based on performance against streamflow observations over the 2000 2008 water year period 2 5 projection procedures using the sets of parameterizations from the nd z and za calibration procedures we project the cheakamus basin s future hydrology under representative concentration pathway 8 5 from 1981 through 2098 using the fully coupled model described in section 2 2 for the one way coupling projections described in section 2 2 we use the parameterization set from the nd procedure in all subsequent sections we refer to the one way projections that use the nd parameterization set as ow projections and refer to the fully coupled projections as nd 2 6 analysis 2 6 1 variability within pareto optimal sets we wish to compare between the different calibration projection procedures the ability of the optimization algorithm to constrain parameter values as well as the procedure s ability to constrain the following model outputs 1 summer july august streamflow q 2 the glacier contribution to summer streamflow q g 3 summer seven day low flow q lf and 4 the coefficient of variation of annual summer streamflow cv q to this end for a given calibration procedure and parameter we compute amongst its 60 pareto optimal values the standard deviation normalized as a percentage of the parameter s upper limit value this normalized value is computed for each parameter and procedure to assess variability in model output amongst the pareto optimal sets we use each projection procedure to simulate the validation period for all 60 of its pareto optimal parameterizations we then test for differences in variance amongst the sets using an f sigma test with α 0 05 this is the only analysis where all 60 pareto optimal parameterizations are studied in all other analysis a subset of six parameterizations is used 2 6 2 variability from forcing set versus parameterization set for each procedure we also wish to compare the variability in model outputs that stems from the set of six selected ubcwm parameterizations p to that which stems from the set of six gcms f as in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 we make this comparison for our four properties of interest by calculating the between to within variability ratio for both the set of parameterizations and the set of forcings to calculate this ratio for the set of forcings and model output q time averaged summer streamflow q was computed for each simulation producing a set of 36 average values s q f p f p f p this set was then separated into six groups the first group contains the six projections that use the first set of climate forcings f 1 q f 1 p p p the second group contains the six projections that use the second set of forcings f 2 q f 2 p p p and so on for each f i the mean value of the group is computed and the between group variability bv f set to the variance between these means next the variance within each group f i is computed and the results are averaged to calculate the within group variability wv f the between to within variability ratio is the ratio of the between group variability and the within group variability bwr f bv f wv f analogous procedures are used to calculate the ratio for the set of parameterizations and the other model outputs for a given streamflow property we consider factors with a relatively large between to within variability ratio to have a relatively large contribution to variance of the streamflow property 2 6 3 variability of changes between end century and baseline for each set of projections ow nd z and za we calculate the change from baseline 1981 2008 to end century 2071 2098 of time averaged values of summer streamflow glacier contribution to summer streamflow summer seven day low flow and the cv of summer streamflow we assess the variability of these changes between ow nd z and za in three ways first we test for significance in the projected changes of each procedure using welch s unequal variances t test welch 1947 with α 0 05 and look for any differences between the procedures second we use the same t test to check for significant differences in magnitude between the changes from baseline to end century projected by ow nd z and za finally we perform a two way analysis of variance anova and calculate the relative effect sizes of 1 gcm forcings and 2 calibration projection procedures on the projected differences between baseline and end century values 3 results 3 1 historic period 1985 2008 3 1 1 calibration and validation calibration and validation performance of the six selected pareto optimal parameterizations was similar across all three procedures table 2 metric scores over the calibration and validation periods are reasonable though the models generally struggled to capture low flow winter conditions as well as peak extremes fig 3 over the calibration period daily nash sutcliffe efficiency values ranged from 0 57 0 64 percent bias between 2 8 5 6 nash sutcliffe efficiency of the log of streamflow between 0 57 0 65 and kling gupta efficiency between 0 52 0 62 over the validation period daily nash sutcliffe efficiency was within 0 58 0 64 percent bias ranged from 9 6 12 4 nash sutcliffe efficiency of the log of streamflow ranged from 0 56 0 63 and kling gupta efficiency varied within 0 58 0 63 while higher goodness of fit metric scores are preferable we consider our results adequate for the purposes of our study 3 1 2 pareto optimal set variability the results from computation of each calibrated parameter s normalized standard deviation within its 60 pareto optimal values are mixed table 3 there is no clear trend regarding the relative magnitude of the normalized values when comparing between calibration procedures however amongst the highest sensitivity parameters determined using morris method analysis it appears that the distribution of pareto optimal values using procedure z is generally tightest with the next tightest distribution being produced by procedure za and the least tightest by procedure nd in particular the exponential parameter that determines the rate of albedo decay for non glacierized and glacierized cells p0albmlx and p 0 albmlx g appears to be best constrained by procedure z analysis of the variability of each projection procedure s full set of 60 pareto optimal parameterizations over the validation period show no significant differences between the procedures in constraining simulated summer streamflow table 5 with the exception of the z za pairing there was also no significant difference between the cv q variance simulated by the procedures though the magnitude of ow s simulated cv q appears to be larger than that of the others fig 5 3 2 projections 1981 2098 summer projection results from ow nd z and za are generally consistent with one another as well as with the conceptual model of increasing radiative forcings leading to an earlier spring onset of snowmelt and a resulting decrease in summer streamflow table 4 in conjunction with this loss of summer snowmelt simulations of glacier dynamics though varied all project nearly total glacier loss by the end century fig 4 correspondingly the simulations consistently project a loss of glacier contribution to streamflow over the summer period 3 2 1 forcing set versus parameterization set variability table 6 shows the results of the between to within variability ratio calculations for all projection sets n 6 gcms 6 parameterizations 36 for each calibration projection procedure for each procedure the majority of the variability in summer streamflow the seven day summer low flow and summer streamflow cv appear to result from variability in forcings rather than from variability in the procedure s subset of pareto optimal parameterizations variability in the z and za projections of the glacier component of summer streamflow also appear to be mostly a result of variability in forcings for the ow and nd procedures more of the variability in the glacier contribution to summer streamflow stems from variability in the subset of parameterizations 3 2 2 variability in projected changes the sign and significance of projected changes agree across all projection procedures table 4 for each set summer streamflow the glacier contribution to summer streamflow and the summer seven day low flow are all expected to decrease in the end century while the cv of summer streamflow is expected to increase though the sign and significance of these changes are consistent among ow nd z and za the mean and distribution of the expected changes show some variation between projection procedures fig 6 analysis of the magnitude of projected changes shows statistically significant differences between the calibration projection procedures table 7 the magnitude of changes to summer streamflow and glacier melt projected by the two way nd procedure is significantly different from the other two way methods and the one way method the magnitude of changes to summer low flow and cv projected by one way coupling are significantly different from those projected by the two way methods the apparent difference in projected summer seven day low flow between ow and the other projection procedures can also be seen in the range of flow duration curves for each procedure fig 7 two factor anova shows both forcings and projection procedures explain a significant α 0 05 amount of variation in the projected differences of all four computed variables with the exception of summer streamflow the variations explained by calibration projection procedure are as large or larger than those explained by gcm fig 8 4 discussion calibration and validation simulations demonstrate that the ghm can reasonably reproduce historic streamflow in the cheakamus basin table 2 still some biases particularly in baseflow exist fig 3 and higher goodness of fit measures are preferable our goodness of fit values may be a symptom of the difficulty inherit in parameterizing a model to simultaneously fit both the basin s streamflow and glacier observations as well as the underlying deficiencies in model structure and input data this struggle to precisely fit observations may lead to higher variability within a procedure s pareto optimal parameterizations though the calibration procedures performances against observations were similar and our analysis of variability is comparative amongst the procedures rather than absolute our results should nonetheless be interpreted with this limitation in mind over the validation period the models calibrated using the fully coupled ghm produced tighter overall constraints on the cheakamus basin s streamflow properties table 5 compared to ow z and za both displayed significantly smaller variance in glacier contribution to summer streamflow and seven day low flow compared to nd z s variance in both summer streamflow and seven day low flow was significantly smaller while za s variance was only significantly smaller in seven day low flow in none of the four properties analyzed was the variance in the nd or ow sets significantly smaller than those of z and za while the fully coupled calibration procedures performed better in terms of variance than their static counterpart the additional constraint on glacier area that defines the difference between z and za does not appear to positively influence calibration results the za set s variance was not significantly smaller than that of z for any of the analyzed properties while the z set showed a significantly smaller variance than za in the coefficient of variation in summer streamflow these results imply that there is a benefit to parameterizing a ghm using dynamics during the calibration period for those ghms that calibrate to thinning rate our results do not imply any benefit from the additional constraint of glacier area our analysis of the normalized standard deviation of individual parameters amongst their pareto optimal sets generally agree with this conclusion as calibration procedure z followed next by za best constrains the highest sensitivity parameters table 3 these parameters control the evolution of albedo as a snowpack ages and therefore have a direct influence on snow melt glacier melt and mass balance the primary input for the glacier dynamics model conceptually one would expect constraining glacier area to be beneficial to a model as it helps to avoid internal compensation for errors in the melt rate with errors in glacier area change however our results do not display any evidence of such a compensating effect as the glacier area evolutions in the z and za projections are generally very similar fig 4 the absence of any benefit from the addition of an area constraint may relate to the relatively short calibration period during which glacier area change was essentially zero it is possible that the basin s glaciers were sufficiently thick during this period that smaller errors in melt rate were unable to manifest as glacier area errors such limitations stemming from the availability of glacier observations are common in this field but should nonetheless be kept in mind when interpreting our study s results the magnitude of projected changes in the cheakamus basin are found to vary significantly among the projection procedures z and za the two fully coupled projection sets that are calibrated using the fully coupled model show agreement between one another the magnitudes of changes in summer streamflow and its glacier contribution projected by nd varied from those of the other procedures table 7 although simulated changes in summer streamflow glacier contribution q g for ow are not significantly different from those of z and za the one way procedure s projection set s distribution of δ q g appears to more closely resemble that of nd and have a larger variance than δ q g for z or za fig 6 results show ow simulations projecting a significantly larger decrease in summer seven day low flow q lf and increase in the cv of summer streamflow than the nd z and za procedures table 7 the difference in δ q lf appears to be a result of a difference in projected end century q lf as baseline flow duration curves are similar for ow nd z and za whereas the end century ow curve appears to separate from the other procedures at the flow values with a high probability of exceedance fig 7 anova shows that choice of projection calibration procedure accounts for a significant amount of the variation in the projected changes of all four computed streamflow variables the effect size computations quantify this contribution and show that the variation attributable to the choice of projection calibration procedure is as large or larger than what can be attributed to the choice of forcing for glacier contribution to streamflow seven day summer low flow and the coefficient of variation of summer streamflow fig 8 in previous studies examining uncertainties in hydrological projections under climate change e g kay et al 2009 prudhomme and davies 2009 prudhomme and davies 2009 najafi et al 2011 choice of gcm has generally been found to be the largest source of uncertainty in the modelling chain however these studies did not consider parameterization variation uncertainty due to calibration procedure but rather compared the variation due to gcm structure against the internal variability of the hydrological model associated with its structure and parameters that we find the uncertainty associated with calibration projection procedure to be comparable to this previously established large source of uncertainty underscores the importance of calibration uncertainty in interpreting the results of ghms despite their differences all four projection sets are consistent in their broad conclusions regarding the cheakamus basins future hydrology the basin s glaciers melt summer streamflow decreases and cv increases table 4 this would appear to imply that the projected changes in climate forcings are strong enough to make the sign and significance of changes to cheakamus basin s hydrology insensitive to the calibration and projection procedures explored in this study in some ways this insensitivity is unsurprising the rapid thinning rates and area loss schiefer et al 2007 moore et al 2009 observed in british columbia combined with the general expectation of a warmer future climate would seem to indicate that irrespective of trajectories simulated glacier evolutions will inevitably end in large scale loss still while such a result may be intuitive it is not obvious a priori calibration of glacier dynamics was performed not only to accurately simulate glacier evolution but also to constrain the non glacier parameters and thereby avoid poor parameterizations that perform well historically because of the compensating effects between glacierized and non glacierized parts of the basin we assert that the overall impact of this secondary benefit of glacier calibration on projections is generally unclear prior to simulation 5 conclusions in this study we presented a new adaptable fully coupled glacio hydrological modelling system developed within a modular framework our fully coupled ghm was used to analyze the impact of differing calibration procedures on hydrological projections of the cheakamus basin we additionally compared these projection sets to simulations wherein glacier dynamics are prescribed using the results of clarke et al 2015 our results indicate that the climatic forcings projected under representative concentration pathway 8 5 have sufficient strength to make the sign and significance of changes to the basin s summer hydrology insensitive to variation between our selected calibration and projection procedures variation between our calibration projection procedures does however appear to have an impact on the magnitude of projected changes table 4 and can be a source of uncertainty comparable to known sources of large uncertainty such as gcm structure fig 8 this would imply that while some facets of glacier dynamic modelling such as the critically limiting availability of observations inevitably lead to uncertainty in projections there is still room to reduce the uncertainty in ghm projections to this end though projected changes from each methodology cannot be compared to observations we nonetheless identify a preferred procedure for the new ghm based on three principles 1 an internally consistent model is preferable to a model without internal consistency 2 it is desirable for a calibration procedure to minimize variations in output between optimal parameterizations 3 a methodology with fewer data requirements is preferable to one with more accordingly we favor the fully coupled model calibrated with glacier dynamics and thinning rates as a target observation method z for projecting hydrology in a partially glacierized basin as it is the fully coupled model with the fewest data requirements and also leads to the tightest overall constraint of the four streamflow properties analyzed tables 3 5 our study has been primarily focused on one fully coupled ghm applied to a single site with limited observations we therefore do not recommend a direct application of our findings to other glacio hydrological studies rather we suggest viewing our work as an example highlighting the importance of calibration techniques and their associate uncertainties in ghm simulations based on our findings we advocate additional research involving a

8551,as glaciers across the world continue to recede there is a concern that their loss as a fresh water reservoir within mountainous basins will have a negative impact on stream temperatures and downstream water resources currently there are relatively few glacio hydrological models ghms appropriate to study such phenomena and studies that have used ghms generally acknowledge the high uncertainty associated with their simulations calibration techniques present a particular issue in ghms as available glacier observations are limited and errors in the glacierized portion of a basin can be compensated by errors in the non glacierized portion using as a study site the cheakamus basin in british columbia canada we 1 present a new fully coupled ghm 2 analyze the effects different calibration techniques have on the model s summer streamflow projections and 3 compare the fully coupled ghm results to projections using a one way ghm the calibration techniques studied vary in terms of glacier representation dynamic static and glacier constraint mass balance thinning rates thinning rates and area change we find projected future climate forcings are sufficiently strong in the cheakamus basin so as to generally make the sign and significance of changes to the basin s hydrology insensitive to the calibration and projection procedures studied however the variation among these procedures produces significant changes in the projected magnitude of future hydrological changes and therefore should be carefully considered in studies where precision beyond the sign and significance of change is required based on analysis of the variation within each procedure s set of model outputs we conclude 1 the two way ghm has benefits over the one way model 2 calibration using dynamic glaciers and a thinning rate constraint is preferable for the new ghm and 3 there is a need for additional studies on the uncertainties associated with the calibration of glacio hydrological models keywords glacier dynamics glacio hydrological model calibration uncertainty hydrological projections data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction alpine glaciers worldwide are generally thought to be in a state of recession gardner et al 2013 kaser et al 2006 that is expected to continue through the end of the century radić and hock 2011 from a water resources and environmental perspective the global impact of this continued glacial loss may be substantial barnett et al 2005 huss and hock 2018 over one sixth of the world s population depends on glacier and snowmelt for their water supply barnett et al 2005 and in even modestly glacierized basins 2 5 glacial coverage glacier melt has been shown to play a significant role in seasonal streamflow stahl and moore 2006 glacial melt usually coincides with the warm dry weather that is typically associated with low flow periods in the non glacierized portions of the basin meier 1969 and warm stream temperatures brown et al 2005 moore 2006 hence in partially glacierized basins glaciers can compensate for otherwise low flow conditions and act to attenuate stream temperatures and variability in the streamflow signal fountain and tangborn 1985 as a basin s glacial area decreases its ability to attenuate stream properties may ultimately diminish while initially glacier loss is associated with an increase in melt and subsequent streamflow this benefit is not sustained as the supply of glacier ice is eventually exhausted huss et al 2008 stahl and moore 2006 in those regions dependent on melt from diminishing glaciers estimating the current and future stages of the basin s streamflow relative to this changing glacier signal is an important task frans et al 2015 despite the importance of understanding a region s streamflow response to glacier loss projecting the future hydrology of partially glacierized watersheds remains a difficult challenge amongst other facets long term simulations must model how the glacier volume and area evolve over time this requirement is juxtaposed with the common practice of hydrological models assuming a static glacier coverage and glacier dynamics models not being linked to other hydrological processes naz et al 2014 while recent studies have developed and deployed coupled glacio hydrological models ghms e g immerzeel et al 2012 ismail et al 2020 jost et al 2012 naz et al 2014 seibert et al 2018 there are still relatively few models available that use physically based representations to simulate both glacier dynamics and hydrological processes of the studies focused on ghms many have raised the issue of the high uncertainty associated with their simulations for hydrological models in general uncertainty in the future forcings blöschl and montanari 2010 the representation of hydrological processes orth et al 2015 and the calibration validation approach troin et al 2016 all contribute to uncertainty in simulation results in partially glacierized basins uncertainty in calibration is exacerbated by relatively limited observations of the processes controlling glacier dynamics van tiel et al 2020 and the possibility that errors in the glacier portion of the basin may compensate for errors in the non glacierized portion ismail et al 2020 for proper interpretation of projection results from ghms the relative magnitude of each source of uncertainty should be understood recently some progress has been made towards understanding and better constraining the uncertainty in ghms naz et al 2014 compared the metric performance over a 22 year historical period of streamflow from the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model when using 1 static glaciers 2 prescribed glaciers based on observations and 3 glaciers simulated using a dynamics model in that study the authors found that including a glacier dynamics representation improved prediction of streamflow as simulation length increased and that the hydrographs produced using prescribed and modelled glacier changes were similar over the historic period in ismail et al 2020 the future hydrology in the upper indus basin was projected using two ghms each parameterized using 1 a simple calibration validation approach that only used streamflow observations at the basin s outlet and 2 an enhanced calibration validation approach that incorporated sub catchment gauge data different climate conditions and glacier mass balance the study found some differences in the projected streamflow between the two methods at the annual scale up to 10 as well as larger monthly differences up to 19 during colder months october march using analysis of variance ismail et al 2020 also found that by the end of the century uncertainty associated with parameterization using the enhanced method was very small relative to overall uncertainty and therefore concluded that an enhanced calibration approach may help constrain hydrological projections in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 the authors analyzed the variability in projected streamflow from a one way ghm with prescribed glaciers that stemmed from choice of 1 glacier evolution 2 parameterization amongst pareto optimal sets and 3 climate forcings the study found the uncertainty associated with choice of climate forcings to be largest and the uncertainty associated with choice of parameterization among pareto optimal solutions from the same calibration procedure to generally be larger than the uncertainty associated with choice of glacier evolution while these previous studies have provided useful insights regarding ghm uncertainty our collective understanding of the impacts of calibration validation approaches and glacier dynamics representations on ghm uncertainty is still relatively underdeveloped recently van tiel et al 2020 performed a thorough review of calibration procedures currently used for ghms and concluded there is need for a systematic analysis of best practices for ghm calibration to better understand model simulations in glacierized basins to this end we explore the impact that different calibration procedures have on the streamflow changes projected by a fully coupled ghm in the partially glacierized cheakamus river basin for simulations we use a new ghm that represents the full coupling of the ubc watershed model ubcwm to the regional glaciation model clarke et al 2015 the three procedures were selected based on available data and the methodology of previous studies i e ismail et al 2020 jost et al 2012 lutz et al 2016 meyer et al 2019 tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 all of the procedures use the same optimization algorithms and streamflow targets but vary in the glacier data used to constrain simulations and the treatment of glacier dynamics during the calibration period see fig 1 and section 2 4 to compare the fully coupled ghm model structure to our previous work s methodology we also analyze projections that use the one way coupled model from tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 wherein prescribed changes to glacier landcover based on clarke et al 2015 results are forced annually onto ubcwm simulations 2 methods 2 1 study site we simulate the hydrological processes of the cheakamus basin up to its gauging station approximately 6 km north of its confluence with the squamish river near the southwestern coast of british columbia fig 2 the cheakamus basin was selected for this study because of the availability of observational glacier and hydrological data projected glacier dynamics i e clarke et al 2015 simulations and historic and projected forcing data it was also selected because it is of operational interest the basin is regulated roughly 24 km upstream of its squamish river confluence by the daisy lake dam which is operated by bc hydro the simulated basin has a drainage area of 965 km 2 with elevation ranging between roughly 2300 m and 50 m hydrologically the basin is considered a hybrid regime snowmelt dominates the annual streamflow signal but is superimposed by short intense fall and winter rain on snow events that typically account for the highest daily flows the basin is mostly forested 60 with modest glacier coverage 5 that is thought to be in a state of recession bolch et al 2010 only a small portion 1 of the basin is considered urban 2 2 models in our study we generate projections of the hydrology of the cheakamus basin in two ways 1 with a fully coupled glacio hydrological model and 2 with a one way coupled glacio hydrological model the two approaches vary only in the method used to calculate the change in the glacier coverage in the fully coupled approach the basin s glacier coverage is updated at the end of each water year based on simulations using the regional glaciation model rgm which is driven by annual mass balance states of the hydrological model in the one way approach annual glacier coverage is dictated by the results of the simulations described in clarke et al 2015 see section 2 3 of this paper in both approaches we discretize the cheakamus basin into 200 m 200 m hydrological response units hrus this resolution was chosen to match that of the rgm simulations and clarke et al 2015 results allowing for straightforward interfacing of the hydrological and glacier components of the ghm we model the hydrology of an individual hru using the university of british columbia watershed model ubcwm routing within and between subbasins and calculations of streamflow contributions are handled by raven s internal algorithms below we provide a brief overview of the main components of our modeling framework 2 2 1 raven raven is a modular hydrological modeling framework described in craig et al 2020 in its original design raven was capable of applying landuse change only if the changes were known prior to the beginning of the simulation for our purposes we modified raven s source code to allow landuse change to be determined during a simulation based on output from an external program e g rgm this modification allows one to create within raven a ghm consisting of any combination of hydrological process representations available within the framework and a compatible external glacier dynamics model in our study for each simulated year changes to glacier coverage are made within raven on october 1st when snow accumulation and glacier melt are generally thought to be minimal in the one way coupling scheme these changes are dictated by the clarke et al 2015 results in the two way scheme ice thickness is updated annually by rgm based on surface mass balance and corresponding 200 m 200 m glacier coverage maps are built using a one meter threshold for glaciated cells raven then updates landcover for the hydrological model by comparing the current glacier coverage map with that of the previous year s when an hru loses its glacier coverage the landuse type is changed from glacier to barren and the glacier reservoir within the hru which conceptually is depleted becomes inaccessible for simplicity newly barren hrus are initialized with a soil moisture of zero as simulations show that the hydrology at a basin s outlet is insensitive to this initialization raven s tracer routing feature provides a method for tracking source contributions throughout a simulation in our study we use this feature to trace the contribution of glacier melt to streamflow at the basin s outlet raven tracks this contribution by treating it as a pollutant that is sourced from glacier melt and is mixed uniformly with other sources of water within all subsequent reservoirs it enters pollutants and water from an hru are routed to the corresponding subbasin s outlet using a discrete transfer function subbasin to subbasin routing is determined by iteratively using newton s root finding algorithm to solve the discrete form of the reach s storage expression v q out n 1 v q out n δ t 1 2 q in n q in n 1 1 2 q out n q out n 1 here q in n and q out n are the upstream inflow and the outflow from the subbasin at the end of the nth step and v q is the channel volume for flow rate q 2 2 2 ubcwm all hydrological processes within an hru are simulated using ubcwm quick and pipes 1977 quick 1995 in its review of hydrological models applied over western canada beckers et al 2009 identified ubcwm as one of the preferred models for research focused on climate related changes to mass balance in the region s mountainous and glacierized basins like beckers et al 2009 we chose ubcwm for this study because it is physically based and analytically represents snow and glacier melt additionally the model can be run within raven s interface ubcwm calculates an hru s climatic forcings and hydrology using three sub models 1 a meteorological sub model where precipitation is quantified and divided into snow and rain based on climatic forcings elevation and atmospheric conditions 2 a soil sub model that determines evaporation and distributes the remaining available snow melt and rain into reservoirs representing surface runoff shallow groundwater deep groundwater and interflow based on antecedent conditions and 3 a routing sub model that moves water between reservoirs and to the outlet of the hru for glacier hrus the distribution of snow due to the effects of wind and gravity are not considered and glacier melt is distributed solely to surface runoff typically ubcwm expects an hru to be divided into elevation bands that experience different forcings based on orographic corrections to the climatic drivers here we consider the high resolution hrus to have uniform elevation as a result ubcwm s orographic correction algorithms are not used within a cell but rather applied to each hru based on its elevation relative to the 1 16 cell in the forcing data containing the majority of the hru s area 2 2 3 rgm glacier evolution is modeled using the ice dynamics component of the regional glaciation model rgm described in clarke et al 2015 this is a two dimensional vertically integrated i e 2 5 d model that assumes the shallow ice approximation and isothermal ice the equations of the shallow ice model are solved as a non linear diffusion equation using a super implicit numerical scheme conservation of mass is enforced using a flux limiting scheme jarosch et al 2013 the model is run on a 200 m 200 m grid that matches that of the ubcwm simulations and is forced with annual average surface mass balance and is run at a timestep of 0 2 years 2 3 data for calibration and validation historical simulations are forced using pnwnamet werner et al 2019 a 1 16 gridded data set while operational simulations suggest that climate station forcings may produce better goodness of fit results over historical periods georg jost personal communication may 12 2021 we choose to use the gridded pnwnamet data because of its similarity in structure to the gridded gcm forcings that drive both baseline and future period projections simulated streamflow at the outlet is compared to naturalized flows provided by bc hydro simulated glacier volume and area change are evaluated relative to the basin scale thinning rate and glacier area change values developed in schiefer et al 2007 using topographical differences from bias corrected shuttle radar topography mission data and digital terrain models from aerial photography initial glaciers are determined using the estimated subglacial digital elevation maps developed in clarke et al 2015 combined with the terrain resource information management surface digital elevation map circa 1985 for calibration and the bias corrected shuttle radar topography mission map circa 2000 for validation glaciers are identified as those cells for which the surface elevation is at least one meter larger than the subsurface elevation as in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 all other grid cells are assigned a landuse type based on majority area relative to a modified version of the north america land cover dataset edition 2 natural resources canada the canada centre for mapping and earth observation 2013 from the north america land change monitoring system the original map classifies land use in north america at a 250 m resolution using 19 vegetative classes in british columbia most regions are classified as temperate or sub polar needle leaf to reflect the variation within this class four sub classes of temperate or sub polar needle leaf are identified and assigned based on leaf area index from geov1 baret et al 2013 camacho et al 2013 and vegetative height from simard et al 2011 the cheakamus basin s future hydrology under representative concentration pathway 8 5 is simulated using forcing data from six coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 global climate models gcms access1 3 canesm2 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es and mpi esm lr these gcms are selected based on their ability to represent model uncertainty in the projections of change in a collection of western north american climate extremes cannon 2015 the outputs of these gcms are statistically downscaled to 1 16 using bias corrected constructed analogues with quantile delta mapping reordering bccaqv2 werner and cannon 2016 with pnwnamet used as the target data set bccaqv2 is a hybrid method that combines results from bias corrected constructed analogs bcca maurer et al 2010 and quantile delta mapping qdm cannon et al 2015 bcca uses spatial aggregation from a linear combination of historical analogues for daily large scale fields qdm applies a form of quantile mapping where relative changes in gcm quantiles are preserved to avoid inflationary effects that can occur with standard quantile mapping bccaqv2 is an updated version of bccaq version 1 which employed standard quantile mapping for all of the fully coupled projections initial land cover is the same as that of the calibration simulations from the initial land cover map glacier coverage can change based on the dynamics simulated by the fully coupled model for one way coupled projections annual glacier coverage is determined by the results of clarke et al 2015 in that study six possible glacier evolutions were projected based on different gcm forcings however tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 found the choice of glacier evolution negligible relative to the variation associated with meteorological forcings and parameterization hence we only use one glacier evolution in our one way coupled projections which is selected based on its proximity to the median of the evolutionary paths 2 4 calibration procedures note for clarity here and throughout the paper we use the term parameterization to refer to a single point in the parameter space of our ghm i e a unique array of parameter values used to simulate the ghm we use the terms set of parameterizations or parameterization set to refer to a collection of such points we simulate projections of the future hydrology of the cheakamus basin using three separate sets of parameterizations obtained through three different calibration procedures summarized in table 1 and fig 1 the first procedure nd is based on the methodology of jost et al 2012 and tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 the glacier dynamics model is turned off i e only the hydrological model is run during calibration and the glacier melt simulated over the static glaciers by the hydrological model is constrained based on thinning rates converted to mass balance although the results of tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 suggest that streamflow properties are insensitive to the precise path of glacier area dynamics within a prescribed range we nonetheless wish to explore the effects of running the fully coupled model with glacier dynamics on during the calibration period because a it allows for direct constraint of glacier melt based on thinning rates and b the internal dynamics model may produce a range of glacier dynamics much larger than the one studied in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 hence in the second procedure z we follow studies such as ismail et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 and lutz et al 2016 and run the fully coupled model during calibration with glacier melt constrained directly based on observed versus simulated thinning rates our third procedure za follows the z methodology but constrains glacier melt by both observed thinning rates and observed surface area change to minimize the compensating effects of errors within these two properties rather than generate a separate set of parameterizations for the one way projections we use the nd parameterization set the nd calibration procedure varies slightly from that of tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 in that its glacier coverage is static during the entire simulation whereas glacier coverage in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 is switched mid way through the calibration period from glacier observations circa the first year of simulation to glacier observations circa the last year of simulation we use the nd set for one way simulations 1 to save on computational cost 2 because observed cheakamus glacier area change from 1985 1999 is minimal 1 km 2 and 3 to directly analyze the effects of one way versus two way coupling on hydrological projections calibration simulations for all of the procedures are for 1985 1999 water years while this period is small relative to the timescale of glacier dynamics it was chosen based on the availability of glacier volume and area change observations a common limiting factor in calibration naz et al 2014 for each of the procedures the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 is used to find pareto optimal parameterizations consisting of 15 calibrated parameters these parameters were selected based on a sensitivity analysis and are allowed to vary within ranges determined by a combination of prescription from quick and pipes 1977 internal bc hydro ubcwm simulations of the cheakamus georg jost personal communication may 12 2021 and the authors experience calibrating ubcwm in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 in the optimization algorithm points in the parameter space are evaluated based on a multi objective function composed of each calibration procedure s specific glacier metrics and the following four streamflow metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nash sutcliffe efficiency of the log of streamflow percent bias and kling gupta efficiency the uniform basin wide thinning rate in z is constrained using the absolute error metric in za the thinning rate and the glacier surface area change are constrained using absolute error for nd we follow the procedure described in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 because no simulated thinning rate is available we first make upper b u and lower b l estimates of glacier net mass balance based on observed thinning rates the uncertainty associated with those observations 3 m schiefer et al 2007 and the uncertainty in the glaciers bulk density dyurgerov et al 2009 huss 2013 1 b l min 0 7 δ h 3 0 85 δ h 3 2 b u max 0 7 δ h 3 0 85 δ h 3 where δ h is average change in glacier height across the basin in meters we then constrain simulated mass balance b s using a bell shaped membership function zhao and bose 2002 3 bmf b 1 1 b s b m b u b l 2 where b m is the midpoint between b u and b l because the optimization algorithm is designed to find pareto optimal i e non inferior solutions each metric in a given set of constraints is considered to have equal weight the calibration algorithm is iterated 30 times and generates 60 parameterizations each iterate after the final iteration we verify that the algorithm has converged in the sense that each of the 60 parameterizations is pareto optimal for each calibration procedure a subset of six of the 60 pareto optimal parameterizations are selected for validation and projections based on combined metric performance validation is based on performance against streamflow observations over the 2000 2008 water year period 2 5 projection procedures using the sets of parameterizations from the nd z and za calibration procedures we project the cheakamus basin s future hydrology under representative concentration pathway 8 5 from 1981 through 2098 using the fully coupled model described in section 2 2 for the one way coupling projections described in section 2 2 we use the parameterization set from the nd procedure in all subsequent sections we refer to the one way projections that use the nd parameterization set as ow projections and refer to the fully coupled projections as nd 2 6 analysis 2 6 1 variability within pareto optimal sets we wish to compare between the different calibration projection procedures the ability of the optimization algorithm to constrain parameter values as well as the procedure s ability to constrain the following model outputs 1 summer july august streamflow q 2 the glacier contribution to summer streamflow q g 3 summer seven day low flow q lf and 4 the coefficient of variation of annual summer streamflow cv q to this end for a given calibration procedure and parameter we compute amongst its 60 pareto optimal values the standard deviation normalized as a percentage of the parameter s upper limit value this normalized value is computed for each parameter and procedure to assess variability in model output amongst the pareto optimal sets we use each projection procedure to simulate the validation period for all 60 of its pareto optimal parameterizations we then test for differences in variance amongst the sets using an f sigma test with α 0 05 this is the only analysis where all 60 pareto optimal parameterizations are studied in all other analysis a subset of six parameterizations is used 2 6 2 variability from forcing set versus parameterization set for each procedure we also wish to compare the variability in model outputs that stems from the set of six selected ubcwm parameterizations p to that which stems from the set of six gcms f as in tsuruta and schnorbus 2021 we make this comparison for our four properties of interest by calculating the between to within variability ratio for both the set of parameterizations and the set of forcings to calculate this ratio for the set of forcings and model output q time averaged summer streamflow q was computed for each simulation producing a set of 36 average values s q f p f p f p this set was then separated into six groups the first group contains the six projections that use the first set of climate forcings f 1 q f 1 p p p the second group contains the six projections that use the second set of forcings f 2 q f 2 p p p and so on for each f i the mean value of the group is computed and the between group variability bv f set to the variance between these means next the variance within each group f i is computed and the results are averaged to calculate the within group variability wv f the between to within variability ratio is the ratio of the between group variability and the within group variability bwr f bv f wv f analogous procedures are used to calculate the ratio for the set of parameterizations and the other model outputs for a given streamflow property we consider factors with a relatively large between to within variability ratio to have a relatively large contribution to variance of the streamflow property 2 6 3 variability of changes between end century and baseline for each set of projections ow nd z and za we calculate the change from baseline 1981 2008 to end century 2071 2098 of time averaged values of summer streamflow glacier contribution to summer streamflow summer seven day low flow and the cv of summer streamflow we assess the variability of these changes between ow nd z and za in three ways first we test for significance in the projected changes of each procedure using welch s unequal variances t test welch 1947 with α 0 05 and look for any differences between the procedures second we use the same t test to check for significant differences in magnitude between the changes from baseline to end century projected by ow nd z and za finally we perform a two way analysis of variance anova and calculate the relative effect sizes of 1 gcm forcings and 2 calibration projection procedures on the projected differences between baseline and end century values 3 results 3 1 historic period 1985 2008 3 1 1 calibration and validation calibration and validation performance of the six selected pareto optimal parameterizations was similar across all three procedures table 2 metric scores over the calibration and validation periods are reasonable though the models generally struggled to capture low flow winter conditions as well as peak extremes fig 3 over the calibration period daily nash sutcliffe efficiency values ranged from 0 57 0 64 percent bias between 2 8 5 6 nash sutcliffe efficiency of the log of streamflow between 0 57 0 65 and kling gupta efficiency between 0 52 0 62 over the validation period daily nash sutcliffe efficiency was within 0 58 0 64 percent bias ranged from 9 6 12 4 nash sutcliffe efficiency of the log of streamflow ranged from 0 56 0 63 and kling gupta efficiency varied within 0 58 0 63 while higher goodness of fit metric scores are preferable we consider our results adequate for the purposes of our study 3 1 2 pareto optimal set variability the results from computation of each calibrated parameter s normalized standard deviation within its 60 pareto optimal values are mixed table 3 there is no clear trend regarding the relative magnitude of the normalized values when comparing between calibration procedures however amongst the highest sensitivity parameters determined using morris method analysis it appears that the distribution of pareto optimal values using procedure z is generally tightest with the next tightest distribution being produced by procedure za and the least tightest by procedure nd in particular the exponential parameter that determines the rate of albedo decay for non glacierized and glacierized cells p0albmlx and p 0 albmlx g appears to be best constrained by procedure z analysis of the variability of each projection procedure s full set of 60 pareto optimal parameterizations over the validation period show no significant differences between the procedures in constraining simulated summer streamflow table 5 with the exception of the z za pairing there was also no significant difference between the cv q variance simulated by the procedures though the magnitude of ow s simulated cv q appears to be larger than that of the others fig 5 3 2 projections 1981 2098 summer projection results from ow nd z and za are generally consistent with one another as well as with the conceptual model of increasing radiative forcings leading to an earlier spring onset of snowmelt and a resulting decrease in summer streamflow table 4 in conjunction with this loss of summer snowmelt simulations of glacier dynamics though varied all project nearly total glacier loss by the end century fig 4 correspondingly the simulations consistently project a loss of glacier contribution to streamflow over the summer period 3 2 1 forcing set versus parameterization set variability table 6 shows the results of the between to within variability ratio calculations for all projection sets n 6 gcms 6 parameterizations 36 for each calibration projection procedure for each procedure the majority of the variability in summer streamflow the seven day summer low flow and summer streamflow cv appear to result from variability in forcings rather than from variability in the procedure s subset of pareto optimal parameterizations variability in the z and za projections of the glacier component of summer streamflow also appear to be mostly a result of variability in forcings for the ow and nd procedures more of the variability in the glacier contribution to summer streamflow stems from variability in the subset of parameterizations 3 2 2 variability in projected changes the sign and significance of projected changes agree across all projection procedures table 4 for each set summer streamflow the glacier contribution to summer streamflow and the summer seven day low flow are all expected to decrease in the end century while the cv of summer streamflow is expected to increase though the sign and significance of these changes are consistent among ow nd z and za the mean and distribution of the expected changes show some variation between projection procedures fig 6 analysis of the magnitude of projected changes shows statistically significant differences between the calibration projection procedures table 7 the magnitude of changes to summer streamflow and glacier melt projected by the two way nd procedure is significantly different from the other two way methods and the one way method the magnitude of changes to summer low flow and cv projected by one way coupling are significantly different from those projected by the two way methods the apparent difference in projected summer seven day low flow between ow and the other projection procedures can also be seen in the range of flow duration curves for each procedure fig 7 two factor anova shows both forcings and projection procedures explain a significant α 0 05 amount of variation in the projected differences of all four computed variables with the exception of summer streamflow the variations explained by calibration projection procedure are as large or larger than those explained by gcm fig 8 4 discussion calibration and validation simulations demonstrate that the ghm can reasonably reproduce historic streamflow in the cheakamus basin table 2 still some biases particularly in baseflow exist fig 3 and higher goodness of fit measures are preferable our goodness of fit values may be a symptom of the difficulty inherit in parameterizing a model to simultaneously fit both the basin s streamflow and glacier observations as well as the underlying deficiencies in model structure and input data this struggle to precisely fit observations may lead to higher variability within a procedure s pareto optimal parameterizations though the calibration procedures performances against observations were similar and our analysis of variability is comparative amongst the procedures rather than absolute our results should nonetheless be interpreted with this limitation in mind over the validation period the models calibrated using the fully coupled ghm produced tighter overall constraints on the cheakamus basin s streamflow properties table 5 compared to ow z and za both displayed significantly smaller variance in glacier contribution to summer streamflow and seven day low flow compared to nd z s variance in both summer streamflow and seven day low flow was significantly smaller while za s variance was only significantly smaller in seven day low flow in none of the four properties analyzed was the variance in the nd or ow sets significantly smaller than those of z and za while the fully coupled calibration procedures performed better in terms of variance than their static counterpart the additional constraint on glacier area that defines the difference between z and za does not appear to positively influence calibration results the za set s variance was not significantly smaller than that of z for any of the analyzed properties while the z set showed a significantly smaller variance than za in the coefficient of variation in summer streamflow these results imply that there is a benefit to parameterizing a ghm using dynamics during the calibration period for those ghms that calibrate to thinning rate our results do not imply any benefit from the additional constraint of glacier area our analysis of the normalized standard deviation of individual parameters amongst their pareto optimal sets generally agree with this conclusion as calibration procedure z followed next by za best constrains the highest sensitivity parameters table 3 these parameters control the evolution of albedo as a snowpack ages and therefore have a direct influence on snow melt glacier melt and mass balance the primary input for the glacier dynamics model conceptually one would expect constraining glacier area to be beneficial to a model as it helps to avoid internal compensation for errors in the melt rate with errors in glacier area change however our results do not display any evidence of such a compensating effect as the glacier area evolutions in the z and za projections are generally very similar fig 4 the absence of any benefit from the addition of an area constraint may relate to the relatively short calibration period during which glacier area change was essentially zero it is possible that the basin s glaciers were sufficiently thick during this period that smaller errors in melt rate were unable to manifest as glacier area errors such limitations stemming from the availability of glacier observations are common in this field but should nonetheless be kept in mind when interpreting our study s results the magnitude of projected changes in the cheakamus basin are found to vary significantly among the projection procedures z and za the two fully coupled projection sets that are calibrated using the fully coupled model show agreement between one another the magnitudes of changes in summer streamflow and its glacier contribution projected by nd varied from those of the other procedures table 7 although simulated changes in summer streamflow glacier contribution q g for ow are not significantly different from those of z and za the one way procedure s projection set s distribution of δ q g appears to more closely resemble that of nd and have a larger variance than δ q g for z or za fig 6 results show ow simulations projecting a significantly larger decrease in summer seven day low flow q lf and increase in the cv of summer streamflow than the nd z and za procedures table 7 the difference in δ q lf appears to be a result of a difference in projected end century q lf as baseline flow duration curves are similar for ow nd z and za whereas the end century ow curve appears to separate from the other procedures at the flow values with a high probability of exceedance fig 7 anova shows that choice of projection calibration procedure accounts for a significant amount of the variation in the projected changes of all four computed streamflow variables the effect size computations quantify this contribution and show that the variation attributable to the choice of projection calibration procedure is as large or larger than what can be attributed to the choice of forcing for glacier contribution to streamflow seven day summer low flow and the coefficient of variation of summer streamflow fig 8 in previous studies examining uncertainties in hydrological projections under climate change e g kay et al 2009 prudhomme and davies 2009 prudhomme and davies 2009 najafi et al 2011 choice of gcm has generally been found to be the largest source of uncertainty in the modelling chain however these studies did not consider parameterization variation uncertainty due to calibration procedure but rather compared the variation due to gcm structure against the internal variability of the hydrological model associated with its structure and parameters that we find the uncertainty associated with calibration projection procedure to be comparable to this previously established large source of uncertainty underscores the importance of calibration uncertainty in interpreting the results of ghms despite their differences all four projection sets are consistent in their broad conclusions regarding the cheakamus basins future hydrology the basin s glaciers melt summer streamflow decreases and cv increases table 4 this would appear to imply that the projected changes in climate forcings are strong enough to make the sign and significance of changes to cheakamus basin s hydrology insensitive to the calibration and projection procedures explored in this study in some ways this insensitivity is unsurprising the rapid thinning rates and area loss schiefer et al 2007 moore et al 2009 observed in british columbia combined with the general expectation of a warmer future climate would seem to indicate that irrespective of trajectories simulated glacier evolutions will inevitably end in large scale loss still while such a result may be intuitive it is not obvious a priori calibration of glacier dynamics was performed not only to accurately simulate glacier evolution but also to constrain the non glacier parameters and thereby avoid poor parameterizations that perform well historically because of the compensating effects between glacierized and non glacierized parts of the basin we assert that the overall impact of this secondary benefit of glacier calibration on projections is generally unclear prior to simulation 5 conclusions in this study we presented a new adaptable fully coupled glacio hydrological modelling system developed within a modular framework our fully coupled ghm was used to analyze the impact of differing calibration procedures on hydrological projections of the cheakamus basin we additionally compared these projection sets to simulations wherein glacier dynamics are prescribed using the results of clarke et al 2015 our results indicate that the climatic forcings projected under representative concentration pathway 8 5 have sufficient strength to make the sign and significance of changes to the basin s summer hydrology insensitive to variation between our selected calibration and projection procedures variation between our calibration projection procedures does however appear to have an impact on the magnitude of projected changes table 4 and can be a source of uncertainty comparable to known sources of large uncertainty such as gcm structure fig 8 this would imply that while some facets of glacier dynamic modelling such as the critically limiting availability of observations inevitably lead to uncertainty in projections there is still room to reduce the uncertainty in ghm projections to this end though projected changes from each methodology cannot be compared to observations we nonetheless identify a preferred procedure for the new ghm based on three principles 1 an internally consistent model is preferable to a model without internal consistency 2 it is desirable for a calibration procedure to minimize variations in output between optimal parameterizations 3 a methodology with fewer data requirements is preferable to one with more accordingly we favor the fully coupled model calibrated with glacier dynamics and thinning rates as a target observation method z for projecting hydrology in a partially glacierized basin as it is the fully coupled model with the fewest data requirements and also leads to the tightest overall constraint of the four streamflow properties analyzed tables 3 5 our study has been primarily focused on one fully coupled ghm applied to a single site with limited observations we therefore do not recommend a direct application of our findings to other glacio hydrological studies rather we suggest viewing our work as an example highlighting the importance of calibration techniques and their associate uncertainties in ghm simulations based on our findings we advocate additional research involving a variety of models study sites and observations is needed to better codify best practices for ghm calibration projection credit authorship contribution statement kai tsuruta conceptualization

8552,a robust multi functional framework for widespread planning of nature based solutions nbs must incorporate components of social equity and hydro environmental performance in a cost effective manner nbs systems address stormwater mitigation by increasing on site infiltration and evaporation through enhanced greenspace while also improving various components of societal well being such as physical health e g heart disease diabetes mental health e g post traumatic stress disorder depression and social cohesion however current optimization tools for nbs systems rely on stormwater quantity abatement and to a lesser extent economic costs and environmental pollutant mitigation therefore the objective of this study is to explore how nbs planning may be improved to maximize hydrological environmental and social co benefits in an unequivocal and equitable manner here a novel equity based indexing framework is proposed to better understand how we might optimize social and physical functionalities of nbs systems as a function of transdisciplinary characteristics specifically this study explores the spatial tradeoffs associated with nbs allocation by first optimizing a local watershed scale model according to traditional metrics of stormwater efficacy e g cost efficiency hydrological runoff reduction and pollutant load reduction using swmm modeling the statistical dispersion of social health is then identified using the area deprivation index adi which is a high resolution spatial account of socioeconomic disadvantages that have been linked to adverse health outcomes according to united states census properties as nbss have been shown to mitigate various adverse health conditions through increased urban greening this improved understanding of geospatial health characteristics may be leveraged to inform an explicit representation of social wellness within nbs planning frameworks this study presents and demonstrates a novel framework for integrating hydro environmental modeling economic efficiency and social health deprivation using a dimensionless gini coefficient which is intended to spur the positive connection of social and physical influences within robust nbs planning hydro environmental risk according to hydro dynamic modeling and social disparity according to adi distribution are combined within a common measurement unit to capture variation across spatial domains and to optimize fair distribution across the study area a comparison between traditional swmm based optimization and the proposed gini based framework reveals how the spatial allocation of nbss within the watershed may be structured to address significantly more areas of social health deprivation while achieving similar hydro environmental performance and cost efficiency the results of a case study for nbs planning in the white oak bayou watershed in houston texas usa revealed runoff volume reductions of 3 45 and 3 38 pollutant load reductions of 11 15 and 11 28 and adi mitigation metrics of 16 84 and 35 32 for the swmm based and the gini based approaches respectively according to similar cost expenditures as such the proposed framework enables an analytical approach for balancing the spatial tradeoffs of overlapping human water goals in nbs planning while maintaining hydro environmental robustness and economic efficiency keywords area deprivation index adi gini coefficient low impact development multi objective optimization storm water management model swmm social equity 1 introduction renewed global mandates have encouraged a proliferation of nature based solutions nbss to deliver intersectoral functions of hydrological abatement social well being e g mental and physical health sense of place vulnerability and environmental health according to unep 2019 widespread use of nbss could help offset the negative consequences of climate change by addressing several united nations sustainable development goals concurrently including improved social well being food security ecosystem restoration and hydro meteorological hazard reduction when planning for such overlapping benefits there will exist inherent tradeoffs between spatial priority and functionality that must be considered as such nbs optimization requires examining a range of transdisciplinary characteristics among human and physical domains to maximize the synergies between social equity and hydro environmental performance frantzeskaki et al 2019 nbss have evolved within the literature to encompass the urban drainage concepts of green infrastructure gi low impact development lid best management practices bmps sustainable urban drainage systems suds water sensitive urban design wsud and blue green infrastructure bgi ruangpan et al 2020 at the local scale i e laboratory plot neighborhood scale nbs technologies have shown great promise in addressing stormwater abatement goals by improving peak runoff and attenuation reducing hydrological flashiness improving occurrence of combined sewer overflows and reducing water contaminants boano et al 2020 jato espino et al 2016 kabisch et al 2016 loperfido et al 2014 ruangpan et al 2020 however nbss are unlike traditional stormwater infrastructure due to regular human interaction with greenspaces by increasing levels of urban vegetation nbss have been linked to a reduction in mortality gascon et al 2016 cardiovascular diseases astell burt and feng 2021 diabetes cancer mitchell and popham 2008 mental disorders van den berg et al 2010 and respiratory diseases fuertes et al 2014 which are disproportionately higher among racial and ethnic minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged luck et al 2009 nbss have also been shown to enhance social cohesion through improved recreational opportunities kaczynski and henderson 2007 reduced crime rates branas et al 2011 increased land values vandermeulen et al 2011 and enriched meeting spaces de vries et al 2003 consideration of social co benefits has been increasingly valued throughout the nbs literature for example wolch et al 2014 highlighted the need to consider social enhancement during urban planning of green infrastructure in addition to environmental sustainability studies have also shown that attitudes regarding nbss are improved when stakeholders can readily identify how nbs solutions will benefit their locale according to both stormwater performance and societal improvement liu and jensen 2018 sarabi et al 2020 wamsler et al 2020 therefore nbs adoption depends partly on recognizing the unique spatial distribution of social characteristics in a given locale and identifying how the allocation of nbs features would address areas of highest impact spatial characteristics of nbs co benefits are often planned at the preliminary stage using data overlay methods for defining hot spots of multiple functions for example meerow and newell 2017 integrated social vulnerability air quality landscape connectivity and urban heat island effects for nbs planning through visualization of geospatial characteristics while flood risk was estimated using historical flood events and a simplified runoff coefficient i e using the rational method to estimate runoff from land use data similarly the london green infrastructure focus map gifp was designed for stakeholder prioritization

spatial data overlay approaches for identifying areas of social vulnerability when prioritizing nbs allocation in urban planning e g heckert and rosan 2016 jessup et al 2021 la rosa and pappalardo 2020 wong and montalto 2020 integrated social co benefits with physical watershed performance through geospatial characteristics and agent based modeling while such studies have highlighted the need to consider social characteristics at the early stages of nbs planning they do not contain robust analysis of hydro environmental performance conversely two dimensional modeling programs are often used to assess nbs hydro dynamics for localized planning e g swmm sustain mike urban where numerous studies have been conducted to analyze hydrograph characteristics of nbs implementation with varying results regarding optimal performance e g huang et al 2019 jarden et al 2016 jato espino et al 2016 radinja et al 2019 zellner et al 2016 such high resolution techniques are important in assessing nbs performance due to the unique mechanisms associated with interacting zones of vegetation soil and land surface in a water balance model further detailed in si text s 1 as two dimensional modeling is computationally expensive various optimization tools have been developed to simulate and compare allocation schemes for identifying the ideal placement of nbs features as a function of cost and performance e g lee et al 2012 macro et al 2019 sfei 2018 many studies have coupled the popular nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii with hydro dynamic modeling to analyze the tradeoffs between nbs performance and cost alamdari and sample 2019 giacomoni and joseph 2017 krebs et al 2013 mani et al 2019 muleta and boulos 2007 oraei zare et al 2012 raei et al 2019 tao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 while these decision support tools have successfully combined high resolution modeling with optimization techniques they lack assessment of the unique spatial exposures of social characteristics that could benefit from nbs implementation by relying on multi functional data overlays or complex modelling tools such planning may fail to allocate nbss throughout space in a manner that fully espouses social needs while maintaining hydro dynamic rigor kandakoglu et al 2019 in this way nbs plans may not realize the full locational benefits available thus limiting their maximum potential to mitigate cross cutting issues within the urban fabric here a novel equity based indexing framework is proposed to better understand how we might optimize transdisciplinary characteristics of nbs systems specifically this study explores the spatial tradeoffs associated with nbs allocation by first optimizing a local watershed scale model according to traditional metrics of performance e g cost efficiency hydrological runoff reduction and pollutant load reduction using swmm software and nsga ii optimization the statistical dispersion of social health is then identified using the area deprivation index adi which is a high resolution spatial account of socioeconomics disadvantages that have been linked to adverse health outcomes according to united states census characteristics the adi is incorporated into the optimization scheme using a novel area based gini coefficient to combine the hydro environmental performance of nbs siting with social characteristics across space the gini coefficient is a statistical representation of inequality across a population commonly used within the social sciences to assess the degree of income equality between disparate locations gini 1912 by extending the gini coefficient to represent hydrological efficacy and social impact this study provides a novel means for allocating nbss according to both their physical performance and also the locational characteristics of persons that would be influenced by varying spatial arrangements the proposed gini based framework provides a common dimensionless measurement unit for capturing transdisciplinary variations across space to spur the positive connection of social and physical influences associated with nbs systems while maintaining hydro dynamic rigor 2 materials and methods 2 1 white oak bayou case study the white oak bayou wob in houston texas usa was chosen as the case study due to its history of flooding sipes and zeve 2012 and its potential for improving various metrics of social deprivation through enhanced levels of greenspace including reduced morbidity and risk of disease increased mental health of residents and improved levels of environmental and economic prosperity c40 2017 crompton 2012 current stormwater management within the study area is based on a worst first framework despart 2019 where hydrological improvements are prioritized according to flood risk reduction and the number of persons benefited irrespective of their socioeconomic conditions such frameworks do not address inherent vulnerabilities within the population served to consider human aspects such as ability to recover from a storm or the reinforcing impacts of hydro environmental hazards on social health as such the adi is adopted as a spatial representation of social deprivation throughout the watershed to highlight areas of greatest potential health benefit when planning multi functional nbss 2 2 area deprivation index the adi was introduced in 2016 as a proxy indicator of socioeconomic status from census results that were curated to reflect risk factors associated with long term health and social well being knighton et al 2016 the adi has been used within the medical literature to measure social determinants that have been shown to influence public health issues such as cancer rates kurani et al 2020 hospital admissions hirshberg et al 2019 ingraham et al 2021 asthma nkoy et al 2018 obesity ludwig et al 2011 diabetes addala et al 2021 mental health martikainen et al 2004 and mortality chamberlain et al 2020 singh 2003 each of which are positively impacted by nbs systems van den bosch and ode sang 2017 the adi merges characteristics of income employment education and housing from the united states census to represent social disadvantage kind and buckingham 2018 which have been shown to collectively influence communal health link and phelan 1995 an advantage of using the adi for nbs planning as opposed to other social indices involves its highly granular geospatial scale the adi provides a unique measurement of social deprivation for each census block group within the united states other standard metrics of social vulnerability such as the center for disease control cdc social vulnerability index sovi flanagan et al 2020 are delineated at the census tract scale thereby lacking spatial heterogeneity to assess key differences at the neighborhood scale note census tracts are subdivisions of counties encompassing approximately 4 000 residents within each bound block groups are subdivisions of census tracts encompassing approximately 250 550 housing units each demarcated by local streets schlossberg 2003 the adi for the study area was downloaded from the university of wisconsin s neighborhood atlas for year 2019 kind and buckingham 2018 the weighted adi values within each spatial unit are represented at the national level by a percentile 1 100 and at the state level by a decile 1 10 with lower values denoting greater disadvantage university of wisconsin school of medicine and public 2019 for example an adi value of 1 on the national scale represents an area that is more disadvantaged than the remaining 99 of census blocks within the nation at the state scale an adi of 1 implies that the given census block is more disadvantaged than 90 of the other census blocks within that state here the national level adi was used to depict spatial variation of social deprivation throughout the wob watershed fig 1 2 3 hydro environmental swmm model 2 3 1 hydrological modeling the basin model for the wob watershed was initialized using the hms prepro tool which rapidly delineates a watershed into subcatchments according to the local terrain connects hydrological topology in a format consistent with standard hydrological modeling software and estimates common hydrological parameters to represent basin infiltration runoff and channelized flow routing castro and maidment 2020 the green ampt method was used to represent infiltration losses within each subcatchment according to local empirical values used in fema effective hydrology models for the wob watershed hcfcd 2019 initial content 0 067 saturated content 0 46 suction 3 553 in conductivity 0 032 in hour the swmm software routes overland flow to the subcatchment outlet using a property called the characteristic width which is defined as the subcatchment area divided by the average maximum overland flow length rossman and huber 2016 the longest flow path for each subcatchment was calculated in hms prepro according to 2018 lidar at 10 centimeter resolution tnris 2019 the time of concentration for each subcatchment was calculated using the tr 55 methodology for urban watersheds usda 1986 other principal inputs for modeling subcatchments in swmm included average land use impervious coverage subcatchment area and terrain slope which were each estimated using hms prepro pcswmm version 7 4 3240 hamouz et al 2020 which is a proprietary software designed as a user friendly interface to the environmental protection agency epa swmm program was used to convert the preliminary basin into a swmm model to route flow through the watershed stream network the pcswmm transect tool was used to create average cross sections for each system channel from the 2018 lidar elevation model chi 2014 design storm data for the houston region was obtained from barrett 2019 and coh 2019a to represented the latest atlas 14 precipitation frequency estimates in texas according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa perica et al 2018 the rainfall intensity values for the houston area were used to develop intensity duration frequency idf curves in pcswmm for varying annual exceedance probability aep storm events summarized in table s 1 2 3 2 pollutant load modeling the event mean concentration emc method was used to estimate non point water pollution within each subcatchment according to 1 emc i c i q i d t q i d t where emc i is the event mean concentration c i is the standard concentration of a target pollutant and q i is the runoff volume for each subcatchment i changing over simulation time t local stormwater monitoring data was obtained from the national stormwater quality database nsqd which contains public water quality metadata from over 9 000 runoff events for approximately 200 municipalities in the united states including 41 monitoring stations within harris county texas pitt et al 2015 since the greenplan it algorithm searches for the most cost effective solution according to an individual pollutant type further described in section 2 4 total suspended solids tss were chosen as the criteria pollutant due to the strong adsorption effects of tss on other contaminants liu et al 2019 rossi et al 2006 tss concentrations were obtained for various land use types within the nsqd and averaged for each wob subcatchment the land use values in the wob basin model were obtained from the 2016 national land cover database nlcd which contains 16 unique land classifications based on the modified anderson level ii scheme yang et al 2018 the removal efficiency for each of the nbs features in this study were obtained from the 2020 international stormwater bmp database clary et al 2020 summarized in table s 2 2 3 3 nbs water balance modeling epa s swmm engine calculates the water balance for nbs driven systems using a nonlinear reservoir model chen and shubinski 1971 according to a unique set of infiltration storage and evaporation properties that describe on a per unit area basis how nbs structures impact hydrological behavior further described in si text s 1 within nbs systems the surface zone represents the ground surface which stores excess inflow and generates outflow either overland or to an adjacent drainage system the soil zone is comprised of an engineered soil mixture that allows water to percolate into the underlying zone which may consist of rock and gravel for additional storage the underdrain system conveys water out of the storage layer and into an engineered outlet the three nbs features used in this case study bioretention cells porous pavement and tree boxes are summarized in table s 3 as a function of their representative water balance layers in the wob case study tree boxes were modeled as bioretention cells with no outflow drain various input parameters are also required within a swmm model to describe the engineered design of local nbs features e g conductivity rate vegetation volume clogging properties surface roughness etc which were obtained from the city of houston design guidelines for low impact development coh 2019b and summarized in table s 4 2 3 4 calibration validation the hydrological basin parameters were calibrated to observed streamflow measurements from united states geological survey usgs stream gauges 08074020 and 08074500 usgs 2021a usgs 2021b one year of daily precipitation values were obtained from the harris county flood warning system hcfws precipitation gauges 530 535 550 555 560 570 582 590 and 595 hcfcd 2021 encompassing the totality of the white oak bayou fig 2 a the first six months of precipitation data october 2 2020 march 2 2021 were used to calibrate the model while the latter six months of data march 3 2021 august 2 2021 were used to validate the model the annual set of hydrographs for the basin model was disaggregated for wet weather conditions with a criterion of at least 500 cfs flow for a minimum of 4 consecutive hours resulting in ten unique storm events for calibration and eight unique storm events for validation the wet weather flow hydrographs were calibrated using the pcswmm srtc tool by selecting uncertainties for control parameters based on their data source and sensitivity gradient per guidelines proposed by choi and ball 2002 and james 2003 the basin model was then simulated with the calibrated parameters and compared to observed streamflow to measure the goodness of fit using the integrated square error ise further described in si text s 2 model calibration and validation results are detailed in the supplementary materials tables s 5 s 6 and fig s 2 2 4 spatial allocation optimization the decision support tool greenplan it was used to optimize nbs siting within the calibrated model according to levels of runoff reduction pollutant load abatement and cost effectiveness wu et al 2019 by coupling the nsga ii algorithm with swmm sfei 2018 this optimization tool compares the performance of various nbs strategies to the baseline scenario which represents watershed conditions prior to nbs implementation model performance is defined by three objectives 1 minimizing the total relative cost expenditures for nbs implementation 2 maximizing the reduction in hydrological runoff volume and 3 maximizing abatement of pollutant loadings within the study area the greenplan it package combines several unique tools that operate in succession to identify the optimal spatial allocation of nbs features within the study area including 1 gis based site locator tool slt merges spatial characteristics of nbs feature types with regional geospatial information to identify all possible nbs siting locations within the study area 2 epa swmm basin model establishes baseline conditions for runoff and pollutant loadings throughout the study area and simulates proposed conditions according to unique nbs siting schemes and 3 greenplan it optimization tool gpot an executable file that runs through the user s command prompt to identify optimal combinations of nbs types within each catchment area according to a cost benefit analysis where cost targets are defined by the user and benefits are calculated using swmm simulations to assess the reduction in stormwater runoff and pollutant loading over many nbs configurations the slt was used to identify all potential locations of nbs features within the wob watershed as shown in fig 2 b potential locations for bioretention cells permeable pavement and tree boxes were defined according to open space land use parcels areas of existing pavement and adjacent land near existing sidewalks respectively corresponding data layers were obtained from the city of houston gis data hub coh 2021 baseline flows and tss loadings were quantified within the swmm model for various design storm events as described in sections 2 3 1 2 3 2 the slt output then served as a spatial constraint for the gpot which executed several thousand swmm models according to unique spatial allocations of nbs features within the permissible areas i e the shaded areas shown in fig 2 b relative cost estimates for the case study were obtained from the epa national stormwater calculator nswc which provides annual costs for nbs implementation and maintenance within unique geographical regions cnt 2009 at the time of study the nswc cost estimates for the houston area included pervious pavement 8 68 sf bioretention cells 6 07 sf and tree planter boxes 9 46 sf bernagros et al 2021 the gpot used two input files to compare nbs scenarios with the baseline swmm model the first input file contained the total acreage percent impervious coverage and maximum number of nbs locations per subcatchment as summarized in table s 7 the second input file described average sizing parameters proposed by sfei 2018 where bioretention cells pervious pavements and treeboxes were assigned uniform areas and widths of 500 sf by 20 ft 5000 sf by 50 ft and 60 sf by 6 ft respectively the gpot searches for the optimal solution among numerous possible scenarios by first modeling a random set of nbs placements and comparing their outputs for non dominance according to the nsga ii algorithm deb et al 2002 non dominance occurs when a solution performs no worse than any other solution for all objectives e g cost runoff and pollutant load efficiency and also performs better than all other solutions within the cohort for at least one objective this cohort known as a generation sorts each of the sub routines within the series known as a population using the previous generation s non dominant solutions and relative populations until the system either reaches a maximum number of simulations or until no further changes are observed the greenplan it tool for the wob case study used a threshold of 100 generations and 250 populations for a maximum of 25 000 unique configurations the gpot outputs were plotted as a function of cost x axis and runoff load reduction y axes to assess the cost efficiency of hydro dynamic performance among many possible siting plans the resulting graphs contained a set of all quasi optimal solutions for nbs spatial allocation according to the targets on the plotted axes known collectively as the pareto set through the nsga ii algorithm the pareto set converged to identify the optimal allocation of nbss along a cost efficiency curve also known as the pareto curve or pareto front where no further improvements could be made through reallocation of nbs features wu et al 2019 2 5 multi objective gini index the gini coefficient is a common index used in economics to describe the statistical dispersion of income and population within a sample group in a perfectly equal society the distribution of income x axis would match the distribution of population y axis known as the line of equality in fig 3 in a more realistic scenario the cumulative percentage of population versus household income often follows an exponential distribution called the lorenz curve which delineates state spaces a e g the inequality gap and b e g the actual income distribution described graphically by 2 gini a a b where a represents the total area between the line of equality and the lorenz curve distribution and b represents the area between the lorenz curve and the base axis a numerical form of the gini coefficient g i is given by 3 g i 1 i 1 i y i y i 1 x i x i 1 where x i is the cumulative percentage of the variable on the x axis and y i is the cumulative percentage of the variable on the y axis for data point i from i 1 to i i total data points gini values range from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates absolute equality and 1 represents absolute inequality due to the popularity of the gini coefficient to quickly identify statistical differences in distribution studies have begun applying this economic concept to issues of energy appropriation jacobson et al 2005 saboohi 2001 environmental inequity boyce et al 2016 heerink et al 2001 white 2007 water resources distribution cho and lee 2014 du et al 2021 hu et al 2016 yan et al 2018 flood drainage rights zhang et al 2020 and other topics regarding allocation of limited natural resources josa and aguado 2020 in the environmental literature recent applications have emerged to represent the gini axes spatially using the area based gini ar gini which compares social metrics calculated on an area basis to a distributed good calculated on a resource basis druckman and jackson 2008 an example of using the ar gini coefficient beyond the traditional scope of economic wealth disparity is given by sun et al 2010 where wastewater discharge permitting was optimized using the gini index and a multi criteria assessment of land population income and environmental capacity in this study the conflict between wastewater efficiency and social equality was bridged by balancing tradeoffs between various policy making goals amidst limited resources sun et al 2010 the ar gini is extended here to consider the spatial patterns of nbs allocation and performance with the distribution of social characteristics the cumulative area of nbs allocation is plotted on the gini y axis as a proportion of subcatchment area normalized on a scale from 0 to 100 unique evaluation indicators e g stormwater runoff stormwater quality and social equity are then plotted on the gini x axes such that each potential nbs scheme contains three different gini indices hydrological efficiency is represented as the percent difference of stormwater runoff volume between baseline and optimized conditions as a function of cost environmental efficiency is described as the percent difference of pollutant load abatement between baseline and optimized conditions on the basis of cost social equity is a function of the average neighborhood disadvantage i e adi score over the weighted area of nbs allocation within each subcatchment the individual gini indices are combined to derive a single dimensionless coefficient for transdisciplinary planning a high composite gini coefficient would suggest that the distribution of nbss is skewed toward either hydro environmental efficiency or social equity and does not maximize spatial allocation according to all three characteristics a low composite gini coefficient would reveal an ideal state space of nbs distribution that achieves maximum hydro environmental performance while siting nbs features in locations with the greatest potential for social health improvement the following equations are used in deriving the individual gini indices 4 ω i j 1 n z ji a j where ω i is the allocation of nbs area per subcatchment i n is number of unique nbs feature types j bioretention cells porous pavements or tree boxes z is the number nbss per subcatchment a j is the area of each nbs feature type a j bioretention cells 500 sf porous pavements 5 000 sf tree boxes 60 sf 5 η h e i a i b i a i 100 ω i c j where η i is the percent efficiency of hydrologic h and environmental e improvement between the baseline model a and the optimized model b for each subcatchment i normalized by the cost of nbs features c j c j 6 07 sf 8 68 sf 9 46 sf for j bioretention cells porous pavements and tree boxes respectively note a and b represent the total stormwater runoff volume vr in million gallons for hydrologic efficiency h and the total pollutant load runoff tss in lbs for environmental efficiency e obtained from swmm modeling and 6 μ si adi i i 1 m ω i where μ si is the percent of nbss sited within areas of high adi normalized by subcatchments area ω i for all subcatchments m and the social inequality within the subcatchment is measured by the average spatial adi score within each subcatchment i to eliminate differences in measurement units and magnitudes among evaluation choices each indicator is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100 per 7 x x x min x max x min 100 where x is the normalized value of each x hydrologic efficiency η hi environmental efficiency η ei and social equity μ si consequently the sum of the normalization series for each lorenz curve axis is 100 the

relative to cost 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydro environmental optimization the 2 5 and 100 year rainfall events were chosen as representative design storms for demonstrating the swmm based optimization of the wob model as demonstrated in fig 4 an example of planning for nbs expenditure of 1 000 m is shown in the dashed lines where the optimal pareto front results in a flow reduction of 3 22 3 62 and 4 37 and a tss pollutant load reduction 11 69 11 65 and 9 55 of for the 2 5 and 100 year design storms respectively the cost effectiveness curves i e the pareto fronts suggest there exists a largely linear relationship between the level of nbs implementation and tss pollutant load reduction between the 2 year and 5 year design storms as noted in fig 4 the runoff volume and pollutant load efficiencies are inverted relative to design storm intensity higher cost expenditures are associated with a greater number of nbs features for mitigating larger volumes of rainfall runoff since pollutant loading concentrations are a function of land use the percent change in wash off is not significantly impacted by rainfall values consequently the cost efficiency for pollutant load reduction decreases as the design storm intensity and thus nbs magnitude increases note the greenplan it tool presents optimization results in monetary units of million which were maintained for purposes of this case study the cost effectiveness curves in fig 4 inform which generation and population models provide the most efficient hydro environmental outcomes from the 25 000 scenarios that were simulated in swmm decision makers can use these results to determine optimal nbs planning according to target expenditures by assessing the far right portion of the pareto front stakeholders may identify at which point further investment in nbs features yield no additional improvement in hydro environmental goals as such hydrologic and environmental goals may be compared and contrasted between scenarios as a function of cost distribution and intensity of design storm metrics sfei 2020 for example if decision makers had a goal of reducing the 100 yr runoff by 5 equating to a total cost of 1 187 m on the pareto front curve in fig 4 a stakeholders could quickly visualize the flow reduction efficiency for additional design storms and the tradeoffs associated with pollutant load abatement at this cost point to demonstrate how such optimization outputs may be combined with the multi objective gini coefficient the 5 yr storm event with 1 000 m expenditure was chosen for further investigation in the swmm based approach generation 97 population 117 produced the most optimal nbs allocation scenario according to hydro environmental efficiency i e 3 45 runoff volume reduction and 11 15 pollutant load reduction in comparing the spatial distribution of nbss from this model with the areas of highest social deprivation in the wob watershed fig 5 a b we may note how sole reliance upon hydro environmental characteristics for nbs planning could result in a missed opportunity to address potential social co benefits from enhanced urban greening as such the multi objective gini coefficient is explored in the following section to refine the nbs optimization results 3 2 gini based optimization by plotting the lorenz curves for the swmm based optimization model generation 97 population 117 in fig 6 the individual gini indices according to hydrologic efficiency pollutant load efficiency and social equity were calculated as 0 17 0 10 and 0 46 respectively a gini coefficient less than or equal to 0 4 is commonly used as a threshold denoting fair distribution between the indicators on the x and y axes of the lorenz curve groves kirkby et al 2009 sadras and bongiovanni 2004 such results suggest a greater equity in nbs allocation on the basis of hydrodynamics compared with social characteristics the large area between the lorenz curve and the line of equality in fig 6 b reveals poor allocation fairness corresponding to spatial distribution of neighborhood deprivation i e the adi index as such the framework presented here suggests amalgamating each of the individual gini indices g i to achieve a minimal composite gini g e toward a more equitable distribution of all evaluation indicators a sample set of outputs from the swmm based optimization was selected to demonstrate how the principal allocation scheme may shift when the multi objective gini coefficient is applied as shown in fig 7 and summarized in table 1 a cohort of 10 additional nbs planning scenarios were evaluated on the basis of the gini coefficient for hydrologic environmental and social indicators the construction of multi objective lorenz curves is demonstrated as the plotting of cumulative nbs spatial allocation against cumulative evaluation indicators allowing for rapid comparison across planning scenarios a larger area below the lorenz curve suggests that the stormwater and social benefits are more variable within the planning paradigm while a smaller area under the curve indicates a more uniform distribution of spatial planning for achieving multiple objectives by comparing the width of the lorenz curves and minimizing the composite gini coefficient between these scenarios the greatest distribution of equality occurs in planning scenario generation 22 population 246 g e 0 229 the gini based plan provides a more equal distribution of overall benefits in comparison to the swmm based optimization model generation 97 population 117 g e 0 243 despite a similar investment in financial resources while the improvement in the composite gini coefficient may appear modest a detailed comparison between the optimization frameworks reveals a significant difference of nbs allocation in areas of greatest social need i e high adi score as summarized in table 2 the swmm based model only addresses 16 84 of the socially deprived areas when nbs features are sited for optimal hydro environmental performance by altering the composition of nbs features throughout the watershed the gini based plan addresses 35 32 of the weighted adi score within each subcatchment while maintaining similar runoff and pollutant load reductions this difference in social equity is further demonstrated in fig 5 c d where the swmm based and gini based models are compared spatially according to total nbs allocation and the corresponding proportion of nbs features to adi deprivation the holistic distribution of nbs co benefits is shown in fig 8 where the pie charts represent the weighted efficiency achieved in each subcatchment according to hydrologic blue environmental orange and social green aspects as observed in fig 8 a the swmm based model generation 97 population 117 exhibits a high proportion of blue and orange areas throughout the wob watershed highlighting prioritization of hydro environmental performance conversely fig 8 b generation 22 population 246 contains a greater proportion of green areas thereby revealing a greater influence of nbs allocation within socially vulnerable subcatchments the primary reason for this disparity is that areas prone to flooding and environmental issues are not always spatially proportional to areas of highest social deprivation as such reliance upon a worst first approach to nbs planning through the lens of hydro dynamic modeling may result in non optimal allocation for addressing the many societal benefits provided by nbs solutions 4 limitations it should be noted that the gini coefficient is sensitive to outliers by its nature as the gini is a summary statistic information may be lost when disparate datasets are combined and an extreme value in one region of the graph can greatly impact the overall results in other words by converting all data along the lorenz curve to a single number disparate planning scenarios may result in a similar gini coefficient de maio 2007 as the gini coefficient s sensitivity is related to the survey sample size and spatial resolution boyce et al 2016 fabrizi and trivisano 2016 giorgi and gigliarano 2017 this study attempted to overcome such limitations by choosing a high resolution measure of national social inequality i e the adi and a robust measure of hydrologic performance according to detailed swmm modeling while outside the scope of this study comparison of the spatial gini coefficient to other measures of inequality and their sensitivity to outliers of which many are presented throughout the literature e g boyce et al 2016 cobham and sumner 2013 cowell and flachaire 2002 sangüesa et al 2018 is a worthwhile avenue of future research in amalgamating social inequality with environmental performance 5 conclusion in the age of the anthropocene where hydrologic environmental and social processes are being influenced and altered by human patterns nbss serve as a prime foundation for exploring linkages between quality of life goals and water challenges nbs design is a function of rapid urban development social wellbeing and a scarcity of resources for addressing hydro meteorological challenges as such proper co development of nbs plans can and should account for the multi functional components involved in all of these processes for optimal impact to amalgamate such inter woven goals decision makers seek the ability to identify priority planning areas that guide equitable investment marchese et al 2018 in considering the rising popularity of urban green infrastructure we are presented with an opportunity to re cast how decision making operates in order to maximize the numerous co benefits associated with nbss as such this study demonstrates how real world social and hydro environmental complexities may be amalgamated using a novel application of the area gini coefficient for actionable science the gini index is a straightforward calculation that could be used to merge holistic benefits using simple algebra since the coefficient of derivation under the lorenz curve is calculated as a standard deviation variation is relative and thus invariant to changes in spatial scale in other words the gini index provides a transparent measurement tool to describe the summary of impact fractions for multi objective planning at cascading scales lee 1997 by solely relying on hydro environmental modeling the relative benefits addressed by nbs solutions are limited and are not able to be optimized according to unique properties of socioeconomics and human health this study is the first known attempt to incorporate nbs synergies and tradeoffs between hydrology social health deprivation environmental quality and cost efficiency into a single framework using the dimensionless gini coefficient the white oak bayou case study investigated how social equity and watershed dynamics propagate throughout the nbs system according to 25 000 swmm model runs a comparison between traditional swmm based optimization and the proposed gini based framework revealed how the spatial allocation of nbss within the watershed may be structured to address significantly more areas of social health deprivation while achieving similar hydro environmental performance and cost efficiency the case study comparison revealed runoff volume reductions of 3 45 and 3 38 pollutant load reductions of 11 15 and 11 28 and adi mitigation metrics of 16 84 and 35 32 for the swmm based and the gini based approaches respectively using similar cost expenditures by constructing the optimization framework with interdisciplinary elements this study strengthened the planning capabilities associated with overlapping social and hydro dynamic processes and patterns by approaching the system as a linkage of spatial properties this study highlighted synergies associated with multiple human water objectives thereby reducing the potential for systemic underperformance marchese et al 2018 moreover by integrating various epistemologies this analytical approach serves as a representation of complex landscape functionalities and their unique interactions as we continue to have increasing access to high resolution datasets the spatial gini coefficient maximizes our understanding of local risks and benefits to answer challenging questions associated with multi functional planning the practical implications of this study will enhance the user friendliness of nbs planning in an intuitive manner while merging well established hydrological methodologies with social co benefits kuller et al 2017 when we are better able to connect the dots between social constructs environmental processes and the hydrological cycle which are all complex processes that operate cohesively amongst one another we can establish optimal patterns within the seemingly chaotic network of human water phenomena in a world with increasing socio environmental stressors and finite resources this research will improve public policy interventions by providing the knowledge necessary for identifying quantifying and linking complex interactions of nbs functions toward sound

8552,a robust multi functional framework for widespread planning of nature based solutions nbs must incorporate components of social equity and hydro environmental performance in a cost effective manner nbs systems address stormwater mitigation by increasing on site infiltration and evaporation through enhanced greenspace while also improving various components of societal well being such as physical health e g heart disease diabetes mental health e g post traumatic stress disorder depression and social cohesion however current optimization tools for nbs systems rely on stormwater quantity abatement and to a lesser extent economic costs and environmental pollutant mitigation therefore the objective of this study is to explore how nbs planning may be improved to maximize hydrological environmental and social co benefits in an unequivocal and equitable manner here a novel equity based indexing framework is proposed to better understand how we might optimize social and physical functionalities of nbs systems as a function of transdisciplinary characteristics specifically this study explores the spatial tradeoffs associated with nbs allocation by first optimizing a local watershed scale model according to traditional metrics of stormwater efficacy e g cost efficiency hydrological runoff reduction and pollutant load reduction using swmm modeling the statistical dispersion of social health is then identified using the area deprivation index adi which is a high resolution spatial account of socioeconomic disadvantages that have been linked to adverse health outcomes according to united states census properties as nbss have been shown to mitigate various adverse health conditions through increased urban greening this improved understanding of geospatial health characteristics may be leveraged to inform an explicit representation of social wellness within nbs planning frameworks this study presents and demonstrates a novel framework for integrating hydro environmental modeling economic efficiency and social health deprivation using a dimensionless gini coefficient which is intended to spur the positive connection of social and physical influences within robust nbs planning hydro environmental risk according to hydro dynamic modeling and social disparity according to adi distribution are combined within a common measurement unit to capture variation across spatial domains and to optimize fair distribution across the study area a comparison between traditional swmm based optimization and the proposed gini based framework reveals how the spatial allocation of nbss within the watershed may be structured to address significantly more areas of social health deprivation while achieving similar hydro environmental performance and cost efficiency the results of a case study for nbs planning in the white oak bayou watershed in houston texas usa revealed runoff volume reductions of 3 45 and 3 38 pollutant load reductions of 11 15 and 11 28 and adi mitigation metrics of 16 84 and 35 32 for the swmm based and the gini based approaches respectively according to similar cost expenditures as such the proposed framework enables an analytical approach for balancing the spatial tradeoffs of overlapping human water goals in nbs planning while maintaining hydro environmental robustness and economic efficiency keywords area deprivation index adi gini coefficient low impact development multi objective optimization storm water management model swmm social equity 1 introduction renewed global mandates have encouraged a proliferation of nature based solutions nbss to deliver intersectoral functions of hydrological abatement social well being e g mental and physical health sense of place vulnerability and environmental health according to unep 2019 widespread use of nbss could help offset the negative consequences of climate change by addressing several united nations sustainable development goals concurrently including improved social well being food security ecosystem restoration and hydro meteorological hazard reduction when planning for such overlapping benefits there will exist inherent tradeoffs between spatial priority and functionality that must be considered as such nbs optimization requires examining a range of transdisciplinary characteristics among human and physical domains to maximize the synergies between social equity and hydro environmental performance frantzeskaki et al 2019 nbss have evolved within the literature to encompass the urban drainage concepts of green infrastructure gi low impact development lid best management practices bmps sustainable urban drainage systems suds water sensitive urban design wsud and blue green infrastructure bgi ruangpan et al 2020 at the local scale i e laboratory plot neighborhood scale nbs technologies have shown great promise in addressing stormwater abatement goals by improving peak runoff and attenuation reducing hydrological flashiness improving occurrence of combined sewer overflows and reducing water contaminants boano et al 2020 jato espino et al 2016 kabisch et al 2016 loperfido et al 2014 ruangpan et al 2020 however nbss are unlike traditional stormwater infrastructure due to regular human interaction with greenspaces by increasing levels of urban vegetation nbss have been linked to a reduction in mortality gascon et al 2016 cardiovascular diseases astell burt and feng 2021 diabetes cancer mitchell and popham 2008 mental disorders van den berg et al 2010 and respiratory diseases fuertes et al 2014 which are disproportionately higher among racial and ethnic minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged luck et al 2009 nbss have also been shown to enhance social cohesion through improved recreational opportunities kaczynski and henderson 2007 reduced crime rates branas et al 2011 increased land values vandermeulen et al 2011 and enriched meeting spaces de vries et al 2003 consideration of social co benefits has been increasingly valued throughout the nbs literature for example wolch et al 2014 highlighted the need to consider social enhancement during urban planning of green infrastructure in addition to environmental sustainability studies have also shown that attitudes regarding nbss are improved when stakeholders can readily identify how nbs solutions will benefit their locale according to both stormwater performance and societal improvement liu and jensen 2018 sarabi et al 2020 wamsler et al 2020 therefore nbs adoption depends partly on recognizing the unique spatial distribution of social characteristics in a given locale and identifying how the allocation of nbs features would address areas of highest impact spatial characteristics of nbs co benefits are often planned at the preliminary stage using data overlay methods for defining hot spots of multiple functions for example meerow and newell 2017 integrated social vulnerability air quality landscape connectivity and urban heat island effects for nbs planning through visualization of geospatial characteristics while flood risk was estimated using historical flood events and a simplified runoff coefficient i e using the rational method to estimate runoff from land use data similarly the london green infrastructure focus map gifp was designed for stakeholder prioritization of preferred nbs benefits i e flood risk water quality air quality social vulnerability green space and heat island according to the perceived importance of each variable hydrologic factors were incorporated as pre defined maps of areas that typically flood i e 1 annual inundation boundary which were superimposed into a geospatial map for holistic planning gla 2018 other studies have employed spatial data overlay approaches for identifying areas of social vulnerability when prioritizing nbs allocation in urban planning e g heckert and rosan 2016 jessup et al 2021 la rosa and pappalardo 2020 wong and montalto 2020 integrated social co benefits with physical watershed performance through geospatial characteristics and agent based modeling while such studies have highlighted the need to consider social characteristics at the early stages of nbs planning they do not contain robust analysis of hydro environmental performance conversely two dimensional modeling programs are often used to assess nbs hydro dynamics for localized planning e g swmm sustain mike urban where numerous studies have been conducted to analyze hydrograph characteristics of nbs implementation with varying results regarding optimal performance e g huang et al 2019 jarden et al 2016 jato espino et al 2016 radinja et al 2019 zellner et al 2016 such high resolution techniques are important in assessing nbs performance due to the unique mechanisms associated with interacting zones of vegetation soil and land surface in a water balance model further detailed in si text s 1 as two dimensional modeling is computationally expensive various optimization tools have been developed to simulate and compare allocation schemes for identifying the ideal placement of nbs features as a function of cost and performance e g lee et al 2012 macro et al 2019 sfei 2018 many studies have coupled the popular nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii with hydro dynamic modeling to analyze the tradeoffs between nbs performance and cost alamdari and sample 2019 giacomoni and joseph 2017 krebs et al 2013 mani et al 2019 muleta and boulos 2007 oraei zare et al 2012 raei et al 2019 tao et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 while these decision support tools have successfully combined high resolution modeling with optimization techniques they lack assessment of the unique spatial exposures of social characteristics that could benefit from nbs implementation by relying on multi functional data overlays or complex modelling tools such planning may fail to allocate nbss throughout space in a manner that fully espouses social needs while maintaining hydro dynamic rigor kandakoglu et al 2019 in this way nbs plans may not realize the full locational benefits available thus limiting their maximum potential to mitigate cross cutting issues within the urban fabric here a novel equity based indexing framework is proposed to better understand how we might optimize transdisciplinary characteristics of nbs systems specifically this study explores the spatial tradeoffs associated with nbs allocation by first optimizing a local watershed scale model according to traditional metrics of performance e g cost efficiency hydrological runoff reduction and pollutant load reduction using swmm software and nsga ii optimization the statistical dispersion of social health is then identified using the area deprivation index adi which is a high resolution spatial account of socioeconomics disadvantages that have been linked to adverse health outcomes according to united states census characteristics the adi is incorporated into the optimization scheme using a novel area based gini coefficient to combine the hydro environmental performance of nbs siting with social characteristics across space the gini coefficient is a statistical representation of inequality across a population commonly used within the social sciences to assess the degree of income equality between disparate locations gini 1912 by extending the gini coefficient to represent hydrological efficacy and social impact this study provides a novel means for allocating nbss according to both their physical performance and also the locational characteristics of persons that would be influenced by varying spatial arrangements the proposed gini based framework provides a common dimensionless measurement unit for capturing transdisciplinary variations across space to spur the positive connection of social and physical influences associated with nbs systems while maintaining hydro dynamic rigor 2 materials and methods 2 1 white oak bayou case study the white oak bayou wob in houston texas usa was chosen as the case study due to its history of flooding sipes and zeve 2012 and its potential for improving various metrics of social deprivation through enhanced levels of greenspace including reduced morbidity and risk of disease increased mental health of residents and improved levels of environmental and economic prosperity c40 2017 crompton 2012 current stormwater management within the study area is based on a worst first framework despart 2019 where hydrological improvements are prioritized according to flood risk reduction and the number of persons benefited irrespective of their socioeconomic conditions such frameworks do not address inherent vulnerabilities within the population served to consider human aspects such as ability to recover from a storm or the reinforcing impacts of hydro environmental hazards on social health as such the adi is adopted as a spatial representation of social deprivation throughout the watershed to highlight areas of greatest potential health benefit when planning multi functional nbss 2 2 area deprivation index the adi was introduced in 2016 as a proxy indicator of socioeconomic status from census results that were curated to reflect risk factors associated with long term health and social well being knighton et al 2016 the adi has been used within the medical literature to measure social determinants that have been shown to influence public health issues such as cancer rates kurani et al 2020 hospital admissions hirshberg et al 2019 ingraham et al 2021 asthma nkoy et al 2018 obesity ludwig et al 2011 diabetes addala et al 2021 mental health martikainen et al 2004 and mortality chamberlain et al 2020 singh 2003 each of which are positively impacted by nbs systems van den bosch and ode sang 2017 the adi merges characteristics of income employment education and housing from the united states census to represent social disadvantage kind and buckingham 2018 which have been shown to collectively influence communal health link and phelan 1995 an advantage of using the adi for nbs planning as opposed to other social indices involves its highly granular geospatial scale the adi provides a unique measurement of social deprivation for each census block group within the united states other standard metrics of social vulnerability such as the center for disease control cdc social vulnerability index sovi flanagan et al 2020 are delineated at the census tract scale thereby lacking spatial heterogeneity to assess key differences at the neighborhood scale note census tracts are subdivisions of counties encompassing approximately 4 000 residents within each bound block groups are subdivisions of census tracts encompassing approximately 250 550 housing units each demarcated by local streets schlossberg 2003 the adi for the study area was downloaded from the university of wisconsin s neighborhood atlas for year 2019 kind and buckingham 2018 the weighted adi values within each spatial unit are represented at the national level by a percentile 1 100 and at the state level by a decile 1 10 with lower values denoting greater disadvantage university of wisconsin school of medicine and public 2019 for example an adi value of 1 on the national scale represents an area that is more disadvantaged than the remaining 99 of census blocks within the nation at the state scale an adi of 1 implies that the given census block is more disadvantaged than 90 of the other census blocks within that state here the national level adi was used to depict spatial variation of social deprivation throughout the wob watershed fig 1 2 3 hydro environmental swmm model 2 3 1 hydrological modeling the basin model for the wob watershed was initialized using the hms prepro tool which rapidly delineates a watershed into subcatchments according to the local terrain connects hydrological topology in a format consistent with standard hydrological modeling software and estimates common hydrological parameters to represent basin infiltration runoff and channelized flow routing castro and maidment 2020 the green ampt method was used to represent infiltration losses within each subcatchment according to local empirical values used in fema effective hydrology models for the wob watershed

hms prepro according to 2018 lidar at 10 centimeter resolution tnris 2019 the time of concentration for each subcatchment was calculated using the tr 55 methodology for urban watersheds usda 1986 other principal inputs for modeling subcatchments in swmm included average land use impervious coverage subcatchment area and terrain slope which were each estimated using hms prepro pcswmm version 7

000 runoff events for approximately 200 municipalities in the united states including 41 monitoring stations within harris county texas pitt et al 2015 since the greenplan it algorithm searches for the most cost effective solution according to an individual pollutant type further described in section 2 4 total suspended solids tss were chosen as the criteria pollutant due to the strong adsorption effects of tss on other contaminants liu et al 2019 rossi et al 2006 tss concentrations were obtained for various land use types within the nsqd and averaged for each wob subcatchment the land use values in the wob basin model were obtained from the 2016 national land cover database nlcd which contains 16 unique land classifications based on the modified anderson level ii scheme yang

balance modeling epa s swmm engine calculates the water balance for nbs driven systems using a nonlinear reservoir model chen and shubinski 1971 according to a unique set of infiltration storage and evaporation properties that describe on a per unit area basis how nbs structures impact hydrological behavior further described in si text s 1 within nbs systems the surface zone represents the ground surface which stores excess inflow and generates outflow either overland or to an adjacent drainage system the soil zone is comprised of an engineered soil mixture that allows water to percolate into the underlying zone which may consist of rock and gravel for additional storage the underdrain system conveys water out of the storage layer and into an engineered outlet the three nbs features used in this case study bioretention cells porous pavement and tree boxes are summarized in table s 3 as a function of their representative water balance layers in the wob case study tree boxes were

august 2 2021 were used to validate the model the annual set of hydrographs for the basin model was disaggregated for wet weather conditions with a criterion of at least 500 cfs flow for a minimum of 4 consecutive hours resulting in ten unique storm events for calibration and eight unique storm events for validation the wet weather flow hydrographs were calibrated using the pcswmm srtc tool by selecting uncertainties for control parameters based on their data source and sensitivity gradient per guidelines proposed by choi and ball 2002 and james 2003 the basin model was then simulated with the calibrated parameters and compared to observed streamflow to measure the goodness of fit using the integrated square error ise further described in si text s 2 model calibration and validation results are detailed in the supplementary materials tables s 5 s 6 and fig s 2 2 4 spatial allocation optimization the decision support tool greenplan it was used to optimize nbs siting within the calibrated model according to levels of runoff reduction pollutant load abatement and cost effectiveness wu et al 2019 by coupling the nsga ii algorithm with swmm sfei 2018 this optimization tool compares the performance of various nbs strategies to the baseline scenario which represents watershed conditions prior to nbs implementation model performance is defined by three objectives 1 minimizing the total relative cost expenditures for nbs implementation 2 maximizing the reduction in hydrological runoff volume and 3 maximizing abatement of pollutant loadings within the study area the greenplan it package combines several unique tools that operate in succession to identify the optimal spatial allocation of nbs features within the study area including 1 gis based site locator tool slt merges spatial characteristics of nbs feature types with regional geospatial information to identify all possible nbs siting locations within the study area 2 epa swmm basin model establishes baseline conditions for runoff and pollutant loadings throughout the study area and simulates proposed conditions according to unique nbs siting schemes and 3 greenplan it optimization tool gpot an executable file that runs through the user s command prompt to identify optimal combinations of nbs types within each catchment area according to a cost benefit analysis where cost targets are defined by the user and benefits are calculated using swmm simulations to assess the reduction in stormwater runoff and pollutant loading over many nbs configurations the slt was used to identify all potential locations of nbs features within the wob watershed as shown in fig 2 b potential locations for bioretention cells permeable pavement and tree boxes were defined according to open space land use parcels areas of existing pavement and adjacent land near existing sidewalks respectively corresponding data layers were obtained from the city of houston gis data hub coh 2021 baseline flows and tss loadings were quantified within the swmm model for various design storm events as described in sections 2 3 1 2 3 2 the slt output then served as a spatial constraint for the gpot which executed several thousand swmm models according to unique spatial allocations of nbs features within the permissible areas i e the shaded areas shown in fig 2 b relative cost estimates for the case study were obtained from the epa national stormwater calculator nswc which provides annual costs for nbs implementation and maintenance within unique geographical regions cnt 2009 at the time of study the nswc cost estimates for the houston area included pervious pavement 8 68 sf bioretention cells 6 07 sf and tree planter boxes 9 46 sf bernagros et al 2021 the gpot used two input files to compare nbs scenarios with the baseline swmm model the first input file contained the total acreage percent impervious coverage and maximum number of nbs locations per subcatchment as summarized in table s 7 the second input file described average sizing parameters proposed by sfei 2018 where bioretention cells pervious pavements and treeboxes were assigned uniform areas and widths of 500 sf by 20 ft 5000 sf by 50 ft and 60 sf by 6 ft respectively the gpot searches for the optimal solution among numerous possible scenarios by first modeling a random set of nbs placements and comparing their outputs for non dominance according to the nsga ii algorithm deb et al 2002 non dominance occurs when a solution performs no worse than any other solution for all objectives e g cost runoff and pollutant load efficiency and also performs better than all other solutions within the cohort for at least one objective this cohort known as a generation sorts each of the sub routines within the series known as a population using the previous generation s non dominant solutions and relative populations until the system either reaches a maximum number of simulations or until no further changes are observed the greenplan it tool for the wob case study used a threshold of 100 generations and 250 populations for a maximum of 25 000 unique configurations the gpot outputs were plotted as a function of cost x axis and runoff load reduction y axes to assess the cost efficiency of hydro dynamic performance among many possible siting plans the resulting graphs contained a set of all quasi optimal solutions for nbs spatial allocation according to the targets on the plotted axes known collectively as the pareto set through the nsga ii algorithm the pareto set converged to identify the optimal allocation of nbss along a cost efficiency curve also known as the pareto curve or pareto front where no further improvements could be made through reallocation of nbs features wu et al 2019 2 5 multi objective gini index the gini coefficient is a common index used in economics to describe the statistical dispersion of income and population within a sample group in a perfectly equal society the distribution of income x axis would match the distribution of population y axis known as the line of equality in fig 3 in a more realistic scenario the cumulative percentage of population versus household income often follows an exponential distribution called the lorenz curve which delineates state spaces a e g the inequality gap and b e g the actual income distribution described graphically by 2 gini a a b where a represents the total area between the line of equality and the lorenz curve distribution and b represents the area between the lorenz curve and the base axis a numerical form of the gini coefficient g i is given by 3 g i 1 i 1 i y i y i 1 x i x i 1 where x i is the cumulative percentage of the variable on the x axis and y i is the cumulative percentage of the variable on the y axis for data point i from i 1 to i i total data points gini values range from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates absolute equality and 1 represents absolute inequality due to the popularity of the gini coefficient to quickly identify statistical differences in distribution studies have begun applying this economic concept to issues of energy appropriation jacobson et al 2005 saboohi 2001 environmental inequity boyce et al 2016 heerink et al 2001 white 2007 water resources distribution cho and lee 2014 du et al 2021 hu et al 2016 yan et al 2018 flood drainage rights zhang et al 2020 and other topics regarding allocation of limited natural resources josa and aguado 2020 in the environmental literature recent applications have emerged to represent the gini axes spatially using the area based gini ar gini which compares social metrics calculated on an area basis to a distributed good calculated on a resource basis druckman and jackson 2008 an example of using the ar gini coefficient beyond the traditional scope of economic wealth disparity is given by sun et al 2010 where wastewater discharge permitting was optimized using the gini index and a multi criteria assessment of land population income and environmental capacity in this study the conflict between wastewater efficiency and social equality was bridged by balancing tradeoffs between various policy making goals amidst limited resources sun et al 2010 the ar gini is extended here to consider the spatial patterns of nbs allocation and performance with the distribution of social characteristics the cumulative area of nbs allocation is plotted on the gini y axis as a proportion of subcatchment area normalized on a scale from 0 to 100 unique evaluation indicators e g stormwater runoff stormwater quality and social equity are then plotted on the gini x axes such that each potential nbs scheme contains three different gini indices hydrological efficiency is represented as the percent difference of stormwater runoff volume between baseline and optimized conditions as a function of cost environmental efficiency is described as the percent difference of pollutant load abatement between baseline and optimized conditions on the basis of cost social equity is a function of the average neighborhood disadvantage i e adi score over the weighted area of nbs allocation within each subcatchment the individual gini indices are combined to derive a single dimensionless coefficient for transdisciplinary planning a high composite gini coefficient would suggest that the distribution of nbss is skewed toward either hydro environmental efficiency or social equity and does not maximize spatial allocation according to all three characteristics a low composite gini coefficient would reveal an ideal state space of nbs distribution that achieves maximum hydro environmental performance while siting nbs features in locations with the greatest potential for social health improvement the following equations are used in deriving the individual gini indices 4 ω i j 1 n z ji a j where ω i is the allocation of nbs area per subcatchment i n is number of unique nbs feature types j bioretention cells porous pavements or tree boxes z is the number nbss per subcatchment a j is the area of each nbs feature type a j bioretention cells 500 sf porous pavements 5 000 sf tree boxes 60 sf 5 η h e i a i b i a i 100 ω i c j where η i is the percent efficiency of hydrologic h and environmental e improvement between the baseline model a and the optimized model b for each subcatchment i normalized by the cost of nbs

hydrologic efficiency h and the total pollutant load runoff tss in lbs for environmental efficiency e obtained from swmm modeling and 6 μ si adi i i 1 m ω i where μ si is the percent of nbss sited within areas of high adi normalized by subcatchments area ω i for all subcatchments m and the social inequality within the subcatchment is measured by the average spatial adi score within each subcatchment i to eliminate differences in measurement units and magnitudes among evaluation choices each indicator is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100 per 7 x x x min x max x min 100 where x is the normalized value of each x hydrologic efficiency η hi environmental efficiency η ei and social equity μ si consequently the sum of the normalization series for each lorenz curve axis is 100 the composite gini coefficient is then calculated by 8 y i y i 1 ω i i 1 m a i 100 9a x i x i 1 η hi i 1 m η hi 100 9b x i x i 1 η ei i 1 m η ei 100 9c x i x i 1 μ si i 1 m μ si 100 and 10 g e 1 i 0 m x i x i 1 y i y i 1 where y i is the y axis value on the lorenz curve x i is the x axis value on the lorenz curve eq 9a is the x i value for the hydrologic efficiency indicator eq 9b is the x i value for the environmental efficiency and eq 9c is the x i value for the social deprivation indicator a i is the area of each subcatchment i with total subcatchments m and g e is the gini coefficient corresponding to composite evaluation indices e runoff volume efficiency pollutant load efficiency or social equity distribution x i and y i are plotted on the lorenz curve by sorting y i in ascending order where x 0 and y 0 each equal 0 finally the composite optimization objective is represented by 11 optimization objective min e 1 e g e e where g e is the multi functional gini coefficient for each indicator e over the total number of indicators e in summary the following steps are applied to calculate the composite gini index for amalgamating a series of nbs efficiency indicators according to both social well being and hydro environmental performance 1 select a set of potential nbs allocation scenarios according to hydro environmental swmm based modeling 2 calculate lorenz curve values for each efficiency indicator hydrologic environmental and social and unique nbs scenario 3 plot the lorenz curves and calculate the individual gini indices 4 aggregate the objective functions and compare lorenz curves according to the multi criteria gini coefficient and 5 minimize the optimization objective for the composite gini coefficient to identify the most spatially balanced distribution of social equality i e nbs placement in areas of highest health deprivation and hydro environmental efficiency i e nbs placement in areas of maximum runoff volume and pollutant load mitigation relative to cost 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydro environmental optimization the 2 5 and 100 year rainfall events were chosen as representative design storms for demonstrating the swmm based optimization of the wob model as demonstrated in fig 4 an example of planning for nbs expenditure of 1 000 m is shown in the dashed lines where the optimal pareto front results in a flow reduction of 3 22 3 62 and 4 37 and a tss pollutant load reduction 11 69 11 65 and 9 55 of for the 2 5 and 100 year design storms respectively the cost effectiveness curves i e the pareto fronts suggest there exists a largely linear relationship between the level of nbs implementation and tss pollutant load reduction between the 2 year and 5 year design storms as noted in fig 4 the runoff volume and pollutant load efficiencies are inverted relative to design storm intensity higher cost expenditures are associated with a greater number of nbs features for mitigating larger volumes of rainfall runoff since pollutant loading concentrations are a function of land use the percent change in wash off is not significantly impacted by rainfall values consequently the cost efficiency for pollutant load reduction decreases as the design storm intensity and thus nbs magnitude increases note the greenplan it tool presents optimization results in monetary units of million which were maintained for purposes of this case study the cost effectiveness curves in fig 4 inform which generation and population models provide the most efficient hydro environmental outcomes from the 25 000 scenarios that were simulated in swmm decision makers can use these results to determine optimal nbs planning according to target expenditures by assessing the far right portion of the pareto front stakeholders may identify at which point further investment in nbs features yield no additional improvement in hydro environmental goals as such hydrologic and environmental goals may be compared and contrasted between scenarios as a function of cost distribution and intensity of design storm metrics sfei 2020 for example if decision makers had a goal of reducing the 100 yr runoff by 5 equating to a total cost of 1 187 m on the pareto front curve in fig 4 a stakeholders could quickly visualize the flow reduction efficiency for additional design storms and the tradeoffs associated with pollutant load abatement at this cost point to demonstrate how such optimization outputs may be combined with the multi objective gini coefficient the 5 yr storm event with 1 000 m expenditure was chosen for further investigation in the swmm based approach generation 97 population 117 produced the most optimal nbs allocation scenario according to hydro environmental efficiency i e 3 45 runoff volume reduction and 11 15 pollutant load reduction in comparing the spatial distribution of nbss from this model with the areas of highest social deprivation in the wob watershed fig 5 a b we may note how sole reliance upon hydro environmental characteristics for nbs planning could result in a missed opportunity to address potential social co benefits from enhanced urban greening as such the multi objective gini coefficient is explored in the following section to refine the nbs optimization results 3 2 gini based optimization by plotting the lorenz curves for the swmm based optimization model generation 97 population 117 in fig 6 the individual gini indices according to hydrologic efficiency pollutant load efficiency and social equity were calculated as 0 17 0 10 and 0 46 respectively a gini coefficient less than or equal to 0 4 is commonly used as a threshold denoting fair distribution between the indicators on the x and y axes of the lorenz curve groves kirkby et al 2009 sadras and bongiovanni 2004 such results suggest a greater equity in nbs allocation on the basis of hydrodynamics compared with social characteristics the large area between the lorenz curve and the line of equality in fig 6 b reveals poor allocation fairness corresponding to spatial distribution of neighborhood deprivation i e the adi index as such the framework presented here suggests amalgamating each of the individual gini indices g i to achieve a minimal composite gini g e toward a more equitable distribution of all evaluation indicators a sample set of outputs from the swmm based optimization was selected to demonstrate how the principal allocation scheme may shift when the multi objective gini coefficient is applied as shown in fig 7 and summarized in table 1 a cohort of 10 additional nbs planning scenarios were evaluated on the basis of the gini coefficient for hydrologic environmental and social indicators the construction of multi objective lorenz curves is demonstrated as the plotting of cumulative nbs spatial allocation against cumulative evaluation indicators allowing for rapid comparison across planning scenarios a larger area below the lorenz curve suggests that the stormwater and social benefits are more variable within the planning paradigm while a smaller area under the curve indicates a more uniform distribution of spatial planning for achieving multiple objectives by comparing the width of the lorenz curves and minimizing the composite gini coefficient between these scenarios the greatest distribution of equality occurs in planning scenario generation 22 population 246 g e 0 229 the gini based plan provides a more equal distribution of overall benefits in comparison to the swmm based optimization model generation 97 population 117 g e 0 243 despite a similar investment in financial resources while the improvement in the composite gini coefficient may appear modest a detailed comparison between the optimization frameworks reveals a significant difference of nbs allocation in areas of greatest social need i e high adi score as summarized in table 2 the swmm based model only addresses 16 84 of the socially deprived areas when nbs features are sited for optimal hydro environmental performance by altering the composition of nbs features throughout the watershed the gini based plan addresses 35 32 of the weighted adi score within each subcatchment while maintaining similar runoff and pollutant load reductions this difference in social equity is further demonstrated in fig 5 c d where the swmm based and gini based models are compared spatially according to total nbs allocation and the corresponding proportion of nbs features to adi deprivation the holistic distribution of nbs co benefits is shown in fig 8 where the pie charts represent the weighted efficiency achieved in each subcatchment according to hydrologic blue environmental orange and social green aspects as observed in fig 8 a the swmm based model generation 97 population 117 exhibits a high proportion of blue and orange areas throughout the wob watershed highlighting prioritization of hydro environmental performance conversely fig 8 b generation 22 population 246 contains a greater proportion of green areas thereby revealing a greater influence of nbs allocation within socially vulnerable subcatchments the primary reason for this disparity is that areas prone to flooding and environmental issues are not always spatially proportional to areas of highest social deprivation as such reliance upon a worst first approach to nbs planning through the lens of hydro dynamic modeling may result in non optimal allocation for addressing the many societal benefits provided by nbs solutions 4 limitations it should be noted that the gini coefficient is sensitive to outliers by its nature as the gini is a summary statistic information may be lost when disparate datasets are combined and an extreme value in one region of the graph can greatly impact the overall results in other words by converting all data along the lorenz curve to a single number disparate planning scenarios may result in a similar gini coefficient de maio 2007 as the gini coefficient s sensitivity is related to the survey sample size and spatial resolution boyce et al 2016 fabrizi and trivisano 2016 giorgi and gigliarano 2017 this study attempted to overcome such limitations by choosing a high resolution measure of national social inequality i e the adi and a robust measure of hydrologic performance according to detailed swmm modeling while outside the scope of this study comparison of the spatial gini coefficient to other measures of inequality and their sensitivity to outliers of which many are presented throughout the literature e g boyce et al 2016 cobham and sumner 2013 cowell and flachaire 2002 sangüesa et al 2018 is a worthwhile avenue of future research in amalgamating social inequality with environmental performance 5 conclusion in the age of the anthropocene where hydrologic environmental and social processes are being influenced and altered by human patterns nbss serve as a prime foundation for exploring linkages between quality of life goals and water challenges nbs design is a function of rapid urban development social wellbeing and a scarcity of resources for addressing hydro meteorological challenges as such proper co development of nbs plans can and should account for the multi functional components involved in all of these processes for optimal impact to amalgamate such inter woven goals decision makers seek the ability to identify priority planning areas that guide equitable investment marchese et al 2018 in considering the rising popularity of urban green infrastructure we are presented with an opportunity to re cast how decision making operates in order to maximize the numerous co benefits associated with nbss as such this study demonstrates how real world social and hydro environmental complexities may be amalgamated using a novel application of the area gini coefficient for actionable science the gini index is a straightforward calculation that could be used to merge holistic benefits using simple algebra since the coefficient of derivation under the lorenz curve is calculated as a standard deviation variation is relative and thus invariant to changes in spatial scale in other words the gini index provides a transparent measurement tool to describe the summary of impact fractions for multi objective planning at cascading scales lee 1997 by solely relying on hydro environmental modeling the relative benefits addressed by nbs solutions are limited and are not able to be optimized according to unique properties of socioeconomics and human health this study is the first known attempt to incorporate nbs synergies and tradeoffs between hydrology social health deprivation environmental quality and cost efficiency into a single framework using the dimensionless gini coefficient the white oak bayou case study investigated how social equity and watershed dynamics propagate throughout the nbs system according to 25 000 swmm model runs a comparison between traditional swmm based optimization and the proposed gini based framework revealed how the spatial allocation of nbss within the watershed may be structured to address significantly more areas of social health deprivation while achieving similar hydro environmental performance and cost efficiency the case study comparison revealed runoff volume reductions of 3 45 and 3 38 pollutant load reductions of 11 15 and 11 28 and adi mitigation metrics of 16 84 and 35 32 for the swmm based and the gini based approaches respectively using similar cost expenditures by constructing the optimization framework with interdisciplinary elements this study strengthened the planning capabilities associated with overlapping social and hydro dynamic processes and patterns by approaching the system as a linkage of spatial properties this study highlighted synergies associated with multiple human water objectives thereby reducing the potential for systemic underperformance marchese et al 2018 moreover by integrating various epistemologies this analytical approach serves as a representation of complex landscape functionalities and their unique interactions as we continue to have increasing access to high resolution datasets the spatial gini coefficient maximizes our understanding of local risks and benefits to answer challenging questions associated with multi functional planning the practical implications of this study will enhance the user friendliness of nbs planning in an intuitive manner while merging well established hydrological methodologies with social co benefits kuller et al 2017 when we are better able to connect the dots between social constructs environmental processes and the hydrological cycle which are all complex processes that operate cohesively amongst one another we can establish optimal patterns within the seemingly chaotic network of human water phenomena in a world with increasing socio environmental stressors and finite resources this research will improve public policy interventions by providing the knowledge necessary for identifying quantifying and linking complex interactions of nbs functions toward sound

8553,extreme precipitation heavily affects society and economy in africa because it triggers natural hazards and contributes large amounts of freshwater understanding past changes in extreme precipitation could help us improve our projections of extremes thus reducing the vulnerability of the region to climate change here we combine high resolution satellite data 1981 2019 with a novel non asymptotic statistical approach which explicitly separates intensity and occurrence of the process we investigate past changes in extreme daily precipitation amounts relevant to engineering and risk management significant α 0 05 positive and negative trends in annual maximum daily precipitation are reported in 20 of africa both at the local scales 0 05 and mesoscales 1 our statistical model is able to explain 90 of their variance and performs well 72 explained variance even when annual maxima are explicitly censored from the parameter estimation this suggests possible applications in situations in which the observed extremes are not quantitatively trusted we present results at the continental scale as well as for six areas characterized by different climatic characteristics and forcing mechanisms underlying the ongoing changes in general we can attribute most of the observed trends to changes in the tail heaviness of the intensity distribution 25 of explained variance 38 at the mesoscale while changes in the average number of wet days only explain 4 12 of the variance low probability extremes always exhibit faster trend rates than annual maxima 44 faster in median for the case of 100 year events implying that changes in infrastructure design values are likely underestimated by approaches based on trend analyses of annual maxima flexible change permitting models are needed no systematic difference between local and mesoscales is reported with locally varying impacts on the areal reduction factors used to transform return levels across scales data availability links to the data are provided in the acknowledgements 1 introduction africa is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its high socio economic sensitivity to extreme weather events di baldassarre et al 2010 liu et al 2020 wmo 2021 extreme precipitation heavily affects society and economy because it triggers devastating natural hazards such as floods and landslides nka et al 2015 igwe 2018 tramblay et al 2020 and provides large amounts of freshwater to replenish groundwater resources samuels et al 2009 taylor et al 2013 quantifying and understanding past changes in extreme precipitation in africa is thus of burning interest because it helps improving our projections for engineering applications and risk and water resources management according to the last intergovernmental panel on climate change assessment report ipcc climate change 2021 only two african regions i e western and eastern south africa exhibit increasing trends in heavy precipitation attributable to the human contribution since the 1950s although with a low confidence due to limited agreement due to the lack of long term in situ observations washington et al 2006 kidd et al 2017 detection and attribution of trends in extreme precipitation in africa proves rather uncertain with sometimes contrasting results even for what concerns the direction of change cattani et al 2018 harrison et al 2019 nevertheless numerous observational studies contribute to drawing the picture of heavy precipitation trends in africa typically examining high percentiles in the daily precipitation distribution e g the 99th wet day percentile or the annual maximum daily amounts rx1day or rx1 as detailed in the following one of the most investigated regions is sahel west africa where many works reported a recovery in the precipitation amounts and heavy precipitation since the 1980s after decades of shortage probably caused by an increased intensity and frequency of mesoscale convective systems e g taylor et al 2017 nicholson et al 2018 vischel et al 2019 diatta et al 2020 chagnaud et al 2021 similarly increasing precipitation amounts characterize western south africa particularly in the southern interior kruger and nxumalo 2017 conversely rainfall amounts decreased significantly in the horn of africa tierney et al 2015 especially during the march may rain season this was likely caused by natural multidecadal variability of the tropical pacific sea surface temperatures lyon 2014 or by a human induced increase in the indian ocean sea surface temperatures which modulates the warm pool circulation williams and funk 2011 statistically significant negative trends in precipitation amount and number of wet days in autumn were recently found over the east central and north eastern parts of south africa mackellar et al 2014 kruger and nxumalo 2017 central africa experienced a significant decrease in total precipitation which is likely associated with a significant decrease of the length of the maximum number of consecutive wet days aguilar et al 2009 here the area of the congo basin one of the world s most active thunderstorm regions where the second largest rainforest is situated is witnessing a widespread increase in the boreal summer june august dry season length since the 1980s jiang et al 2019 given the poor and uneven spatial coverage of monitoring stations over africa it was difficult to infer an overall significant trend in rx1 and rx5 the annual maxima at five consecutive days westra et al 2013 sun et al 2021 nevertheless it was possible to detect a predominance of positive trends for both indices from 1950 to 2018 in south africa where many ground stations are located westra et al 2013 similarly positive trends were reported for kenya and western ethiopia based on geostationary satellite observations and negative trends for eastern ethiopia gebrechorkos et al 2019 at a pan african level statistically significant positive trends in the annual averages of the monthly maxima from the rainfall estimates on a gridded network contractor et al 2020 were reported during 1980 2016 in west and east africa whereas negative and non significant deviations characterize southern africa robinson et al 2021 less is known about the changes in rarer extremes such as the amounts exceeded on average once in n years termed n year events or return levels which are fundamental for engineering and risk management applications and on the mechanisms behind these changes the direct quantification of extreme return levels requires data series several times longer than the exceedance probability timescale hence statistical extrapolation models need to be used such as extreme value distributions coles 2001 these models rely on the observed extremes either the annual maxima or the values exceeding very high thresholds and require relatively long records to achieve a reasonable accuracy katz et al 2002 despite being preferable to traditional trend detection techniques zhang et al 2004 quantifying changes between two periods is subject to large uncertainties because the temporal slices are usually short paeth et al 2017 for example de waal et al 2017 compared 50 year return levels from 76 rainfall stations in western cape south africa estimated during 1980 2009 with those estimated during 1950 1979 finding an increase in 63 of the stations and a decrease in the remaining 37 possible alternatives to this approach include nonstationary models in which changes of the distribution parameters are modeled using covariates which are expected to be related to extreme precipitation such as temperature tramblay et al 2012 nasri et al 2016 tramblay and somot 2018 chagnaud et al 2021 for the case of central and eastern africa afuecheta and omar 2021 tested a number of nonstationary models for annual and monthly maxima of daily precipitation using time as covariate and combined them with an analysis of trends in temperature extremes with the objective of improving crop resilience and flood risk management these methods however require approximations in order to reduce uncertainties typically a priori assumptions on the high order statistical moments of the distribution which are difficult to estimate under stationary conditions let alone nonstationary are used such as the absence of temporal changes in some of the parameters e g prosdocimi and kjeldsen 2021 evidence of different responses for extremes characterized by different severity schär et al 2016 pendergrass 2018 however challenges these assumptions it has also been argued that stochastic climate variability may set a lower boundary to the uncertainty in the observed extremes limiting the practical usefulness of these models serinaldi and kilsby 2015 fatichi et al 2016 as an additional complication changes in extremes may depend on the spatial scale of interest this may alter the areal reduction factors that are used to convert in situ estimates of extreme return levels to areal amounts associated to corresponding exceedance probabilities these factors are of crucial importance for engineers and risk managers svensson and jones 2010 evidence of a possible dependence on the spatial scale of the response of extremes to temperature is reported for many regions wasko et al 2016 lochbihler et al 2017 peleg et al 2018 raising the question whether this effect may have caused temporal changes in the extremes in africa here we address these challenges and try to improve our understanding of the changes that occurred in multi scale extreme return levels in africa over the last decades to do so we combine long term high resolution satellite precipitation estimates with a novel statistical approach able to quantify changes in return levels relevant for engineering and risk management and to attribute the observed trends to changes in the events intensity and or occurrence while a similar framework was recently used to investigate extreme sub daily precipitation in the eastern italian alps assuming spatial homogeneity of the trends dallan et al 2022 to the authors knowledge this is the first time this approach is applied over a wide area here continental using distributed here satellite information our application could overcome important limitations in the current state of the art for what concerns the attribution of observed trends in extremes to specific changes in precipitation climatology over wide ungauged regions of the earth specifically we a quantify trends in extreme daily precipitation amounts and extreme return levels at the local and mesoscale b investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed changes and c quantify differences in the changes detected for annual maximum daily amounts and extreme return levels at different spatial scales 2 methods 2 1 precipitation data this study is based on data from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps version 2 funk et al 2015 which covers the period 1981 2019 39 years with global land only daily precipitation estimates at 0 05 resolution this dataset is chosen as it represents one of the few options currently available to represent extreme daily precipitation at local and coarser scales for i a region where convection dominates extremes and for ii a sufficiently long time period to allow the investigation of temporal changes in fact other candidate satellite based precipitation products generally start about two decades later when passive microwave sensors were first deployed and are subject to important temporal inhomogeneities in both number and type of sensors included in the estimation reanalysis products could represent an alternative but cannot resolve convective processes due to the insufficient resolution of the current models and recent studies recommend the use of alternative sources when it comes to extremes while we recommend caution for all products dependent on their intended application this particularly applies to reanalyses which show the most divergence across results alexander et al 2020 the chirps algorithm is based on infrared ir cold cloud duration based precipitation estimates from the geostationary satellite constellation and a rain gauge merging procedure the high resolutions granted by ir are critical for sampling short living local and mesoscale convective systems which are crucial in determining extremes even at the daily scale laing et al 2008 2011 raghavendra et al 2018 especially in arid regions morin et al 2020 chirps is regarded as a reference in terms of robustness and quality over africa and is largely used in climatological studies e g dinku et al 2018 satgé et al 2020 dembélé et al 2020 it is characterized by sufficiently high resolution and long continuous and homogeneous records to allow multi scale trend detection over a multi decadal period although harrison et al 2019 pointed out that a promising result for identifying regional changes is that numerous satellite products do well at interannual variations in precipitation totals and number of rain days even as well as some gauge only products we limit here the possible impact of biases in the data by examining normalized quantities namely i the average change rates that is the slope of a linear approximation of the trends normalized over the median value of the variable of interest and ii the ratios between change rates similar assumptions have long been adopted for analyzing the scale dependence of extremes in remote sensing observations after frederick et al 1977 the global precipitation climatology center gpcc full data daily v2020 is a 1 gridded dataset based on rain gauge observations ziese et al 2020 being based on direct observations as opposed to the indirect retrievals of the ir estimates it is expected to provide more accurate representations of extremes albeit at coarser spatial scales it covers the period 1982 2019 and is used here as a benchmark for the validation of the assumptions underlying our statistical model section 2 4 2 2 statistical model we estimate extreme return levels using a non asymptotic statistical approach the model relies on information from the so called ordinary as opposed to extreme events which are all the days with non null precipitation amounts wet days assumed here as statistically independent marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 the idea is that when the tail of the distribution of the wet day amounts is known an extreme value distribution describing the emerging extremes can be built from ordinary statistics by explicitly considering the yearly sampling of wet days marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2020 serinaldi et al 2020 the approach directly captures and separates information on the wet day intensity distribution and on wet day occurrence frequency thermodynamics reasoning suggests that the exceedance probability of extreme daily precipitation amounts x decreases as a stretched exponential wilson and toumi 2005 so that the right tail of the wet day distribution can be parametrized with a cumulative distribution function in the form 1 f x λ κ 1 e x λ κ where λ is a scale parameter and κ a shape parameter which defines the tail heaviness sub exponential for κ 1 heavier than exponential for κ 1 see figure s1 in the supporting information for a visual interpretation this tail model was supported by observations over different climatic regimes e g papalexiou et al 2018 marra et al 2019 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 including tropical africa amponsah et al 2022 thresholds to define the tail typically ranged between the 75th and the 90th wet day percentiles mediterranean and continental climates respectively knowing f it is possible to estimate rare daily precipitation associated to extreme yearly non exceedance probabilities p such as the 100 year return levels with p 0 99 by inverting the extreme value distribution 2 p x f x λ κ n where the average number of wet days in a year n is explicitly considered this approach is known as simplified metastatistical extreme value or smev marra et al 2019 marra et al 2020 serinaldi et al 2020 as the model parameters are derived from a relatively large fraction of the wet day amounts they can be estimated for every year in the record thus allowing us to quantify return levels at each year these estimates will be obviously subject to large uncertainties and will not be directly useful for engineering and risk management applications however using trend detection techniques it is possible to evaluate the statistical significance of the changes in these quantities and quantify trend rates e g miniussi and marani 2020 dallan et al 2022 2 3 parameter estimation in our application we define as wet all daily amounts equal or exceeding 0 1 mm at 0 05 resolution and assume independence of the wet day amounts e g zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2019 parameters of the model are computed for every year j n j is the number of wet days λ j and κ j are computed by censoring censoring the magnitude but retaining the weight in probability the portion of data not belonging to the tail section 2 4 and using a least square linear regression in weibull transformed coordinates marani and ignaccolo 2015 2 4 validation of the model assumptions and definition of the tail our statistical model is as good as its underlying assumption the exceedance probability of heavy daily precipitation intensities decays as a stretched exponential this assumption is verified using a specific monte carlo test fig 1 based on the one described in marra et al 2020 to have a quantitatively robust reference for extremes we use the gpcc dataset the test consists of i estimating the model parameters λ θ κ θ by explicitly censoring all the observed annual maxima and the wet day values below a given left censoring threshold θ ii sampling 103 random realizations of reality as if the model assumptions were true n j wet days distributed as the estimated model λ θ κ θ with j 1 m representing years in the record iii extracting the corresponding annual maxima iv testing whether the observed annual maxima are likely samples from the model if more than 5 of these annual maxima lie outside the 95 sampling confidence interval the assumption of having stretched exponential tail above the tested threshold is to be rejected iterating i iv over different thresholds θ permits to identify the portion of the distribution tail which is well described by a stretched exponential that is the lowest threshold above which the model is never rejected left censoring thresholds between the 50th and the 90th percentile are explored if the stretched exponential tail is rejected also for the highest left censoring threshold we consider the assumption as not verified because the tail is expected to be a climatic property and the test is subject to a level of stochasticity the left censoring thresholds used in the study are selected by smoothing the obtained values 1 resolution over 3 3 windows and rounding to the closest 5th percentile a schematic of the workflow is reported in fig 1 it is worth noting three aspects concerning this test first for the sake of the test the stationarity assumption behind the test a unique tail is tested using all the years can be considered verified even when significant trends are observed figure s2 second the test is robust the probability of not rejecting stretched exponential tails in presence of power type tails which are the most widely supported alternative to stretched exponential tails for the case of precipitation is zero or close to zero for thresholds lower than the 90th percentile conversely the probability of wrong rejection in presence of stretched exponential tails can be close to 10 figure s3 last our definition of the left censoring thresholds implies that the model parameters are not sensitive to small changes in the thresholds see marra et al 2019 2 5 spatial scales two spatial scales are examined i local scale represented by chirps data at the original resolution 0 05 5 km at the equator ii mesoscale represented by the data aggregated to 1 resolution 100 km at the equator to do so a 1 aggregated value is computed for each wet day of the 0 05 pixels by spatially averaging the original data over the 20 20 surrounding pixels 2 6 detection of temporal trends the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 is used to test the statistical significance level α 0 05 of the trends in the model parameters in the largest daily amounts observed rx1 and modeled rx1 modelled in each year and in the modeled return levels 100 year return levels are here shown at both local and mesoscale the 2 year return levels are the theoretical median of rx1 and are here used as model quantification of the change rate in the rx1 rx1 modeled possible serial correlation in the data is accounted for by pre whitening the data it should be noted that correlation was small and results without pre whitening are indistinguishable yearly estimates of the distribution parameters may be subject to systematic biases especially for what concerns the estimated tail heaviness usually tail heaviness is overestimated when few data are available for parameter estimation to limit the impact of this issue the magnitude of the trends is here quantified using the average change rate computed as the ratio between the non parametric sen s slope estimator sen 1968 and the median value of the variable in the time series this assumes that the biases in the estimated parameters are stationary 3 results and discussion 3 1 tail properties of extreme daily precipitation over africa the right tail of the distribution of daily precipitation amounts is found to be well described by a stretched exponential model for 87 of the continent see fig 2 with definitions of the right tail ranging from the largest 50 of the wet day amounts light blue in the fig 2a to the largest 10 dark blue in the remaining 13 of the continent dotted areas our test rejects the assumption of stretched exponential tail within the tested ranges of tail definitions 50th to 90th percentiles as mentioned above this is in line with synthetic experiments showing that under the examined conditions record length yearly number of wet days the test may provide 5 11 false rejections see figure s3 however in two regions one in east africa and one in southern angola the spatial clustering of these pixels suggests that extreme precipitation could have different types of tail or that tails could here consist in smaller fractions of the data e g only the largest 5 nevertheless since only few significant trends are detected in these areas see next section this is not expected to affect our results after left censoring an average of at least 10 data points per year are available for parameter estimation in most of the continent fig 2c granting a proper estimation of the two tail parameters fewer data points are available over the sahara desert and in other isolated areas in the eastern and southern portions of the continent 3 2 trends in annual maximum daily precipitation the trends of the annual maximum daily precipitation rx1 at the local scale are significant over 20 3 of the continent fig 3 a the area in central africa characterized by strong negative trends area 4 in fig 3a contributes 60 of the significant trends however the reliability of the results is dubious because the area is almost completely devoid of ground observations in particular central africa is a region where rain gauge data are scarce with consequences on the accuracy of the satellite precipitation products which strongly rely on gauge data for their generation as is the case of chirps the case of the central africa will be further discussed below section 3 2 1 without considering the central african area 37 of the significant trends is positive and 63 negative positive trends are reported in the sahel 2 in kenya and tanzania 5 and in the coastal regions of the gulf of guinea 3 and of the middle east 1 negative trends are reported in the middle east 1 in inland areas of west africa 3 and 2 in south africa and namibia 6 and in the above mentioned region in central africa extending from sudan to angola 4 similar trends are reported at the mesoscale 1 figure s4 the fraction of significant trends in the six examined areas ranges from 15 to 20 1 and reaches 77 in area 4 13 4 74 at the mesoscale and are thus larger than the 5 false positives expected at the used significance level the interested reader can find quantitative information on the parameters estimated for the different areas in table s1 these values are reasonable when compared to other studies in which stretched exponential tails have been used e g marra et al 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 nevertheless as discussed in section 2 6 we deem their quantitative values less reliable than the average change rates examined here harrison et al 2019 compared trends derived from multiple precipitation products including chirps finding no statistically significant change in the extremes direct comparison with their results is however difficult because they focused on a small portion of the continent in which our results show no statistically significant trend see fig 1 in harrison et al 2019 similarly pfahl et al 2017 reported an increase in rx1 from global climate models in central africa for the period 1983 2000 a result difficult to compare with ours due to the different examined period and to the known deficiency of global models in resolving the convective processes that are key to extreme precipitation the trends we observe however are in line with results from both chaney et al 2014 who reported positive trends in the sahel region and mtewele et al 2021 who used multi sensor satellite estimates from the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa for the period 1998 2018 and found negative trends in both frequency and intensity of extremes in the western portion of central africa 3 2 1 the case of the central africa the area over which consistent negative trends in extremes are observed includes the tropical forests of the congo basin and vast savannah regions d onofrio et al 2018 since most of the precipitable water available in these regions is related to the forest or to other vegetation types o connor et al 2021 vegetation precipitation feedbacks may represent an important mechanism behind these observations e g due to wildfire generated aerosols or woody encroachment a hypothesis to be explored more in detail in the future other authors recently highlighted a decrease in precipitation amounts and forest greenness over congo with an increase of the dry season length jiang et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 convection from deep convection to mesoscale convective systems is responsible for most of precipitation in this area being the congo basin one of the three most convective regions in the world together with amazonia and the indonesian maritime continent raghavendra et al 2018 used 35 years 1982 2016 of geostationary infrared brightness temperatures to explore the changes in the magnitude and area of cold cloud top temperatures as a proxy for the number and size of individual thunderstorms at different intensities the results suggest that larger and more intense thunderstorms are occurring in this area during the last decades with an increase in the mean size of thunderstorms with lower cloud top temperature to the detriment of the mean size of thunderstorms with higher cloud top temperature this contributes to a drier lower troposphere and a wetter higher troposphere a weaker ascent at both the lower and upper troposphere and an overall reduction of the soil moisture these changes were found to be associated with a significant decrease in april may june precipitation over the congo basin more recently alber et al 2021 analyzed the trend in thunderstorm activity from 1983 to 2018 exploiting the gálvez davidson index feedback mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed thunderstorm intensification which include the cooling and moistening of the mid troposphere drying and warming at the surface and lower troposphere and a decrease in vertical stability and convective inhibition despite the lower level of accuracy expected for chirps estimates in this region the above factors are conducive to the significant negative trend we observe for the past 40 years which is also in agreement with rather independent satellite observations for the last 20 years mtewele et al 2021 3 3 evaluation of the statistical model our statistical model proves robust at reproducing the observed trends both in qualitative spatial patterns and quantitative explained variance terms fig 3b specifically the model explains 89 of the variance 91 at the mesoscale of the significant change rates r 2 computed for all pixels in which the observed trend is significant notably only 45 of the variance 43 at the mesoscale is explained in area 4 while 76 90 of the variance 68 92 at the mesoscale is explained in the other areas remarkably the model run explicitly censoring the observed annual maxima rx1 and thus providing independent estimates of their trends explains as much as 72 of the variance 67 at the mesoscale of the significant trends in rx1 fig 4 this suggests that the proposed statistical model could represent an opportunity for examining trends in extremes in situations in which the observed modelled extremes are not fully trusted e g masunaga et al 2019 rajulapati et al 2020 these results support the use of the statistical model to i investigate the relation between daily precipitation climatology and extreme and ii quantify trends in rare exceedance probabilities which cannot be extracted from observations alone as detailed in the following sections 3 4 link between changes in precipitation climatology and extremes the largest portion of variance explained by the model is to be ascribed to the distribution tail heaviness shape parameter of the stretched exponential distribution κ which is negatively correlated to extreme return levels see figure s1 with 25 explained variance 38 at the mesoscale fig 3e and figure s4e changes in the scale of the distribution λ explain 13 of the variance 21 at the mesoscale and changes in the number of wet days 4 12 at the mesoscale fig 3d and f figure s4d and s4f this implies that at both scales the trends in extremes are mostly related to changes in the distribution of daily precipitation amounts rather than to changes in the occurrence frequency of storms and mostly in the proportion of very extreme events an interesting exception is the sahel area 2 where the number of wet days explains 11 of the variance versus 0 of the tail heaviness this confirms previous findings based on in situ and satellite observations panthou et al 2014 taylor et al 2017 chagnaud et al 2021 possible physical explanations are associated with changes in sea surface temperature convective available potential energy and vertical wind shear and are discussed by biasutti 2019 and tramblay et al 2020 noting that a uniform scaling of extreme precipitation with temperature such as 7 c 1 expected according to the clausius clapeyron relation e g o gorman and schneider 2009 translates into a change in the scale parameter only the trends we observe in the model parameter imply that severity dependent scaling factors are essential to adequately capture the complex dependences of extreme precipitation and that trends in extreme return levels are likely different from the trends one can detect using observed annual maxima 3 5 different changes of annual maxima and extreme return levels at local and mesoscales significant trends in the 100 year return levels q100 derived from the statistical model are shown in fig 3c figure s4c for the mesoscale overall 19 6 of the continent experienced significant changes in the 100 year events this implies that the stochastic uncertainties characterizing yearly estimates of extreme return levels as high as the 100 year events using our model is comparable to the one characterizing annual maxima the spatial patterns of these changes largely follow the ones of rx1 with no cases of opposing trends but their magnitude is always 99 99 of the significant pixels greater fig 5 trend rates in the 100 year events in africa since 1981 have been 44 stronger in median than the ones in rx1 both at local and mesoscales this is consistent with previous findings based on extreme precipitation temperature scaling observations and models in several regions of the earth e g myhre et al 2019 kelder et al 2020 lenderink et al 2021 visser et al 2021 the ratio between change rates of extremes at local and mesoscales can be interpreted as a proxy of the changes in extreme storm structure and is directly related to the areal reduction factors fig 6 the previously reported redistribution of moisture toward the storm center in response to global warming e g wasko et al 2016 armon et al 2022 translates into expected stronger positive trends at the local scale or stronger negative trends at the mesoscale this is qualitatively confirmed in areas 3 positive trends and 6 negative and implies an increased reduction of extremes with area in some parts of eastern africa and southern africa fig 6b and d however other regions present opposite behaviors such as area 1 both positive and negative trends area 2 positive and area 4 negative this smoothing translates into a decreased reduction of extremes with area and confirms previous findings based on the sahel vischel et al 2019 overall the distribution of these ratios is rather dispersed so that local situations might largely differ from the behaviors highlighted here specific cases need to be examined individually when interpreting our results in terms of risk assessment and water resources management we should consider systems that respond to daily or sub daily extreme rainfall such as floods and flash floods in catchments with areas up to a few thousand square kilometers or landslides and debris flows in headwater catchments and steep slopes the faster changes in extreme return levels here demonstrated by the 100 year events imply that changes in the potential occurrence of these hazards could have happened faster than what measured by usual trends on rx1 the strong positive trends observed in area 2 sahel and 5 eastern africa for example could be indicative of a quick increase in the probability of flood and landslides in these areas over the past decades as perhaps exemplified by recent events wainwright et al 2021 similarly the change we report in the areal reduction factors can suggest different changes between landslides flash flood risk which respond to local precipitation and flood risk water availability which are mostly impacted by the volumes of precipitation over relatively vast areas however it should be recalled that rainfall is far from being the only factor affecting these processes e g sharma et al 2018 additional work based on hydrological models or slope stability models able to include observed trends in extremes antecedent conditions and other relevant processes is needed to thoroughly address these issues quantitatively 4 conclusions changes in annual maximum daily precipitation and low probability extremes relevant for engineering and risk management that occurred over africa since 1981 are examined using a high resolution satellite precipitation product chirps version 2 and a novel non asymptotic statistical approach based on ordinary as opposed to extreme value statistics temporal trends in annual maxima rx1 and extreme return levels at local scales 0 05 and mesoscales 1 are detected quantified and compared and are then attributed to changes in wet day occurrence and characteristics of the wet day intensity distribution roughly 20 of the continent experienced significant trends mann kendall α 0 05 in annual maxima rx1 with both positive sahel kenya and tanzania coastal regions of the gulf of guinea coastal regions of the middle east and negative middle east inland areas of west africa south africa and namibia and a vast region in central africa extending from sudan to angola changes the statistical model explains 89 91 at the mesoscale of the variance in the observed change rates of rx1 and 72 67 at the mesoscale of the variance when run with explicit censoring of the observed annual maxima it can thus be trusted for investigating causal relations between wet day intensity distribution and number of wet days on one side and extremes on the other and to quantify past trends in rare exceedance probabilities provided its assumptions are met it could represent a viable option for examining trends in situations in which the observed modelled extremes are not fully trusted here we evaluated the validity of the model assumption using observational data and a robust monte carlo based statistical test changes in the tail heaviness of the wet day intensity distribution that is the proportion between heavy and extreme events explain most 25 of the variance in the changes in rx1 as opposed to 13 of the intensity distribution scale parameter and 4 of the number of wet days these results imply a differential rate of change between rx1 and rarer extremes extreme return levels changed faster than rx1 44 faster for the case of 100 year events both for positive and negative trends increased reduction of extremes with area suggesting a redistribution of moisture toward the storm center is reported for coastal areas of the gulf of guinea positive trends and southern africa negative while an opposite behavior is found for the middle east positive and negative trends sahel positive and central africa negative these results imply locally dependent impacts on the areal reduction factors used to derive extreme return levels at the areal scale e g at the catchment scale our quantitative results depend on the ability of chirpsv2 to represent changes in the wet day precipitation intensities and in precipitation occurrence key features of our model and on the local adequacy of the stretched exponential tail model and of the assumptions underlying the trend analyses but are robust with respect to stochastic uncertainties and errors in the satellite estimation of extreme precipitation credit authorship contribution

8553,extreme precipitation heavily affects society and economy in africa because it triggers natural hazards and contributes large amounts of freshwater understanding past changes in extreme precipitation could help us improve our projections of extremes thus reducing the vulnerability of the region to climate change here we combine high resolution satellite data 1981 2019 with a novel non asymptotic statistical approach which explicitly separates intensity and occurrence of the process we investigate past changes in extreme daily precipitation amounts relevant to engineering and risk management significant α 0 05 positive and negative trends in annual maximum daily precipitation are reported in 20 of africa both at the local scales 0 05 and mesoscales 1 our statistical model is able to explain 90 of their variance and performs well 72 explained variance even when annual maxima are explicitly censored from the parameter estimation this suggests possible applications in situations in which the observed extremes are not quantitatively trusted we present results at the continental scale as well as for six areas characterized by different climatic characteristics and forcing mechanisms underlying the ongoing changes in general we can attribute most of the observed trends to changes in the tail heaviness of the intensity distribution 25 of explained variance 38 at the mesoscale while changes in the average number of wet days only explain 4 12 of the variance low probability extremes always exhibit faster trend rates than annual maxima 44 faster in median for the case of 100 year events implying that changes in infrastructure design values are likely underestimated by approaches based on trend analyses of annual maxima flexible change permitting models are needed no systematic difference between local and mesoscales is reported with locally varying impacts on the areal reduction factors used to transform return levels across scales data availability links to the data are provided in the acknowledgements 1 introduction africa is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its high socio economic sensitivity to extreme weather events di baldassarre et al 2010 liu et al 2020 wmo 2021 extreme precipitation heavily affects society and economy because it triggers devastating natural hazards such as floods and landslides nka et al 2015 igwe 2018 tramblay et al 2020 and provides large amounts of freshwater to replenish groundwater resources samuels et al 2009 taylor et al 2013 quantifying and understanding past changes in extreme precipitation in africa is thus of burning interest because it helps improving our projections for engineering applications and risk and water resources management according to the last intergovernmental panel on climate change assessment report ipcc climate change 2021 only two african regions i e western and eastern south africa exhibit increasing trends in heavy precipitation attributable to the human contribution since the 1950s although with a low confidence due to limited agreement due to the lack of long term in situ observations washington et al 2006 kidd et al 2017 detection and attribution of trends in extreme precipitation in africa proves rather uncertain with sometimes contrasting results even for what concerns the direction of change cattani et al 2018 harrison et al 2019 nevertheless numerous observational studies contribute to drawing the picture of heavy precipitation trends in africa typically examining high percentiles in the daily precipitation distribution e g the 99th wet day percentile or the annual maximum daily amounts rx1day or rx1 as detailed in the following one of the most investigated regions is sahel west africa where many works reported a recovery in the precipitation amounts and heavy precipitation since the 1980s after decades of shortage probably caused by an increased intensity and frequency of mesoscale convective systems e g taylor et al 2017 nicholson et al 2018 vischel et al 2019 diatta et al 2020 chagnaud et al 2021 similarly increasing precipitation amounts characterize western south africa particularly in the southern interior kruger and nxumalo 2017 conversely rainfall amounts decreased significantly in the horn of africa tierney et al 2015 especially during the march may rain season this was likely caused by natural multidecadal variability of the tropical pacific sea surface temperatures lyon 2014 or by a human induced increase in the indian ocean sea surface temperatures which modulates the warm pool circulation williams and funk 2011 statistically significant negative trends in precipitation amount and number of wet days in autumn were recently found over the east central and north eastern parts of south africa mackellar et al 2014 kruger and nxumalo 2017 central africa experienced a significant decrease in total precipitation which is likely associated with a significant decrease of the length of the maximum number of consecutive wet days aguilar et al 2009 here the area of the congo basin one of the world s most active thunderstorm regions where the second largest rainforest is situated is witnessing a widespread increase in the boreal summer june august dry season length since the 1980s jiang et al 2019 given the poor and uneven spatial coverage of monitoring stations over africa it was difficult to infer an overall significant trend in rx1 and rx5 the annual maxima at five consecutive days westra et al 2013 sun et al 2021 nevertheless it was possible to detect a predominance of positive trends for both indices from 1950 to 2018 in south africa where many ground stations are located westra et al 2013 similarly positive trends were reported for kenya and western ethiopia based on geostationary satellite observations and negative trends for eastern ethiopia gebrechorkos et al 2019 at a pan african level statistically significant positive trends in the annual averages of the monthly maxima from the rainfall estimates on a gridded network contractor et al 2020 were reported during 1980 2016 in west and east africa whereas negative and non significant deviations characterize southern africa robinson et al 2021 less is known about the changes in rarer extremes such as the amounts exceeded on average once in n years termed n year events or return levels which are fundamental for engineering and risk management applications and on the mechanisms behind these changes the direct quantification of extreme return levels requires data series several times longer than the exceedance probability timescale hence statistical extrapolation models need to be used such as extreme value distributions coles 2001 these models rely on the observed extremes either the annual maxima or the values exceeding very high thresholds and require relatively long records to achieve a reasonable accuracy katz et al 2002 despite being preferable to traditional trend detection techniques zhang et al 2004 quantifying changes between two periods is subject to large uncertainties because the temporal slices are usually short paeth et al 2017 for example de waal et al 2017 compared 50 year return levels from 76 rainfall stations in western cape south africa estimated during 1980 2009 with those estimated during 1950 1979 finding an increase in 63 of the stations and a decrease in the remaining 37 possible alternatives to this approach include nonstationary models in which changes of the distribution parameters are modeled using covariates which are expected to be related to extreme precipitation such as temperature tramblay et al 2012 nasri et al 2016 tramblay and somot 2018 chagnaud et al 2021 for the case of central and eastern africa afuecheta and omar 2021 tested a number of nonstationary models for annual and monthly maxima of daily precipitation using time as covariate and combined them with an analysis of trends in temperature extremes with the objective of improving crop resilience and flood risk management these methods however require approximations in order to reduce uncertainties typically a priori assumptions on the high order statistical moments of the distribution which are difficult to estimate under stationary conditions let alone nonstationary are used such as the absence of temporal changes in some of the parameters e g prosdocimi and kjeldsen 2021 evidence of different responses for extremes characterized by different severity schär et al 2016 pendergrass 2018 however challenges these assumptions it has also been argued that stochastic climate variability may set a lower boundary to the uncertainty in the observed extremes limiting the practical usefulness of these models serinaldi and kilsby 2015 fatichi et al 2016 as an additional complication changes in extremes may depend on the spatial scale of interest this may alter the areal reduction factors that are used to convert in situ estimates of extreme return levels to areal amounts associated to corresponding exceedance probabilities these factors are of crucial importance for engineers and risk managers svensson and jones 2010 evidence of a possible dependence on the spatial scale of the response of extremes to temperature is reported for many regions wasko et al 2016 lochbihler et al 2017 peleg et al 2018 raising the question whether this effect may have caused temporal changes in the extremes in africa here we address these challenges and try to improve our understanding of the changes that occurred in multi scale extreme return levels in africa over the last decades to do so we combine long term high resolution satellite precipitation estimates with a novel statistical approach able to quantify changes in return levels relevant for engineering and risk management and to attribute the observed trends to changes in the events intensity and or occurrence while a similar framework was recently used to investigate extreme sub daily precipitation in the eastern italian alps assuming spatial homogeneity of the trends dallan et al 2022 to the authors knowledge this is the first time this approach is applied over a wide area here continental using distributed here satellite information our application could overcome important limitations in the current state of the art for what concerns the attribution of observed trends in extremes to specific changes in precipitation climatology over wide ungauged regions of the earth specifically we a quantify trends in extreme daily precipitation amounts and extreme return levels at the local and mesoscale b investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed changes and c quantify differences in the changes detected for annual maximum daily amounts and extreme return levels at different spatial scales 2 methods 2 1 precipitation data this study is based on data from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps version 2 funk et al 2015 which covers the period 1981 2019 39 years with global land only daily precipitation estimates at 0 05 resolution this dataset is chosen as it represents one of the few options currently available to represent extreme daily precipitation at local and coarser scales for i a region where convection dominates extremes and for ii a sufficiently long time period to allow the investigation of temporal changes in fact other candidate satellite based precipitation products generally start about two decades later when passive microwave sensors were first deployed and are subject to important temporal inhomogeneities in both number and type of sensors included in the estimation reanalysis products could represent an alternative but cannot resolve convective processes due to the insufficient resolution of the current models and recent studies recommend the use of alternative sources when it comes to extremes while we recommend caution for all products dependent on their intended application this particularly applies to reanalyses which show the most divergence across results alexander et al 2020 the chirps algorithm is based on infrared ir cold cloud duration based precipitation estimates from the geostationary satellite constellation and a rain gauge merging procedure the high resolutions granted by ir are critical for sampling short living local and mesoscale convective systems which are crucial in determining extremes even at the daily scale laing et al 2008 2011 raghavendra et al 2018 especially in arid regions morin et al 2020 chirps is regarded as a reference in terms of robustness and quality over africa and is largely used in climatological studies e g dinku et al 2018 satgé et al 2020 dembélé et al 2020 it is characterized by sufficiently high resolution and long continuous and homogeneous records to allow multi scale trend detection over a multi decadal period although harrison et al 2019 pointed out that a promising result for identifying regional changes is that numerous satellite products do well at interannual variations in precipitation totals and number of rain days even as well as some gauge only products we limit here the possible impact of biases in the data by examining normalized quantities namely i the average change rates that is the slope of a linear approximation of the trends normalized over the median value of the variable of interest and ii the ratios between change rates similar assumptions have long been adopted for analyzing the scale dependence of extremes in remote sensing observations after frederick et al 1977 the global precipitation climatology center gpcc full data daily v2020 is a 1 gridded dataset based on rain gauge observations ziese et al 2020 being based on direct observations as opposed to the indirect retrievals of the ir estimates it is expected to provide more accurate representations of extremes albeit at coarser spatial scales it covers the period 1982 2019 and is used here as a benchmark for the validation of the assumptions underlying our statistical model section 2 4 2 2 statistical model we estimate extreme return levels using a non asymptotic statistical approach the model relies on information from the so called ordinary as opposed to extreme events which are all the days with non null precipitation amounts wet days assumed here as statistically independent marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 the idea is that when the tail of the distribution of the wet day amounts is known an extreme value distribution describing the emerging extremes can be built from ordinary statistics by explicitly considering the yearly sampling of wet days marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2020 serinaldi et al 2020 the approach directly captures and separates information on the wet day intensity distribution and on wet day occurrence frequency thermodynamics reasoning suggests that the exceedance probability of extreme daily precipitation amounts x decreases as a stretched exponential wilson and toumi 2005 so that the right tail of the wet day distribution can be parametrized with a cumulative distribution function in the form 1 f x λ κ 1 e x λ κ where λ is a scale parameter and κ a shape parameter which defines the tail heaviness sub exponential for κ 1 heavier than exponential for κ 1 see figure s1 in the supporting information for a visual interpretation this tail model was supported by observations over different climatic regimes e g papalexiou et al 2018 marra et al 2019 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 including tropical africa amponsah et al 2022 thresholds to define the tail typically ranged between the 75th and the 90th wet day percentiles mediterranean and continental climates respectively knowing f it is possible to estimate rare daily precipitation associated to extreme yearly non exceedance probabilities p such as the 100 year return levels with p 0 99 by inverting the extreme value distribution 2 p x f x λ κ n where the average number of wet days in a year n is explicitly considered this approach is known as simplified metastatistical extreme value or smev marra et al 2019 marra et al 2020 serinaldi et al 2020 as the model parameters are derived from a relatively large fraction of the wet day amounts they can be estimated for every year in the record thus allowing us to quantify return levels at each year these estimates will be obviously subject to large uncertainties and will not be directly useful for engineering and risk management applications however using trend detection techniques it is possible to evaluate the statistical significance of the changes in these quantities and quantify trend rates e g miniussi and marani 2020 dallan et al 2022 2 3 parameter estimation in our application we define as wet all daily amounts equal or exceeding 0 1 mm at 0 05 resolution and assume independence of the wet day amounts e g zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2019 parameters of the model are computed for every year j n j is the number of wet days λ j and κ j are computed by censoring censoring the magnitude but retaining the weight in probability the portion of data not belonging to the tail section 2 4 and using a least square linear regression in weibull transformed coordinates marani and ignaccolo 2015 2 4 validation of the model assumptions and definition of the tail our statistical model is as good as its underlying assumption the exceedance probability of heavy daily precipitation intensities decays as a stretched exponential this assumption is verified using a specific monte carlo test fig 1 based on the one described in marra et al 2020 to have a quantitatively robust reference for extremes we use the gpcc dataset the test consists of i estimating the model parameters λ θ κ θ by explicitly censoring all the observed annual maxima and the wet day values below a given left censoring threshold θ ii sampling 103 random realizations of reality as if the model assumptions were true n j wet days distributed as the estimated model λ θ κ θ with j 1 m representing years in the record iii extracting the corresponding annual maxima iv testing whether the observed annual maxima are likely samples from the model if more than 5 of these annual maxima lie outside the 95 sampling confidence interval the assumption of having stretched exponential tail above the tested threshold is to be rejected iterating i iv over different thresholds θ permits to identify the portion of the distribution tail which is well described by a stretched exponential that is the lowest threshold above which the model is never rejected left censoring thresholds between the 50th and the 90th percentile are explored if the stretched exponential tail is rejected also for the highest left censoring threshold we consider the assumption as not verified because the tail is expected to be a climatic property and the test is subject to a level of stochasticity the left censoring thresholds used in the study are selected by smoothing the obtained values 1 resolution over 3 3 windows and rounding to the closest 5th percentile a schematic of the workflow is reported in fig 1 it is worth noting three aspects concerning this test first for the sake of the test the stationarity assumption behind the test a unique tail is tested using all the years can be considered verified even when significant trends are observed figure s2 second the test is robust the probability of not rejecting stretched exponential tails in presence of power type tails which are the most widely supported alternative to stretched exponential tails for the case of precipitation is zero or close to zero for thresholds lower than the 90th percentile conversely the probability of wrong rejection in presence of stretched exponential tails can be close to 10 figure s3 last our definition of the left censoring thresholds implies that the model parameters are not sensitive to small changes in the thresholds see marra et al 2019 2 5 spatial scales two spatial scales are examined i local scale represented by chirps data at the original resolution 0 05 5 km at the equator ii mesoscale represented by the data aggregated to 1 resolution 100 km at the equator to do so a 1 aggregated value is computed for each wet day of the 0 05 pixels by spatially averaging the original data over the 20 20 surrounding pixels 2 6 detection of temporal trends the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 is used to test the statistical significance level α 0 05 of the trends in the model parameters in the largest daily amounts observed rx1 and modeled rx1 modelled in each year and in the modeled return levels 100 year return levels are here shown at both local and mesoscale the 2 year return levels are the theoretical median of rx1 and are here used as model quantification of the change rate in the rx1 rx1 modeled possible serial correlation in the data is accounted for by pre whitening the data it should be noted that correlation was small and results without pre whitening are indistinguishable yearly estimates of the distribution parameters may be subject to systematic biases especially for what concerns the estimated tail heaviness usually tail heaviness is overestimated when few data are available for parameter estimation to limit the impact of this issue the magnitude of the trends is here quantified using the average change rate computed as the ratio between the non parametric sen s slope estimator sen 1968 and the median value of the variable in the time series this assumes that the biases in the estimated parameters are stationary 3 results and discussion 3 1 tail properties of extreme daily precipitation over africa the right tail of the distribution of daily precipitation amounts is found to be well described by a stretched exponential model for 87 of the continent see fig 2 with definitions of the right tail ranging from the largest 50 of the wet day amounts light blue in the fig 2a to the largest 10 dark blue in the remaining 13 of the continent dotted areas our test rejects the assumption of stretched exponential tail within the tested ranges of tail definitions 50th to 90th percentiles as mentioned above this is in line with synthetic experiments showing that under the examined conditions record length yearly number of wet days the test may provide 5 11 false rejections see figure s3 however in two regions one in east africa and one in southern angola the spatial clustering of these pixels suggests that extreme precipitation could have different types of tail or that tails could here consist in smaller fractions of the data e g only the largest 5 nevertheless since only few significant trends are detected in these areas see next section this is not expected to affect our results after left censoring an average of at least 10 data points per year are available for parameter estimation in most of the continent fig 2c granting a proper estimation of the two tail parameters fewer data points are available over the sahara desert and in other isolated areas in the eastern and southern portions of the continent 3 2 trends in annual maximum daily precipitation the trends of the annual maximum daily precipitation rx1 at the local scale are significant over 20 3 of the continent fig 3 a the area in central africa characterized by strong negative trends area 4 in fig 3a contributes 60 of the significant trends however the reliability of the results is dubious because the area is almost completely devoid of ground observations in particular central africa is a region where rain gauge data are scarce with consequences on the accuracy of the satellite precipitation products which strongly rely on gauge data for their generation as is the case of chirps the case of the central africa will be further discussed below section 3 2 1 without considering the central african area 37 of the significant trends is positive and 63 negative positive trends are reported in the sahel 2 in kenya and tanzania 5 and in the coastal regions of the gulf of guinea 3 and of the middle east 1 negative trends are reported in the middle east 1 in inland areas of west africa 3 and 2 in south africa and namibia 6 and in the above mentioned region in central africa extending from sudan to angola 4 similar trends are reported at the mesoscale 1 figure s4 the fraction of significant trends in the six examined areas ranges from 15 to 20 1 and reaches 77 in area 4 13 4 74 at the mesoscale and are thus larger than the 5 false positives expected at the used significance level the interested reader can find quantitative information on the parameters estimated for the different areas in table s1 these values are reasonable when compared to other studies in which stretched exponential tails have been used e g marra et al 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 nevertheless as discussed in section 2 6 we deem their quantitative values less reliable than the average change rates examined here harrison et al 2019 compared trends derived from multiple precipitation products including chirps finding no statistically significant change in the extremes direct comparison with their results is however difficult because they focused on a small portion of the continent in which our results show no statistically significant trend see fig 1 in harrison et al 2019 similarly pfahl et al 2017 reported an increase in rx1 from global climate models in central africa for the period 1983 2000 a result difficult to compare with ours due to the different examined period and to the known deficiency of global models in resolving the convective processes that are key to extreme precipitation the trends we observe however are in line with results from both chaney et al 2014 who reported positive trends in the sahel region and mtewele et al 2021 who used multi sensor satellite estimates from the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa for the period 1998 2018 and found negative trends in both frequency and intensity of extremes in the western portion of central africa 3 2 1 the case of the central africa the area over which consistent negative trends in extremes are observed includes the tropical forests of the congo basin and vast savannah regions d onofrio et al 2018 since most of the precipitable water available in these regions is related to the forest or to other vegetation types o connor et al 2021 vegetation precipitation feedbacks may represent an important mechanism behind these observations e g due to wildfire generated aerosols or woody encroachment a hypothesis to be explored more in detail in the future other authors recently highlighted a decrease in precipitation amounts and forest greenness over congo with an increase of the dry season length jiang et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 convection from deep convection to mesoscale convective systems is responsible for most of precipitation in this area being the congo basin one of the three most convective regions in the world together with amazonia and the indonesian maritime continent raghavendra et al 2018 used 35 years 1982 2016 of geostationary infrared brightness temperatures to explore the changes in the magnitude and area of cold cloud top temperatures as a proxy for the number and size of individual thunderstorms at different intensities the results suggest that larger and more intense thunderstorms are occurring in this area during the last decades with an increase in the mean size of thunderstorms with lower cloud top temperature to the detriment of the mean size of thunderstorms with higher cloud top temperature this contributes to a drier lower troposphere and a wetter higher troposphere a weaker ascent at both the lower and upper troposphere and an overall reduction of the soil moisture these changes were found to be associated with a significant decrease in april may june precipitation over the congo basin more recently alber et al 2021 analyzed the trend in thunderstorm activity from 1983 to 2018 exploiting the gálvez davidson index feedback mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed thunderstorm intensification which include the cooling and moistening of the mid troposphere drying and warming at the surface and lower troposphere and a decrease in vertical stability and convective inhibition despite the lower level of accuracy expected for chirps estimates in this region the above factors are conducive to the significant negative trend we observe for the past 40 years which is also in agreement with rather independent satellite observations for the last 20 years mtewele et al 2021 3 3 evaluation of the statistical model our statistical model proves robust at reproducing the observed trends both in qualitative spatial patterns and quantitative explained variance terms fig 3b specifically the model explains 89 of the variance 91 at the mesoscale of the significant change rates r 2 computed for all pixels in which the observed trend is significant notably only 45 of the variance 43 at the mesoscale is explained in area 4 while 76 90 of the variance 68 92 at the mesoscale is explained in the other areas remarkably the model run explicitly censoring the observed annual maxima rx1 and thus providing independent estimates of their trends explains as much as 72 of the variance 67 at the mesoscale of the significant trends in rx1 fig 4 this suggests that the proposed statistical model could represent an opportunity for examining trends in extremes in situations in which the observed modelled extremes are not fully trusted e g masunaga et al 2019 rajulapati et al 2020 these results support the use of the statistical model to i investigate the relation between daily precipitation climatology and extreme and ii quantify trends in rare exceedance probabilities which cannot be extracted from observations alone as detailed in the following sections 3 4 link between changes in precipitation climatology and extremes the largest portion of variance explained by the model is to be ascribed to the distribution tail heaviness shape parameter of the stretched exponential distribution κ which is negatively correlated to extreme return levels see figure s1 with 25 explained variance 38 at the mesoscale fig 3e and figure s4e changes in the scale of the distribution λ explain 13 of the variance 21 at the mesoscale and changes in the number of wet days 4 12 at the mesoscale fig 3d and f figure s4d and s4f this implies that at both scales the trends in extremes are mostly related to changes in the distribution of daily precipitation amounts rather than to changes in the occurrence frequency of storms and mostly in the proportion of very extreme events an interesting exception is the sahel area 2 where the number of wet days explains 11 of the variance versus 0 of the tail heaviness this confirms previous findings based on in situ and satellite observations panthou et al 2014 taylor et al 2017 chagnaud et al 2021 possible physical explanations are associated with changes in sea surface temperature convective available potential energy and vertical wind shear and are discussed by biasutti 2019 and tramblay et al 2020 noting that a uniform scaling of extreme precipitation with temperature such as 7 c 1 expected according to the clausius clapeyron relation e g o gorman and schneider 2009 translates into a change in the scale parameter only the trends we observe in the model parameter imply that severity dependent scaling factors are essential to adequately capture the complex dependences of extreme precipitation and that trends in extreme return levels are likely different from the trends one can detect using observed annual maxima 3 5 different changes of annual maxima and extreme return levels at local and mesoscales significant trends in the 100 year return levels q100 derived from the statistical model are shown in fig 3c figure s4c for the mesoscale overall 19 6 of the continent experienced significant changes in the 100 year events this implies that the stochastic uncertainties characterizing yearly estimates of extreme return levels as high as the 100 year events using our model is comparable to the one characterizing annual maxima the spatial patterns of these changes largely follow the ones of rx1 with no cases of opposing trends but their magnitude is always 99 99 of the significant pixels greater fig 5 trend rates in the 100 year events in africa since 1981 have been 44 stronger in median than the ones in rx1 both at local and mesoscales this is consistent with previous findings based on extreme precipitation temperature scaling observations and models in several regions of the earth e g myhre et al 2019 kelder et al 2020 lenderink et al 2021 visser et al 2021 the ratio between change rates of extremes at local and mesoscales can be interpreted as a proxy of the changes in extreme storm structure and is directly related to the areal reduction factors fig 6 the previously reported redistribution of moisture toward the storm center in response to global warming e g wasko et al 2016 armon et al 2022 translates into expected stronger positive trends at the local scale or stronger negative trends at the mesoscale this is qualitatively confirmed in areas 3 positive trends and 6 negative and implies an increased reduction of extremes with area in some parts of eastern africa and southern africa fig 6b and d however other regions present opposite behaviors such as area 1 both positive and negative trends area 2 positive and area 4 negative this smoothing translates into a decreased reduction of extremes with area and confirms previous findings based on the sahel vischel et al 2019 overall the distribution of these ratios is rather dispersed so that local situations might largely differ from the behaviors highlighted here specific cases need to be examined individually when interpreting our results in terms of risk assessment and water resources management we should consider systems that respond to daily or sub daily extreme rainfall such as floods and flash floods in catchments with areas up to a few thousand square kilometers or landslides and debris flows in headwater catchments and steep slopes the faster changes in extreme return levels here demonstrated by the 100 year events imply that changes in the potential occurrence of these hazards could have happened faster than what measured by usual trends on rx1 the strong positive trends observed in area 2 sahel and 5 eastern africa for example could be indicative of a quick increase in the probability of flood and landslides in these areas over the past decades as perhaps exemplified by recent events wainwright et al 2021 similarly the change we report in the areal reduction factors can suggest different changes between landslides flash flood risk which respond to local precipitation and flood risk water availability which are mostly impacted by the volumes of precipitation over relatively vast areas however it should be recalled that rainfall is far from being the only factor affecting these processes e g sharma et al 2018 additional work based on hydrological models or slope stability models able to include observed trends in extremes antecedent conditions and other relevant processes is needed to thoroughly address these issues quantitatively 4 conclusions changes in annual maximum daily precipitation and low probability extremes relevant for engineering and risk management that occurred over africa since 1981 are examined using a high resolution satellite precipitation product chirps version 2 and a novel non asymptotic statistical approach based on ordinary as opposed to extreme value statistics temporal trends in annual maxima rx1 and extreme return levels at local scales 0 05 and mesoscales 1 are detected quantified and compared and are then attributed to changes in wet day occurrence and characteristics of the wet day intensity distribution roughly 20 of the continent experienced significant trends mann kendall α 0 05 in annual maxima rx1 with both positive sahel kenya and tanzania coastal regions of the gulf of guinea coastal regions of the middle east and negative middle east inland areas of west africa south africa and namibia and a vast region in central africa extending from sudan to angola changes the statistical model explains 89 91 at the mesoscale of the variance in the observed change rates of rx1 and 72 67 at the mesoscale of the variance when run with explicit censoring of the observed annual maxima it can thus be trusted for investigating causal relations between wet day intensity distribution and number of wet days on one side and extremes on the other and to quantify past trends in rare exceedance probabilities provided its assumptions are met it could represent a viable option for examining trends in situations in which the observed modelled extremes are not fully trusted here we evaluated the validity of the model assumption using observational data and a robust monte carlo based statistical test changes in the tail heaviness of the wet day intensity distribution that is the proportion between heavy and extreme events explain most 25 of the variance in the changes in rx1 as opposed to 13 of the intensity distribution scale parameter and 4 of the number of wet days these results imply a differential rate of change between rx1 and rarer extremes extreme return levels changed faster than rx1 44 faster for the case of 100 year events both for positive and negative trends increased reduction of extremes with area suggesting a redistribution of moisture toward the storm center is reported for coastal areas of the gulf of guinea positive trends and southern africa negative while an opposite behavior is found for the middle east positive and negative trends sahel positive and central africa negative these results imply locally dependent impacts on the areal reduction factors used to derive extreme return levels at the areal scale e g at the catchment scale our quantitative results depend on the ability of chirpsv2 to represent changes in the wet day precipitation intensities and in precipitation occurrence key features of our model and on the local adequacy of the stretched exponential tail model and of the assumptions underlying the trend analyses but are robust with respect to stochastic uncertainties and errors in the satellite estimation of extreme precipitation credit authorship contribution

8554,ice jam floods ijfs are a key concern in cold region environments where seasonal effects of river ice formation and break up can have substantial impacts on flooding processes different statistical machine learning and process based models have been developed to simulate ijf events in order to improve our understanding of river ice processes to quantify potential flood magnitudes and backwater levels and to undertake risk analysis under a changing climate assessment of ijf risks under future climate is limited due to constraints related to model input data however given the broad economic and environmental significance of ijfs and their sensitivity to a changing climate robust modelling frameworks that can incorporate future climatic changes and produce reliable scenarios of future ijf risks are needed in this review paper we discuss the probable impacts of future climate on ijfs and provide suggestions on modelling ijfs under both past and future climates we also make recommendations around existing approaches and highlight some data and research opportunities that could lead to further improvements in ijf modelling and prediction keywords ice jam flood future climate cold regions modelling risk assessment 1 introduction river ice is an integral component of the hydrological and hydraulic regimes of cold region rivers and affects an extensive portion of the global hydrologic system particularly in the northern hemisphere yang et al 2020 it regulates numerous hydrologic geomorphic biological and chemical process in rivers and provides important socio economic and ecological benefits prowse 2001 however river ice can also cause extensive damage to infrastructure navigation and hydroelectric production and result in detrimental effects to river ecology and water quality beltaos and burrell 2015 river ice impacts local river hydraulics in many different ways the presence of ice cover and ice jams obstruct river flows and increase stage due to additional resistance and reduced cross sectional area which can occasionally lead to backwater flooding beltaos and prowse 2001 similarly in some small river systems freezing of riverbeds may block groundwater inflows which may also generate flooding through aufeis daly 2013 ice jams can also change river channel properties and flow paths through ice scouring and erosion boucher et al 2009 a schematic view of a river ice jam and ice jam induced backwater level compared against open water or ice cover conditions is shown in fig 1 it reveals that ice jam induced backwater levels are substantially higher than backwater levels that arise from intact stationary floating ice cover or open water conditions previous studies e g prowse and beltaos 2002 have also suggested that ice jams can result in two to three times higher water depths in river channels for the same or even lower discharges compared to open water ice free conditions furthermore a range of possible backwater staging can occur due to the presence of ice for a given discharge which makes it challenging to predict the magnitude of an ice jam flood ijf lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 the complexity of ice jamming can bring into question hydrometric measurements and often despite the best efforts from the investigating hydrometric agency the data can be difficult to interpret and be unreliable de rham et al 2020 measurements of river velocities during ice jam formation are far too dangerous to carry out during ice jam flooding events in such cases discharge could be ideally estimated upstream of the ice jam in open water conditions but such open water conditions could be hundreds of kilometers upstream making the discharge estimates uncertain in other cases the gauge house and equipment could be damaged and water levels can go unreported for weeks retrospective analysis is often needed to fill gaps in data but these values are typically listed as estimated and should be treated with care de rham et al 2020 recently published a dataset of ice formation and breakup based on careful analyses of 196 gauge locations operated by the water survey of canada globally the ice jam database of the united states army corps of engineers carr et al 2015 is perhaps the most comprehensive national database available the database that has historical records since 1780 shows that more than 22 500 ice jam events have been recorded in united states alone as of october 26 2017 and about 10 of those events have resulted in some extent of flooding rokaya et al 2018b the financial cost of ijfs has never been calculated globally french 2018 estimated an annual cost of us 300 million per year for north america based on 2017 costing estimates while adjusting historical inflation however these approximations could be low considering single events have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for instance the recent ijf event along the athabasca river in fort mcmurray in western canada in april 2020 resulted in one human fatality forced 13 000 people out of their homes and caused more than half a billion dollars in insured damages derworiz 2020 however detailed ice jam damage records are not available in most ice jam prone countries river ice processes including ijfs are very sensitive to climate in fact changes in the ice regime phenology and properties is widely considered as one of the proxy indicators of climate change magnuson et al 2000 prowse and brown 2010 therefore given the broad economic and environmental significance of ijfs and their sensitivity to changing climate robust modelling frameworks that can incorporate future climatic change and produce reliable scenarios of future ijf risks are necessary however ice related research under future climate has been largely limited to assessment of changes in the timing of ice cover freeze up and breakup total ice duration and in few cases on ice thickness the evaluation of more complex issues such as ice jams under future climate are rare in the literature and an appropriate ijf modelling framework that incorporates future climatic conditions is not well established turcotte et al 2020 this is mainly because flow estimates at breakup are not reliable at least at most sites which makes flow forecasting challenging especially in a context where ice induced flow variations are not considered in hydrological models similarly river ice models need several input parameters some of which are difficult to determine the main objective of this review article is to provide practical suggestions for modelling ijfs under past and future climate ijf modelling here refers to simulation of backwater levels arising from ice jams and does not include other modelling areas such as inundation mapping or modeling of impacts this article first discusses the observed and expected climatic effects on river ice processes including ijfs in section 2 descriptions on how historical ijf events are simulated using different types of river ice models i e statistical empirical and process based models are provided in section 3 a generic framework for modelling ijfs under future climate is also presented highlighting different input data requirements and potential approaches to acquire such input data the paper concludes with identification of key research opportunities that can further improve ijf modelling capabilities in section 4 2 climatic effects on river ice processes 2 1 observed climatic effects on river ice processes previous studies have found a decreasing trend in the overall duration of the ice cover season across the northern hemisphere in europe ice cover duration was reported to decrease by 46 days per century in the oder river along the border between germany and poland between 1956 and 2015 marszelewski and pawłowski 2019 the lower part of the danube river in romania also experienced a reduction in ice cover duration by 28 days per century in the 1937 2016 period ionita et al 2018 whereas the lower reaches of the drava river in hungary observed a decline of 14 days per century in the 1875 2014 period takács and kern 2015 shiklomanov and lammers 2014 reported similar patterns 12 to 37 days per century in large russian rivers e g ob yenisey lena etc draining to the arctic between 1955 and 2012 in response to recent warming in the arctic in the baltic region klavins et al 2009 reported that the major rivers e g narva parnu daugava etc showed a declining trend in ice cover duration from 28 to 63 days per century in the yellow river in asia a reduction of 14 2 days per century in ice cover duration between 1954 and 2015 was reported by si et al 2015 in canada ice cover duration was reported to decrease by 22 days per century in the red river in manitoba during the 1798 1981 period rannie 1983 recently chen and she 2020 studied the patterns of breakup timing across canada in response to climate change their results showed earlier breakup trends in western canada and canada s arctic where spring warming trends are more evident in atlantic canada where warming trends are weak or even negative cooling mixed or later breakup trends were observed similarly in the united states white et al 2007 reported that the ice cover duration declined from 15 to 37 days across four rivers in maine whereas in the interior of alaska a decreasing trend in ice cover duration by 4 days per century during the 1972 2016 period was found by brown et al 2018 these results suggest that ice cover duration in northern rivers has decreased across the northern hemisphere in response to warming temperatures in the last few decades beltaos and prowse 2009 a recent study by yang et al 2020 using landsat images also showed that globally river ice cover duration has decreased from 0 3 to 4 3 percentage points at monthly scale between 2008 2018 and 1984 1994 the reported decline in ice cover duration in rivers in the northern hemisphere from historical observations is shown in fig 2 it reveals that in most of the northern regions a decreasing trend of a month or more per century in ice cover duration is already recorded but there are also indicators of regional disparities in trend direction and magnitude these trends of later freeze up and early breakup resulting in shorter ice cover durations over much of the northern hemisphere closely corresponds to the increasing air temperature trends observed over most of this region which has been most pronounced at the end of the last century prowse et al 2011a previous studies e g ginzburg 1992 soldatova 1992 have found fairly high correlations r2 0 6 0 7 between mean air temperatures and ice cover durations in fact many regional e g prowse et al 2002 and global river ice studies e g yang et al 2020 have used an air temperature based index such as 0 c isotherm or statistical models based on air temperature to predict future ice regimes note that the study period is not consistent across the studies in fig 2 so the trend magnitudes should not be directly compared a larger pool of studies is also available that have reported only freeze up trends or breakup trends or duration of lake ice cover but not the duration of river ice cover we also excluded the literature that reported trends derived from modelling studies since they could give misleading interpretations if compared directly with trends from observed data which are not subject to the same modelling uncertainties furthermore the figure includes both regulated and unregulated rivers and in regulated systems reservoir release makes it challenging to derive direct relationships between large scale climate variables and river ice regimes therefore the figure should be catiously interpreted a smaller number of studies are available on ice thickness probably owing to the fact that measuring ice thickness in a river is a relatively difficult and often dangerous endeavor one long term ice thickness database is available from the piscataquis river in central maine in the united states where huntington et al 2003 reported a decreasing trend of 26 cm per century between 1912 and 2001 in another study of several large russian rivers vuglinsky 2006 found a decline in ice thicknesses by 2 to 14 cm in the 1980 2000 period compared to the 1950 1979 period while a larger pool of literature is available on climatic effects on river ice e g freeze up and breakup trends total ice cover duration and in few cases ice thickness only a handful of research has investigated the climatic impacts on more complex processes such as ice jams mid winter breakup ice cover breakup in winter months due to abrupt increases in air temperature and or discharge and ijfs among the available studies beltaos 2002 studied the mid winter breakup in the saint john river in eastern canada from 1926 to 1997 using a long term hydrodynamic data the study recorded a significant rise in winter discharge in response to increased temperature that is large enough to initiate mid winter breakup occurrences newton et al 2017 identified 52 mid winter breakup events in western canada 1950 2008 and alaska 1950 2014 and investigated their hydro climatic drivers some recent studies e g das et al 2020 turcotte et al 2020 beltaos and bonsal 2021 have examined the impacts of future climate on ijfs across different rivers 2 2 expected climatic effects on river ice processes and ice jam floods although global climate models may differ substantially in projected changes of future precipitation the projections for increased air temperatures are consistent pachauri et al 2014 as a result of increases in air temperatures ice cover duration is projected to reduce under future climatic conditions due to delays in freeze ups and earlier breakups prowse et al 2007 a recent global study of river ice comparing ice cover duration in the 2080 2100 period against the 2009 2029 period projected that the ice cover durations globally will decline by about a week under the modest representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 whereas under the higher emission scenario rcp 8 5 the reduction can be up to about 17 days yang et al 2020 other regional and catchment scale studies across the northern hemisphere e g borshch et al 2001 andrishak and hicks 2008 timalsina et al 2015 in which similar assessments were performed have also arrived to similar conclusions on reduced ice cover durations under future climatic conditions while assessments of freeze up breakup dates or ice cover duration under future climatic conditions may be relatively straight forward to establish river ice extremes such as ijfs are difficult to predict since alongside air temperature several other hydro climatic and geomorphological factors come into play these factors themselves are susceptible to climate warming to varying degrees therefore their future implications are challenging to anticipate for instance a warmer spring may induce more frequent thermal breakup events gradual breakup of ice cover due to decrease in ice strength from increasing air temperature and may have less potential for dynamic ice jam events high discharge dislodges ice cover from the riverbank before thermal deterioration can occur this would likely be attributable to the deterioration of ice strength suggesting that the severity of ijfs may be reduced however this reduction in risk could be offset if the magnitude of snowmelt runoff in spring substantially increases prowse et al 2011b thus allowing for dynamic break up early when ice may be more intact importantly some climatic variables such as precipitation have the potential to influence both the driving and resisting forces that affect breakup severity prowse and beltaos 2002 perhaps owing to these complexities studies in understanding future river ijf outcomes are limited in the research literature a status on current knowledge and research approaches to address the impacts of climate change on breakup ice jams in canada was recently presented by turcotte et al 2019 the authors highlighted the importance of ijf prediction emphasized on conducting representative ijf future trend studies suggested that climate change may alter ice jam parameters and discussed some existing ijf modelling methods the expected outcomes of future air temperature and streamflow changes on the severity of different types of ijfs is provided in fig 3 highlighting potential changes in seasonal flood possibilities in the fall freeze up floods flooding that occurs from freeze up jams due to ice cover consolidation may occur left column of fig 3 although the majority of cold region catchments may only experience delays in ice cover formation in some temperate regions the water temperature may not be cold enough to form frazil ice such scenarios can result in a low probability of ijfs during the freeze up period turcotte et al 2019 in contrast if the weather is cold enough to form frazil ice then ice cover formation will occur the ice cover could be thinner or thicker depending upon hydro meteorological conditions the thinner ice cover may also go through a consolidation process and result in thicker ice covers this is usually observed in regulated rivers where initial ice covers may collapse and form juxtaposed ice covers due to abrupt changes in discharge these thicker ice covers have the potential to cause ijfs during a freeze up period hicks et al 2009 but if the ice cover is very thick thermal melting may also occur during the fall however streamflows in the river will also play an important role in the fall if the flows during this period are low then the probability of occurrence and severity of ijfs would decrease since there is not enough force to dislodge ice covers and cause ice jamming on the contrary increased discharge at freeze up will likely increase the probability of ice jam flooding the higher discharges can maintain open water reaches over a prolonged period of time and can also result in wider channel cross sectional areas both of these will generate more frazil ice huokuna et al 2020 in low gradient rivers higher streamflows may also increase the turbulence leading to more shoving and thickening of initial ice covers they also have the potential to break the ice covers and result in ice jamming lindenschmidt 2020 during the winter period middle column of fig 3 warmer air temperatures could deteriorate the strength of ice covers and larger winter flows may exert higher forces on ice covers these processes could lead to more frequent mid winter breakup events see fig 3b it is important to note however that the interactions are not so straight forward in winter the snow on ice covers can offer some degree of insulation although in absence of explicit quantification it may appear from the figure that increased air temperatures and discharges have equal importance but in reality discharge can play a larger role in mid winter breakup compared to other variables beltaos 2002 an opposing result low probability of mid winter ijf may be achieved with decreases in air temperatures and discharges in winter the colder temperature could increase the strength of ice cover and make them less prone to breakup in mid winter particularly if discharges are low low flows cannot exert enough force to dislodge the ice covers from riverbanks thus the ice cover will only disappear later in spring with increased temperature and discharge however if breakup does occur in mid winter more severe flooding could result nevertheless the literature e g prowse et al 2011a yang et al 2020 suggests that this scenario is less likely compared to the previous scenario of increased air temperature and discharge in winter in the spring breakup period right column of fig 3 increases in air temperatures can reduce the ice strength and result in thermal breakup events that are less severe in contrast the lower air temperatures prevent such thermal deteriorations so the ice cover may remain relatively intact in terms of structural integrity and end of winter strength for a longer duration of time until breakup eventually occurs on the other hand if breakup flows are not large enough to dislodge the ice cover then the probability of ice jamming is low since the ice cover will gradually deteriorate in place before being mobilized but if breakup flows are large enough to dislodge the ice covers before the thermal decay of ice cover occurs a dynamic breakup event will occur which has a higher probability of leading to ijfs beltaos 2003b in some cases higher discharges can also wash out ice or ice jams from the river reach and prevent backwater flooding however such flushing of ice and ice jams can still arrest ice and form ice jams at downstream ice jam prone locations therefore this reduces the probability of ijf in the initial reach but that transfers the risk to downstream reaches the probable future impacts on ice jam floods discussed here are only from the perspective of air temperature and discharge there are a number of other hydro climatic e g precipitation wind etc and geomorphological e g channel constriction presence of islands abrupt changes in slopes etc factors that may also play enabling or resisting roles in the probability of ijf it is possible to have more complex situations such as increased temperature but decreased discharge or vice versa during mid winter or increased temperature and increased discharge or vice versa during spring breakup or no changes at all in temperature or discharge for those circumstances ijf risks are difficult to generalize since temperature and discharge may compensate each other or the outcome may depend upon relative changes in temperature or discharge 3 modelling ice jam floods 3 1 modelling historical ice jam flood events practitioners and researchers have used statistical empirical and process based approaches to understand and simulate historical ijf events these different methods arise from a need to understand and predict ijf at a variety of locations across cold regions a basic workflow of these different types of models including their input data requirements are shown in fig 4 the process based approaches require additional information e g channel bathymetry as they strive for a mechanistic representation of ice jam behavior a traditional statistical models early ice jam flood modelling efforts were largely based on traditional statistical models e g regression models these models were developed based on a conceptual understanding of physical processes and involved a simplified mathematical formalization to estimate ijfs three types of statistical methods have been widely used in ijf modelling threshold models regression models and discriminant function analysis in the following sections we briefly describe how each statistical model is set up and applied model selection the first step in the model setup involves the selection of the modelling approach which is often guided by availability of input data the objective of the study and modellers own knowledge and experience threshold models are simplistic in nature and involve identifying a threshold value of a single or multiple hydro meteorological variables from analyses of historical data to predict a dichotomous outcome such as ice jam flooding or no ice jam flooding e g tuthill et al 1996 regression models establish empirical relationships between inputs independent variables such as hydro meteorological or river ice data and outputs dependent variable that is to be simulated or predicted such as breakup flow or water level using a linear regression equation mahabir et al 2006 discriminant function analysis performs multivariate tests to determine the differences between groups e g ice jam or no ice jam based on measurable predictor variables white and daly 2002 model setup the common input data used in statistical methods are winter precipitation air temperature minimum mean and maximum daily temperatures air temperature based indexes cumulative degree days of freezing and cumulative degree days of melting thawing snow water equivalent swe discharge freeze up level and ice cover thickness although threshold models can be set up based on a single variable in practice often multiple variables or indices and in some cases even some type of method to assign weights to different variables based on perceived relative importance of variables are used this is mainly because ice jam flooding is a complex phenomenon not easily described by a single variable threshold values can also be estimated from the regression of historical data tuthill et al 1996 developed such a threshold model to distinguish ice jam and no jam years based on winter peak discharges for the winooski river in vermont united states there are numerous examples in the literature of multivariate statistical methods robichaud 2003 used multiple linear regression to predict maximum ice jam induced stage in the athabasca river at fort mcmurray in western canada de coste et al 2017 used multiple linear regression to develop relationship between five input variables i e length of the jam toe location of the jam discharge toe shift of the delta jam and the lake level and one output variable ice induced water level for the hay river delta in northern canada generating a series of regression equations logistic regression models have also been used which applies nominal ordinal or interval ratio variables or a mixture of all three in contrast to linear regression which requires continuous variables white 1996 discriminant function analysis determines the combination of hydro meteorological and river ice variables that can be used to discriminate between ice jam or no jam events white and daly 2002 perform validation all of the statistical models can be evaluated using cross validation or re substitution methods in cross validation a subset of data can be used to develop the model and the remaining data are then used for validation however since ijf are not frequent events and extreme events can even wash away observation gauges it is often difficult to get a long term observation data series particularly for large ice jam prone rivers in the case of limited data re substitution methods can be used which uses same data set for both model development and validation model errors in the re substitution validation method can be evaluated based on outcome vs actual value the coefficient of determination is usually used to evaluate the degree of correlation closeness of fit of the equation but average error values and p value to show the strength of relationship can also be calculated similarly regression residuals can also be examined to see if they are random for discriminant function analysis several models can be developed and tested to determine a suitable model based on the selected performance metrics statistical river ice models are extremely site specific and may have limitations in applicability in a changing climate therefore many of the thresholds and regression equations developed for a particular ice jam prone location or under certain historical climatic conditions may not be applicable to other areas or under different climate conditions threshold models also have been largely employed for only qualitative assessments extensive historical data are also required to build a statistical model which may not be available for many ice jam prone sites limiting their applications burrell et al 2015 b machine learning in the last two decades more complex data driven methods such as fuzzy expert systems fes and artificial neural networks ann have become very popular in ijf modelling particularly in the forecasting context we refer to the collection of more complex data driven methods as machine learning algorithms in the following sections we briefly describe how machine learning models are configured and applied in historical or forecasting context model selection similar to statistical method model selection is usually based on study objectives model data requirement and availability and the knowledge and experience of modellers fuzzy logic is a form of artificial intelligence based on the idea of transferring human expertise to a computer algorithm so that the computer can make inferences often providing a logic structure behind the inference the values for inputs and outputs are represented through logical linguistics in the fuzzy logic method therefore compared to statistical models they rely less on historical data fuzzy logic based methods have been widely used in river ice breakup modelling e g mahabir et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 a detailed comparison of the model performance of different fuzzy logic models is available from sun and trevor 2015 artificial neural networks anns are supervised computer algorithms that are capable of modelling complex non linear systems the relationship between input and output variables are established through training which does not require a priori knowledge on the nature of the relationship zhao et al 2012 the ability to simulate the nonlinearity of the underlying process without having to solve complex partial differential equations makes anns popular in ijf modelling tao et al 2008 besides fuzzy logic and ann several other machine learning techniques and multi modal approaches have also been employed to simulate river ice jams sun 2018 applied a stacking multi type model tree for ice cover breakup prediction in the athabasca river at fort mcmurray in western canada sun and trevor 2017 used a combined k nearest neighbor models to predict annual breakup flows in the smoky river at watino in western canada similarly sun and trevor 2018 combined anfis and ann to predict annual ice affected maximum water levels in the athabasca river at fort mcmurray likewise several other machine learning techniques have also been employed e g wang et al 2010 aleshin and malygin 2018 a comprehensive review on ijf modelling using artificial intelligence is available from madaeni et al 2020 model setup fuzzy logic models use if then else rules to define the relationship between inputs and outputs the results of each set of rules are then either combined or defuzzified to obtain the final result the first step in developing fuzzy logic models is to describe input variables using linguistic terms with logical meanings then linguistic terms such as and or or are used to control the interaction of input variables after that using expert knowledge historical evaluation or a combination of both rule bases are developed to define the output membership functions from antecedent combinations of input variables finally defuzzification is performed which evaluates results and converts the solution set into a single crisp value however there are challenges in describing base rules and fine tuning of membership functions like multiple regression models the setup of an ann model requires selection of relevant hydro meteorological and river ice variables which is a critical decision data with errors or data that could skew the results can be identified through statistical analyses and can be removed in the data pre processing stage however statistical analyses may not reveal clear relationships and expert knowledge and interpretation may be required similarly training and validation data sets should also be identified the type of ann model and the number of hidden layers and neurons are also defined there are different types of structures for developing ann models but previous studies e g zhao et al 2012 guo et al 2018 have suggested feed forward neural network modelling using a back propagation algorithm as being the most suitable in ijf modelling finally the performance criteria against which the model is to be evaluated are also selected train calibrate the model fuzzy logic models can be calibrated using a training dataset calibration is usually based on experts subjective knowledge and experience statistical measures such as root mean square error mean average error and coefficient of determination are often used to calibrate the model unlike fuzzy logic models training ann models require a learning process involving training of algorithms the error between the input and output data is minimized in the training process by finding the optimal connection weights and adjusting the weights in the beginning the input weights for all the neurons are set to some random numbers between 0 and 1 but then weights and thresholds for all neurons are adjusted based on the error resulting output vs desired output the process is repeated many times until an acceptable result error is obtained perform validation the cross validation also known as holdout method or split sample method and resubstitution methods that we discussed earlier for statistical model validation are the most common methods used to perform validation of empirical ijf models however for ann often datasets are partitioned into three subsets i e training validation and testing while the algorithm is trained using the training dataset an error in the validation dataset is calculated after each iteration to prevent overfitting or overtraining then the testing dataset is used for an independent validation of the model performance it is important to note that the iterative procedures of neural networks are sensitive to the selected initial weight values and the networks are sometimes trapped by local minima during the training stage which could prevent a solution from reaching the global minimum guo et al 2018 it is also possible that the derived weights of variables are not reasonable and an expert knowledge is needed the reliability of ann models depends upon the quality and quantity of calibration validation data so in the context of ijfs where limited data are available the reliability may be questionable some combination of inputs data may also generate impossible outputs e g implausible ice jam profiles therefore careful judgment is also important in river ice modelling furthermore the models may not be able to perform reasonably under climatic conditions that exceed the range of the historical training data c process based models the traditional statistical and more complex machine learning models may provide reasonable results but they offer limited physical understanding of the system and poor parameter transferability in contrast process based models represent our theoretical understanding of how the world works based on inductive reasoning from observations therefore the focus is not only on model accuracy but also in model fidelity however this also means that the input data requirements and computational costs are significantly larger a previous study of several process based river ice models by carson et al 2011 showed that model performance is dependent on the quality of data available for model calibration model selection different types of process based hydraulic models are available for ijf modelling with their own advantages and limitations as well as their respective niches in the ecosystem of river ice models the majority of models are one dimensional e g hec ras icejam mike 11 rivjam river1d and rivice but a few two dimensional models e g crissp2d and dynarice are also available they also vary on numerical scheme e g implicit finite element method implicit finite difference method iterative procedure runge kutta solutions representation of model state steady vs unsteady state and other model aspects such as source code availability graphical user interface and possibility of parallelization madaeni et al 2020 provides some basic comparison of different river ice hydraulic models whereas more detailed assessment of modelling capabilities of several models is available from carson et al 2011 for a comprehensive assessment of river ice processes and their mathematical modelling shen 2010 is recommended model bathymetry after selecting the model the first step in model development for an area of interest is to configure the model unlike statistical and empirical models the channel bathymetry data is a pre requisite for any process based model setup however it is often difficult to obtain cross sectional data for an area of interest since field surveys of river bathymetry are time consuming and financially expensive endeavors in some small rivers where ice jams are usually only few tens of meters long lidar data at low flows may provide adequate information to derive channel bathymetry alfredsen and juárez 2020 recent advances have demonstrated that remote sensing e g feurer et al 2008 legleiter et al 2009 and sonar and lidar mapping using manned or unmanned aerial vehicles bandini et al 2018 e g mandlburger et al 2020 can also generate satisfactory bathymetry data and could be considered for modelling of ijfs in small to medium size rivers but in large rivers ice jams can sometimes be hundreds of kilometers long and simulating these events requires a model setup for long sections of rivers some models such as hec ras have flexible bathymetric interpolation routines that allows users to infer cross sections between surveyed sites at the desired spacing however careful consideration is essential since such interpolation can lead to erroneous results depending on the nature of the river for instance beltaos et al 2012 showed that some cross section spacing affects the model output and results in implausible ice jam profiles other topographic data such as floodplain elevation may also be needed for mapping of flood inundation defining boundary conditions after model bathymetry is established the next step is to define the hydraulic boundary conditions the most common boundary conditions across river ice hydraulic models are incoming discharge at the upstream reach and water level or a normal depth or a rating curve at the downstream reach of the modelling domain some study locations along the mainstem river may also have incoming or outgoing tributary flows as boundary conditions depending on the nature of the reach being investigated the volume of ice available for ice jamming and the extent of the jam specifying the location of head and toe of the jam are two other common boundary conditions but different models apply different approaches therefore require slightly different boundary conditions for instance only the location of the toe of the ice jam is needed for rivice whereas both the location of head and toe of the ice jam is specified in hec ras similarly the models such as hec ras can also use normal flow depth which is calculated from local water surface slope instead of water level to specify downstream boundary condition beltaos and tang 2013 while discharge and water level data are commonly available from hydrometric gauging stations volume of ice and the extent of the ice jam are challenging to define ice volume is usually estimated based on ice thickness and length and width of the upstream reaches that contribute ice to the modelling reach but one must also subtract shear walls that can account for a large portion of ice volume in some rivers the extent of a jam is usually derived based on field observations aerial photos and satellite based imageries can also be used in this process zhang et al 2017 showed that it is possible to get reasonable estimates of ice volume available for ice jamming using space borne and air borne remote sensing data lindenschmidt 2017 was also able to estimate calibrate the ice volume through model simulations even the discharge and water level data at the upstream and downstream modelling domain may not always be available often gauging stations do not coincide with the modelling domain and in extreme ice jam events measuring gauges can be washed out meteorological data the most important meteorological data required for ice jam flood modelling is air temperature air temperature data are usually available from meteorological stations in or near the study site if station data is not available then gridded temperature data from model simulations or re analysis products can be used such as canadian precipitation analysis mahfouf et al 2007 north american regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 and era5 global reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 models such as river1d use air temperature along with net incoming solar radiation and some heat transfer functions to estimate water temperature to determine water cooling and supercooling for frazil ice generation precipitation is another important meteorological data but often is indirectly accounted for through discharge data however snow data may be used to estimate snow on ice parameterize model model parameterization is the third step in the model development river ice hydraulic models can simulate several river ice processes such as frazil ice generation ice transport formation and progression of ice cover and ice jam formation such physical processes are represented as accurately as possible through model parameterization slush ice and ice cover properties e g porosity thickness ice strength parameters erosion and deposition velocity thresholds roughness coefficients internal friction angle of the ice rubble constituting the jam spacing between successive cross sections and maximum allowable flow velocity underneath the jam are some commonly required parameters in models similar to the boundary conditions different models have different configurations and therefore there is a diversity in approaches to parameterization for instance rivjam mike 11 crissp2d and dynarice account for flow seepage through voids of the jam while icejam river1d hec ras icesim and rivice do not have such a representation the values for parameters that can be measured such as ice thicknesses are largely guided by field observation or by remote sensing whereas initial values for empirical parameters and other parameters that cannot be directly measured or are difficult to measure are inferred from manuals and previous studies a list of lower upper value bounds of most commonly calibrated parameters in hec ras rivjam and rivice models from a review of 41 studies is available from rokaya and lindenschmidt 2020 calibrate and validate model after model parameters are estimated the models are then often calibrated against single or multiple historical ice jam flood events for this calibration process recorded ice jam induced water level data is most often the objective function of choice this is mainly due to the fact that it is available through a manual survey or in some cases derived from high water marks in the channel at the ice jam location if a gauge is present then peak water level may be available however there may be few in most cases just a single gauging stations in the study reach for a more complete calibration of ice jam profiles observed data across the modelling reach is required therefore high water level marks observed after flood water recession or evidence of high water levels during floods recorded through aerial photos or other surveys are often used along the entire reach however additional variables such as flows water temperature ice cover progression rates ice thickness etc can also be used in calibration and validation blackburn and she 2019 the calibration process in most models is through manual adjustments based on operator knowledge use of single event for calibration and need for visual inspections to ensure that the simulated ice jam profiles are plausible makes manual interpretation a likely choice but automatic calibration can also be performed while boundary conditions will remain the same some initial model parameter values can be fine tuned in this calibration process to match the recorded water levels in some cases when values of some boundary conditions such as ice volume or downstream water level are unknown they can also be calibrated e g lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 once the model successfully reproduces observed ice jam conditions the model is validated against other single or multiple ijf events d modelling framework the constraints in modelling ijf events irrespective of model type are associated with model input and forcing information as described above the modelling framework is heavily dependent on available observations the nature of the reach being analyzed and local hydraulic conditions bathymetry discharge water level ice properties ice volume and meteorological forcing information are all necessary parts of the overall framework depending on the availability of field observations and the model input needs synthetic or derived estimates of observations may substitute for field observation as an example it may be necessary to run a hydrological model or use geostatistical methods to infer flow for tributaries that would have a substantial impact on the local flow budget similarly if the deterministic modelling system relies on short wave radiation information this can be assessed through numerical weather model outputs interpolation methods or by using theoretical values based on latitude considering cloud conditions from automated cameras a schematic of the necessary components required to successfully implement different ijf models e g statistical empirical and process based and their interactions are shown in fig 5 this framework can be applied to simulate past or future ijfs the major differences will stem from what method data is used to generate what results for instance ice properties for past events can be estimated using meteorological data from station or re analysis products whereas for estimation of future ice properties data from global or regional climate models gcms rcms can be used or in some cases regionalization methods where ice properties are transferred from a river of comparable size and characteristics whose current climate is representative of the future climate of study reach can be adopted similarly discharge data from gauge measurements can be used for the past events whereas hydrological model derived discharge may be necessary for the simulation of future events the figure shows an overall picture of the use of data within the overall modelling framework not everything shown in the figure is essential to successfully simulate ijfs for instance some models e g traditional statistical models may not need ice jam locations whereas for others either past records remote sensing information traditional knowledge or geospatial information could be used to infer ice jam prone locations the data that can be used will be constrained by the information that is available for the area of interest 3 2 modelling ice jam flood under future climate the major challenges in modelling ijf events under future climatic conditions are associated with unavailability and uncertainties in the model input data more than model structure inadequacy or parametric uncertainty if all required boundary conditions and other forcing data are available under a future climate scenario then ijfs can be simulated using the modelling framework described above therefore in this section we specifically focus on model input data that are essential to set up and run ijf scenarios irrespective of the type of model used in climate impact assessments a future climate scenarios scenarios of future climate can be obtained from different global earth system models esms and regional climate models rcms esms are available from the coupled model inter comparison project https www wcrp climate org wgcm cmip whereas rcms can be obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment https cordex org or other regional programs such as the north american regional climate change assessment program https www narccap ucar edu esms are new generation global climate models that simulate all relevant physical chemical and biological processes of the earth system rcms are similar to esms but for a limited region of the earth they are usually at higher resolution resolve earth system processes at sub esm grid scales and produce climate information in greater detail for a specific region however there are hundreds of global and regional models so selecting a suitable individual member or ensemble of members requires careful assessment the spatial and temporal resolution of available meteorological data is important data with higher spatial resolution are able to capture some of the small scale processes such as convection gravity waves and turbulent transport which are not explicitly represented in most esms if process based hydrological land models are also being used to derive future streamflow then meteorological forcing data at a higher temporal resolution such as hourly or three hourly may be needed for some models e g mesh table 1 shows that many of the previous studies have only used air temperature to derive inferences related to future river ice processes furthermore most of these studies rely on traditional statistical or machine learning models for such estimations e g prowse et al 2010 gebre and alfredsen 2014 yang et al 2020 other process based studies that also use river discharge in assessments often require additional meteorological variables such as precipitation wind speed pressure longwave and shortwave radiation and humidity to derive future streamflows e g morales marín et al 2019a das et al 2020 these meteorological data are usually readily available from esms and rcms some forcing data e g humidity pressure and longwave and shortwave radiations can also be estimated using empirical models such as metsim bennett et al 2020 if they are not readily available from the desired esms or rcms additionally few land surface hydrological models such as variable infiltration capacity vic are also capable of internally estimating some meteorological inputs e g humidity incoming longwave and shortwave radiation and pressure via algorithms that index these quantities to the daily mean temperature temperature range and precipitation livneh et al 2013 finally meteorological data obtained from the esms and rcms and in particular esms may be too coarse and may have large biases chen et al 2013 while ijf modelling studies are usually carried out at local scales e g specific ice jam prone river reach the esm outputs are mostly available at larger spatial resolutions e g 100 km esms do not provide reliable information on hydrologically relevant variables below about 200 km maraun et al 2010 which is very coarse for realistic representations of most meteorological data particularly precipitation many of the studies cited above used esm or rcm change fields and ascribed these changes to existing field observation or local weather station information used in the modelling analysis the majority of studies take this approach in applying a seasonal monthly or annual change to an existing field observation typically a change in temperature as an absolute value derived from a esm rcm grid cell or a percentage change in precipitation again as derived from a co located esm rcm grid is used statistical or dynamic approaches can also be used to downscale the coarser data statistical models use functional relationships to relate esm outputs to locally measured meteorological variables in a region of interest dynamic downscaling can be performed by running finer resolution rcm nested into a esm where esm outputs provide boundary conditions for the rcm runs the uncertainties in the esm rcm data can be addressed broadly through three approaches i e a by reducing biases through the esm rcm model improvement b by quantifying uncertainty through an ensemble approach using multi model ensembles and c correction of model output in post processing using observed meteorological forcing data ehret et al 2012 the first approach of esm rcm model improvement is beyond the scope of most ijf modelling studies but the second and third approaches have been previously used in addressing biases in esm rcm outputs for instance prowse et al 2007 used an ensemble of seven different esms to predict the future ice cover freeze up and breakup patterns in canada similarly huokuna et al 2009 applied the mean of 19 esms to study frazil ice generation under a future climate in the kokemäenjoki river finland whereas timalsina et al 2015 used five esms and one rcm to study the impact of climate change on the ice regime in the orkla river in central norway recently turcotte et al 2020 also applied nine esms to assess the impacts of climate change on the frequency of dynamic breakup events and the risk of ice jam floods in the province of quebec canada on the other hand rokaya et al 2020b used 15 members of canrcm4 that were bias corrected using a reanalysis data to study the impacts of future climate on ijfs in the peace athabasca delta in canada similar bias corrections were performed by gebre and alfredsen 2014 on two esms hadam3h and echam4 in their study of trends and future changes in freshwater ice conditions in norway sweden and finland b hydrological data streamflow in spring plays a particularly important role in river ice cover breakup previous studies e g beltaos 2003a beltaos and carter 2009 have shown that the probability and magnitude of ijf is larger if the discharge during ice cover breakup is higher all other conditions being equal therefore river discharge is an important input variable in statistical empirical models massie et al 2002 states that reliable discharges are also needed to predict future ice jam occurrences using neural networks discharge also serves as an essential upstream boundary condition in process based models future flows at the location of interest can be derived using hydrological models by forcing them with meteorological inputs from the esms rcms this is usually a two step process in the first stage hydrological models are calibrated and validated for a historical time period when the model results are deemed satisfactory considering that simulated flows during the breakup period are uncertain then in the second phase meteorological inputs from esms rcms are fed to generate future hydrological conditions downscaling and bias correction of meteorological inputs from the esms rcms that we discussed above are also applicable here the reviewed literature shows that both conceptual and process based models have been widely used to derive future discharges for ijf modelling timalsina et al 2015 used the hbv model to derive future flows in the orkla river basin in norway whereas huokuna et al 2009 applied the wsfs model in the kokemäenjoki river in finland similarly several process based models have also been applied to generate future flows beltaos et al 2006 used watflood in the peace river canada and rokaya et al 2019a used mesh in the athabasca river canada recently turcotte et al 2020 employed future flows that were derived using hydrotel for the province of quebec in canada while many conceptual models may only need daily precipitation and temperature related input data some process based models require a larger number of meteorological inputs e g precipitation wind speed temperature longwave and shortwave radiation specific humidity and barometric pressure and sometimes at sub daily time steps however some process based models such as vic can run even with daily temporal resolution and only four meteorological inputs precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed nevertheless most hydrological models still do not consider ice effect on flow but some recent hydrological model improvements for water temperature simulations e g morales marín et al 2019b rokaya et al 2020a have shown some progress in this direction the water level at the downstream end of the modelled reach affects the simulation of backwater effects from ice jamming therefore downstream water level at breakup is another important boundary condition in ijf modelling however unlike discharge all river ice hydraulic models do not require downstream water level data the models such as hec ras can also use normal flow depth which is calculated from local water surface slope this becomes particularly handy when water level data at the downstream end of the modelling reach is not known which is usually the case in most ice jam events downstream water level at breakup can also be calibrated when no measured data are available e g lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 another option is to extend the modelling domain further downstream from the toe of the ice jam so that the hydraulic conditions will converge in the upstream direction the future ijf studies that use downstream water level as a boundary condition usually transfer the rating curve derived from historical data to obtain the future downstream water level in this method a rating curve is first established using discharge and observed water level for the end of breakup then future flows estimated from hydrological models are applied to this rating curve to generate future downstream water levels das et al 2020 however this method does not account for the possible changes in future channel geometry that can affect the historical rating curve furthermore the use of rating curve under ice conditions is subject to large degree of uncertainty and therefore should be carefully applied c river ice data rubble ice and ice cover properties porosity and thickness and volume of ice available for jamming are some of the important river ice data needed for a comprehensive modelling of future ijf events different types of models e g empirical statistical and process based can be used to generate these river ice input data and in some cases even historical parameter ranges can be transferred for future studies earlier breakup when ice covers are still intact have the potential to cause large scale ijfs but late breakup that extends thermal deterioration of ice cover strength may not result in significant ice jamming see fig 3 the hydrological model run for future climatic conditions only provides streamflow hydrographs but it does not indicate the breakup flow however breakup flow identification is key in ijf modelling since it is the point in time when ice covers dislodge from their banks previously degree day method accumulated degree days of thawing melting based on air temperature have been used to identify breakup timing the accumulated degree days of thawing melting is calculated by adding the daily mean air temperature above c although bilello 1980 suggests to use 5 c as a base temperature since the majority of river ice covers exhibit 10 or more thinning before the temperature exceeds 0 c hydrological models with capabilities to simulate water temperature e g vic rbm mesh rbm hybrid models e g air2stream or a range of other statistical models can also be applied as a proxy indicator to identify the probable breakup timing when water temperature exceeds 0 c however models need to account for the heat loss required to melt the ice cover to generate realistic results readers are referred to benyahya et al 2007 for a comprehensive review of statistical water temperature models ice thickness is another important river ice variable essential for ijf modelling stefan s equation stefan 1891 is perhaps the most common approach used to estimate ice thickness from air temperature data several modified versions of stefan s equation e g starodumov et al 2017 lamichhane et al 2020 have also been proposed which incorporates snow depth for a better estimate of ice thickness some studies e g park et al 2016 have also used coupled models to estimate ice thicknesses under future climatic conditions the estimated ice thickness is also essential to estimate the total volume of ice that is available for ice jamming which is an important boundary condition and largely dictates the severity of ice jamming it is also important to note that a minimal ice thickness can be required for an ice jam to generate a flood in specific rivers in the future some ice cover will become too weak ice coverage will become increasingly partial whereas in colder region the strength of the ice cover will barely change other river ice parameters such as porosity of the rubble ice forming the jam can be transferred from historical measurements and values available from literature to future scenarios an earlier review by rokaya and lindenschmidt 2020 reported that a rubble ice porosity value of 0 4 was used in 20 different ijf modelling studies using hec ras and rivjam models whereas 21 case studies with rivice used the porosity values from 0 3 to 0 5 a similar range of values can be used to accommodate future climate simulations another option to estimate future ice properties is to use regionalization approach in the method river ice data are obtained for a river of interest from a comparable river size profile and other characteristics whose current climate is representative of the future climate of the river of interest turcotte et al 2020 ensemble modelling can also be performed using ranges of values for different river ice parameters to generate an ensemble of ijf conditions under future climate as shown by das et al 2020 in this method parameter values are randomly derived from the probability density function within certain ranges uniform pdf if extreme value data are available then extreme value methods can be applied using location scale and shape factors expert judgement is essential here to ensure that random sampling does not yield implausible parameter combinations or model outputs d geomorphological data the presence of flow obstacles in rivers such as bridges and islands stationary ice covers hanging dams and channel constrictions due to decreased river width impede the transport capacity and result in ice jamming identification of such locations is important since if the ice jams form upstream of the location of interest than the risk of backwater flooding is low for the location of interest however if the ice jam location is downstream of the location of interest than backwater effects from ice jamming can be significant however it should be noted that an ice jam upstream may evolve into an ice jam downstream historical records traditional knowledge field observations satellite imagery and geospatial models have been used in the past to identify ice jam prone locations e g lindenschmidt and das 2015 de munck et al 2017 potential ice jam locations are known to be largely dictated by channel geomorphology although channel morphology is a dynamic attribute that changes with time the changes are generally slow and gradual except in younger landscapes and for extreme events and often in most ijf studies ice jam prone locations are assumed not to change under future climatic conditions but even in a single river reach there could be numerous potential ice jamming locations studies in the past have used different approaches to address this uncertainty in ice jam location some stochastic methods identify a potential ice jamming reach and then draw random locations along the constrained reach using uniform distribution e g lindenschmidt et al 2019 their assumption is that by doing hundreds of runs with hundreds of potential locations the uncertainty in the future ice jam toe location will be captured this may result in locating ice jam toes in non ice jam prone areas so expert judgement will be required to rule out those cases future studies should also adopt bi or multi modal distributions to incorporate probability of lodgments with sharp changes in slopes meandering or other changes in geomorphological conditions 4 research opportunities for improved modelling and prediction more than a decade ago prowse et al 2008 stressed the need for a comprehensive numerical river ice model coupled with climatic such as esms rcms and hydrological models for detail quantitative predictions of impact of future climate on ijfs recent years have seen some progress with some loose coupling of river ice models with hydrological models driven by esms rcms to assess future ijf risks a coupled model as envisioned by prowse et al 2008 and later reiterated by beltaos and prowse 2009 is yet to be developed although such a coupled model can still only provide hydro meteorological boundary conditions and may not be able to predict some complex features such as the location of toe of jam furthermore unless it is two way coupling some of the important feedbacks between land surface and atmosphere may be missing nevertheless reliable quantitative assessment on future ijf risk can still be made with existing models as discussed earlier in this paper however some data and research opportunities can substantially improve existing modelling capability irrespective of types of models in this section we highlight some of these potential research avenues 4 1 improving process representation there are still some gaps in how some of the important river ice processes are not represented in ijf models often only ice cover thickness along with length and width of contributing river reach is considered in calculating the ice volume available for jamming frazil ice deposits such as hanging dams can also provide an additional volume of ice but it is usually not incorporated in estimates of total ice volume thickness of future hanging dams is also uncertain their mobilization threshold could vary tremendously from year to year previous studies e g beltaos 2003a beltaos and carter 2009 have demonstrated that discharge plays a larger role in the probability and severity of ijfs therefore it is essential to obtain good estimates of future flows to assess future ijf risks however there are outstanding challenges in modelling discharges in cold region catchments most existing hydrological models do not account for river ice formation and breakup therefore the limited capability to simulate ice induced hydrological fluctuations represent a major limitation in simulating future ijfs availability of reliable snow data is also another constraint there is large uncertainty in snow data and snowmelt rates and routing are still difficult to quantify particularly in large complex basins e g seasonally frozen soils permafrost glacier etc with limited observed data similarly we do not have good understanding of the ablation rate during breakup which can also affect ice thickness water temperature flow rate and velocity all have important roles in ablation but further research is needed to quantify their impacts on ablation similarly the encroaching border ice can result in constrictions which all models may not be capturing the seepage flow through the voids of ice jams is also not represented by many models which can be a major portion of the total river discharge finally the role of freeze up in spring ijf also needs to be better understood and quantified there are also numerous other river ice processes where we have limited understanding breakup in steep channels is not documented in depth similarly streams and small rivers possess a different set of challenges than modelling a large river they can have highly variable morphologies and hydraulic conditions over relatively short distances and can result in higher staging not only from increased channel roughness but also due to ice induced partial to complete channel blockage turcotte et al 2017 the overbank flow onto floodplains has also received little attention the interaction between an existing ice jam and an incoming ice run and jave is also not well understood with a changing hydroclimate mid winter breakup occurrences have also become more frequent however there has been comparatively limited research in mid winter breakup events since discharge is a driving role in mid winter breakup runoff should be adequately simulated and small streams that are the first to respond should be sufficiently monitored more research is also needed to explore the capability of coupled hydrological river ice models to predict mid winter breakup events 4 2 enhancing model fidelity although parameterization is not uniform across models better parameter identifiability is needed limited studies e g sheikholeslami et al 2017 have performed sensitivity analyses on river ice model parameters and this work needs to extend across all models often calibrated values are the ones obtained for one set of conditions but further investigations are needed to understand how parameters behave in different sets of conditions will the sensitivities of parameters change in different modelling domain or under different river ice conditions a more critical assessment on model parameters is required furthermore global sensitivity analyses should be pursued instead of local sensitivity analyses for better parameter identifiability recent studies such as das and lindenschmidt 2020 have also shown that not only model parameters but even digital elevation models dem used in ijf delineation are sensitive although not necessarily for ice jam context but a wealth of knowledge on the importance of dem on flood inundation mapping is available from literature which can provide some valuable guidance we also need a comprehensive database for different models and their parameters in different environmental conditions to draw parameter ranges for future studies some studies e g beltaos 2018 blackburn and she 2019 have published their calibrated or optimal adopted values and the practice should be further encouraged on the calibration side the traditional approach has been to calibrate simulated water levels against observed highwater marks from ijf events however it is already well established that multiple combinations of parameters and boundary conditions can result in same or similar water depths to avoid such equifinality multi objective functions should be used in calibrating river ice models note that i using multi response approach various aspects of single process typically an ice jam stage ii using multi site data number of gauges within the same modelling reach and iii using multi type data such as ice extent ice thickness ice jam profile water temperature etc are all commonly referred to as multi objective calibration budhathoki et al 2020 within a multi objective calibration framework equal or weighted percentages can be provided to each objective function and pareto optimal solutions can be identified based on the model performance on each objective function ijf modelling has largely been a deterministic modelling approach but there is a large uncertainty in several input data e g discharge from hydrological models total ice volumes available for jamming therefore ensemble modelling approach should be adopted for future ijf studies the ensemble approach will not help to reduce the uncertainty in the modelling results but it will allow for their characterization in the results however this does not mean using ensembles for all input data but for the parameters and boundary conditions that modellers have less confidence some previous studies aaltonen et al 2017 rokaya et al 2019b have already implemented such ensemble modelling approaches 4 3 understanding and reducing uncertainty ijf modelling is a multi model approach where several models e g hydrological geospatial etc feed the hydrodynamic river ice model this results in a cascade of uncertainty from one model to the next and from different input data sources a common approach is to use ensembles to characterize uncertainty in every sub model in the modelling chain however there are several challenges in characterizing the cascade of uncertainties first as we develop ensembles of ensembles to follow the cascade of uncertainty through all of the sub models we encounter a factorial problem that can create a very large number of ensemble members it is necessary to carefully sample ensemble members in order to adequately represent the covariance structure across the different sub models second in some aspects of the modelling chain it may not be possible to provide statistically reliable estimates of uncertainty this is a common problem in the climate modelling community where uncertainty characterization relies on ensembles of opportunity i e where the collection of climate models available to use does not represent the true uncertainties in the system e g the unknown unknowns associated with climate system feedbacks third when sampling across an ensemble of opportunity different sub models different methods it is common that some models are much better than others as such including bad models and methods in the ensemble can artificially inflate the uncertainty it is possible to obtain better uncertainty estimates by culling the inadequate ensemble members taken together it is possible to address these challenges by developing a small set of ijf storylines that can be used to provide a set of alternative scenarios that are useful for planning clark et al 2016 4 4 building consensus on future climate projections in table 1 we showed that different studies have used meteorological data from different esms rcms in their future projections similarly methodologies for bias correction and accounting for future changes are also diverse while this may be a more convenient and practical approach from a particular study we still need broader consensus on future projections data and methodology without such consensus we may run into situations where different studies in the same study area may report different magnitude of changes and sometimes even opposing results which is likely to create some confusion more collaboration is needed with hydrology and atmospheric modelling communities large river ice committees such as the committee on river ice processes and the environment cripe of the canadian geophysical union hydrology section and committee on ice research and engineering of the international association for hydro environment engineering and research could lead such initiatives by forming working groups to evaluate biases and performances of different esms rcms over reference periods and regions and provide recommendation on suite of models to be used for scenario analyses 4 5 transition to open source models recent years have seen some initiatives towards public domain models and source code of many models are now publicly available e g rivice river1d since local geomorphology and channel characteristics play an important role in ice jam flooding accommodations may be necessary in model source codes to capture some of the local complexities for example accurately representing spur dikes along the oder river that flows along the border of germany and poland was extremely difficult without the access to source code in other cases some missing processes cannot be added or improved this is also applicable to statistical and empirical models sharing of statistical equations and codes of empirical models help in scaling adapting and replicating the work elsewhere we need more transparency in our science 4 6 rallying for observed data a task force was set up by cripe to test and compare the performance of existing process based models carson et al 2011 they performed several experiments including a blind test where field data such as bathymetry river flow location of ice jam etc were provided but not the data on ice thickness or surface water profiles when all data were provided then all models performed well but the results varied in blind mode and had larger biases even when the modelling was led by experienced river ice modellers this experiment highlighted the importance of observed data in ijf modelling often there is only one gauging station in the modelling reach which poses challenge in quantifying upstream discharge and downstream water levels especially when they are separated by significant distances the model calibration is also then restricted to a single gauge data in some cases some research stations are present but they are not appropriately georeferenced without geodetic datum the observed data can be used for only qualitative assessments limited observed data also presents a challenge in calibrating longitudinal ice jam profiles in countries like canada federal and provincial agencies have their own streamflow networks while federal database is publicly available it is harder to obtain data from some provincial networks similarly some research private local institutions also maintain observational gauges but the data is not easily accessible more coordinated efforts are needed to promote accessibility of relevant data and data sharing culture even among researchers furthermore additional data are also becoming available from alternative sources such as remote sensing which should be tapped into 4 7 training and education in early 2020 the first author interacted with some recent graduates of a civil engineering program from a reputed canadian university and learned that river ice science was never taught in any of their courses dedicated river ice programs in universities are still rare our academic institutions continue to produce river practitioners that are not trained in river ice science about twenty years ago prowse and beltaos 2002 commented that there is a general lack of appreciation for the hydrological significance of river ice while there have been some significant advances in river ice process understanding and modelling see beltaos 2008 rokaya et al 2018a further initiatives are required in training and educating the next generation of river ice practitioners both academic institutions and river ice community associations such as cripe can play an important role in institutionalizing river ice education and training and providing networking and learning opportunities for early career professionals 5 conclusion streamflow ice properties freeze up conditions and channel morphology that govern river ice processes in general and ijf in particular are largely influenced by climate since values of meteorological variables are projected to change under future climate it is important to assess future ijf risks such assessments will be useful in land use planning designing hydraulic infrastructures and deciding on ijf risk mitigation measures in this review we present suggestions to incorporate future climatic changes and produce reliable scenarios of future ijf risks the major constraints associated with ijf modelling under future climate are related with quality and availability of model input data we provide a review of what has been and can be done to address such constraints finally we highlight some research avenues that could led to further improvements in ijf modelling capabilities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

8554,ice jam floods ijfs are a key concern in cold region environments where seasonal effects of river ice formation and break up can have substantial impacts on flooding processes different statistical machine learning and process based models have been developed to simulate ijf events in order to improve our understanding of river ice processes to quantify potential flood magnitudes and backwater levels and to undertake risk analysis under a changing climate assessment of ijf risks under future climate is limited due to constraints related to model input data however given the broad economic and environmental significance of ijfs and their sensitivity to a changing climate robust modelling frameworks that can incorporate future climatic changes and produce reliable scenarios of future ijf risks are needed in this review paper we discuss the probable impacts of future climate on ijfs and provide suggestions on modelling ijfs under both past and future climates we also make recommendations around existing approaches and highlight some data and research opportunities that could lead to further improvements in ijf modelling and prediction keywords ice jam flood future climate cold regions modelling risk assessment 1 introduction river ice is an integral component of the hydrological and hydraulic regimes of cold region rivers and affects an extensive portion of the global hydrologic system particularly in the northern hemisphere yang et al 2020 it regulates numerous hydrologic geomorphic biological and chemical process in rivers and provides important socio economic and ecological benefits prowse 2001 however river ice can also cause extensive damage to infrastructure navigation and hydroelectric production and result in detrimental effects to river ecology and water quality beltaos and burrell 2015 river ice impacts local river hydraulics in many different ways the presence of ice cover and ice jams obstruct river flows and increase stage due to additional resistance and reduced cross sectional area which can occasionally lead to backwater flooding beltaos and prowse 2001 similarly in some small river systems freezing of riverbeds may block groundwater inflows which may also generate flooding through aufeis daly 2013 ice jams can also change river channel properties and flow paths through ice scouring and erosion boucher et al 2009 a schematic view of a river ice jam and ice jam induced backwater level compared against open water or ice cover conditions is shown in fig 1 it reveals that ice jam induced backwater levels are substantially higher than backwater levels that arise from intact stationary floating ice cover or open water conditions previous studies e g prowse and beltaos 2002 have also suggested that ice jams can result in two to three times higher water depths in river channels for the same or even lower discharges compared to open water ice free conditions furthermore a range of possible backwater staging can occur due to the presence of ice for a given discharge which makes it challenging to predict the magnitude of an ice jam flood ijf lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 the complexity of ice jamming can bring into question hydrometric measurements and often despite the best efforts from the investigating hydrometric agency the data can be difficult to interpret and be unreliable de rham et al 2020 measurements of river velocities during ice jam formation are far too dangerous to carry out during ice jam flooding events in such cases discharge could be ideally estimated upstream of the ice jam in open water conditions but such open water conditions could be hundreds of kilometers upstream making the discharge estimates uncertain in other cases the gauge house and equipment could be damaged and water levels can go unreported for weeks retrospective analysis is often needed to fill gaps in data but these values are typically listed as estimated and should be treated with care de rham et al 2020 recently published a dataset of ice formation and breakup based on careful analyses of 196 gauge locations operated by the water survey of canada globally the ice jam database of the united states army corps of engineers carr et al 2015 is perhaps the most comprehensive national database available the database that has historical records since 1780 shows that more than 22 500 ice jam events have been recorded in united states alone as of october 26 2017 and about 10 of those events have resulted in some extent of flooding rokaya et al 2018b the financial cost of ijfs has never been calculated globally french 2018 estimated an annual cost of us 300 million per year for north america based on 2017 costing estimates while adjusting historical inflation however these approximations could be low considering single events have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for instance the recent ijf event along the athabasca river in fort mcmurray in western canada in april 2020 resulted in one human fatality forced 13 000 people out of their homes and caused more than half a billion dollars in insured damages derworiz 2020 however detailed ice jam damage records are not available in most ice jam prone countries river ice processes including ijfs are very sensitive to climate in fact changes in the ice regime phenology and properties is widely considered as one of the proxy indicators of climate change magnuson et al 2000 prowse and brown 2010 therefore given the broad economic and environmental significance of ijfs and their sensitivity to changing climate robust modelling frameworks that can incorporate future climatic change and produce reliable scenarios of future ijf risks are necessary however ice related research under future climate has been largely limited to assessment of changes in the timing of ice cover freeze up and breakup total ice duration and in few cases on ice thickness the evaluation of more complex issues such as ice jams under future climate are rare in the literature and an appropriate ijf modelling framework that incorporates future climatic conditions is not well established turcotte et al 2020 this is mainly because flow estimates at breakup are not reliable at least at most sites which makes flow forecasting challenging especially in a context where ice induced flow variations are not considered in hydrological models similarly river ice models need several input parameters some of which are difficult to determine the main objective of this review article is to provide practical suggestions for modelling ijfs under past and future climate ijf modelling here refers to simulation of backwater levels arising from ice jams and does not include other modelling areas such as inundation mapping or modeling of impacts this article first discusses the observed and expected climatic effects on river ice processes including ijfs in section 2 descriptions on how historical ijf events are simulated using different types of river ice models i e statistical empirical and process based models are provided in section 3 a generic framework for modelling ijfs under future climate is also presented highlighting different input data requirements and potential approaches to acquire such input data the paper concludes with identification of key research opportunities that can further improve ijf modelling capabilities in section 4 2 climatic effects on river ice processes 2 1 observed climatic effects on river ice processes previous studies have found a decreasing trend in the overall duration of the ice cover season across the northern hemisphere in europe ice cover duration was reported to decrease by 46 days per century in the oder river along the border between germany and poland between 1956 and 2015 marszelewski and pawłowski 2019 the lower part of the danube river in romania also experienced a reduction in ice cover duration by 28 days per century in the 1937 2016 period ionita et al 2018 whereas the lower reaches of the drava river in hungary observed a decline of 14 days per century in the 1875 2014 period takács and kern 2015 shiklomanov and lammers 2014 reported similar patterns 12 to 37 days per century in large russian rivers e g ob yenisey lena etc draining to the arctic between 1955 and 2012 in response to recent warming in the arctic in the baltic region klavins et al 2009 reported that the major rivers e g narva parnu daugava etc showed a declining trend in ice cover duration from 28 to 63 days per century in the yellow river in asia a reduction of 14 2 days per century in ice cover duration between 1954 and 2015 was reported by si et al 2015 in canada ice cover duration was reported to decrease by 22 days per century in the red river in manitoba during the 1798 1981 period rannie 1983 recently chen and she 2020 studied the patterns of breakup timing across canada in response to climate change their results showed earlier breakup trends in western canada and canada s arctic where spring warming trends are more evident in atlantic canada where warming trends are weak or even negative cooling mixed or later breakup trends were observed similarly in the united states white et al 2007 reported that the ice cover duration declined from 15 to 37 days across four rivers in maine whereas in the interior of alaska a decreasing trend in ice cover duration by 4 days per century during the 1972 2016 period was found by brown et al 2018 these results suggest that ice cover duration in northern rivers has decreased across the northern hemisphere in response to warming temperatures in the last few decades beltaos and prowse 2009 a recent study by yang et al 2020 using landsat images also showed that globally river ice cover duration has decreased from 0 3 to 4 3 percentage points at monthly scale between 2008 2018 and 1984 1994 the reported decline in ice cover duration in rivers in the northern hemisphere from historical observations is shown in fig 2 it reveals that in most of the northern regions a decreasing trend of a month or more per century in ice cover duration is already recorded but there are also indicators of regional disparities in trend direction and magnitude these trends of later freeze up and early breakup resulting in shorter ice cover durations over much of the northern hemisphere closely corresponds to the increasing air temperature trends observed over most of this region which has been most pronounced at the end of the last century prowse et al 2011a previous studies e g ginzburg 1992 soldatova 1992 have found fairly high correlations r2 0 6 0 7 between mean air temperatures and ice cover durations in fact many regional e g prowse et al 2002 and global river ice studies e g yang et al 2020 have used an air temperature based index such as 0 c isotherm or statistical models based on air temperature to predict future ice regimes note that the study period is not consistent across the studies in fig 2 so the trend magnitudes should not be directly compared a larger pool of studies is also available that have reported only freeze up trends or breakup trends or duration of lake ice cover but not the duration of river ice cover we also excluded the literature that reported trends derived from modelling studies since they could give misleading interpretations if compared directly with trends from observed data which are not subject to the same modelling uncertainties furthermore the figure includes both regulated and unregulated rivers and in regulated systems reservoir release makes it challenging to derive direct relationships between large scale climate variables and river ice regimes therefore the figure should be catiously interpreted a smaller number of studies are available on ice thickness probably owing to the fact that measuring ice thickness in a river is a relatively difficult and often dangerous endeavor one long term ice thickness database is available from the piscataquis river in central maine in the united states where huntington et al 2003 reported a decreasing trend of 26 cm per century between 1912 and 2001 in another study of several large russian rivers vuglinsky 2006 found a decline in ice thicknesses by 2 to 14 cm in the 1980 2000 period compared to the 1950 1979 period while a larger pool of literature is available on climatic effects on river ice e g freeze up and breakup trends total ice cover duration and in few cases ice thickness only a handful of research has investigated the climatic impacts on more complex processes such as ice jams mid winter breakup ice cover breakup in winter months due to abrupt increases in air temperature and or discharge and ijfs among the available studies beltaos 2002 studied the mid winter breakup in the saint john river in eastern canada from 1926 to 1997 using a long term hydrodynamic data the study recorded a significant rise in winter discharge in response to increased temperature that is large enough to initiate mid winter breakup occurrences newton et al 2017 identified 52 mid winter breakup events in western canada 1950 2008 and alaska 1950 2014 and investigated their hydro climatic drivers some recent studies e g das et al 2020 turcotte et al 2020 beltaos and bonsal 2021 have examined the impacts of future climate on ijfs across different rivers 2 2 expected climatic effects on river ice processes and ice jam floods although global climate models may differ substantially in projected changes of future precipitation the projections for increased air temperatures are consistent pachauri et al 2014 as a result of increases in air temperatures ice cover duration is projected to reduce under future climatic conditions due to delays in freeze ups and earlier breakups prowse et al 2007 a recent global study of river ice comparing ice cover duration in the 2080 2100 period against the 2009 2029 period projected that the ice cover durations globally will decline by about a week under the modest representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 whereas under the higher emission scenario rcp 8 5 the reduction can be up to about 17 days yang et al 2020 other regional and catchment scale studies across the northern hemisphere e g borshch et al 2001 andrishak and hicks 2008 timalsina et al 2015 in which similar assessments were performed have also arrived to similar conclusions on reduced ice cover durations under future climatic conditions while assessments of freeze up breakup dates or ice cover duration under future climatic conditions may be relatively straight forward to establish river ice extremes such as ijfs are difficult to predict since alongside air temperature several other hydro climatic and geomorphological factors come into play these factors themselves are susceptible to climate warming to varying degrees therefore their future implications are challenging to anticipate for instance a warmer spring may induce more frequent thermal breakup events gradual breakup of ice cover due to decrease in ice strength from increasing air temperature and may have less potential for dynamic ice jam events high discharge dislodges ice cover from the riverbank before thermal deterioration can occur this would likely be attributable to the deterioration of ice strength suggesting that the severity of ijfs may be reduced however this reduction in risk could be offset if the magnitude of snowmelt runoff in spring substantially increases prowse et al 2011b thus allowing for dynamic break up early when ice may be more intact importantly some climatic variables such as precipitation have the potential to influence both the driving and resisting forces that affect breakup severity prowse and beltaos 2002 perhaps owing to these complexities studies in understanding future river ijf outcomes are limited in the research literature a status on current knowledge and research approaches to address the impacts of climate change on breakup ice jams in canada was recently presented by turcotte et al 2019 the authors highlighted the importance of ijf prediction emphasized on conducting representative ijf future trend studies suggested that climate change may alter ice jam parameters and discussed some existing ijf modelling methods the expected outcomes of future air temperature and streamflow changes on the severity of different types of ijfs is provided in fig 3 highlighting potential changes in seasonal flood possibilities in the fall freeze up floods flooding that occurs from freeze up jams due to ice cover consolidation may occur left column of fig 3 although the majority of cold region catchments may only experience delays in ice cover formation in some temperate regions the water temperature may not be cold enough to form frazil ice such scenarios can result in a low probability of ijfs during the freeze up period turcotte et al 2019 in contrast if the weather is cold enough to form frazil ice then ice cover formation will occur the ice cover could be thinner or thicker depending upon hydro meteorological conditions the thinner ice cover may also go through a consolidation process and result in thicker ice covers this is usually observed in regulated rivers where initial ice covers may collapse and form juxtaposed ice covers due to abrupt changes in discharge these thicker ice covers have the potential to cause ijfs during a freeze up period hicks et al 2009 but if the ice cover is very thick thermal melting may also occur during the fall however streamflows in the river will also play an important role in the fall if the flows during this period are low then the probability of occurrence and severity of ijfs would decrease since there is not enough force to dislodge ice covers and cause ice jamming on the contrary increased discharge at freeze up will likely increase the probability of ice jam flooding the higher discharges can maintain open water reaches over a prolonged period of time and can also result in wider channel cross sectional areas both of these will generate more frazil ice huokuna et al 2020 in low gradient rivers higher streamflows may also increase the turbulence leading to more shoving and thickening of initial ice covers they also have the potential to break the ice covers and result in ice jamming lindenschmidt 2020 during the winter period middle column of fig 3 warmer air temperatures could deteriorate the strength of ice covers and larger winter flows may exert higher forces on ice covers these processes could lead to more frequent mid winter breakup events see fig 3b it is important to note however that the interactions are not so straight forward in winter the snow on ice covers can offer some degree of insulation although in absence of explicit quantification it may appear from the figure that increased air temperatures and discharges have equal importance but in reality discharge can play a larger role in mid winter breakup compared to other variables beltaos 2002 an opposing result low probability of mid winter ijf may be achieved with decreases in air temperatures and discharges in winter the colder temperature could increase the strength of ice cover and make them less prone to breakup in mid winter particularly if discharges are low low flows cannot exert enough force to dislodge the ice covers from riverbanks thus the ice cover will only disappear later in spring with increased temperature and discharge however if breakup does occur in mid winter more severe flooding could result nevertheless the literature e g prowse et al 2011a yang et al 2020 suggests that this scenario is less likely compared to the previous scenario of increased air temperature and discharge in winter in the spring breakup period right column of fig 3 increases in air temperatures can reduce the ice strength and result in thermal breakup events that are less severe in contrast the lower air temperatures prevent such thermal deteriorations so the ice cover may remain relatively intact in terms of structural integrity and end of winter strength for a longer duration of time until breakup eventually occurs on the other hand if breakup flows are not large enough to dislodge the ice cover then the probability of ice jamming is low since the ice cover will gradually deteriorate in place before being mobilized but if breakup flows are large enough to dislodge the ice covers before the thermal decay of ice cover occurs a dynamic breakup event will occur which has a higher probability of leading to ijfs beltaos 2003b in some cases higher discharges can also wash out ice or ice jams from the river reach and prevent backwater flooding however such flushing of ice and ice jams can still arrest ice and form ice jams at downstream ice jam prone locations therefore this reduces the probability of ijf in the initial reach but that transfers the risk to downstream reaches the probable future impacts on ice jam floods discussed here are only from the perspective of air temperature and discharge there are a number of other hydro climatic e g precipitation wind etc and geomorphological e g channel constriction presence of islands abrupt changes in slopes etc factors that may also play enabling or resisting roles in the probability of ijf it is possible to have more complex situations such as increased temperature but decreased discharge or vice versa during mid winter or increased temperature and increased discharge or vice versa during spring breakup or no changes at all in temperature or discharge for those circumstances ijf risks are difficult to generalize since temperature and discharge may compensate each other or the outcome may depend upon relative changes in temperature or discharge 3 modelling ice jam floods 3 1 modelling historical ice jam flood events practitioners and researchers have used statistical empirical and process based approaches to understand and simulate historical ijf events these different methods arise from a need to understand and predict ijf at a variety of locations across cold regions a basic workflow of these different types of models including their input data requirements are shown in fig 4 the process based approaches require additional information e g channel bathymetry as they strive for a mechanistic representation of ice jam behavior a traditional statistical models early ice jam flood modelling efforts were largely based on traditional statistical models e g regression models these models were developed based on a conceptual understanding of physical processes and involved a simplified mathematical formalization to estimate ijfs three types of statistical methods have been widely used in ijf modelling threshold models regression models and discriminant function analysis in the following sections we briefly describe how each statistical model is set up and applied model selection the first step in the model setup involves the selection of the modelling approach which is often guided by availability of input data the objective of the study and modellers own knowledge and experience threshold models are simplistic in nature and involve identifying a threshold value of a single or multiple hydro meteorological variables from analyses of historical data to predict a dichotomous outcome such as ice jam flooding or no ice jam flooding e g tuthill et al 1996 regression models establish empirical relationships between inputs independent variables such as hydro meteorological or river ice data and outputs dependent variable that is to be simulated or predicted such as breakup flow or water level using a linear regression equation mahabir et al 2006 discriminant function analysis performs multivariate tests to determine the differences between groups e g ice jam or no ice jam based on measurable predictor variables white and daly 2002 model setup the common input data used in statistical methods are winter precipitation air temperature minimum mean and maximum daily temperatures air temperature based indexes cumulative degree days of freezing and cumulative degree days of melting thawing snow water equivalent swe discharge freeze up level and ice cover thickness although threshold models can be set up based on a single variable in practice often multiple variables or indices and in some cases even some type of method to assign weights to different variables based on perceived relative importance of variables are used this is mainly because ice jam flooding is a complex phenomenon not easily described by a single variable threshold values can also be estimated from the regression of historical data tuthill et al 1996 developed such a threshold model to distinguish ice jam and no jam years based on winter peak discharges for the winooski river in vermont united states there are numerous examples in the literature of multivariate statistical methods robichaud 2003 used multiple linear regression to predict maximum ice jam induced stage in the athabasca river at fort mcmurray in western canada de coste et al 2017 used multiple linear regression to develop relationship between five input variables i e length of the jam toe location of the jam discharge toe shift of the delta jam and the lake level and one output variable ice induced water level for the hay river delta in northern canada generating a series of regression equations logistic regression models have also been used which applies nominal ordinal or interval ratio variables or a mixture of all three in contrast to linear regression which requires continuous variables white 1996 discriminant function analysis determines the combination of hydro meteorological and river ice variables that can be used to discriminate between ice jam or no jam events white and daly 2002 perform validation all of the statistical models can be evaluated using cross validation or re substitution methods in cross validation a subset of data can be used to develop the model and the remaining data are then used for validation however since ijf are not frequent events and extreme events can even wash away observation gauges it is often difficult to get a long term observation data series particularly for large ice jam prone rivers in the case of limited data re substitution methods can be used which uses same data set for both model development and validation model errors in the re substitution validation method can be evaluated based on outcome vs actual value the coefficient of determination is usually used to evaluate the degree of correlation closeness of fit of the equation but average error values and p value to show the strength of relationship can also be calculated similarly regression residuals can also be examined to see if they are random for discriminant function analysis several models can be developed and tested to determine a suitable model based on the selected performance metrics statistical river ice models are extremely site specific and may have limitations in applicability in a changing climate therefore many of the thresholds and regression equations developed for a particular ice jam prone location or under certain historical climatic conditions may not be applicable to other areas or under different climate conditions threshold models also have been largely employed for only qualitative assessments extensive historical data are also required to build a statistical model which may not be available for many ice jam prone sites limiting their applications burrell et al 2015 b machine learning in the last two decades more complex data driven methods such as fuzzy expert systems fes and artificial neural networks ann have become very popular in ijf modelling particularly in the forecasting context we refer to the collection of more complex data driven methods as machine learning algorithms in the following sections we briefly describe how machine learning models are configured and applied in historical or forecasting context model selection similar to statistical method model selection is usually based on study objectives model data requirement and availability and the knowledge and experience of modellers fuzzy logic is a form of artificial intelligence based on the idea of transferring human expertise to a computer algorithm so that the computer can make inferences often providing a logic structure behind the inference the values for inputs and outputs are represented through logical linguistics in the fuzzy logic method therefore compared to statistical models they rely less on historical data fuzzy logic based methods have been widely used in river ice breakup modelling e g mahabir et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 a detailed comparison of the model performance of different fuzzy logic models is available from sun and trevor 2015 artificial neural networks anns are supervised computer algorithms that are capable of modelling complex non linear systems the relationship between input and output variables are established through training which does not require a priori knowledge on the nature of the relationship zhao et al 2012 the ability to simulate the nonlinearity of the underlying process without having to solve complex partial differential equations makes anns popular in ijf modelling tao et al 2008 besides fuzzy logic and ann several other machine learning techniques and multi modal approaches have also been employed to simulate river ice jams sun 2018 applied a stacking multi type model tree for ice cover breakup prediction in the athabasca river at fort mcmurray in western canada sun and trevor 2017 used a combined k nearest neighbor models to predict annual breakup flows in the smoky river at watino in western canada similarly sun and trevor 2018 combined anfis and ann to predict annual ice affected maximum water levels in the athabasca river at fort mcmurray likewise several other machine learning techniques have also been employed e g wang et al 2010 aleshin and malygin 2018 a comprehensive review on ijf modelling using artificial intelligence is available from madaeni et al 2020 model setup fuzzy logic models use if then else rules to define the relationship between inputs and outputs the results of each set of rules are then either combined or defuzzified to obtain the final result the first step in developing fuzzy logic models is to describe input variables using linguistic terms with logical meanings then linguistic terms such as and or or are used to control the interaction of input variables after that using expert knowledge historical evaluation or a combination of both rule bases are developed to define the output membership functions from antecedent combinations of input variables finally defuzzification is performed which evaluates results and converts the solution set into a single crisp value however there are challenges in describing base rules and fine tuning of membership functions like multiple regression models the setup of an ann model requires selection of relevant hydro meteorological and river ice variables which is a critical decision data with errors or data that could skew the results can be identified through statistical analyses and can be removed in the data pre processing stage however statistical analyses may not reveal clear relationships and expert knowledge and interpretation may be required similarly training and validation data sets should also be identified the type of ann model and the number of hidden layers and neurons are also defined there are different types of structures for developing ann models but previous studies e g zhao et al 2012 guo et al 2018 have suggested feed forward neural network modelling using a back propagation algorithm as being the most suitable in ijf modelling finally the performance criteria against which the model is to be evaluated are also selected train calibrate the model fuzzy logic models can be calibrated using a training dataset calibration is usually based on experts subjective knowledge and experience statistical measures such as root mean square error mean average error and coefficient of determination are often used to calibrate the model unlike fuzzy logic models training ann models require a learning process involving training of algorithms the error between the input and output data is minimized in the training process by finding the optimal connection weights and adjusting the weights in the beginning the input weights for all the neurons are set to some random numbers between 0 and 1 but then weights and thresholds for all neurons are adjusted based on the error resulting output vs desired output the process is repeated many times until an acceptable result error is obtained perform validation the cross validation also known as holdout method or split sample method and resubstitution methods that we discussed earlier for statistical model validation are the most common methods used to perform validation of empirical ijf models however for ann often datasets are partitioned into three subsets i e training validation and testing while the algorithm is trained using the training dataset an error in the validation dataset is calculated after each iteration to prevent overfitting or overtraining then the testing dataset is used for an independent validation of the model performance it is important to note that the iterative procedures of neural networks are sensitive to the selected initial weight values and the networks are sometimes trapped by local minima during the training stage which could prevent a solution from reaching the global minimum guo et al 2018 it is also possible that the derived weights of variables are not reasonable and an expert knowledge is needed the reliability of ann models depends upon the quality and quantity of calibration validation data so in the context of ijfs where limited data are available the reliability may be questionable some combination of inputs data may also generate impossible outputs e g implausible ice jam profiles therefore careful judgment is also important in river ice modelling furthermore the models may not be able to perform reasonably under climatic conditions that exceed the range of the historical training data c process based models the traditional statistical and more complex machine learning models may provide reasonable results but they offer limited physical understanding of the system and poor parameter transferability in contrast process based models represent our theoretical understanding of how the world works based on inductive reasoning from observations therefore the focus is not only on model accuracy but also in model fidelity however this also means that the input data requirements and computational costs are significantly larger a previous study of several process based river ice models by carson et al 2011 showed that model performance is dependent on the quality of data available for model calibration model selection different types of process based hydraulic models are available for ijf modelling with their own advantages and limitations as well as their respective niches in the ecosystem of river ice models the majority of models are one dimensional e g hec ras icejam mike 11 rivjam river1d and rivice but a few two dimensional models e g crissp2d and dynarice are also available they also vary on numerical scheme e g implicit finite element method implicit finite difference method iterative procedure runge kutta solutions representation of model state steady vs unsteady state and other model aspects such as source code availability graphical user interface and possibility of parallelization madaeni et al 2020 provides some basic comparison of different river ice hydraulic models whereas more detailed assessment of modelling capabilities of several models is available from carson et al 2011 for a comprehensive assessment of river ice processes and their mathematical modelling shen 2010 is recommended model bathymetry after selecting the model the first step in model development for an area of interest is to configure the model unlike statistical and empirical models the channel bathymetry data is a pre requisite for any process based model setup however it is often difficult to obtain cross sectional data for an area of interest since field surveys of river bathymetry are time consuming and financially expensive endeavors in some small rivers where ice jams are usually only few tens of meters long lidar data at low flows may provide adequate information to derive channel bathymetry alfredsen and juárez 2020 recent advances have demonstrated that remote sensing e g feurer et al 2008 legleiter et al 2009 and sonar and lidar mapping using manned or unmanned aerial vehicles bandini et al 2018 e g mandlburger et al 2020 can also generate satisfactory bathymetry data and could be considered for modelling of ijfs in small to medium size rivers but in large rivers ice jams can sometimes be hundreds of kilometers long and simulating these events requires a model setup for long sections of rivers some models such as hec ras have flexible bathymetric interpolation routines that allows users to infer cross sections between surveyed sites at the desired spacing however careful consideration is essential since such interpolation can lead to erroneous results depending on the nature of the river for instance beltaos et al 2012 showed that some cross section spacing affects the model output and results in implausible ice jam profiles other topographic data such as floodplain elevation may also be needed for mapping of flood inundation defining boundary conditions after model bathymetry is established the next step is to define the hydraulic boundary conditions the most common boundary conditions across river ice hydraulic models are incoming discharge at the upstream reach and water level or a normal depth or a rating curve at the downstream reach of the modelling domain some study locations along the mainstem river may also have incoming or outgoing tributary flows as boundary conditions depending on the nature of the reach being investigated the volume of ice available for ice jamming and the extent of the jam specifying the location of head and toe of the jam are two other common boundary conditions but different models apply different approaches therefore require slightly different boundary conditions for instance only the location of the toe of the ice jam is needed for rivice whereas both the location of head and toe of the ice jam is specified in hec ras similarly the models such as hec ras can also use normal flow depth which is calculated from local water surface slope instead of water level to specify downstream boundary condition beltaos and tang 2013 while discharge and water level data are commonly available from hydrometric gauging stations volume of ice and the extent of the ice jam are challenging to define ice volume is usually estimated based on ice thickness and length and width of the upstream reaches that contribute ice to the modelling reach but one must also subtract shear walls that can account for a large portion of ice volume in some rivers the extent of a jam is usually derived based on field observations aerial photos and satellite based imageries can also be used in this process zhang et al 2017 showed that it is possible to get reasonable estimates of ice volume available for ice jamming using space borne and air borne remote sensing data lindenschmidt 2017 was also able to estimate calibrate the ice volume through model simulations even the discharge and water level data at the upstream and downstream modelling domain may not always be available often gauging stations do not coincide with the modelling domain and in extreme ice jam events measuring gauges can be washed out meteorological data the most important meteorological data required for ice jam flood modelling is air temperature air temperature data are usually available from meteorological stations in or near the study site if station data is not available then gridded temperature data from model simulations or re analysis products can be used such as canadian precipitation analysis mahfouf et al 2007 north american regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 and era5 global reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 models such as river1d use air temperature along with net incoming solar radiation and some heat transfer functions to estimate water temperature to determine water cooling and supercooling for frazil ice generation precipitation is another important meteorological data but often is indirectly accounted for through discharge data however snow data may be used to estimate snow on ice parameterize model model parameterization is the third step in the model development river ice hydraulic models can simulate several river ice processes such as frazil ice generation ice transport formation and progression of ice cover and ice jam formation such physical processes are represented as accurately as possible through model parameterization slush ice and ice cover properties e g porosity thickness ice strength parameters erosion and deposition velocity thresholds roughness coefficients internal friction angle of the ice rubble constituting the jam spacing between successive cross sections and maximum allowable flow velocity underneath the jam are some commonly required parameters in models similar to the boundary conditions different models have different configurations and therefore there is a diversity in approaches to parameterization for instance rivjam mike 11 crissp2d and dynarice account for flow seepage through voids of the jam while icejam river1d hec ras icesim and rivice do not have such a representation the values for parameters that can be measured such as ice thicknesses are largely guided by field observation or by remote sensing whereas initial values for empirical parameters and other parameters that cannot be directly measured or are difficult to measure are inferred from manuals and previous studies a list of lower upper value bounds of most commonly calibrated parameters in hec ras rivjam and rivice models from a review of 41 studies is available from rokaya and lindenschmidt 2020 calibrate and validate model after model parameters are estimated the models are then often calibrated against single or multiple historical ice jam flood events for this calibration process recorded ice jam induced water level data is most often the objective function of choice this is mainly due to the fact that it is available through a manual survey or in some cases derived from high water marks in the channel at the ice jam location if a gauge is present then peak water level may be available however there may be few in most cases just a single gauging stations in the study reach for a more complete calibration of ice jam profiles observed data across the modelling reach is required therefore high water level marks observed after flood water recession or evidence of high water levels during floods recorded through aerial photos or other surveys are often used along the entire reach however additional variables such as flows water temperature ice cover progression rates ice thickness etc can also be used in calibration and validation blackburn and she 2019 the calibration process in most models is through manual adjustments based on operator knowledge use of single event for calibration and need for visual inspections to ensure that the simulated ice jam profiles are plausible makes manual interpretation a likely choice but automatic calibration can also be performed while boundary conditions will remain the same some initial model parameter values can be fine tuned in this calibration process to match the recorded water levels in some cases when values of some boundary conditions such as ice volume or downstream water level are unknown they can also be calibrated e g lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 once the model successfully reproduces observed ice jam conditions the model is validated against other single or multiple ijf events d modelling framework the constraints in modelling ijf events irrespective of model type are associated with model input and forcing information as described above the modelling framework is heavily dependent on available observations the nature of the reach being analyzed and local hydraulic conditions bathymetry discharge water level ice properties ice volume and meteorological forcing information are all necessary parts of the overall framework depending on the availability of field observations and the model input needs synthetic or derived estimates of observations may substitute for field observation as an example it may be necessary to run a hydrological model or use geostatistical methods to infer flow for tributaries that would have a substantial impact on the local flow budget similarly if the deterministic modelling system relies on short wave radiation information this can be assessed through numerical weather model outputs interpolation methods or by using theoretical values based on latitude considering cloud conditions from automated cameras a schematic of the necessary components required to successfully implement different ijf models e g statistical empirical and process based and their interactions are shown in fig 5 this framework can be applied to simulate past or future ijfs the major differences will stem from what method data is used to generate what results for instance ice properties for past events can be estimated using meteorological data from station or re analysis products whereas for estimation of future ice properties data from global or regional climate models gcms rcms can be used or in some cases regionalization methods where ice properties are transferred from a river of comparable size and characteristics whose current climate is representative of the future climate of study reach can be adopted similarly discharge data from gauge measurements can be used for the past events whereas hydrological model derived discharge may be necessary for the simulation of future events the figure shows an overall picture of the use of data within the overall modelling framework not everything shown in the figure is essential to successfully simulate ijfs for instance some models e g traditional statistical models may not need ice jam locations whereas for others either past records remote sensing information traditional knowledge or geospatial information could be used to infer ice jam prone locations the data that can be used will be constrained by the information that is available for the area of interest 3 2 modelling ice jam flood under future climate the major challenges in modelling ijf events under future climatic conditions are associated with unavailability and uncertainties in the model input data more than model structure inadequacy or parametric uncertainty if all required boundary conditions and other forcing data are available under a future climate scenario then ijfs can be simulated using the modelling framework described above therefore in this section we specifically focus on model input data that are essential to set up and run ijf scenarios irrespective of the type of model used in climate impact assessments a future climate scenarios scenarios of future climate can be obtained from different global earth system models esms and regional climate models rcms esms are available from the coupled model inter comparison project https www wcrp climate org wgcm cmip whereas rcms can be obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment https cordex org or other regional programs such as the north american regional climate change assessment program https www narccap ucar edu esms are new generation global climate models that simulate all relevant physical chemical and biological processes of the earth system rcms are similar to esms but for a limited region of the earth they are usually at higher resolution resolve earth system processes at sub esm grid scales and produce climate information in greater detail for a specific region however there are hundreds of global and regional models so selecting a suitable individual member or ensemble of members requires careful assessment the spatial and temporal resolution of available meteorological data is important data with higher spatial resolution are able to capture some of the small scale processes such as convection gravity waves and turbulent transport which are not explicitly represented in most esms if process based hydrological land models are also being used to derive future streamflow then meteorological forcing data at a higher temporal resolution such as hourly or three hourly may be needed for some models e g mesh table 1 shows that many of the previous studies have only used air temperature to derive inferences related to future river ice processes furthermore most of these studies rely on traditional statistical or machine learning models for such estimations e g prowse et al 2010 gebre and alfredsen 2014 yang et al 2020 other process based studies that also use river discharge in assessments often require additional meteorological variables such as precipitation wind speed pressure longwave and shortwave radiation and humidity to derive future streamflows e g morales marín et al 2019a das et al 2020 these meteorological data are usually readily available from esms and rcms some forcing data e g humidity pressure and longwave and shortwave radiations can also be estimated using empirical models such as metsim bennett et al 2020 if they are not readily available from the desired esms or rcms additionally few land surface hydrological models such as variable infiltration capacity vic are also capable of internally estimating some meteorological inputs e g humidity incoming longwave and shortwave radiation and pressure via algorithms that index these quantities to the daily mean temperature temperature range and precipitation livneh et al 2013 finally meteorological data obtained from the esms and rcms and in particular esms may be too coarse and may have large biases chen et al 2013 while ijf modelling studies are usually carried out at local scales e g specific ice jam prone river reach the esm outputs are mostly available at larger spatial resolutions e g 100 km esms do not provide reliable information on hydrologically relevant variables below about 200 km maraun et al 2010 which is very coarse for realistic representations of most meteorological data particularly precipitation many of the studies cited above used esm or rcm change fields and ascribed these changes to existing field observation or local weather station information used in the modelling analysis the majority of studies take this approach in applying a seasonal monthly or annual change to an existing field observation typically a change in temperature as an absolute value derived from a esm rcm grid cell or a percentage change in precipitation again as derived from a co located esm rcm grid is used statistical or dynamic approaches can also be used to downscale the coarser data statistical models use functional relationships to relate esm outputs to locally measured meteorological variables in a region of interest dynamic downscaling can be performed by running finer resolution rcm nested into a esm where esm outputs provide boundary conditions for the rcm runs the uncertainties in the esm rcm data can be addressed broadly through three approaches i e a by reducing biases through the esm rcm model improvement b by quantifying uncertainty through an ensemble approach using multi model ensembles and c correction of model output in post processing using observed meteorological forcing data ehret et al 2012 the first approach of esm rcm model improvement is beyond the scope of most ijf modelling studies but the second and third approaches have been previously used in addressing biases in esm rcm outputs for instance prowse et al 2007 used an ensemble of seven different esms to predict the future ice cover freeze up and breakup patterns in canada similarly huokuna et al 2009 applied the mean of 19 esms to study frazil ice generation under a future climate in the kokemäenjoki river finland whereas timalsina et al 2015 used five esms and one rcm to study the impact of climate change on the ice regime in the orkla river in central norway recently turcotte et al 2020 also applied nine esms to assess the impacts of climate change on the frequency of dynamic breakup events and the risk of ice jam floods in the province of quebec canada on the other hand rokaya et al 2020b used 15 members of canrcm4 that were bias corrected using a reanalysis data to study the impacts of future climate on ijfs in the peace athabasca delta in canada similar bias corrections were performed by gebre and alfredsen 2014 on two esms hadam3h and echam4 in their study of trends and future changes in freshwater ice conditions in norway sweden and finland b hydrological data streamflow in spring plays a particularly important role in river ice cover breakup previous studies e g beltaos 2003a beltaos and carter 2009 have shown that the probability and magnitude of ijf is larger if the discharge during ice cover breakup is higher all other conditions being equal therefore river discharge is an important input variable in statistical empirical models massie et al 2002 states that reliable discharges are also needed to predict future ice jam occurrences using neural networks discharge also serves as an essential upstream boundary condition in process based models future flows at the location of interest can be derived using hydrological models by forcing them with meteorological inputs from the esms rcms this is usually a two step process in the first stage hydrological models are calibrated and validated for a historical time period when the model results are deemed satisfactory considering that simulated flows during the breakup period are uncertain then in the second phase meteorological inputs from esms rcms are fed to generate future hydrological conditions downscaling and bias correction of meteorological inputs from the esms rcms that we discussed above are also applicable here the reviewed literature shows that both conceptual and process based models have been widely used to derive future discharges for ijf modelling timalsina et al 2015 used the hbv model to derive future flows in the orkla river basin in norway whereas huokuna et al 2009 applied the wsfs model in the kokemäenjoki river in finland similarly several process based models have also been applied to generate future flows beltaos et al 2006 used watflood in the peace river canada and rokaya et al 2019a used mesh in the athabasca river canada recently turcotte et al 2020 employed future flows that were derived using hydrotel for the province of quebec in canada while many conceptual models may only need daily precipitation and temperature related input data some process based models require a larger number of meteorological inputs e g precipitation wind speed temperature longwave and shortwave radiation specific humidity and barometric pressure and sometimes at sub daily time steps however some process based models such as vic can run even with daily temporal resolution and only four meteorological inputs precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed nevertheless most hydrological models still do not consider ice effect on flow but some recent hydrological model improvements for water temperature simulations e g morales marín et al 2019b rokaya et al 2020a have shown some progress in this direction the water level at the downstream end of the modelled reach affects the simulation of backwater effects from ice jamming therefore downstream water level at breakup is another important boundary condition in ijf modelling however unlike discharge all river ice hydraulic models do not require downstream water level data the models such as hec ras can also use normal flow depth which is calculated from local water surface slope this becomes particularly handy when water level data at the downstream end of the modelling reach is not known which is usually the case in most ice jam events downstream water level at breakup can also be calibrated when no measured data are available e g lindenschmidt and rokaya 2019 another option is to extend the modelling domain further downstream from the toe of the ice jam so that the hydraulic conditions will converge in the upstream direction the future ijf studies that use downstream water level as a boundary condition usually transfer the rating curve derived from historical data to obtain the future downstream water level in this method a rating curve is first established using discharge and observed water level for the end of breakup then future flows estimated from hydrological models are applied to this rating curve to generate future downstream water levels das et al 2020 however this method does not account for the possible changes in future channel geometry that can affect the historical rating curve furthermore the use of rating curve under ice conditions is subject to large degree of uncertainty and therefore should be carefully applied c river ice data rubble ice and ice cover properties porosity and thickness and volume of ice available for jamming are some of the important river ice data needed for a comprehensive modelling of future ijf events different types of models e g empirical statistical and process based can be used to generate these river ice input data and in some cases even historical parameter ranges can be transferred for future studies earlier breakup when ice covers are still intact have the potential to cause large scale ijfs but late breakup that extends thermal deterioration of ice cover strength may not result in significant ice jamming see fig 3 the hydrological model run for future climatic conditions only provides streamflow hydrographs but it does not indicate the breakup flow however breakup flow identification is key in ijf modelling since it is the point in time when ice covers dislodge from their banks previously degree day method accumulated degree days of thawing melting based on air temperature have been used to identify breakup timing the accumulated degree days of thawing melting is calculated by adding the daily mean air temperature above c although bilello 1980 suggests to use 5 c as a base temperature since the majority of river ice covers exhibit 10 or more thinning before the temperature exceeds 0 c hydrological models with capabilities to simulate water temperature e g vic rbm mesh rbm hybrid models e g air2stream or a range of other statistical models can also be applied as a proxy indicator to identify the probable breakup timing when water temperature exceeds 0 c however models need to account for the heat loss required to melt the ice cover to generate realistic results readers are referred to benyahya et al 2007 for a comprehensive review of statistical water temperature models ice thickness is another important river ice variable essential for ijf modelling stefan s equation stefan 1891 is perhaps the most common approach used to estimate ice thickness from air temperature data several modified versions of stefan s equation e g starodumov et al 2017 lamichhane et al 2020 have also been proposed which incorporates snow depth for a better estimate of ice thickness some studies e g park et al 2016 have also used coupled models to estimate ice thicknesses under future climatic conditions the estimated ice thickness is also essential to estimate the total volume of ice that is available for ice jamming which is an important boundary condition and largely dictates the severity of ice jamming it is also important to note that a minimal ice thickness can be required for an ice jam to generate a flood in specific rivers in the future some ice cover will become too weak ice coverage will become increasingly partial whereas in colder region the strength of the ice cover will barely change other river ice parameters such as porosity of the rubble ice forming the jam can be transferred from historical measurements and values available from literature to future scenarios an earlier review by rokaya and lindenschmidt 2020 reported that a rubble ice porosity value of 0 4 was used in 20 different ijf modelling studies using hec ras and rivjam models whereas 21 case studies with rivice used the porosity values from 0 3 to 0 5 a similar range of values can be used to accommodate future climate simulations another option to estimate future ice properties is to use regionalization approach in the method river ice data are obtained for a river of interest from a comparable river size profile and other characteristics whose current climate is representative of the future climate of the river of interest turcotte et al 2020 ensemble modelling can also be performed using ranges of values for different river ice parameters to generate an ensemble of ijf conditions under future climate as shown by das et al 2020 in this method parameter values are randomly derived from the probability density function within certain ranges uniform pdf if extreme value data are available then extreme value methods can be applied using location scale and shape factors expert judgement is essential here to ensure that random sampling does not yield implausible parameter combinations or model outputs d geomorphological data the presence of flow obstacles in rivers such as bridges and islands stationary ice covers hanging dams and channel constrictions due to decreased river width impede the transport capacity and result in ice jamming identification of such locations is important since if the ice jams form upstream of the location of interest than the risk of backwater flooding is low for the location of interest however if the ice jam location is downstream of the location of interest than backwater effects from ice jamming can be significant however it should be noted that an ice jam upstream may evolve into an ice jam downstream historical records traditional knowledge field observations satellite imagery and geospatial models have been used in the past to identify ice jam prone locations e g lindenschmidt and das 2015 de munck et al 2017 potential ice jam locations are known to be largely dictated by channel geomorphology although channel morphology is a dynamic attribute that changes with time the changes are generally slow and gradual except in younger landscapes and for extreme events and often in most ijf studies ice jam prone locations are assumed not to change under future climatic conditions but even in a single river reach there could be numerous potential ice jamming locations studies in the past have used different approaches to address this uncertainty in ice jam location some stochastic methods identify a potential ice jamming reach and then draw random locations along the constrained reach using uniform distribution e g lindenschmidt et al 2019 their assumption is that by doing hundreds of runs with hundreds of potential locations the uncertainty in the future ice jam toe location will be captured this may result in locating ice jam toes in non ice jam prone areas so expert judgement will be required to rule out those cases future studies should also adopt bi or multi modal distributions to incorporate probability of lodgments with sharp changes in slopes meandering or other changes in geomorphological conditions 4 research opportunities for improved modelling and prediction more than a decade ago prowse et al 2008 stressed the need for a comprehensive numerical river ice model coupled with climatic such as esms rcms and hydrological models for detail quantitative predictions of impact of future climate on ijfs recent years have seen some progress with some loose coupling of river ice models with hydrological models driven by esms rcms to assess future ijf risks a coupled model as envisioned by prowse et al 2008 and later reiterated by beltaos and prowse 2009 is yet to be developed although such a coupled model can still only provide hydro meteorological boundary conditions and may not be able to predict some complex features such as the location of toe of jam furthermore unless it is two way coupling some of the important feedbacks between land surface and atmosphere may be missing nevertheless reliable quantitative assessment on future ijf risk can still be made with existing models as discussed earlier in this paper however some data and research opportunities can substantially improve existing modelling capability irrespective of types of models in this section we highlight some of these potential research avenues 4 1 improving process representation there are still some gaps in how some of the important river ice processes are not represented in ijf models often only ice cover thickness along with length and width of contributing river reach is considered in calculating the ice volume available for jamming frazil ice deposits such as hanging dams can also provide an additional volume of ice but it is usually not incorporated in estimates of total ice volume thickness of future hanging dams is also uncertain their mobilization threshold could vary tremendously from year to year previous studies e g beltaos 2003a beltaos and carter 2009 have demonstrated that discharge plays a larger role in the probability and severity of ijfs therefore it is essential to obtain good estimates of future flows to assess future ijf risks however there are outstanding challenges in modelling discharges in cold region catchments most existing hydrological models do not account for river ice formation and breakup therefore the limited capability to simulate ice induced hydrological fluctuations represent a major limitation in simulating future ijfs availability of reliable snow data is also another constraint there is large uncertainty in snow data and snowmelt rates and routing are still difficult to quantify particularly in large complex basins e g seasonally frozen soils permafrost glacier etc with limited observed data similarly we do not have good understanding of the ablation rate during breakup which can also affect ice thickness water temperature flow rate and velocity all have important roles in ablation but further research is needed to quantify their impacts on ablation similarly the encroaching border ice can result in constrictions which all models may not be capturing the seepage flow through the voids of ice jams is also not represented by many models which can be a major portion of the total river discharge finally the role of freeze up in spring ijf also needs to be better understood and quantified there are also numerous other river ice processes where we have limited understanding breakup in steep channels is not documented in depth similarly streams and small rivers possess a different set of challenges than modelling a large river they can have highly variable morphologies and hydraulic conditions over relatively short distances and can result in higher staging not only from increased channel roughness but also due to ice induced partial to complete channel blockage turcotte et al 2017 the overbank flow onto floodplains has also received little attention the interaction between an existing ice jam and an incoming ice run and jave is also not well understood with a changing hydroclimate mid winter breakup occurrences have also become more frequent however there has been comparatively limited research in mid winter breakup events since discharge is a driving role in mid winter breakup runoff should be adequately simulated and small streams that are the first to respond should be sufficiently monitored more research is also needed to explore the capability of coupled hydrological river ice models to predict mid winter breakup events 4 2 enhancing model fidelity although parameterization is not uniform across models better parameter identifiability is needed limited studies e g sheikholeslami et al 2017 have performed sensitivity analyses on river ice model parameters and this work needs to extend across all models often calibrated values are the ones obtained for one set of conditions but further investigations are needed to understand how parameters behave in different sets of conditions will the sensitivities of parameters change in different modelling domain or under different river ice conditions a more critical assessment on model parameters is required furthermore global sensitivity analyses should be pursued instead of local sensitivity analyses for better parameter identifiability recent studies such as das and lindenschmidt 2020 have also shown that not only model parameters but even digital elevation models dem used in ijf delineation are sensitive although not necessarily for ice jam context but a wealth of knowledge on the importance of dem on flood inundation mapping is available from literature which can provide some valuable guidance we also need a comprehensive database for different models and their parameters in different environmental conditions to draw parameter ranges for future studies some studies e g beltaos 2018 blackburn and she 2019 have published their calibrated or optimal adopted values and the practice should be further encouraged on the calibration side the traditional approach has been to calibrate simulated water levels against observed highwater marks from ijf events however it is already well established that multiple combinations of parameters and boundary conditions can result in same or similar water depths to avoid such equifinality multi objective functions should be used in calibrating river ice models note that i using multi response approach various aspects of single process typically an ice jam stage ii using multi site data number of gauges within the same modelling reach and iii using multi type data such as ice extent ice thickness ice jam profile water temperature etc are all commonly referred to as multi objective calibration budhathoki et al 2020 within a multi objective calibration framework equal or weighted percentages can be provided to each objective function and pareto optimal solutions can be identified based on the model performance on each objective function ijf modelling has largely been a deterministic modelling approach but there is a large uncertainty in several input data e g discharge from hydrological models total ice volumes available for jamming therefore ensemble modelling approach should be adopted for future ijf studies the ensemble approach will not help to reduce the uncertainty in the modelling results but it will allow for their characterization in the results however this does not mean using ensembles for all input data but for the parameters and boundary conditions that modellers have less confidence some previous studies aaltonen et al 2017 rokaya et al 2019b have already implemented such ensemble modelling approaches 4 3 understanding and reducing uncertainty ijf modelling is a multi model approach where several models e g hydrological geospatial etc feed the hydrodynamic river ice model this results in a cascade of uncertainty from one model to the next and from different input data sources a common approach is to use ensembles to characterize uncertainty in every sub model in the modelling chain however there are several challenges in characterizing the cascade of uncertainties first as we develop ensembles of ensembles to follow the cascade of uncertainty through all of the sub models we encounter a factorial problem that can create a very large number of ensemble members it is necessary to carefully sample ensemble members in order to adequately represent the covariance structure across the different sub models second in some aspects of the modelling chain it may not be possible to provide statistically reliable estimates of uncertainty this is a common problem in the climate modelling community where uncertainty characterization relies on ensembles of opportunity i e where the collection of climate models available to use does not represent the true uncertainties in the system e g the unknown unknowns associated with climate system feedbacks third when sampling across an ensemble of opportunity different sub models different methods it is common that some models are much better than others as such including bad models and methods in the ensemble can artificially inflate the uncertainty it is possible to obtain better uncertainty estimates by culling the inadequate ensemble members taken together it is possible to address these challenges by developing a small set of ijf storylines that can be used to provide a set of alternative scenarios that are useful for planning clark et al 2016 4 4 building consensus on future climate projections in table 1 we showed that different studies have used meteorological data from different esms rcms in their future projections similarly methodologies for bias correction and accounting for future changes are also diverse while this may be a more convenient and practical approach from a particular study we still need broader consensus on future projections data and methodology without such consensus we may run into situations where different studies in the same study area may report different magnitude of changes and sometimes even opposing results which is likely to create some confusion more collaboration is needed with hydrology and atmospheric modelling communities large river ice committees such as the committee on river ice processes and the environment cripe of the canadian geophysical union hydrology section and committee on ice research and engineering of the international association for hydro environment engineering and research could lead such initiatives by forming working groups to evaluate biases and performances of different esms rcms over reference periods and regions and provide recommendation on suite of models to be used for scenario analyses 4 5 transition to open source models recent years have seen some initiatives towards public domain models and source code of many models are now publicly available e g rivice river1d since local geomorphology and channel characteristics play an important role in ice jam flooding accommodations may be necessary in model source codes to capture some of the local complexities for example accurately representing spur dikes along the oder river that flows along the border of germany and poland was extremely difficult without the access to source code in other cases some missing processes cannot be added or improved this is also applicable to statistical and empirical models sharing of statistical equations and codes of empirical models help in scaling adapting and replicating the work elsewhere we need more transparency in our science 4 6 rallying for observed data a task force was set up by cripe to test and compare the performance of existing process based models carson et al 2011 they performed several experiments including a blind test where field data such as bathymetry river flow location of ice jam etc were provided but not the data on ice thickness or surface water profiles when all data were provided then all models performed well but the results varied in blind mode and had larger biases even when the modelling was led by experienced river ice modellers this experiment highlighted the importance of observed data in ijf modelling often there is only one gauging station in the modelling reach which poses challenge in quantifying upstream discharge and downstream water levels especially when they are separated by significant distances the model calibration is also then restricted to a single gauge data in some cases some research stations are present but they are not appropriately georeferenced without geodetic datum the observed data can be used for only qualitative assessments limited observed data also presents a challenge in calibrating longitudinal ice jam profiles in countries like canada federal and provincial agencies have their own streamflow networks while federal database is publicly available it is harder to obtain data from some provincial networks similarly some research private local institutions also maintain observational gauges but the data is not easily accessible more coordinated efforts are needed to promote accessibility of relevant data and data sharing culture even among researchers furthermore additional data are also becoming available from alternative sources such as remote sensing which should be tapped into 4 7 training and education in early 2020 the first author interacted with some recent graduates of a civil engineering program from a reputed canadian university and learned that river ice science was never taught in any of their courses dedicated river ice programs in universities are still rare our academic institutions continue to produce river practitioners that are not trained in river ice science about twenty years ago prowse and beltaos 2002 commented that there is a general lack of appreciation for the hydrological significance of river ice while there have been some significant advances in river ice process understanding and modelling see beltaos 2008 rokaya et al 2018a further initiatives are required in training and educating the next generation of river ice practitioners both academic institutions and river ice community associations such as cripe can play an important role in institutionalizing river ice education and training and providing networking and learning opportunities for early career professionals 5 conclusion streamflow ice properties freeze up conditions and channel morphology that govern river ice processes in general and ijf in particular are largely influenced by climate since values of meteorological variables are projected to change under future climate it is important to assess future ijf risks such assessments will be useful in land use planning designing hydraulic infrastructures and deciding on ijf risk mitigation measures in this review we present suggestions to incorporate future climatic changes and produce reliable scenarios of future ijf risks the major constraints associated with ijf modelling under future climate are related with quality and availability of model input data we provide a review of what has been and can be done to address such constraints finally we highlight some research avenues that could led to further improvements in ijf modelling capabilities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence
