24505,understanding the impacts of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals is important for effective mitigation and management sound impacts can cause behavioral changes that lead to displacement from preferred habitat and can have negative influence on vital rates here we develop a movement model to better understand and simulate how whales respond to anthropogenic sound over ecologically meaningful space and time scales the stochastic model is based on a sequential monte carlo sampler a particle filter the movement model takes account of vertical dive information and is influenced by the underwater soundscape and the historical whale distribution in the region in the absence of noise disturbance the simulator is shown to recover the historical whale distribution in the region when noise disturbance is incorporated the whale s behavioral response is determined through a dose response function dependent on the received level of sound the aggregate impact is assessed by considering both the duration of foraging loss and the spatial shift to alternate and potentially less favorable habitat persistence of the behavioral response in time is treated through a disruption parameter we apply the approach to a population of fin whales whose distribution overlaps naval sonar testing activities beside the southern california range complex the simulation shows the consequences of one year of naval sonar disturbance are a function of i how loud the sound source is ii where the disturbed whales are relative to preferred high density habitat and iii how long a whale takes before returning to a pre disturbance state the movement simulator developed here is a generic movement modeling tool that can be adapted for different species different regions and any acoustic disturbances with known impacts on animal populations keywords animal movement model particle filter naval sonar dose response function aggregate impact fin whales 1 introduction the us marine mammal protection act 16 u s c 1361 et seq aims to protect marine mammals from harassment in us waters exceptions may be made for certain activities including those that generate underwater sound a key example and a central motivator for this paper is when tactical sonar is used for naval training and testing to receive an exception the us navy undertakes extensive planning to determine how many whales could be exposed to sonar and the levels at which each animal is exposed at present one limitation of this approach is that each simulation of behavioral effects is done for a 24 hour period with no memory of previous disturbance this limits our understanding of longer term effects of multiple sound exposure on whales behavior health and ultimately vital rates the literature on the link between exposure and impacts on hearing and behavior is rich e g southall et al 2019 but determining the aggregate impacts of multiple exposures as well as the cumulative effect of different stressors on vital rates is an open and pressing research question national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2017 animal movement models are a class of stochastic models that simulate trajectories through time and space hooten et al 2017 these stochastic movement models are extremely flexible in terms of character of the realizations of animal movement they can generate they generally must be confronted with location data tracks within an inferential framework in order to provide reasonable simulations of actual trajectories bio logging technologies have provided these data and revolutionalized the study of animal movement whitford and klimley 2019 fusion of movement models and tracking data through statistical methods allow for understanding of animal behavior inferred through movement approaches often focus on estimating the parameters for behavioral inference e g patterson et al 2017 using methods such as bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc morales et al 2004 joy et al 2015 and statistical frameworks such as hidden markov models langrock et al 2012 whoriskey et al 2017 and state space models jonsen et al 2003 dowd and joy 2011 there is also significant interest in developing movement simulators that simulate realistic trajectories but do not rely directly on observed track data these include the use of potential functions that influence model trajectories based on imposed field of attraction or repulsion brillinger 2010 preisler et al 2013 one recent development makes use of resource selection functions that encapsulate habitat preference michelot et al 2019a b and proposes an mcmc based simulator wherein the step selection functions or movement models are such that the long run distribution tends to the resource selection function here we offer a related but distinct sequential monte carlo sampler del moral et al 2006 for movement simulation that can account for historical distributions of whale abundance as well as incorporate sound exposure a suite of individual based animal movement models have been developed to merge individual based movement with exposure to noise disturbance e g aim frankel et al 2002 safesimm donovan et al 2012 3mb hauser 2006 and the us navy acoustics effect model naemo blackstock et al 2018 3mtsim parrott et al 2011 these existing methods are limited in a number of respects first long run movement in the absence of disturbance does not tend to the resource selection function second none of these acoustic effects models accounts for behavioral context ellison et al 2012 although a few include realistic avoidance behavior donovan et al 2017 third existing approaches are limited in their ability to assess aggregate exposure over more ecologically meaningful time frames i e those that may be linked to vital rates and population consequences e g pirotta et al 2018 from both a conservation and ecological standpoint it is important to move beyond single event assessments and examine long run movement of individuals and how their spatial use changes across multiple sound exposures this study proposes a novel formulation for a marine animal movement model in the form of a particle filter based movement sampler this is motivated by and targeted at a population of fin whales in the coastal waters off southern california although the methods themselves are quite general the movement simulator provides a framework for evaluating long term consequences e g over one year of sound disturbance by tracking sound exposure and behavioral changes on the individuals that collectively may induce population level consequences on vital rates we make use of a multi scale individual based random walk marine mammal movement model that simulates horizontal movement and diving over a period of up to one year of us naval sonar exercises with dive by dive resolution the sequential monte carlo sampler allows movement trajectories to follow historical whale distributions in this way individual based movement simulations permit us to incorporate the following i the aggregate noise exposure in an area ii the movement of individuals in response to the exposure and iii the changes in habitat use as a result of those sound induced behavioral changes we propose this model as part of a management focused tool that when calibrated to local conditions could be used in combination with existing methods to estimate behavioral effects of accumulated exposure and the distribution of aggregate exposure and behavior response within the population collectively this tool assists on going efforts to better describe the consequences of anthropogenic sources of disturbance on marine mammals and the possible effect of mitigation measures while our focus is on marine mammals and underwater sound our movement modeling approach could be applied to other marine or terrestrial species to study spatial habitat use and behavioral disturbance due to anthropogenic stressors 2 methods we develop a stochastic modeling approach that simulates the movement of a whale through space and time it is based on a stochastic movement model producing whale trajectories that are influenced by historical whale distribution as well as underwater noise fields in this section we first introduce a general movement model we consider its vertical dimension as being taken from a population dive distribution this is coupled to a random walk model of the horizontal movement next we demonstrate how realizations trajectories of this stochastic movement model can be guided by a historical spatial whale distribution surface something that is often available from past studies based on sightings surveys or other data on habitat utilization finally the influence of underwater noise is incorporated using a hypothetical dose response function to define the probability of a behavioral response that takes the form of an alteration of the movement pathway to avoid or minimize further sound exposure the general framework for the movement model is the following stochastic time series model 1 x t d x t 1 ϕ ε t where x t is the state vector that describes the state at time t which here represents the animal s location the operator d steps the movement process forward in time it is markovian and has a dependence on the state at the previous time x t 1 as well as on a set of parameters ϕ the term ε t represents stochastic forcing or random disturbance it is generally assumed serially uncorrelated and can enter multiplicatively or additively the unit time index and the time increment defined by it is arbitrary it could reflect the discretization time used in a numerical scheme for solving differential equations hence mimicking continuous movement it could be the time between observations of the system or it could simply reflect any time interval of interest that is regularly or otherwise spaced eq 1 is a very general movement model and below it is made application specific by first considering the movement in the vertical depth dimension and then showing how that informs movement in the horizontal dimension 2 1 vertical movement we first consider the vertical movement or dive characteristics as this acts to specify many of the features of the horizontal movement the statistics describing an individual dive typically are assumed to follow a known distribution including dive duration descent rates time at the surface between dives and time at depth hauser 2006 here we consider the intermediate time spent not diving as surface related activity that is linked to the previous subsurface component of a dive which relates in part to the recovery phase after submergence tyack et al 2006 this couplet of submergence and surface recovery is henceforth called a dive dives are randomly generated from species dive statistics or taken directly from dives recorded on tags each dive realization is assumed to occur independently from any previous dive and represents a discrete event dive durations are variable and do not conform to a regular time interval furthermore for realism each dive is also constrained to be less deep than the local bathymetry at the dive location importantly as outlined below these realizations of vertical movement are coupled to the horizontal movement with the duration of each dive defining the associated time step for the stochastic model of horizontal movement as well as the magnitude of the horizontal displacement 2 2 horizontal movement the horizontal part of the movement model is based on a simple 2 d random walk that is straightforward to simulate from 2 x t x t 1 ε t where ε t n 0 σ t 2 here x t is a 2 1 vector that represents the northing and easting utm position of the whale at time step t the unit time step here is taken as the dive duration which will be a variable not constant length of time longer dive durations tend to be associated with larger displacement between two point locations fauchald and tveraa 2003 to incorporate this feature we make the variance term σ t 2 in the state evolution eq 2 a scalar function of the dive duration specifically the standard deviation for the displacement σ t is the dive duration multiplied by a typical speed of the whale species under consideration we further add a constraint to the horizontal movement through a user defined threshold that rejects a proposed displacement if it exceeds the maximum possible speed of the species effectively making ε t a normal distribution with its upper tail truncated hence the transition density p x t x t 1 associated with eq 2 is a truncated normal as described 2 3 incorporating spatial habitat use the basic random walk given by eq 2 is by itself not a particularly informative or realistic model for whale location eq 2 has no directional fidelity to the movement meaning that the expected location is the simulation starting position and location variance just grows as a linear function of time to add realism through directional preference we use this movement model within a sequential monte carlo sampler to take into account information on historical whale spatial density below we assume we have an estimate of the spatial probability density function of whales in a mapped region from past studies in practice this habitat preference is often a product derived from whale sightings fitted with a density surface model or from a species distribution model it may alternatively be referred to as a resource selection function boyce and mcdonald 1999 we will term this quantity the historical whale spatial density to emphasize that it is an already obtained quantity and denote it as p y t x t this says that for a particular animal location x t we can determine the probability of a whale observation y t occurring there the historical whale spatial density will be used to influence the local trajectory of the random walk and hence bias the horizontal movement and impart directional fidelity that reflects habitat preference more specifically we seek the posterior distribution of the new whale location taking account the previous position the movement model prediction and the historical whale spatial density from bayes theorem we have 3 p x t y t p y t x t p x t x t 1 where p x t y t is the target distribution note that the movement model p x t x t 1 and the historical whale spatial density p y t x t also provide the components for a state space model whose goal is to determine the posterior p x t y t for t 1 t we exploit this fact below to propose a sequential estimation procedure for the state that combines the random walk movement model with the historical whale spatial density in order to generate realizations of whale trajectories that are draws from the posterior note that there are no parameters to estimate here since the displacement variance σ t 2 and the whale observation density p y t x t are user inputs and hence specified since the distributions considered are generally non gaussian we use the basic particle filtering algorithm of sequential importance resampling sir gordon et al 1993 kitagawa 1987 in general terms this works as follows starting with initial conditions x 0 the whale movement model predicts possible movement locations the historical whale spatial density weights these locations based on the probability of a whale being found there and a weighted resampling occurs after which a new location is determined the procedure then continues sequentially forward through time the particle filter is simple to implement well understood and converges to the target posterior kitagawa 1987 our specific adaption of this sequential monte carlo algorithm to generating whale trajectories is given below for this sequential recursive algorithm we assume without loss of generality that we are at time t 1 and know the whale location at that time i e the location at the start of a dive our goal is to determine its position at the next time t at the end of the dive and after surface recovery we do this according to the following sequence of steps starting with the whale location x t 1 i set up determine the displacement variance term σ t 2 in the horizontal movement model 2 this is done by randomly generating a dive duration from a species dive distribution see sections 2 1 and 2 2 ii prediction simulate n possible whale positions at time t by drawing n realizations of the random vector of displacement ε t and applying the random walk model 2 to each one this yields a set of n possible predicted locations designated x t t 1 i i 1 n which is a draw from the transition density p x t x t 1 here x t t 1 designates the one step ahead forecast location prior to any consideration of the historical whale spatial density and the superscript i identifies an ensemble member particle iii weighting calculate a weight for each member of the forecast ensemble w t i i 1 n the n weights are calculated for each forecast whale position as being proportional to the whale spatial density 4 w t i p y t x t t 1 i iv selection a single ensemble member is selected randomly from the candidate set x t t 1 i i 1 n with probability proportional to their weights w t i this becomes the next location in the simulated track at time t or the value for the position x t applying this algorithm for all time steps yields a single trajectory for a whale that is a function of the stochastic movement model as well as the historical whale spatial density the basic random walk could in some sense be said to be biased by the local landscape conditions one feature of the algorithm is that to obtain a single whale trajectory requires at each time step the generation of many n candidate location predictions from which a single one is chosen however since the movement model and the weighted resampling are computationally trivial the overall computational burden should be minimal the size of n is user specified and must be large enough so that whale location predictions sufficiently populate the local space around the current position allowing an appropriate particle to be chosen for the trajectory that properly responds to the historical whale spatial density see supplementary material to generate an ensemble of whale trajectories or many individual tracks multiple runs of the above algorithm would be undertaken these could be run in parallel finally note that this approach is a general one it can be applied to any markovian movement model of the form 1 and will converge to the target posterior the sequential monte carlo sampler is discussed further in section 4 2 4 whale movement response to underwater noise the simulated whales response to the sound field incorporates three components 1 a biphasic dose response function that informs the probability of a response to noise disturbance 2 directional horizontal movement away from the loudest noise in the region of the whale this changes over time as noise source s and the whales move 3 duration of behavioral disruption post disturbance that affects directional persistence the strength of the behavior changes decreases with time as behavior reverts to baseline according to an exponential decay governed by a disruption parameter 2 4 1 biphasic dose response function probability of behavioral response is modeled as a function of the acoustic dose of anthropogenic noise quantified as the received sound level rl a biphasic functional relationship has been hypothesized ellison et al 2012 whereby i at lower rls the response is dependent on the pre existing behavioral context of the whale while ii at higher rls a behavioral response is more likely and is more directly tied to rl combining these two modes of response and integrating over behavioral states leads to a biphasic function this type of function has been fitted to experimental and observational data from multiple taxa and used by the us navy in its impact assessments finneran et al 2017 empirical data on fin whale responses to sonar are not yet available thus the dose response relationship used here is borrowed from that of blue whales a related mysticete species in the same genus balaenoptera finneran et al 2017 an example of the dose response functional form is shown in fig 1 with modification possible once experimental observational data become available the probabilistic functional form is 5 p r r e s p o n s e p 1 1 0 l 1 d o s e h 1 1 p 1 1 0 l 2 d o s e h 2 where d o s e is the received sound pressure level spl in db re 1 μ pa of broadband noise p is the proportion of the curve comprising the first lower dose phase l 1 is the broadband spl at the midpoint inflection point of the first phase l 2 is the broadband spl at the midpoint inflection point of the second phase h 1 is the slope of the first phase where smaller values correspond to lower contextual response and h 2 is the hill slope of the second phase this model is a generalization of the monophasic models previously developed and applied in this context e g antunes et al 2014 and miller et al 2014 other forms of dose response function than those of mono and bi phasic forms could readily be used we refer the reader to the supplementary material for additional information on this function 2 4 2 directional response to noise suppose there is a received level sufficiently loud to trigger a behavioral response br via eq 5 at time t at the animal s location x t the movements of the whale to next location x t 1 are modeled as having a behavioral response such that it moves in a direction 180 away from the maximum sound source this angle is described by the 2 1 unit vector θ s o u n d t containing the easting and northing vector components the magnitude of the movement is taken to be identical to the horizontal displacement computed by the movement model in the absence of any noise effect this corresponds to a step size dictated by the realization of ε t 1 and is the euclidean distance between x t and x t 1 or x t 1 x t at the new position x t 1 at time t 1 if the sound level is still sufficient to trigger another behavioral response then the procedure continues by moving 180 away from the new direction of maximum sound source θ s o u n d t 1 with the distance x t 2 x t 1 goldbogen et al 2013 found whales responded with directional travel away from the sound source when exposed to playbacks of military sonar in some cases whales have been shown to increase speed in response to sonar e g deruiter et al 2013 and this could readily be incorporated if desired 2 4 3 disruption of behavior time to revert to baseline behavior after a behavioral response once a behavioral response occurs then the post disturbance movement process gradually reverts back to that of the disturbance free movement model the rate at which this happens is governed by a parameter α τ where τ is the number of time steps or dives since the most recent behavioral response occurred and α is the disruption parameter 0 α 1 since it is only the direction of movement that is changed the post disturbance direction at time step τ θ t is computed as 6 θ t α τ θ s o u n d t 1 α τ θ m o v e m e n t t where the right hand side of 6 represents a weighted average of the directions θ s o u n d t 180 from the time varying sound source at time t and θ m o v e m e n t t the time varying direction given by the stochastic movement model at time t the relative weighting changes with time since disturbance τ and at each step the direction of maximum sound is re evaluated updated for movements by both the whale and sound source if no behavioral responses occur such as when the noise source ceases the whale remembers the direction of maximum sound from the most recent θ s o u n d t the disruption parameter dictates the rate at which this behavior returns to baseline such that when α 0 there is no change in behavior from past disturbance and when α 1 the whale never returns to its baseline behavior note that while the above procedure is explained in terms of a single noise source the ideas are generalizable to different dose response functions multiple behavioral responses different magnitudes of response and multiple simultaneous moving noise sources 2 5 applications we illustrate the movement model through two applications i an idealized example that highlights the features of the simulation tool using a synthetic historical whale spatial density and a synthetic sound source and ii a realistic case study focused on the consequences of acoustic disturbance on a population of fin whales to the west of the southern california anti submarine warfare range soar located west of san clemente island southern california the simulation model and all analysis is written in r r core team 2020 2 5 1 generic whale movement model with synthetic noise an idealized application we demonstrate the movement model for a generic whale moving through a region where a bimodal distribution is imposed that reflects local habitat quality and specifies the historical whale spatial density this idealized scenario simulates one year of whale movement both in the absence and presence of noise disturbance for simplicity we fix the bathymetry of the idealized region to be deeper than the deepest dtag dive registered for tagged fin whales tagged in this region i e 359 m the purpose here is to demonstrate that the particle filter algorithm described in section 2 2 can be used to construct simulated whale tracks that reflect the historical whale spatial density as well as how the introduction of noise affects the movement dive duration is determined by drawing randomly from a distribution derived from fin whale dtag data see supplementary materials for more details on the dtag data the dive step variance σ t 2 is then scaled to the dive duration such that the characteristic displacement is σ t s p e e d d i v e d u r a t i o n where the s p e e d is taken as 1 m s and represents a typical surface speed once σ t 2 is determined we follow the movement sampler of section 2 2 with a sample size of n 30 see supplementary material for an analysis of sensitivity to the number of particles n note that we incorporate the additional constraint of having movement displacements such that they cannot exceed the maximum speed for fin whales assumed to be 7 7 m s or 15 knots aguilar and garcía vernet 2017 fig 2 shows the synthetic historical whale spatial density constructed as a mixture of two bivariate normal distributions also shown in fig 2 is a synthetic isotropic noise field centered at 0 0 the sound pressure level contours in fig 2 correspond to 20 db increments of broadband noise between 100 and 200 db re 1 μ pa the smallest circle corresponds to 200 db isocline which implies a 100 chance of the simulated whale responding to noise at that location using the dose response function of fig 1 similarly outside the biggest circle received levels are below 100 db corresponding to a 0 chance of eliciting a behavioral response the sound source is always on for the duration of this idealized simulation we explored the following scenarios as numerical experiments 1 whale trajectory in the absence of underwater noise the simulated whale trajectories are based only on the random walk model and responding to the historical whale spatial density as dictated by the particle filter 2 whale trajectory in the presence of continuous underwater noise weak disruption simulation of whale movement using both the historical whale spatial density and the imposed underwater noise field the disruption parameter of 6 is set as α 0 5 which implies a relatively short disturbance period and less directional persistence away from the local noise source 3 whale trajectory in the presence of continuous underwater noise strong disruption as above but with α 0 95 implying a longer time before behavior returned to baseline after noise disturbance for each of the three numerical experiments we summarize a one year whale trajectory with the resultant whale density function derived from the simulated trajectories called the utilization density this uses kernel smoothed density estimation worton 1989 and we assume a gaussian kernel and select the smoothing bandwidth as recommended by venables and ripley 2002 this creates a map of the habitat utilization as dictated by the movement model the historical whale spatial density and the noise field 2 5 2 fin whale response to naval sonar in southern california a case study in this application we investigate the consequences of an extended period of naval sonar events on a population of fin whales in the waters off southern california this synthetic scenario consists of a single naval destroyer equipped with a surface ship mid frequency sonar 53c we use an available regional fin whale density surface to bias the random walk towards preferred habitat using our movement sampler becker et al 2016 the movement model uses realizations of dive behavior taken from tagged fin whales in the region and also accounts for local bathymetry which limits dive depths and coastlines which act to constrain horizontal movement specifically the following sources of data are used more information about these data sources is given in supplementary material 1 dive data we incorporate the vertical component of whale habitat through the dives logged on animal tagging devices e g dtags using tag data we determine the relative amount of time spent at each 10 m depth interval as well as the total dive duration and surface time of each dive these dive duration set the displacement magnitude σ t 2 eq 2 as in the idealized example the realized displacement is conditional on the horizontal movement not exceeding the species maximum swim speeds 2 historical whale spatial density we use the density surface of becker et al 2016 fig 3 to bias the random walk towards preferred habitat according to the movement sampler 3 noise field we incorporate the estimated received level rl fields margolina et al 2018 from a typical single ship naval 53c sonar event to the east of the soar region at 5 minute time resolution we use the nspe navy standard parabolic equation model to describe transmission loss from the vessel position sound source along discrete bearings such that each 10 m depth slice of rl is estimated as a sound map the 20 m depth bin is shown in fig 3c more details on the nspe model can be found in the supplementary material a whale s received level is determined by matching the transmission loss model prediction to the depth interval where the whale spends the most time during a dive the temporal sonar sound production regime is based on data provided by the us navy on hourly detections of navy sonar at the nearby soar range for the two years 2014 and 2015 this disturbance regime is proposed only as a demonstration we do not suggest that this level is applicable to the disturbance regime in the region the duration of each sonar event is simulated with a gamma distribution shape 1 845 rate 0 698 with mean of 2 64 h the time between each sonar event is simulated using a gamma distribution shape 0 561 rate 0 02 with mean of 27 86 h corresponding to 272 naval sonar events per year overall the expected percent of days with no sonar is 48 4 bathymetry the simulated whales dive depths are constrained not to exceed the local depth which can be an important constraint in shallow waters bathymetry at resolution of 3 arc second 90 m from the national geophysical data center was used us coastal relief model bathymetry www ngdc noaa gov mgg bathymetry relief html fig 3a in this application we follow a population of 1176 fin whales for one year this number comes from integrating the regional density surface used to predict the number of fin whales from the 2 d log linear model reported in becker et al 2016 we simulate movement of each individual in the horizontal and vertical dimensions with dive by dive resolution in the presence of multiple exposures to point sources of underwater sound each whale s trajectory corresponds to one year of animal movement and tracks each individual s history of disturbance within a year for each naval sonar event the whale is assigned a unique threshold noise value above which the whale has a behavioral response this response threshold is randomly generated from the dose response function by treating it as a cumulative distribution function if the estimated received level at the horizontal and vertical location of the whale exceeds this response threshold the whale responds we apply the dose response function fig 1 at each dive but count only one br per naval sonar event multiple events that elicit a response for an individual whale can be accumulated across time if a whale has one or more br across a time period the fin whale s movement trajectory is then a mixture of the movement model and its unique exposure history and its memory thereof a schematic is presented in fig 4 we ran two numerical experiments of one year duration on the population of 1176 whales but with different disruption parameters the first experiment describes a population of fin whales whose movement is disrupted on average for 20 min α 0 05 post disturbance we assume 48 of days have naval sonar events or 272 events across 365 days the second experiment similarly describes a population of 1176 fin whales with the same regimen of naval sonar events but where this population retains a disruption memory on average of three days α 0 99 as reported for behavioral response of beaked whales by mccarthy et al 2011 as with the idealized example we map the ensemble of whale trajectories using kernel density estimation to create a distribution surface 3 results 3 1 results for idealized case with synthetic noise the first application details the simulated horizontal movement of an individual whale in an idealized setting fig 5 shows the results from the 3 different scenarios 1 whale track without noise fig 5a c 2 whale track with noise and weaker disruption α 0 50 fig 5d f and 3 whale track with noise and stronger disruption α 0 95 fig 5g i for each scenario the left column of fig 5 provides the reference historical whale spatial density and the noise field if present the middle column is the simulated whale trajectory and the right column is the kernel density reconstruction of the whale density from the simulated tracks which we term the utilization or posterior density surface the results from the noise free scenario top row of fig 5 demonstrates that the movement trajectory is an effective sampler of the underlying bimodal historical whale spatial density the whale track in fig 5b shows that in the absence of noise the simulated whale moves between the modal regions of the density surface and is faithful to their relative probabilities note that more opaque red indicates more time spent in an area while avoiding areas that have low historical whale spatial density the kernel density estimate fig 5c matches well the true underlying historical whale spatial density fig 5a the introduction of noise in addition to the historical whale spatial density alters the movement trajectories and the utilization density table 1 when the noise is sufficiently loud to elicit a behavioral response from the whale the trajectory moves 180 away from the sound source in the first interval with a decay in directional persistence proportional to its sensitivity or disruption parameter that defines how long before an individual returns to baseline behavior post disturbance this results in directed movement away from the noise source and given that the sound level of 200 db re 1 μ pa corresponds to a probability of a behavioral response equal to 1 it results in a region of zero occupancy no whale tracks near the origin the sound source also has the effect of blocking the transiting of the whale between the two areas of preferred habitat this region of whale exclusion is seen for both noise scenarios in both the trajectories fig 5e h as well as in the kernel density estimate of the whale utilization density fig 5f i parts of this central region with the highest noise amplitude would have been an area of preferred habitat and have more movement tracks in the absence of the noise disturbance outside of the central acoustic exclusion zone in regions with moderate received levels there is also a reduced tendency to use this habitat table 1 cols 3 and 4 this is combined with a general tendency to preferentially use the eastern half of the domain the noise source region thus not only acts as an exclusion zone it also acts as a partial barrier for the simulated movement in the case of low disruption parameter the simulated whale initially moves to the preferred habitat to the northeast and then spends most of its time there but is able to transit to the preferred habitat in the southwest by going south of the sound source fig 5e with a large disruption parameter the whale is essentially fully blocked from going to the preferred habitat in the southwest whale movement preferentially tends toward the high historical whale spatial density region in the northeast and eastward since strong disruption means more persistence in moving away from the sound source fig 5h i the details of habitat utilization are also affected by the acoustic disruption the role of the disruption parameter α can be ascertained by contrasting the weaker disruption scenario α 0 5 to the stronger disruption α 0 95 scenario in the stronger disruption scenario the tracks are more broadly spread out over a larger region fig 5e as compared to the weaker memory case fig 5h and the corresponding density surface is more diffuse fig 5f and i the memory effect also influences the number of noise induced behavioral responses brs that the whale is subjected to the strong memory case had 2 5 times lower number of brs compared to whales that had shorter behavior disruptions from disturbance when evaluated across a year of continuous sound exposure 1342 brs for α 0 5 vs 542 brs for α 0 95 this corresponds to 2 5 times fewer dives at br inducing exposure levels when disturbance memory is stronger as whales tend to be more distant from the sound source while whales with strong memory have fewer behavior responses these whales also spend more time in less favorable habitat 3 2 results from fin whale case study in southern california this application simulates a population of fin whales off the coast of southern california exposed to noise from naval sonar the individual whale trajectories of 1176 fin whales across a one year time period are shown in fig 6 b and c in the figure each simulated track is partially transparent such that we see the aggregate of the population trajectories collectively as with the idealized scenario the yearly movement trajectories of the population of 1176 fin whales recreates the original historical whale spatial density as taken from becker et al 2016 the southeastern region of fig 6 contains the subregion in gray box where the naval destroyer conducts a sequence of sonar events and exposes the population to received levels high enough to elicit a br from a fin whale this subregion is also depicted in fig 7 whales in this subregion respond to the disturbance through their horizontal movement as this subregion is not a significant hotspot for fin whales the effect of naval disturbance on individual movement has less impact than fig 5 c vs f i and therefore is less influential on the aggregated population s habitat utilization this pattern arises from the region hosting fewer whales and therefore fewer opportunities for an overlap of whales and noise disturbance in fig 7 we show the naval sonar exposure field and the br history for two identical populations of 1176 whales differing only in their return time to baseline behavior after a disturbance in both cases 79 of the 1176 fin whales in the southern california region were affected by naval sonar events table 2 this means 7 of the population experienced a received level high enough to experience a behavioral response comparing the short disruption time before return to baseline behavior fig 7b to the long disruption time case fig 7c shows higher numbers and density of brs in the short disruption case over the long disruption case this means that whales that return to the area faster returning to baseline movement behavior sooner could have greater consequences from the same disturbance regime at the end of a year of monitoring specifically in the short disruption case there were a total of 328 brs across the 79 whales with a response to the naval disturbance i e 0 27 95 c i 0 16 0 44 brs per whale per year comparatively there were 198 brs shared across the 79 whales when a longer disruption time occurs i e 0 17 95 c i 0 10 0 25 table 2 at the individual dive level over the course of a year the largest impact most brs occurs when the return time to baseline behavior is short smaller disruption parameter α and the whale is exposed to threshold sound levels for 163 dives when the return time is long larger α the maximum dives above threshold noise levels fell to 39 this corresponds to four times fewer dives at br inducing exposure levels largely due to whales being more distant from the sound source when the disruption parameter is greater when translated to time this corresponds to 15 3 h 95 c i 2 36 59 5 h and 3 7 h 95 c i 0 56 14 2 h of time exposed to noise above the br threshold for the short and long changes in behavior cases respectively many of these individual dive level impacts are logged within the same naval sonar exercise that is the 163 and 39 dives above the br noise thresholds occurred during just five sonar exercises as the convention is to count a maximum of one br per whale per naval exercise finneran et al 2017 the range of brs for a single whale is between 0 and 5 it is worth remembering however that higher values of the disruption parameter means a longer period of displacement even if in aggregate it means fewer brs 4 discussion in this study we have presented a framework for simulating marine animal movement its novelty is the following i a flexible movement simulator sampler wherein a stochastic movement model adapts to a pre defined whale density surface using a sequential monte carlo algorithm particle filter ii inclusion of dive information in the forward simulator to control the magnitude of the displacement variance term and set the step size thereby linking the horizontal and vertical movement dynamics iii inclusion of a probabilistic behavioral response to sound using a biphasic dose response curve that operates as a stochastic element within a movement model to trigger compensatory movement in response to disturbance iv incorporation of short and long lasting behavior changes in response to sound induced disturbance that controls the time scale for reversion of movement to the disturbance free case and v realistic application to the fin whale population off southern california over biologically meaningful lengths of time one year in our experiment for this latter targeted application to naval sonar exposures we demonstrated how movement histories and sound exposure at depth for each track over an entire year can be summarized thereby establishing the means to infer the impacts of cumulative disturbances on vital rates this movement modeling framework is general and flexible it allows for incorporation of any stochastic movement model e g continuous time or discrete time with any time step rule based alterations to movement were used to deal with the behavioral response to sound exposure and coastline avoidance one novelty was to introduce a sequential monte carlo sampler that allows for movement realizations to be generated that are influenced by the historical whale spatial density most existing movement simulation frameworks provide a means to sample from a pre defined known whale distribution that could be derived from a sighting data or a species distribution model e g aim frankel et al 2002 safesimm donovan et al 2012 3mb hauser 2006 naemo blackstock et al 2018 michelot et al 2019a b also treat this problem by proposing a markov chain monte carlo sampler whose target distribution is the historical whale spatial density there called a resource selection function with an emphasis on identifying movement models for which this feature holds in fact the random walk model of this study in the absence of sound and coastline effects corresponds to their local gibbs over irregular sample intervals whose long run distribution is the historical whale spatial density sequential monte carlo samplers are a flexible class of samplers based on forward kernels movement models and importance sampling and offer a viable and in some cases superior alternative to markov chain monte carlo samplers del moral et al 2006 our sequential monte carlo sampler yields a movement generator faithful to the underlying historical whale spatial density surface with the flexibility to also alter movement in response to coastlines bathymetry oceanographic fields prey distributions and underwater sound disturbance it was demonstrated that when excessive noise is present the movement of whales differs from the historical whale spatial density reflecting changes in animal behavior in response to noise disturbance and the duration of response to that disturbance it offers an alternative to the potential function approach brillinger 2010 wherein movement trajectories are altered through imposed fields of attraction or repulsion we explored application of the movement simulation framework through two case studies one idealized and the other based on southern california fin whales the idealized study illustrates the basic setup as well as how the simulator performs for a simple and intuitive situation the more realistic application to fin whales with exposure to naval sonar provides an illustration of how the framework can be used to understand the cumulative effects of underwater sound over a biologically meaningful period of time we were able to show that the consequences of a single disturbance are a function of how loud the received level at the whale s location where the whale is relative to its preferred habitat when it is disturbed and how long a whale takes before returning to a pre disturbance state over the one year time period the movement framework links multiple disturbance events to individuals in a population that are repeatedly affected leading to a potential means to assess impacts on vital rates that is by examining the cumulative consequences of multiple naval sonar exercises in an animal s home range we can look at energetic consequences of sound exposure in the fin whale case study we observed some individuals being exposed more due to their proximity to the sonar exercises if the consequence of disturbance can last up to 3 days mccarthy et al 2011 and brs happen repeatedly to the same whale then lower survival and breeding rates are likely consequences pirotta et al 2018 in this case study the locations of the naval sonar exercises did not overlap with a high density region of fin whales had the naval exercises overlapped more with high whale density regions the consequences would likely have been greater we would expect higher numbers of dives at received noise levels above the br threshold potentially eliciting more brs and causing more fin whales to be excluded from preferred habitat for longer if such responses were observed in many individuals there would be a potential for impacts on fin whale population vital rates as the simulated sonar used in our case study overlapped a low whale density area and in reality it is unlikely that one exercise would represent the spatial extent of a year s worth of sonar exercises it may be of interest to the us navy to repeat this experiment with a more realistic set of spatial and temporal locations for our individual based model we made a series of assumptions and decisions using a bottom up approach in the sense of grimm 1999 several of these necessarily simplify the underlying ecology for example simulated animals were assumed to move independently of each other in many cases animals are known to live in groups this could most readily be included in the simulations by assuming that animal locations are instead group locations and simulating a random group size if further refinement were needed the animal location could instead be considered to be the center of a group with individuals displaying an attraction to this group center e g langrock et al 2014 another reason for non independence is that many species live within home ranges within a larger population distribution in this case density surface model could be used to simulate a different home range center for each animal and an individual density surface could then be generated for each animal for example based on a bivariate normal distribution centered on its home range center this would then be used instead of the population level density surface to bias the animal movement model so that the animal would tend to remain within its home range the movement of animals almost certainly deviates from the assumptions of this movement model but we can use information about the characteristics of movement paths from real animals to derive better predictions of encounter rates with naval disturbance that is with the wealth of information from satellite tagging data we could create a more realistic movement model than a random walk and have animals cue off of environmental and oceanographic features or set movement model parameters to reflect behavioral state e g foraging vs traveling additionally uncertainty could be incorporated on model inputs for example different whales could be given different dose response functions reflecting permanent differences in responsiveness uncertainty in the density surface could be incorporated through multiple simulations each sampling from the possible range of inputs output uncertainty could then readily be quantified we stress however that considerable complexity and understanding can be made using straightforward assumptions about movements e g nabe nielsen et al 2013 2014 2018 the framework is a highly flexible and similar approaches have yielded considerable insight about spatial patterns with and without disturbance nabe nielsen et al 2018 warwick evans et al 2018 our study offers opportunities for combining theory with data and to improve our understanding of spatial dynamics and naval impacts grimm 1999 with this framework in place we are now able to examine impacts of a time series of exposures and what these imply for individuals in terms of impacts on vital rates towards this end there are several frameworks that could be applied including an individual based model that tracks food intake nabe nielsen et al 2013 and a dynamic state variable approach mchuron et al 2017 that examines how disturbance may alter vital rates over the course of a year pirotta et al 2018 our model once calibrated and validated should prove useful as part of a decision support tool in combination with existing methods to estimate behavioral effects of

24505,understanding the impacts of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals is important for effective mitigation and management sound impacts can cause behavioral changes that lead to displacement from preferred habitat and can have negative influence on vital rates here we develop a movement model to better understand and simulate how whales respond to anthropogenic sound over ecologically meaningful space and time scales the stochastic model is based on a sequential monte carlo sampler a particle filter the movement model takes account of vertical dive information and is influenced by the underwater soundscape and the historical whale distribution in the region in the absence of noise disturbance the simulator is shown to recover the historical whale distribution in the region when noise disturbance is incorporated the whale s behavioral response is determined through a dose response function dependent on the received level of sound the aggregate impact is assessed by considering both the duration of foraging loss and the spatial shift to alternate and potentially less favorable habitat persistence of the behavioral response in time is treated through a disruption parameter we apply the approach to a population of fin whales whose distribution overlaps naval sonar testing activities beside the southern california range complex the simulation shows the consequences of one year of naval sonar disturbance are a function of i how loud the sound source is ii where the disturbed whales are relative to preferred high density habitat and iii how long a whale takes before returning to a pre disturbance state the movement simulator developed here is a generic movement modeling tool that can be adapted for different species different regions and any acoustic disturbances with known impacts on animal populations keywords animal movement model particle filter naval sonar dose response function aggregate impact fin whales 1 introduction the us marine mammal protection act 16 u s c 1361 et seq aims to protect marine mammals from harassment in us waters exceptions may be made for certain activities including those that generate underwater sound a key example and a central motivator for this paper is when tactical sonar is used for naval training and testing to receive an exception the us navy undertakes extensive planning to determine how many whales could be exposed to sonar and the levels at which each animal is exposed at present one limitation of this approach is that each simulation of behavioral effects is done for a 24 hour period with no memory of previous disturbance this limits our understanding of longer term effects of multiple sound exposure on whales behavior health and ultimately vital rates the literature on the link between exposure and impacts on hearing and behavior is rich e g southall et al 2019 but determining the aggregate impacts of multiple exposures as well as the cumulative effect of different stressors on vital rates is an open and pressing research question national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2017 animal movement models are a class of stochastic models that simulate trajectories through time and space hooten et al 2017 these stochastic movement models are extremely flexible in terms of character of the realizations of animal movement they can generate they generally must be confronted with location data tracks within an inferential framework in order to provide reasonable simulations of actual trajectories bio logging technologies have provided these data and revolutionalized the study of animal movement whitford and klimley 2019 fusion of movement models and tracking data through statistical methods allow for understanding of animal behavior inferred through movement approaches often focus on estimating the parameters for behavioral inference e g patterson et al 2017 using methods such as bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc morales et al 2004 joy et al 2015 and statistical frameworks such as hidden markov models langrock et al 2012 whoriskey et al 2017 and state space models jonsen et al 2003 dowd and joy 2011 there is also significant interest in developing movement simulators that simulate realistic trajectories but do not rely directly on observed track data these include the use of potential functions that influence model trajectories based on imposed field of attraction or repulsion brillinger 2010 preisler et al 2013 one recent development makes use of resource selection functions that encapsulate habitat preference michelot et al 2019a b and proposes an mcmc based simulator wherein the step selection functions or movement models are such that the long run distribution tends to the resource selection function here we offer a related but distinct sequential monte carlo sampler del moral et al 2006 for movement simulation that can account for historical distributions of whale abundance as well as incorporate sound exposure a suite of individual based animal movement models have been developed to merge individual based movement with exposure to noise disturbance e g aim frankel et al 2002 safesimm donovan et al 2012 3mb hauser 2006 and the us navy acoustics effect model naemo blackstock et al 2018 3mtsim parrott et al 2011 these existing methods are limited in a number of respects first long run movement in the absence of disturbance does not tend to the resource selection function second none of these acoustic effects models accounts for behavioral context ellison et al 2012 although a few include realistic avoidance behavior donovan et al 2017 third existing approaches are limited in their ability to assess aggregate exposure over more ecologically meaningful time frames i e those that may be linked to vital rates and population consequences e g pirotta et al 2018 from both a conservation and ecological standpoint it is important to move beyond single event assessments and examine long run movement of individuals and how their spatial use changes across multiple sound exposures this study proposes a novel formulation for a marine animal movement model in the form of a particle filter based movement sampler this is motivated by and targeted at a population of fin whales in the coastal waters off southern california although the methods themselves are quite general the movement simulator provides a framework for evaluating long term consequences e g over one year of sound disturbance by tracking sound exposure and behavioral changes on the individuals that collectively may induce population level consequences on vital rates we make use of a multi scale individual based random walk marine mammal movement model that simulates horizontal movement and diving over a period of up to one year of us naval sonar exercises with dive by dive resolution the sequential monte carlo sampler allows movement trajectories to follow historical whale distributions in this way individual based movement simulations permit us to incorporate the following i the aggregate noise exposure in an area ii the movement of individuals in response to the exposure and iii the changes in habitat use as a result of those sound induced behavioral changes we propose this model as part of a management focused tool that when calibrated to local conditions could be used in combination with existing methods to estimate behavioral effects of accumulated exposure and the distribution of aggregate exposure and behavior response within the population collectively this tool assists on going efforts to better describe the consequences of anthropogenic sources of disturbance on marine mammals and the possible effect of mitigation measures while our focus is on marine mammals and underwater sound our movement modeling approach could be applied to other marine or terrestrial species to study spatial habitat use and behavioral disturbance due to anthropogenic stressors 2 methods we develop a stochastic modeling approach that simulates the movement of a whale through space and time it is based on a stochastic movement model producing whale trajectories that are influenced by historical whale distribution as well as underwater noise fields in this section we first introduce a general movement model we consider its vertical dimension as being taken from a population dive distribution this is coupled to a random walk model of the horizontal movement next we demonstrate how realizations trajectories of this stochastic movement model can be guided by a historical spatial whale distribution surface something that is often available from past studies based on sightings surveys or other data on habitat utilization finally the influence of underwater noise is incorporated using a hypothetical dose response function to define the probability of a behavioral response that takes the form of an alteration of the movement pathway to avoid or minimize further sound exposure the general framework for the movement model is the following stochastic time series model 1 x t d x t 1 ϕ ε t where x t is the state vector that describes the state at time t which here represents the animal s location the operator d steps the movement process forward in time it is markovian and has a dependence on the state at the previous time x t 1 as well as on a set of parameters ϕ the term ε t represents stochastic forcing or random disturbance it is generally assumed serially uncorrelated and can enter multiplicatively or additively the unit time index and the time increment defined by it is arbitrary it could reflect the discretization time used in a numerical scheme for solving differential equations hence mimicking continuous movement it could be the time between observations of the system or it could simply reflect any time interval of interest that is regularly or otherwise spaced eq 1 is a very general movement model and below it is made application specific by first considering the movement in the vertical depth dimension and then showing how that informs movement in the horizontal dimension 2 1 vertical movement we first consider the vertical movement or dive characteristics as this acts to specify many of the features of the horizontal movement the statistics describing an individual dive typically are assumed to follow a known distribution including dive duration descent rates time at the surface between dives and time at depth hauser 2006 here we consider the intermediate time spent not diving as surface related activity that is linked to the previous subsurface component of a dive which relates in part to the recovery phase after submergence tyack et al 2006 this couplet of submergence and surface recovery is henceforth called a dive dives are randomly generated from species dive statistics or taken directly from dives recorded on tags each dive realization is assumed to occur independently from any previous dive and represents a discrete event dive durations are variable and do not conform to a regular time interval furthermore for realism each dive is also constrained to be less deep than the local bathymetry at the dive location importantly as outlined below these realizations of vertical movement are coupled to the horizontal movement with the duration of each dive defining the associated time step for the stochastic model of horizontal movement as well as the magnitude of the horizontal displacement 2 2 horizontal movement the horizontal part of the movement model is based on a simple 2 d random walk that is straightforward to simulate from 2 x t x t 1 ε t where ε t n 0 σ t 2 here x t is a 2 1 vector that represents the northing and easting utm position of the whale at time step t the unit time step here is taken as the dive duration which will be a variable not constant length of time longer dive durations tend to be associated with larger displacement between two point locations fauchald and tveraa 2003 to incorporate this feature we make the variance term σ t 2 in the state evolution eq 2 a scalar function of the dive duration specifically the standard deviation for the displacement σ t is the dive duration multiplied by a typical speed of the whale species under consideration we further add a constraint to the horizontal movement through a user defined threshold that rejects a proposed displacement if it exceeds the maximum possible speed of the species effectively making ε t a normal distribution with its upper tail truncated hence the transition density p x t x t 1 associated with eq 2 is a truncated normal as described 2 3 incorporating spatial habitat use the basic random walk given by eq 2 is by itself not a particularly informative or realistic model for whale location eq 2 has no directional fidelity to the movement meaning that the expected location is the simulation starting position and location variance just grows as a linear function of time to add realism through directional preference we use this movement model within a sequential monte carlo sampler to take into account information on historical whale spatial density below we assume we have an estimate of the spatial probability density function of whales in a mapped region from past studies in practice this habitat preference is often a product derived from whale sightings fitted with a density surface model or from a species distribution model it may alternatively be referred to as a resource selection function boyce and mcdonald 1999 we will term this quantity the historical whale spatial density to emphasize that it is an already obtained quantity and denote it as p y t x t this says that for a particular animal location x t we can determine the probability of a whale observation y t occurring there the historical whale spatial density will be used to influence the local trajectory of the random walk and hence bias the horizontal movement and impart directional fidelity that reflects habitat preference more specifically we seek the posterior distribution of the new whale location taking account the previous position the movement model prediction and the historical whale spatial density from bayes theorem we have 3 p x t y t p y t x t p x t x t 1 where p x t y t is the target distribution note that the movement model p x t x t 1 and the historical whale spatial density p y t x t also provide the components for a state space model whose goal is to determine the posterior p x t y t for t 1 t we exploit this fact below to propose a sequential estimation procedure for the state that combines the random walk movement model with the historical whale spatial density in order to generate realizations of whale trajectories that are draws from the posterior note that there are no parameters to estimate here since the displacement variance σ t 2 and the whale observation density p y t x t are user inputs and hence specified since the distributions considered are generally non gaussian we use the basic particle filtering algorithm of sequential importance resampling sir gordon et al 1993 kitagawa 1987 in general terms this works as follows starting with initial conditions x 0 the whale movement model predicts possible movement locations the historical whale spatial density weights these locations based on the probability of a whale being found there and a weighted resampling occurs after which a new location is determined the procedure then continues sequentially forward through time the particle filter is simple to implement well understood and converges to the target posterior kitagawa 1987 our specific adaption of this sequential monte carlo algorithm to generating whale trajectories is given below for this sequential recursive algorithm we assume without loss of generality that we are at time t 1 and know the whale location at that time i e the location at the start of a dive our goal is to determine its position at the next time t at the end of the dive and after surface recovery we do this according to the following sequence of steps starting with the whale location x t 1 i set up determine the displacement variance term σ t 2 in the horizontal movement model 2 this is done by randomly generating a dive duration from a species dive distribution see sections 2 1 and 2 2 ii prediction simulate n possible whale positions at time t by drawing n realizations of the random vector of displacement ε t and applying the random walk model 2 to each one this yields a set of n possible predicted locations designated x t t 1 i i 1 n which is a draw from the transition density p x t x t 1 here x t t 1 designates the one step ahead forecast location prior to any consideration of the historical whale spatial density and the superscript i identifies an ensemble member particle iii weighting calculate a weight for each member of the forecast ensemble w t i i 1 n the n weights are calculated for each forecast whale position as being proportional to the whale spatial density 4 w t i p y t x t t 1 i iv selection a single ensemble member is selected randomly from the candidate set x t t 1 i i 1 n with probability proportional to their weights w t i this becomes the next location in the simulated track at time t or the value for the position x t applying this algorithm for all time steps yields a single trajectory for a whale that is a function of the stochastic movement model as well as the historical whale spatial density the basic random walk could in some sense be said to be biased by the local landscape conditions one feature of the algorithm is that to obtain a single whale trajectory requires at each time step the generation of many n candidate location predictions from which a single one is chosen however since the movement model and the weighted resampling are computationally trivial the overall computational burden should be minimal the size of n is user specified and must be large enough so that whale location predictions sufficiently populate the local space around the current position allowing an appropriate particle to be chosen for the trajectory that properly responds to the historical whale spatial density see supplementary material to generate an ensemble of whale trajectories or many individual tracks multiple runs of the above algorithm would be undertaken these could be run in parallel finally note that this approach is a general one it can be applied to any markovian movement model of the form 1 and will converge to the target posterior the sequential monte carlo sampler is discussed further in section 4 2 4 whale movement response to underwater noise the simulated whales response to the sound field incorporates three components 1 a biphasic dose response function that informs the probability of a response to noise disturbance 2 directional horizontal movement away from the loudest noise in the region of the whale this changes over time as noise source s and the whales move 3 duration of behavioral disruption post disturbance that affects directional persistence the strength of the behavior changes decreases with time as behavior reverts to baseline according to an exponential decay governed by a disruption parameter 2 4 1 biphasic dose response function probability of behavioral response is modeled as a function of the acoustic dose of anthropogenic noise quantified as the received sound level rl a biphasic functional relationship has been hypothesized ellison et al 2012 whereby i at lower rls the response is dependent on the pre existing behavioral context of the whale while ii at higher rls a behavioral response is more likely and is more directly tied to rl combining these two modes of response and integrating over behavioral states leads to a biphasic function this type of function has been fitted to experimental and observational data from multiple taxa and used by the us navy in its impact assessments finneran et al 2017 empirical data on fin whale responses to sonar are not yet available thus the dose response relationship used here is borrowed from that of blue whales a related mysticete species in the same genus balaenoptera finneran et al 2017 an example of the dose response functional form is shown in fig 1 with modification possible once experimental observational data become available the probabilistic functional form is 5 p r r e s p o n s e p 1 1 0 l 1 d o s e h 1 1 p 1 1 0 l 2 d o s e h 2 where d o s e is the received sound pressure level spl in db re 1 μ pa of broadband noise p is the proportion of the curve comprising the first lower dose phase l 1 is the broadband spl at the midpoint inflection point of the first phase l 2 is the broadband spl at the midpoint inflection point of the second phase h 1 is the slope of the first phase where smaller values correspond to lower contextual response and h 2 is the hill slope of the second phase this model is a generalization of the monophasic models previously developed and applied in this context e g antunes et al 2014 and miller et al 2014 other forms of dose response function than those of mono and bi phasic forms could readily be used we refer the reader to the supplementary material for additional information on this function 2 4 2 directional response to noise suppose there is a received level sufficiently loud to trigger a behavioral response br via eq 5 at time t at the animal s location x t the movements of the whale to next location x t 1 are modeled as having a behavioral response such that it moves in a direction 180 away from the maximum sound source this angle is described by the 2 1 unit vector θ s o u n d t containing the easting and northing vector components the magnitude of the movement is taken to be identical to the horizontal displacement computed by the movement model in the absence of any noise effect this corresponds to a step size dictated by the realization of ε t 1 and is the euclidean distance between x t and x t 1 or x t 1 x t at the new position x t 1 at time t 1 if the sound level is still sufficient to trigger another behavioral response then the procedure continues by moving 180 away from the new direction of maximum sound source θ s o u n d t 1 with the distance x t 2 x t 1 goldbogen et al 2013 found whales responded with directional travel away from the sound source when exposed to playbacks of military sonar in some cases whales have been shown to increase speed in response to sonar e g deruiter et al 2013 and this could readily be incorporated if desired 2 4 3 disruption of behavior time to revert to baseline behavior after a behavioral response once a behavioral response occurs then the post disturbance movement process gradually reverts back to that of the disturbance free movement model the rate at which this happens is governed by a parameter α τ where τ is the number of time steps or dives since the most recent behavioral response occurred and α is the disruption parameter 0 α 1 since it is only the direction of movement that is changed the post disturbance direction at time step τ θ t is computed as 6 θ t α τ θ s o u n d t 1 α τ θ m o v e m e n t t where the right hand side of 6 represents a weighted average of the directions θ s o u n d t 180 from the time varying sound source at time t and θ m o v e m e n t t the time varying direction given by the stochastic movement model at time t the relative weighting changes with time since disturbance τ and at each step the direction of maximum sound is re evaluated updated for movements by both the whale and sound source if no behavioral responses occur such as when the noise source ceases the whale remembers the direction of maximum sound from the most recent θ s o u n d t the disruption parameter dictates the rate at which this behavior returns to baseline such that when α 0 there is no change in behavior from past disturbance and when α 1 the whale never returns to its baseline behavior note that while the above procedure is explained in terms of a single noise source the ideas are generalizable to different dose response functions multiple behavioral responses different magnitudes of response and multiple simultaneous moving noise sources 2 5 applications we illustrate the movement model through two applications i an idealized example that highlights the features of the simulation tool using a synthetic historical whale spatial density and a synthetic sound source and ii a realistic case study focused on the consequences of acoustic disturbance on a population of fin whales to the west of the southern california anti submarine warfare range soar located west of san clemente island southern california the simulation model and all analysis is written in r r core team 2020 2 5 1 generic whale movement model with synthetic noise an idealized application we demonstrate the movement model for a generic whale moving through a region where a bimodal distribution is imposed that reflects local habitat quality and specifies the historical whale spatial density this idealized scenario simulates one year of whale movement both in the absence and presence of noise disturbance for simplicity we fix the bathymetry of the idealized region to be deeper than the deepest dtag dive registered for tagged fin whales tagged in this region i e 359 m the purpose here is to demonstrate that the particle filter algorithm described in section 2 2 can be used to construct simulated whale tracks that reflect the historical whale spatial density as well as how the introduction of noise affects the movement dive duration is determined by drawing randomly from a distribution derived from fin whale dtag data see supplementary materials for more details on the dtag data the dive step variance σ t 2 is then scaled to the dive duration such that the characteristic displacement is σ t s p e e d d i v e d u r a t i o n where the s p e e d is taken as 1 m s and represents a typical surface speed once σ t 2 is determined we follow the movement sampler of section 2 2 with a sample size of n 30 see supplementary material for an analysis of sensitivity to the number of particles n note that we incorporate the additional constraint of having movement displacements such that they cannot exceed the maximum speed for fin whales assumed to be 7 7 m s or 15 knots aguilar and garcía vernet 2017 fig 2 shows the synthetic historical whale spatial density constructed as a mixture of two bivariate normal distributions also shown in fig 2 is a synthetic isotropic noise field centered at 0 0 the sound pressure level contours in fig 2 correspond to 20 db increments of broadband noise between 100 and 200 db re 1 μ pa the smallest circle corresponds to 200 db isocline which implies a 100 chance of the simulated whale responding to noise at that location using the dose response function of fig 1 similarly outside the biggest circle received levels are below 100 db corresponding to a 0 chance of eliciting a behavioral response the sound source is always on for the duration of this idealized simulation we explored the following scenarios as numerical experiments 1 whale trajectory in the absence of underwater noise the simulated whale trajectories are based only on the random walk model and responding to the historical whale spatial density as dictated by the particle filter 2 whale trajectory in the presence of continuous underwater noise weak disruption simulation of whale movement using both the historical whale spatial density and the imposed underwater noise field the disruption parameter of 6 is set as α 0 5 which implies a relatively short disturbance period and less directional persistence away from the local noise source 3 whale trajectory in the presence of continuous underwater noise strong disruption as above but with α 0 95 implying a longer time before behavior returned to baseline after noise disturbance for each of the three numerical experiments we summarize a one year whale trajectory with the resultant whale density function derived from the simulated trajectories called the utilization density this uses kernel smoothed density estimation worton 1989 and we assume a gaussian kernel and select the smoothing bandwidth as recommended by venables and ripley 2002 this creates a map of the habitat utilization as dictated by the movement model the historical whale spatial density and the noise field 2 5 2 fin whale response to naval sonar in southern california a case study in this application we investigate the consequences of an extended period of naval sonar events on a population of fin whales in the waters off southern california this synthetic scenario consists of a single naval destroyer equipped with a surface ship mid frequency sonar 53c we use an available regional fin whale density surface to bias the random walk towards preferred habitat using our movement sampler becker et al 2016 the movement model uses realizations of dive behavior taken from tagged fin whales in the region and also accounts for local bathymetry which limits dive depths and coastlines which act to constrain horizontal movement specifically the following sources of data are used more information about these data sources is given in supplementary material 1 dive data we incorporate the vertical component of whale habitat through the dives logged on animal tagging devices e g dtags using tag data we determine the relative amount of time spent at each 10 m depth interval as well as the total dive duration and surface time of each dive these dive duration set the displacement magnitude σ t 2 eq 2 as in the idealized example the realized displacement is conditional on the horizontal movement not exceeding the species maximum swim speeds 2 historical whale spatial density we use the density surface of becker et al 2016 fig 3 to bias the random walk towards preferred habitat according to the movement sampler 3 noise field we incorporate the estimated received level rl fields margolina et al 2018 from a typical single ship naval 53c sonar event to the east of the soar region at 5 minute time resolution we use the nspe navy standard parabolic equation model to describe transmission loss from the vessel position sound source along discrete bearings such that each 10 m depth slice of rl is estimated as a sound map the 20 m depth bin is shown in fig 3c more details on the nspe model can be found in the supplementary material a whale s received level is determined by matching the transmission loss model prediction to the depth interval where the whale spends the most time during a dive the temporal sonar sound production regime is based on data provided by the us navy on hourly detections of navy sonar at the nearby soar range for the two years 2014 and 2015 this disturbance regime is proposed only as a demonstration we do not suggest that this level is applicable to the disturbance regime in the region the duration of each sonar event is simulated with a gamma distribution shape 1 845 rate 0 698 with mean of 2 64 h the time between each sonar event is simulated using a gamma distribution shape 0 561 rate 0 02 with mean of 27 86 h corresponding to 272 naval sonar events per year overall the expected percent of days with no sonar is 48 4 bathymetry the simulated whales dive depths are constrained not to exceed the local depth which can be an important constraint in shallow waters bathymetry at resolution of 3 arc second 90 m from the national geophysical data center was used us coastal relief model bathymetry www ngdc noaa gov mgg bathymetry relief html fig 3a in this application we follow a population of 1176 fin whales for one year this number comes from integrating the regional density surface used to predict the number of fin whales from the 2 d log linear model reported in becker et al 2016 we simulate movement of each individual in the horizontal and vertical dimensions with dive by dive resolution in the presence of multiple exposures to point sources of underwater sound each whale s trajectory corresponds to one year of animal movement and tracks each individual s history of disturbance within a year for each naval sonar event the whale is assigned a unique threshold noise value above which the whale has a behavioral response this response threshold is randomly generated from the dose response function by treating it as a cumulative distribution function if the estimated received level at the horizontal and vertical location of the whale exceeds this response threshold the whale responds we apply the dose response function fig 1 at each dive but count only one br per naval sonar event multiple events that elicit a response for an individual whale can be accumulated across time if a whale has one or more br across a time period the fin whale s movement trajectory is then a mixture of the movement model and its unique exposure history and its memory thereof a schematic is presented in fig 4 we ran two numerical experiments of one year duration on the population of 1176 whales but with different disruption parameters the first experiment describes a population of fin whales whose movement is disrupted on average for 20 min α 0 05 post disturbance we assume 48 of days have naval sonar events or 272 events across 365 days the second experiment similarly describes a population of 1176 fin whales with the same regimen of naval sonar events but where this population retains a disruption memory on average of three days α 0 99 as reported for behavioral response of beaked whales by mccarthy et al 2011 as with the idealized example we map the ensemble of whale trajectories using kernel density estimation to create a distribution surface 3 results 3 1 results for idealized case with synthetic noise the first application details the simulated horizontal movement of an individual whale in an idealized setting fig 5 shows the results from the 3 different scenarios 1 whale track without noise fig 5a c 2 whale track with noise and weaker disruption α 0 50 fig 5d f and 3 whale track with noise and stronger disruption α 0 95 fig 5g i for each scenario the left column of fig 5 provides the reference historical whale spatial density and the noise field if present the middle column is the simulated whale trajectory and the right column is the kernel density reconstruction of the whale density from the simulated tracks which we term the utilization or posterior density surface the results from the noise free scenario top row of fig 5 demonstrates that the movement trajectory is an effective sampler of the underlying bimodal historical whale spatial density the whale track in fig 5b shows that in the absence of noise the simulated whale moves between the modal regions of the density surface and is faithful to their relative probabilities note that more opaque red indicates more time spent in an area while avoiding areas that have low historical whale spatial density the kernel density estimate fig 5c matches well the true underlying historical whale spatial density fig 5a the introduction of noise in addition to the historical whale spatial density alters the movement trajectories and the utilization density table 1 when the noise is sufficiently loud to elicit a behavioral response from the whale the trajectory moves 180 away from the sound source in the first interval with a decay in directional persistence proportional to its sensitivity or disruption parameter that defines how long before an individual returns to baseline behavior post disturbance this results in directed movement away from the noise source and given that the sound level of 200 db re 1 μ pa corresponds to a probability of a behavioral response equal to 1 it results in a region of zero occupancy no whale tracks near the origin the sound source also has the effect of blocking the transiting of the whale between the two areas of preferred habitat this region of whale exclusion is seen for both noise scenarios in both the trajectories fig 5e h as well as in the kernel density estimate of the whale utilization density fig 5f i parts of this central region with the highest noise amplitude would have been an area of preferred habitat and have more movement tracks in the absence of the noise disturbance outside of the central acoustic exclusion zone in regions with moderate received levels there is also a reduced tendency to use this habitat table 1 cols 3 and 4 this is combined with a general tendency to preferentially use the eastern half of the domain the noise source region thus not only acts as an exclusion zone it also acts as a partial barrier for the simulated movement in the case of low disruption parameter the simulated whale initially moves to the preferred habitat to the northeast and then spends most of its time there but is able to transit to the preferred habitat in the southwest by going south of the sound source fig 5e with a large disruption parameter the whale is essentially fully blocked from going to the preferred habitat in the southwest whale movement preferentially tends toward the high historical whale spatial density region in the northeast and eastward since strong disruption means more persistence in moving away from the sound source fig 5h i the details of habitat utilization are also affected by the acoustic disruption the role of the disruption parameter α can be ascertained by contrasting the weaker disruption scenario α 0 5 to the stronger disruption α 0 95 scenario in the stronger disruption scenario the tracks are more broadly spread out over a larger region fig 5e as compared to the weaker memory case fig 5h and the corresponding density surface is more diffuse fig 5f and i the memory effect also influences the number of noise induced behavioral responses brs that the whale is subjected to the strong memory case had 2 5 times lower number of brs compared to whales that had shorter behavior disruptions from disturbance when evaluated across a year of continuous sound exposure 1342 brs for α 0 5 vs 542 brs for α 0 95 this corresponds to 2 5 times fewer dives at br inducing exposure levels when disturbance memory is stronger as whales tend to be more distant from the sound source while whales with strong memory have fewer behavior responses these whales also spend more time in less favorable habitat 3 2 results from fin whale case study in southern california this application simulates a population of fin whales off the coast of southern california exposed to noise from naval sonar the individual whale trajectories of 1176 fin whales across a one year time period are shown in fig 6 b and c in the figure each simulated track is partially transparent such that we see the aggregate of the population trajectories collectively as with the idealized scenario the yearly movement trajectories of the population of 1176 fin whales recreates the original historical whale spatial density as taken from becker et al 2016 the southeastern region of fig 6 contains the subregion in gray box where the naval destroyer conducts a sequence of sonar events and exposes the population to received levels high enough to elicit a br from a fin whale this subregion is also depicted in fig 7 whales in this subregion respond to the disturbance through their horizontal movement as this subregion is not a significant hotspot for fin whales the effect of naval disturbance on individual movement has less impact than fig 5 c vs f i and therefore is less influential on the aggregated population s habitat utilization this pattern arises from the region hosting fewer whales and therefore fewer opportunities for an overlap of whales and noise disturbance in fig 7 we show the naval sonar exposure field and the br history for two identical populations of 1176 whales differing only in their return time to baseline behavior after a disturbance in both cases 79 of the 1176 fin whales in the southern california region were affected by naval sonar events table 2 this means 7 of the population experienced a received level high enough to experience a behavioral response comparing the short disruption time before return to baseline behavior fig 7b to the long disruption time case fig 7c shows higher numbers and density of brs in the short disruption case over the long disruption case this means that whales that return to the area faster returning to baseline movement behavior sooner could have greater consequences from the same disturbance regime at the end of a year of monitoring specifically in the short disruption case there were a total of 328 brs across the 79 whales with a response to the naval disturbance i e 0 27 95 c i 0 16 0 44 brs per whale per year comparatively there were 198 brs shared across the 79 whales when a longer disruption time occurs i e 0 17 95 c i 0 10 0 25 table 2 at the individual dive level over the course of a year the largest impact most brs occurs when the return time to baseline behavior is short smaller disruption parameter α and the whale is exposed to threshold sound levels for 163 dives when the return time is long larger α the maximum dives above threshold noise levels fell to 39 this corresponds to four times fewer dives at br inducing exposure levels largely due to whales being more distant from the sound source when the disruption parameter is greater when translated to time this corresponds to 15 3 h 95 c i 2 36 59 5 h and 3 7 h 95 c i 0 56 14 2 h of time exposed to noise above the br threshold for the short and long changes in behavior cases respectively many of these individual dive level impacts are logged within the same naval sonar exercise that is the 163 and 39 dives above the br noise thresholds occurred during just five sonar exercises as the convention is to count a maximum of one br per whale per naval exercise finneran et al 2017 the range of brs for a single whale is between 0 and 5 it is worth remembering however that higher values of the disruption parameter means a longer period of displacement even if in aggregate it means fewer brs 4 discussion in this study we have presented a framework for simulating marine animal movement its novelty is the following i a flexible movement simulator sampler wherein a stochastic movement model adapts to a pre defined whale density surface using a sequential monte carlo algorithm particle filter ii inclusion of dive information in the forward simulator to control the magnitude of the displacement variance term and set the step size thereby linking the horizontal and vertical movement dynamics iii inclusion of a probabilistic behavioral response to sound using a biphasic dose response curve that operates as a stochastic element within a movement model to trigger compensatory movement in response to disturbance iv incorporation of short and long lasting behavior changes in response to sound induced disturbance that controls the time scale for reversion of movement to the disturbance free case and v realistic application to the fin whale population off southern california over biologically meaningful lengths of time one year in our experiment for this latter targeted application to naval sonar exposures we demonstrated how movement histories and sound exposure at depth for each track over an entire year can be summarized thereby establishing the means to infer the impacts of cumulative disturbances on vital rates this movement modeling framework is general and flexible it allows for incorporation of any stochastic movement model e g continuous time or discrete time with any time step rule based alterations to movement were used to deal with the behavioral response to sound exposure and coastline avoidance one novelty was to introduce a sequential monte carlo sampler that allows for movement realizations to be generated that are influenced by the historical whale spatial density most existing movement simulation frameworks provide a means to sample from a pre defined known whale distribution that could be derived from a sighting data or a species distribution model e g aim frankel et al 2002 safesimm donovan et al 2012 3mb hauser 2006 naemo blackstock et al 2018 michelot et al 2019a b also treat this problem by proposing a markov chain monte carlo sampler whose target distribution is the historical whale spatial density there called a resource selection function with an emphasis on identifying movement models for which this feature holds in fact the random walk model of this study in the absence of sound and coastline effects corresponds to their local gibbs over irregular sample intervals whose long run distribution is the historical whale spatial density sequential monte carlo samplers are a flexible class of samplers based on forward kernels movement models and importance sampling and offer a viable and in some cases superior alternative to markov chain monte carlo samplers del moral et al 2006 our sequential monte carlo sampler yields a movement generator faithful to the underlying historical whale spatial density surface with the flexibility to also alter movement in response to coastlines bathymetry oceanographic fields prey distributions and underwater sound disturbance it was demonstrated that when excessive noise is present the movement of whales differs from the historical whale spatial density reflecting changes in animal behavior in response to noise disturbance and the duration of response to that disturbance it offers an alternative to the potential function approach brillinger 2010 wherein movement trajectories are altered through imposed fields of attraction or repulsion we explored application of the movement simulation framework through two case studies one idealized and the other based on southern california fin whales the idealized study illustrates the basic setup as well as how the simulator performs for a simple and intuitive situation the more realistic application to fin whales with exposure to naval sonar provides an illustration of how the framework can be used to understand the cumulative effects of underwater sound over a biologically meaningful period of time we were able to show that the consequences of a single disturbance are a function of how loud the received level at the whale s location where the whale is relative to its preferred habitat when it is disturbed and how long a whale takes before returning to a pre disturbance state over the one year time period the movement framework links multiple disturbance events to individuals in a population that are repeatedly affected leading to a potential means to assess impacts on vital rates that is by examining the cumulative consequences of multiple naval sonar exercises in an animal s home range we can look at energetic consequences of sound exposure in the fin whale case study we observed some individuals being exposed more due to their proximity to the sonar exercises if the consequence of disturbance can last up to 3 days mccarthy et al 2011 and brs happen repeatedly to the same whale then lower survival and breeding rates are likely consequences pirotta et al 2018 in this case study the locations of the naval sonar exercises did not overlap with a high density region of fin whales had the naval exercises overlapped more with high whale density regions the consequences would likely have been greater we would expect higher numbers of dives at received noise levels above the br threshold potentially eliciting more brs and causing more fin whales to be excluded from preferred habitat for longer if such responses were observed in many individuals there would be a potential for impacts on fin whale population vital rates as the simulated sonar used in our case study overlapped a low whale density area and in reality it is unlikely that one exercise would represent the spatial extent of a year s worth of sonar exercises it may be of interest to the us navy to repeat this experiment with a more realistic set of spatial and temporal locations for our individual based model we made a series of assumptions and decisions using a bottom up approach in the sense of grimm 1999 several of these necessarily simplify the underlying ecology for example simulated animals were assumed to move independently of each other in many cases animals are known to live in groups this could most readily be included in the simulations by assuming that animal locations are instead group locations and simulating a random group size if further refinement were needed the animal location could instead be considered to be the center of a group with individuals displaying an attraction to this group center e g langrock et al 2014 another reason for non independence is that many species live within home ranges within a larger population distribution in this case density surface model could be used to simulate a different home range center for each animal and an individual density surface could then be generated for each animal for example based on a bivariate normal distribution centered on its home range center this would then be used instead of the population level density surface to bias the animal movement model so that the animal would tend to remain within its home range the movement of animals almost certainly deviates from the assumptions of this movement model but we can use information about the characteristics of movement paths from real animals to derive better predictions of encounter rates with naval disturbance that is with the wealth of information from satellite tagging data we could create a more realistic movement model than a random walk and have animals cue off of environmental and oceanographic features or set movement model parameters to reflect behavioral state e g foraging vs traveling additionally uncertainty could be incorporated on model inputs for example different whales could be given different dose response functions reflecting permanent differences in responsiveness uncertainty in the density surface could be incorporated through multiple simulations each sampling from the possible range of inputs output uncertainty could then readily be quantified we stress however that considerable complexity and understanding can be made using straightforward assumptions about movements e g nabe nielsen et al 2013 2014 2018 the framework is a highly flexible and similar approaches have yielded considerable insight about spatial patterns with and without disturbance nabe nielsen et al 2018 warwick evans et al 2018 our study offers opportunities for combining theory with data and to improve our understanding of spatial dynamics and naval impacts grimm 1999 with this framework in place we are now able to examine impacts of a time series of exposures and what these imply for individuals in terms of impacts on vital rates towards this end there are several frameworks that could be applied including an individual based model that tracks food intake nabe nielsen et al 2013 and a dynamic state variable approach mchuron et al 2017 that examines how disturbance may alter vital rates over the course of a year pirotta et al 2018 our model once calibrated and validated should prove useful as part of a decision support tool in combination with existing methods to estimate behavioral effects of accumulated sound exposure for on going efforts to assess the aggregate consequences of anthropogenic sources of disturbance and develop mitigation measures for affected populations credit authorship

24506,zooplankton is an essential part of the simulation in ecological process based models and rigorous calibration of the zooplankton module lacks relevant modeling research that can predict the response of zooplankton biomass to varied environmental factors the paper therefore builds a one dimensional lake ecology model pclake which quantifies the dynamic effects on zooplankton in small water bodies distinguished by lake size and eutrophication status in warming climates based on the main geometric characteristics among a series of shallow water bodies we constructed three lake models namely a northern lake with a larger area 0 1 ha in poland lake nl a northern lake with a smaller 0 1 ha area in poland lake ns and a southern lake with the smallest area in croatia lake ss data from 2017 to 2018 including water temperature dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chl a and zooplankton were used to calibrate and verify models for three shallow water body categories and uncertainty analyses were carried out to support the credibility of our models further to discuss the potential driving forces of environmental factors on zooplankton we set up a series of scenarios in which atmospheric temperature and nutrient input were changed zooplankton are only considered as a common pool and therefore only how biomass varied can be obtained warming resulted in a decline of zooplankton in the lakes located in northern europe with peak decreases in zooplankton biomass more than four times higher in lake ns than in lake nl in addition due to multiple nutrient loading scenarios incoming nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were found to have a huge impact on zooplankton biomass in lake nl specifically relative to the original eutrophic level the average annual biomass of zooplankton increased by 90 with a 75 increase in organic nitrogen over the original eutrophic level and decreased by more than 50 with a 75 decrease in inorganic phosphorus hence lake size characteristics should be taken into account in management and restoration as they may be synergistic with in lake biological and abiotic processes under complex environmental forces graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecosystem model zooplankton module pclake lake size eutrophication climatic warming 1 introduction as a consequence of human activities eutrophication is spreading in all kinds of surface water bodies around the world leading to the disruption of aquatic ecosystems and threats to aquatic organisms and humans cloern 2001 conley et al 2009 haeder et al 2020 in particular as an intrinsic and significant component of the freshwater environment small water bodies require better monitoring systems and effective management kelly quinn and baars 2014 biggs et al 2017 use terms including ponds small lakes small streams ditches and springs to refer to small water bodies and give a detailed description of these definitions small water bodies have been demonstrated to be more sensitive to environmental changes due to their small surface area vulnerability to pollution lower environmental capacity and lower self purification capacity etc cereghino et al 2008 biggs et al 2017 consequently it is necessary to focus on the ecological functions of small water bodies under different water characteristics e g different responses of small sized water bodies of different sizes and shapes to eutrophication and aquatic organisms zooplankton are sensitive indicators that react to alterations of the water environment due to the diversity of species and the complexity of feeding processes zooplankton have close ties with phytoplankton turner and granéli 1992 some of the differences of plankton communities on the spatial scale are triggered by spatial heterogeneity and interactions between trophic levels kuczyńska kippen et al 2020 shen et al 2021 numerous studies have documented that in the case of small water bodies habitats exhibit growth limitation on certain rotifers and algae špoljar et al 2012 basinska et al 2014 kuczyńska kippen 2018 for instance in the study of janse 2005 it was found that lakes with a smaller surface area are more favorable to macrophytes than larger ones thereby promoting sediment stability and providing a stable habitat for zooplankton and phytoplankton liang et al 2020 also demonstrated that deep lakes may have a greater number of available niches which indicates that zooplankton abundance and diversity are proportional to the depth of lakes environmental factors i e temperature precipitation change hydrological processes which in turn affect water ecosystems bae et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 at present eutrophication and climate change are both considered as critical issues for shallow lakes zhang et al 2020 where pollution and land use change on a global scale have had a profound impact on freshwater ecosystems pollutant discharge and reservoir construction for example in some cases reduces species diversity and promotes the productivity of zooplankton dodson et al 2005 climate change events such as droughts warming and extreme weather result in a vulnerable water ecosystem further forcing freshwater species to respond through changes in morphology and behavior pham et al 2019 noorisameleh et al 2020 additionally zooplankton succession the ecological process by which zooplankton biomes change over time is usually manifested by the variability of the overall diversity abundance and biomass of zooplankton sommer et al 1986 numerous studies have documented that temperature is a driving factor of zooplankton e g rotifers and daphnia succession while such a promoting effect might decrease as a result of a reduced p c ratio makino et al 2011 the predicted effects listed by trolle et al 2011 likewise suggested that lakes with a higher eutrophic state tend to be subject to more frequent harmful algal blooms with warming comparable to an oligo mesotrophic state and enhanced competition with zooplankton for nutrient uptake undoubtedly elevated temperature has both direct and indirect impacts on zooplankton survival and growth these impacts closely interact with changes in the nutritional status of lakes li et al 2019 even though zooplankton are central to the interest of specialists in the field of lake restoration not much research has applied zooplankton for model assessment and prediction many biogeochemical models e g caedym lakeweb mike21 and wasp tend to ignore zooplankton modules and focus mostly on phytoplankton macrophytes zoobenthos and fish baretta et al 1994 håkanson and boulion 2003 trolle et al 2008 akomeah et al 2019 on the other hand the process of measuring zooplankton in the field is cumbersome and expensive and can be discouraging for studies using zooplankton as an indicator in modeling calibration specifically we searched isi s web of science database using the terms lake ecological models and zooplankton within a thirty year period from january 1 1990 to december 31 2020 656 published papers on lake ecological models were found to involve zooplankton species while only 18 of them used zooplankton measurements for model calibration the commonly used ecological models e g pclake and aquatox have numerous state variables including a zooplankton group which accurately describe biological processes and feedback mechanisms in water and sediment mooij et al 2009 janse et al 2010 zhang and liu 2014 as mentioned above there is little literature that addresses the use of a zooplankton module in common ecological models e g zhang and arhonditsis 2008 trolle et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 since the model parameters setting related to zooplankton were not rigorously calculated in the existing ecological models applying default values of these parameters to zooplankton dynamics in response to environmental stress factors and changing climate is likely to be unreliable to overcome this issue we applied an ecosystem model to simulate the growth pattern of plankton especially zooplankton in lakes of different sizes the objectives of this study were 1 to establish pclake models based on the field monitoring data of water quality and ecology indexes of small water bodies with different sizes 2 to test the hypothesis that continued warming would result in a decline of zooplankton and that the degree of decline would vary in relation to lake size 3 to test the hypothesis that the zooplankton biomass affected by instream nutrient concentration increases with the increase of lake size thus not only is the experience of model parameters setting related to zooplankton complemented but it is also possible to predict the future response of environmental stress to water ecology 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out on 30 small water bodies located in the mediterranean region of europe croatia the islands of rab and dugi otok fig 1 and the continental region of europe poland the wielkopolska region fig 1 all water bodies differed in respect to their origin trophic conditions morphometry and level of human impact the thirty ponds were divided into three groups on the basis of their geographical location surface area and width depth ratio fig 1 eighteen ponds in poland are dominated by glacial pools each of which has a well developed zone of macrophytes and a surface area of less than 1 hectare kozak et al 2019 kuczyńska kippen et al 2021 two groups of ponds were distinguished according to the surface area 10 larger ponds 0 1 ha in northern europe nl and 8 smaller ponds 0 1 ha in northern europe ns twelve ponds in croatia are located along the coast with high transparency and substantial coverage of submerged macrophytes this group of ponds in southern europe not only has the smallest area but also the smallest width depth ratio ss each group exhibited similar characteristics in boundary dimensions climatic features and ecological characteristics thus it is feasible to establish three idealized lake models to represent all of the aforementioned ponds correspondingly the distribution of the horizontal area and layer volumes is accounted for as a function of depth in pclake and with the polynomial fit method using the boundary data measured from 30 ponds the maximum depths surface areas and width depth ratios required for the three models were obtained fig 1 such a basis of lake division was designed to analyze the effects upon zooplankton dynamic evolution of two representative morphological indexes which refer to surface area and width depth ratio under different scenarios of future environmental changes 2 2 zooplankton sampling each pond was monitored two or three times in 2017 2018 covering the three seasons spring summer and autumn considering that all of our ponds are located in the temperate or mediterranean climate regions in europe the winter glaciation period with its wide temperature fluctuations is omitted one sampling site was selected for each pond and all of the ponds could be considered homogeneous due to their surface area of less than 1 ha and maximum depth of no more than 3 5 m all samples for zooplankton were taken in triplicate at the same time around midday using a plexiglass core sampler ø 50 mm length 1 5 m from among sampling sites the collected zooplankton samples were concentrated with a 45 μm plankton net and immediately fixed with 4 formalin for final calculations the average of each sampling date was taken specific sampling methods refer to kozak et al 2019 and kuczyńska kippen et al 2021 after zooplankton identification to species level and measurements body dimensions were converted to a specific biovolume using power equations or common geometric formulas obtained biovolumes were converted into wet weight assuming a specific density of 1 1 a dry weight wet weight conversion of 0 25 and a dry weight carbon content of 40 ward 1989 rotifers were shown to be the dominant species in both regions based on the statistical results of zooplankton species richness 84 in poland and 92 in croatia physical parameters and water quality parameters were measured during zooplankton sampling at each site for example different field probes were used to determine temperature and oxygen concentration do and water samples were taken to determine concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chl a in the laboratory 2 3 model description pclake was originally developed in the 1990s to simulate the impact of eutrophication in shallow lakes janse and van liere 1995 based on nutrient cycling in shallow lakes the model was constructed to accurately predict the changes of pollutants through quantitative analysis we selected this particular model as it is one of the few in existence that deals with zooplankton simulation in the fields of water quality and ecology and reflects the interactions between macrophytes fish phytoplankton and zooplankton in shallow lakes using abundant variables 104 state variables and 454 parameters pclake mainly aimed to simulate the structure function and spatiotemporal variability of a shallow lake ecosystem by means of inputting environmental variables it is a dynamic model which considers the main food web dynamics in shallow lakes driven by physical chemical and biological processes it contains both ecosystems lakes and wetlands and can simulate a well mixed water body and the sediment top layer the model describes the dynamics of phytoplankton macrophytes and a simplified food web including zooplankton zoobenthos zooplanktivorous fish benthivorous fish and piscivorous fish and accounts for mass balances represented by dry weight nitrogen phosphorus and silicon cycling between the various components of the ecosystem hu et al 2016 a zooplankton group in pclake is treated as a common biomass pool rather than being calculated separately for individual species the general equations eqs s1 s6 for the zooplankton groups are given in appendix s2 hu et al 2016 linked the ecological model with a hydrodynamic model and the new fabm pclake allowed the simulation of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in zero one as well as three dimensions nielsen et al 2017 provided a graphical user interface for fabm pclake a plugin named wet developed in the qgis platform on this basis pclake has also been frequently used in coupling with other models in recent years such as the water quality model efdc to evolve aquatic ecosystem models for the better zhao et al 2020 2 4 model set up the required input of pclake is information on meteorological forcing water inflow and nutrient loading to the system as well as to the physical domain there are seven pre defined meteorological time series that need to be input into pclake to simulate water quality and ecological results meteorological data were available online at http www meteomanz com including atmospheric pressure hpa wind speed m s wind direction air temperature c relative humidity precipitation mm and cloud cover some observation data from two meteorological stations croatia zadar and poland poznan were selected in this study at the same time water and nutrient organic phosphorus phosphate organic nitrogen nitrate and ammonium load were configured as a near surface inflow to ensure the water and nutrient balance of the model external loads are treated as constants by pclake throughout the entire simulation period which is possible because the three categories of ponds are standing water bodies in small basins meanwhile evaporation calculations are by default deactivated in the core aquatic ecosystem model of wet and assumed as accounted for as part of an outflowing volume which is automatically set to be equal to the inflow volume nielsen et al 2017 as for the physical domain we chose the hypsographic approach i e to specify the relationship between depth and horizontal area for n cross sections throughout the water column where sediment water column interactions occur in each layer of the model nielsen et al 2017 since the three categories of lakes involved in the study are generally shallow maximum depth is 3 2 m the effect of vertical stratification on the calculation results can be ignored that is it is assumed that all output variables are uniform in the vertical direction the depth surface area and width depth ratio of each lake model are obtained by weighted average on the basis of a polynomial fitting of the actual survey data 2 5 calibration validation and uncertainty analysis for the purpose of comparisons between lakes all models were calibrated and uncertainty was analyzed based on a seven month period april 2017 october 2017 and validated on a separate seven month period april 2018 october 2018 there are 104 state variables and 454 parameters contained in pclake which involve phytoplankton zooplankton benthic organisms non biological components such as nitrogen and phosphorus and nitrification processes in the field of water ecological models a large number of studies have shown that parameters related to biological growth metabolism and death rate are sensitive to model results such as tn tp do and chl a omlin et al 2001 arhonditsis et al 2002 li et al 2015 moreover the sensitive parameters vary with the geographical location and size of the lake and other factors such as light temperature and settlement velocity also have a great influence on the results of the simulation pastres et al 1997 pastres and ciavatta 2005 yi et al 2016 pclake model parameters were initially set to the default values based on observed water quality in more than 40 lakes janse 2005 nielsen et al 2014 but it was necessary to recalibrate our model to ensure that the model results were consistent with the actual water quality of our three categories of shallow lakes nl ns and ss for the period of 2017 2018 hence parameters especially those related to zooplankton needed to be recalibrated in this study twenty nine parameters were initially calibrated to better fit the observed data for each biological and non biological indicator especially for zooplankton table 1 here statistical metrics such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percent bias pbias rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and coefficient of determination r2 were used to assess model performance moriasi et al 2007 for the selection of parameters zooplankton was taken as the main comparison indicator in this study thus all 18 parameters of the zooplankton domain were calibrated the other 11 parameters nine belonging to the phytoplankton and water domain and two belonging to the abiotic sediment domain were selected based on the calibration experience of pclake in similar studies rolighed et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 coppens et al 2020 the data were also divided into three groups the division being based on the different boundary conditions of the three lake models the models were performed for the 30 shallow water bodies for two years 2017 2018 and the model results were then compared with the average of observed data including water temperature tn tp do chl a and zooplankton of lakes nl ns and ss to evaluate the model performance factors such as model structure input data parameters and calculation error are all sources of model uncertainty thus we performed an uncertainty analysis by calculating the dispersion of the output water quality values when each parameter takes different values based on our experience of calibration and verification we further selected 14 parameters that are more sensitive to calculated zooplankton values and adjusted a fixed range defined as a 25 deviation from their default or initially calibrated values column 3 of table 1 this wider range allowed for successful model simulations ensuring that no model simulation crashed due to parameters being out of range to visualize the simulated uncertainty caused by parameter variability we set up 28 conditions runs and plotted the statistics as uncertainty bands around the initially calibrated model simulation line 2 6 future climate change and nutrient loading scenarios the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report forecasted future climate change under four emission scenarios named rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 representative concentration pathways in the late twenty first century 2081 2100 over the period 1986 2005 jefferson 2015 in this study the original input temperature was increased by 1 0 c 1 8 c 2 3 c and 3 7 c respectively to correspond to the above four scenarios to model changes in lake nutrient and biological composition dynamics with climate warming we ran a suite of climate warming scenarios ranging from 0 c to 3 7 c above air temperatures in 2017 for each lake fig 2 finally the revised climate files were entered into the pclake model for recalculation to analyze the impact of climate change on the water quality and water ecology of the three categories of lakes nitrogen and phosphorus are the most important biogenic elements of water primary productivity and the food chain as well as the key limiting factors of lake eutrophication the inflow concentration and forms of which vary from lake to lake in order to quantify the implications of future eutrophication changes for restoration and zooplankton response in lakes differing in size a series of nutrient loading scenarios were also set up fig 2 considering the presence of extremes we assumed that external loading decreased to represent lake restoration scenarios or increased to represent possible effects of land use intensification or increased run off and the associated increased nutrient loading by 30 and 75 the seemingly exaggerated span of 75 in nutrient loading was chosen based on the reality changes that many eutrophic lakes have undergone in developed countries e g sand jensen 2008 3 results 3 1 model performance the performance of the three models to predict water quality and ecological indicators was evaluated using various statistical metrics fig 3 firstly calibration allows a comparison between the observed data one set of data in april one in october and the other five during the half month interval from june to july in 2017 and the time series files generated by pclake next all of the models were validated with the mean values of four groups of observed data from spring to autumn in 2018 in terms of the nse the highest predictive power was shown in lake nl all the values except verified chl a nse 0 51 belong to the range of 0 75 nse 1 00 very good lake ss has less predictive power than lake nl with most of the modeled water quality indicators that produce reliable results but a merely satisfactory value of tn and tp 0 45 nse 0 60 for lake ns modeled values were slightly unsatisfactory especially for tn tp and do but even the lowest values nse 0 43 indicated that the observed mean is a reliable standard as a standardized form of root mean square error rmse rsr showed that the performance rating of calibration and validation values of each index in each model is consistent with that of nse in short the model simulation performance of temperature and zooplankton were very good rsr 0 50 do and chl a were also good rsr 0 65 the nutrients were merely satisfactory rsr 0 75 as for pbias positive negative values indicate a model underestimation overestimation bias overall simulation values of our indicators indicated very good pbias 10 for temperature and pbias 25 for the other water quality indicators the verified chl a in lake nl with the highest magnitude value pbias 44 indicated a satisfactory model simulation the coefficient of determination between observed data and model simulation showed that all three models have strong predictive capabilities on the whole r2 0 6 it indicated that the model has no high outliers that is there is no great difference between the mean and variance of the observed and modeled values to sum up the calibration and verification were confirmed acceptable because our modeled results for three categories of lakes generally showed good agreement with observed data for temperature do total nutrients and zooplankton figs 3 6 further the model results were confirmed as acceptable by comparing the uncertainty bands with the average of observed data for temperature do total nutrients and zooplankton figs 4 6 according to fig 4k zooplankton in lake nl decreased by 22 5 compared with the mean value of the uncertainty zone under the condition of sensitive parameters column 3 of table 1 varying within a 25 range indicating that zooplankton was underestimated similarly chl a tn and tp were overestimated by 28 4 13 4 and 6 3 fig 4c e i however a good fit between modeled and observed values improves the reliability of the model results the modeled results of lake ns have a narrower confidence interval from which it can be inferred that the uncertainty of the forecast results is low fig 5 as for lake ss fig 6 the results of the model closely matched the observed levels although they were all underestimated within the confidence interval of 25 with a deviation no more than 11 1 furthermore the following five parameters were identified as more sensitive to those water quality and water ecology indexes from the above 14 parameters according to the uncertainty analysis overall parameters related to zooplankton were identified as the most sensitive followed by those related to algae figs 4 6 for tn tp do and chl a three parameters proved sensitive to these variables that is cprefpom selection factor for particulate organic matter hfilt half saturation constant for food conc on zooplankton and cmumaxblue maximum growth rate blue greens in addition kdrespzoo maintenance respiration constant for zooplankton and fdasszoo dry weight assimilation efficiency of zooplankton also proved to be sensitive to water ecological variables especially to zooplankton 3 2 effects of future climate change on zooplankton and phytoplankton among three categories of lakes the three representative sets of modeled results that predict the dynamics of water ecological condition under warming in the three categories of lakes are shown in fig 7 biomass and growth rate of zooplankton and phytoplankton in water bodies with a large width depth ratio show more sensitivity to warming than those with a small width depth ratio in lake nl and ns fig 7d e an increase of temperature led to an increase in the maximum peak value of phytoplankton baseline to rcp 8 5 scenarios from 21 52 mg l 1 to 43 56 mg l 1 in lake nl and from 2 32 mg l 1 to 131 mg l 1 in lake ns even exceeding an increase amplitude of 100 however in lake ss fig 7f which has a much smaller width depth ratio than the previous two the variation range of the phytoplankton peak was only less than 20 baseline to rcp 8 5 scenarios from 4 84 mg l 1 to 3 92 mg l 1 moreover under the rcp 8 5 scenario the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton in lake nl and ns increased to more than twice that of the original scenario while in lake ss it decreased by 19 similarly the maximum daily reduction in zooplankton biomass between the baseline and rcp 2 6 scenarios was 22 and 93 for lake nl and ns fig 7a b while the variation did not exceed 3 between the baseline and rcp 8 5 scenarios in lake ss fig 7c the final results also showed that for lakes nl and ns fig 7g h j k m n the maximum daily changes of water quality indicators were evident under different warming conditions from baseline to rcp 8 5 scenarios tn an increase of more than 2 96 mg l 1 tp an increase of more than 0 51 mg l 1 chl a an increase of more than 260 35 mg l 1 in contrast only negligible changes occurred in lake ss fig 7i l o tn an increase of 0 84 mg l 1 tp an increase of 0 18 mg l 1 chl a an increase of 47 47 mg l 1 seasonal dynamics under several warming scenarios also show that in general community structures of zooplankton and phytoplankton were more stable in lakes with larger surface areas fig 7 the results show that in lakes ns and ss the biomass of zooplankton has multi peaks the timing of the of their peak occurrence was found to change with warming such change in seasonal concentrations was also observed on tn tp chl a and phytoplankton on the one hand the spring bloom started a week or two earlier than the baseline under the rcp 8 5 scenario while on the other hand the proportion of various compositions of algal assemblage varied with warming specifically diatoms and green algae comprised a similar percentage of the phytoplankton assemblage under the original and rcp 2 6 scenario and when a higher temperature scenario was set the green algae came to dominate the lake ns accounting for no less than 88 a similar phenomenon occurred in lake ss the proportion of diatoms decreased from 77 to 38 with warming and that of cyanobacteria increased from 8 to 54 in lake nl which exhibited an order of magnitude difference in surface area evaporation and slow running water make it easier for exogenous nutrients to accumulate excessive nitrogen and phosphorus conditioned the spring peak and the explosive growth of cyanobacteria conditioned the autumn peak as a result zooplankton biomass shows a single peak distribution with the peak occurring in summer in addition zooplankton blooms and declines occurred almost simultaneously in different scenarios and the relative abundance of various species of phytoplankton varied by less than 3 that is to say the surface area of lakes may affect the seasonal and inter annual dynamics of the community states to some extent 3 3 effects of external nutrient loads on zooplankton and phytoplankton among three categories of lakes for mean zooplankton and phytoplankton concentrations under different nutrient loading scenarios significant differences were found in lakes with varying surface areas fig 8 firstly under the baseline scenario with a decrease of lake surface area nl 7895 88 m2 ns 369 82 m2 ss 249 91 m2 modeled zooplankton biomass decreased fig 8a b c nl 1 0 mg l 1 ns 0 6 mg l 1 ss 0 3 mg l 1 the variation of phytoplankton biomass also showed a similar trend fig 8d e f nl 7 7 mg l 1 ns 1 1 mg l 1 ss 0 3 mg l 1 physical phenomena such as illumination intensity and radiating area may directly affect the growth of phytoplankton simultaneously accumulation of nutrients indirectly led to a change of zooplankton biomass as shown by the higher concentration of tn fig 8g h i nl 2 4 mg l 1 ns ss 1 5 mg l 1 and tp fig 8j k l nl 1 05 mg l 1 ns ss 0 84 mg l 1 in lake nl compared to the other two lakes the results indicated that the biomass of zooplankton and phytoplankton responded more intensely in lake nl to changes of nutrient loading in type 1 3 fig 8a d an increase of input organic nitrogen hereafter input on similarly for input in input op and input ip led to a decrease of 73 in phytoplankton baseline to 75 scenarios from 7 68 mg l 1 to 2 11 mg l 1 and an increase of 91 in zooplankton baseline to 75 scenarios from 1 00 mg l 1 to 1 92 mg l 1 the input of excess organic nitrogen promoted the growth and reproduction of zooplankton both phytoplankton and zooplankton decreased by more than 50 when the input ip in type 3 4 was reduced by 75 compared to type 1 2 fig 8a d for typical phosphorus restricted conditions in lake nl the simulation showed no obvious effect under the varying input of op concentration while limiting the release of inorganic phosphorus helped inhibit cyanobacteria growth and decreased nutrient levels it also reduced the amount of zooplankton however lakes ns and ss showed no significant differences from the baseline for all kinds of projected nutrient loading fig 8b c e f the details of percentage changes relative to the baseline of each nutrient scenario are shown in appendix s3 based on the results of the annual dynamics of tn tp phytoplankton zooplankton concentration compared with lake ss and the other two lake models the width depth ratio was considered to have little effect on zooplankton and phytoplankton for the average annual zooplankton concentration fig 8a b c when the input of on varied from 30 to 30 the amplitude of variation in lakes nl ns was about 5 times that of lake ss nl from 1 01 mg l 1 to 1 47 mg l 1 ns from 0 55 mg l 1 to 0 97 mg l 1 ss from 0 20 mg l 1 to 0 30 mg l 1 other indicators such as phytoplankton fig 8d f tn fig 8g i and tp fig 8j l showed no significant regularity among the three categories of lakes under various loading types and scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 effect of lake size on modeled zooplankton dynamics and ecosystem state changes the primary objective of this study was to predict the influence of water body size heterogeneity on zooplankton dynamics under increasing air temperature and variable nutrient concentrations the physical configuration of the hypothetical lake in pclake was designed with a morphology shaped like a truncated cone thus two indices surface area and width depth ratio were selected in this study to quantify the size effect the results show that the influence of water surface area was reflected in the large fluctuation range of the annual average zooplankton concentration with the change of nutrient loading fig 8 and on the other hand the seasonal variation of zooplankton biomass tended to be unimodal fig 7 the response of zooplankton to the width depth ratio is mainly reflected in the warming simulation that is the deeper water environment in small water bodies is more tolerant to climate warming fig 7 the trophic state of water is fundamental for the diversity abundance and even morphological variation of zooplankton especially in larger lakes barnett and beisner 2007 haberman and haldna 2014 karpowicz et al 2020 it is generally believed that lakes with a larger surface area here larger refers to lake nl with a surface area more than 0 1 ha hereafter tend to form a higher habitat complexity duggan 2001 wojtal et al 2003 in which case the biomass of zooplankton is greater fig 8a further a larger surface area prolongs the water exchange and renewal cycle gourgue et al 2007 making it easier for nutrients to accumulate fig 8g j as shown in types 1 3 of fig 8 zooplankton biomass increased significantly in larger lakes under the scenarios of excessive organic nitrogen this is likely due to the mutual transformation of organic and inorganic forms of nitrogen to promote biological absorption volkmann et al 2016 then the n p ratio was reduced to such a degree that cyanobacteria are no longer growing under optimal conditions type 1 3 fig 8d g j and zooplankton tend to enhance the top down control of the algal community on this occasion similarly due to the low homeostasis i e easily switching between a macrophyte dominated clear state and a phytoplankton dominated turbid state larger lakes appear to be more vulnerable to external disturbance and have a more rapid self recovery ability obolewski and glinska lewczuk 2020 this explains type 3 4 in fig 8 a d showing that when phosphate input decreased phytoplankton growth was mitigated in phosphorus restricted lakes which further affected zooplankton through the predator prey relationship facilitating lake restoration jeppesen et al 2005 spears et al 2007 alcaraz et al 2007 this is a key driving mechanism for controlling eutrophication and restoring the lake ecosystem the model predicts that the peak pattern of zooplankton dynamics in larger lakes is unimodal fig 7a which is correlated with the dominance of cyanobacteria species fig 7d habitats rich in cyanobacteria are not suitable for zooplankton owing to a difficulty in digestion and the competition for nutrients rohrlack et al 1999 wallace and snell 2010 gerba and pepper 2019 in larger lakes cyanobacteria tend to proliferate rapidly under favorable conditions of high temperatures and adequate illumination in summer sukenik et al 2009 due to the dominant role of cyanobacteria the growth rate of zooplankton was reduced and no more peaks of zooplankton biomass appeared after summer the dominating effect of the width depth ratio on zooplankton is closely related to warming whether the biomass of zooplankton increased or decreased with the warming shown in seasonal differences in shallow lakes with small width depth ratio fig 7c indicates that different mechanisms of warming may play a dominant role in different scenarios higher temperature may not only result in a decrease of zooplankton biomass under numerous indirect effects including enhanced stratification and reduced nutrient input from deeper waters into the upper mixed layer carey et al 2012 kirillin and shatwell 2016 but it also directly promotes the metabolism growth reproduction and survival of zooplankton ibelings et al 2011 seasonal fluctuation patterns in zooplankton biomass however seem to be relatively simple in lakes with a larger width depth ratio fig 7a b enhanced microbial activity in the sediment water interface significantly increased the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus making the aquatic ecosystem more suitable for algae and thus algophagous rotifers and daphnia petro et al 2017 this is the most likely explanation for the wider range of variation of zooplankton concentrations with warming in lakes with a larger width depth ratio this is especially true in the case of lake ns the shallowest lake with a depth of only one meter whose predictions show that the temperature rise has a threshold fig 7b e h k n when this threshold rcp 4 5 scenario is exceeded the model calculation will be terminated prematurely in summer that is the lake ecosystem collapses the response of shallow lakes to eutrophication tends to be catastrophic rather than smooth scheffer 2001 future summer heat might easily affect the self regulation ability of the ecosystem rendering it insufficient to maintain the continuous operation of the lake 4 2 model constraints based on the calibration and verification of three categories of lakes the seasonal dynamics of observed tn tp chl a and each functional group of phytoplankton could be well reproduced however pclake is a simplified ecological model that only describes simple food web dynamics in shallow lakes thus the dynamics of zooplankton community succession cannot be fully obtained rolighed et al 2016 in pclake all of the zooplankton species are generalized into a part of the simple food web group appendix s2 in fact however the feeding process of zooplankton species is complex for example large bodied daphnia species exert greater grazing pressure on phytoplankton in comparison with bosmina and ceriodaphnia in the north island lakes new zealand balvert et al 2009 large cladocerans have a circadian feeding rhythm the feeding peak occurring at night bielecka and boehnke 2014 the feeding rate of ciliates e g strombidium sulcatum is higher in summer than in winter affected by temperature dolan 2018 currently mechanistic models are unable to reveal complex trophic interactions clearly for example models have been initially calibrated according to nutrients transparency chl a and vegetation data from more than 40 lakes janse 2005 janse et al 2008 mooij et al 2009 calibrations based upon parameters which are related to the zooplankton module are supplemented here moreover given the diminutive nature of our lake models there might be some fish species and submerged macrophytes that are rare or nonexistent in this ecosystem while relative parameters were set as default values the function of the food web may exert an influence to some extent during the calculation in summary given the intra system complexity pclake may be subject to non uniqueness rolighed et al 2016 4 3 validity of future scenarios the deterioration of water quality induced by climate and nutrient changes appears to be highly related to trophic status trolle et al 2011 collins et al 2019 thus for input nutrient levels a series of control groups were set up to eliminate distractions that may interfere with the outcome three kinds of initial eutrophication conditions were set for each of the three categories of lakes under future warming scenarios respectively on this basis a total of 45 warming simulations were carried out consequently nine groups of predictions were drawn responses of tn tp chl a phytoplankton and zooplankton concentration as shown in appendix s4 it is clear from the predictions that when given different initial eutrophication conditions in one lake overall trends of annual concentrations of zooplankton phytoplankton and other water quality indicators did not change significantly the dry weight of phytoplankton in lake nl for instance showed only slight differences in the magnitude and location of peak due to variations in original nutrient status thus it was indicated that climate is a crucial factor for water ecology rather than nutrient availability moreover only one initial eutrophication scenario for each of our lakes is sufficient to illustrate the size effect of future climate changes on zooplankton in section 3 2 fig 7 similarly the same initial eutrophication levels were set for the response of zooplankton predictions in lakes of different size under nutrient loading scenarios to eliminate possible interference there is no doubt that there are many prospects ahead in addressing the problems of water ecology posed by climate change and nutrient status our modeling study predicted how climate warming would change the structure of small standing water ecosystems however warming is only a key but not the sole component of climate change different manifestations of climate changes such as greenhouse gas emissions stronger rainfall etc are expected to have an impact on zooplankton the same is true for the simulation of water nutrient state based on the current nutrient loading scenarios different input conditions of initial nutritional status can be given to achieve future predictions for instance changing the n p ratio or setting up an original simulation of lower mesotrophic ecosystems furthermore external loads climate forces and internal nutrient cycles collectively control ecosystem function and some may even appear synergistic enhancing symptoms of eutrophication wetzel 2001 watson et al 2016 rolighed et al 2016 hence more importantly future work should focus on the synergistic effect of various external pressures so that we can illustrate the probability of achieving a certain ecological state 5 conclusion we examined the performance of pclake a dynamics aquatic ecosystem model in terms of its ability to reproduce zooplankton biomass in typical small water bodies in poland and croatia the models established for the three lake groups were subsequently used to project the effects of climate warming and nutrient loading on zooplankton biomass and growth rate and thus the potential future implications for shallow lakes that differ in size we found that climate warming does lead to a decrease in zooplankton biomass especially in the two groups of water bodies located in the continental region of europe under the rcp 2 6 scenario the maximum daily reduction in zooplankton biomass is 93 in lake ns and 22 in lake nl compared to the original scenario it indicated that the zooplankton biomass in small lakes will decrease more than in large lakes with warming moreover the results of external nutrient loading scenarios suggested that the amount of variation in zooplankton biomass in lakes with surface areas 0 1 ha was more affected by changes in instream nutrient concentrations compared with that of 0 1 ha in particular the amount of zooplankton biomass changes is likely to be even greater than 50 when the input of organic nitrogen increases or inorganic phosphorus decreases these changes are caused by the decrease of n p ratio in small water bodies thus proper consideration could be given to the control of the n p ratio in lake management and restoration in addition we further combined the warming simulations with different initial eutrophication conditions overall in a typical small water body relatively speaking temperature has a far more significant impact on zooplankton biomass than eutrophication declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

24506,zooplankton is an essential part of the simulation in ecological process based models and rigorous calibration of the zooplankton module lacks relevant modeling research that can predict the response of zooplankton biomass to varied environmental factors the paper therefore builds a one dimensional lake ecology model pclake which quantifies the dynamic effects on zooplankton in small water bodies distinguished by lake size and eutrophication status in warming climates based on the main geometric characteristics among a series of shallow water bodies we constructed three lake models namely a northern lake with a larger area 0 1 ha in poland lake nl a northern lake with a smaller 0 1 ha area in poland lake ns and a southern lake with the smallest area in croatia lake ss data from 2017 to 2018 including water temperature dissolved oxygen do total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chl a and zooplankton were used to calibrate and verify models for three shallow water body categories and uncertainty analyses were carried out to support the credibility of our models further to discuss the potential driving forces of environmental factors on zooplankton we set up a series of scenarios in which atmospheric temperature and nutrient input were changed zooplankton are only considered as a common pool and therefore only how biomass varied can be obtained warming resulted in a decline of zooplankton in the lakes located in northern europe with peak decreases in zooplankton biomass more than four times higher in lake ns than in lake nl in addition due to multiple nutrient loading scenarios incoming nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were found to have a huge impact on zooplankton biomass in lake nl specifically relative to the original eutrophic level the average annual biomass of zooplankton increased by 90 with a 75 increase in organic nitrogen over the original eutrophic level and decreased by more than 50 with a 75 decrease in inorganic phosphorus hence lake size characteristics should be taken into account in management and restoration as they may be synergistic with in lake biological and abiotic processes under complex environmental forces graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecosystem model zooplankton module pclake lake size eutrophication climatic warming 1 introduction as a consequence of human activities eutrophication is spreading in all kinds of surface water bodies around the world leading to the disruption of aquatic ecosystems and threats to aquatic organisms and humans cloern 2001 conley et al 2009 haeder et al 2020 in particular as an intrinsic and significant component of the freshwater environment small water bodies require better monitoring systems and effective management kelly quinn and baars 2014 biggs et al 2017 use terms including ponds small lakes small streams ditches and springs to refer to small water bodies and give a detailed description of these definitions small water bodies have been demonstrated to be more sensitive to environmental changes due to their small surface area vulnerability to pollution lower environmental capacity and lower self purification capacity etc cereghino et al 2008 biggs et al 2017 consequently it is necessary to focus on the ecological functions of small water bodies under different water characteristics e g different responses of small sized water bodies of different sizes and shapes to eutrophication and aquatic organisms zooplankton are sensitive indicators that react to alterations of the water environment due to the diversity of species and the complexity of feeding processes zooplankton have close ties with phytoplankton turner and granéli 1992 some of the differences of plankton communities on the spatial scale are triggered by spatial heterogeneity and interactions between trophic levels kuczyńska kippen et al 2020 shen et al 2021 numerous studies have documented that in the case of small water bodies habitats exhibit growth limitation on certain rotifers and algae špoljar et al 2012 basinska et al 2014 kuczyńska kippen 2018 for instance in the study of janse 2005 it was found that lakes with a smaller surface area are more favorable to macrophytes than larger ones thereby promoting sediment stability and providing a stable habitat for zooplankton and phytoplankton liang et al 2020 also demonstrated that deep lakes may have a greater number of available niches which indicates that zooplankton abundance and diversity are proportional to the depth of lakes environmental factors i e temperature precipitation change hydrological processes which in turn affect water ecosystems bae et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 at present eutrophication and climate change are both considered as critical issues for shallow lakes zhang et al 2020 where pollution and land use change on a global scale have had a profound impact on freshwater ecosystems pollutant discharge and reservoir construction for example in some cases reduces species diversity and promotes the productivity of zooplankton dodson et al 2005 climate change events such as droughts warming and extreme weather result in a vulnerable water ecosystem further forcing freshwater species to respond through changes in morphology and behavior pham et al 2019 noorisameleh et al 2020 additionally zooplankton succession the ecological process by which zooplankton biomes change over time is usually manifested by the variability of the overall diversity abundance and biomass of zooplankton sommer et al 1986 numerous studies have documented that temperature is a driving factor of zooplankton e g rotifers and daphnia succession while such a promoting effect might decrease as a result of a reduced p c ratio makino et al 2011 the predicted effects listed by trolle et al 2011 likewise suggested that lakes with a higher eutrophic state tend to be subject to more frequent harmful algal blooms with warming comparable to an oligo mesotrophic state and enhanced competition with zooplankton for nutrient uptake undoubtedly elevated temperature has both direct and indirect impacts on zooplankton survival and growth these impacts closely interact with changes in the nutritional status of lakes li et al 2019 even though zooplankton are central to the interest of specialists in the field of lake restoration not much research has applied zooplankton for model assessment and prediction many biogeochemical models e g caedym lakeweb mike21 and wasp tend to ignore zooplankton modules and focus mostly on phytoplankton macrophytes zoobenthos and fish baretta et al 1994 håkanson and boulion 2003 trolle et al 2008 akomeah et al 2019 on the other hand the process of measuring zooplankton in the field is cumbersome and expensive and can be discouraging for studies using zooplankton as an indicator in modeling calibration specifically we searched isi s web of science database using the terms lake ecological models and zooplankton within a thirty year period from january 1 1990 to december 31 2020 656 published papers on lake ecological models were found to involve zooplankton species while only 18 of them used zooplankton measurements for model calibration the commonly used ecological models e g pclake and aquatox have numerous state variables including a zooplankton group which accurately describe biological processes and feedback mechanisms in water and sediment mooij et al 2009 janse et al 2010 zhang and liu 2014 as mentioned above there is little literature that addresses the use of a zooplankton module in common ecological models e g zhang and arhonditsis 2008 trolle et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 since the model parameters setting related to zooplankton were not rigorously calculated in the existing ecological models applying default values of these parameters to zooplankton dynamics in response to environmental stress factors and changing climate is likely to be unreliable to overcome this issue we applied an ecosystem model to simulate the growth pattern of plankton especially zooplankton in lakes of different sizes the objectives of this study were 1 to establish pclake models based on the field monitoring data of water quality and ecology indexes of small water bodies with different sizes 2 to test the hypothesis that continued warming would result in a decline of zooplankton and that the degree of decline would vary in relation to lake size 3 to test the hypothesis that the zooplankton biomass affected by instream nutrient concentration increases with the increase of lake size thus not only is the experience of model parameters setting related to zooplankton complemented but it is also possible to predict the future response of environmental stress to water ecology 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out on 30 small water bodies located in the mediterranean region of europe croatia the islands of rab and dugi otok fig 1 and the continental region of europe poland the wielkopolska region fig 1 all water bodies differed in respect to their origin trophic conditions morphometry and level of human impact the thirty ponds were divided into three groups on the basis of their geographical location surface area and width depth ratio fig 1 eighteen ponds in poland are dominated by glacial pools each of which has a well developed zone of macrophytes and a surface area of less than 1 hectare kozak et al 2019 kuczyńska kippen et al 2021 two groups of ponds were distinguished according to the surface area 10 larger ponds 0 1 ha in northern europe nl and 8 smaller ponds 0 1 ha in northern europe ns twelve ponds in croatia are located along the coast with high transparency and substantial coverage of submerged macrophytes this group of ponds in southern europe not only has the smallest area but also the smallest width depth ratio ss each group exhibited similar characteristics in boundary dimensions climatic features and ecological characteristics thus it is feasible to establish three idealized lake models to represent all of the aforementioned ponds correspondingly the distribution of the horizontal area and layer volumes is accounted for as a function of depth in pclake and with the polynomial fit method using the boundary data measured from 30 ponds the maximum depths surface areas and width depth ratios required for the three models were obtained fig 1 such a basis of lake division was designed to analyze the effects upon zooplankton dynamic evolution of two representative morphological indexes which refer to surface area and width depth ratio under different scenarios of future environmental changes 2 2 zooplankton sampling each pond was monitored two or three times in 2017 2018 covering the three seasons spring summer and autumn considering that all of our ponds are located in the temperate or mediterranean climate regions in europe the winter glaciation period with its wide temperature fluctuations is omitted one sampling site was selected for each pond and all of the ponds could be considered homogeneous due to their surface area of less than 1 ha and maximum depth of no more than 3 5 m all samples for zooplankton were taken in triplicate at the same time around midday using a plexiglass core sampler ø 50 mm length 1 5 m from among sampling sites the collected zooplankton samples were concentrated with a 45 μm plankton net and immediately fixed with 4 formalin for final calculations the average of each sampling date was taken specific sampling methods refer to kozak et al 2019 and kuczyńska kippen et al 2021 after zooplankton identification to species level and measurements body dimensions were converted to a specific biovolume using power equations or common geometric formulas obtained biovolumes were converted into wet weight assuming a specific density of 1 1 a dry weight wet weight conversion of 0 25 and a dry weight carbon content of 40 ward 1989 rotifers were shown to be the dominant species in both regions based on the statistical results of zooplankton species richness 84 in poland and 92 in croatia physical parameters and water quality parameters were measured during zooplankton sampling at each site for example different field probes were used to determine temperature and oxygen concentration do and water samples were taken to determine concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chl a in the laboratory 2 3 model description pclake was originally developed in the 1990s to simulate the impact of eutrophication in shallow lakes janse and van liere 1995 based on nutrient cycling in shallow lakes the model was constructed to accurately predict the changes of pollutants through quantitative analysis we selected this particular model as it is one of the few in existence that deals with zooplankton simulation in the fields of water quality and ecology and reflects the interactions between macrophytes fish phytoplankton and zooplankton in shallow lakes using abundant variables 104 state variables and 454 parameters pclake mainly aimed to simulate the structure function and spatiotemporal variability of a shallow lake ecosystem by means of inputting environmental variables it is a dynamic model which considers the main food web dynamics in shallow lakes driven by physical chemical and biological processes it contains both ecosystems lakes and wetlands and can simulate a well mixed water body and the sediment top layer the model describes the dynamics of phytoplankton macrophytes and a simplified food web including zooplankton zoobenthos zooplanktivorous fish benthivorous fish and piscivorous fish and accounts for mass balances represented by dry weight nitrogen phosphorus and silicon cycling between the various components of the ecosystem hu et al 2016 a zooplankton group in pclake is treated as a common biomass pool rather than being calculated separately for individual species the general equations eqs s1 s6 for the zooplankton groups are given in appendix s2 hu et al 2016 linked the ecological model with a hydrodynamic model and the new fabm pclake allowed the simulation of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in zero one as well as three dimensions nielsen et al 2017 provided a graphical user interface for fabm pclake a plugin named wet developed in the qgis platform on this basis pclake has also been frequently used in coupling with other models in recent years such as the water quality model efdc to evolve aquatic ecosystem models for the better zhao et al 2020 2 4 model set up the required input of pclake is information on meteorological forcing water inflow and nutrient loading to the system as well as to the physical domain there are seven pre defined meteorological time series that need to be input into pclake to simulate water quality and ecological results meteorological data were available online at http www meteomanz com including atmospheric pressure hpa wind speed m s wind direction air temperature c relative humidity precipitation mm and cloud cover some observation data from two meteorological stations croatia zadar and poland poznan were selected in this study at the same time water and nutrient organic phosphorus phosphate organic nitrogen nitrate and ammonium load were configured as a near surface inflow to ensure the water and nutrient balance of the model external loads are treated as constants by pclake throughout the entire simulation period which is possible because the three categories of ponds are standing water bodies in small basins meanwhile evaporation calculations are by default deactivated in the core aquatic ecosystem model of wet and assumed as accounted for as part of an outflowing volume which is automatically set to be equal to the inflow volume nielsen et al 2017 as for the physical domain we chose the hypsographic approach i e to specify the relationship between depth and horizontal area for n cross sections throughout the water column where sediment water column interactions occur in each layer of the model nielsen et al 2017 since the three categories of lakes involved in the study are generally shallow maximum depth is 3 2 m the effect of vertical stratification on the calculation results can be ignored that is it is assumed that all output variables are uniform in the vertical direction the depth surface area and width depth ratio of each lake model are obtained by weighted average on the basis of a polynomial fitting of the actual survey data 2 5 calibration validation and uncertainty analysis for the purpose of comparisons between lakes all models were calibrated and uncertainty was analyzed based on a seven month period april 2017 october 2017 and validated on a separate seven month period april 2018 october 2018 there are 104 state variables and 454 parameters contained in pclake which involve phytoplankton zooplankton benthic organisms non biological components such as nitrogen and phosphorus and nitrification processes in the field of water ecological models a large number of studies have shown that parameters related to biological growth metabolism and death rate are sensitive to model results such as tn tp do and chl a omlin et al 2001 arhonditsis et al 2002 li et al 2015 moreover the sensitive parameters vary with the geographical location and size of the lake and other factors such as light temperature and settlement velocity also have a great influence on the results of the simulation pastres et al 1997 pastres and ciavatta 2005 yi et al 2016 pclake model parameters were initially set to the default values based on observed water quality in more than 40 lakes janse 2005 nielsen et al 2014 but it was necessary to recalibrate our model to ensure that the model results were consistent with the actual water quality of our three categories of shallow lakes nl ns and ss for the period of 2017 2018 hence parameters especially those related to zooplankton needed to be recalibrated in this study twenty nine parameters were initially calibrated to better fit the observed data for each biological and non biological indicator especially for zooplankton table 1 here statistical metrics such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percent bias pbias rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and coefficient of determination r2 were used to assess model performance moriasi et al 2007 for the selection of parameters zooplankton was taken as the main comparison indicator in this study thus all 18 parameters of the zooplankton domain were calibrated the other 11 parameters nine belonging to the phytoplankton and water domain and two belonging to the abiotic sediment domain were selected based on the calibration experience of pclake in similar studies rolighed et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 coppens et al 2020 the data were also divided into three groups the division being based on the different boundary conditions of the three lake models the models were performed for the 30 shallow water bodies for two years 2017 2018 and the model results were then compared with the average of observed data including water temperature tn tp do chl a and zooplankton of lakes nl ns and ss to evaluate the model performance factors such as model structure input data parameters and calculation error are all sources of model uncertainty thus we performed an uncertainty analysis by calculating the dispersion of the output water quality values when each parameter takes different values based on our experience of calibration and verification we further selected 14 parameters that are more sensitive to calculated zooplankton values and adjusted a fixed range defined as a 25 deviation from their default or initially calibrated values column 3 of table 1 this wider range allowed for successful model simulations ensuring that no model simulation crashed due to parameters being out of range to visualize the simulated uncertainty caused by parameter variability we set up 28 conditions runs and plotted the statistics as uncertainty bands around the initially calibrated model simulation line 2 6 future climate change and nutrient loading scenarios the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report forecasted future climate change under four emission scenarios named rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 representative concentration pathways in the late twenty first century 2081 2100 over the period 1986 2005 jefferson 2015 in this study the original input temperature was increased by 1 0 c 1 8 c 2 3 c and 3 7 c respectively to correspond to the above four scenarios to model changes in lake nutrient and biological composition dynamics with climate warming we ran a suite of climate warming scenarios ranging from 0 c to 3 7 c above air temperatures in 2017 for each lake fig 2 finally the revised climate files were entered into the pclake model for recalculation to analyze the impact of climate change on the water quality and water ecology of the three categories of lakes nitrogen and phosphorus are the most important biogenic elements of water primary productivity and the food chain as well as the key limiting factors of lake eutrophication the inflow concentration and forms of which vary from lake to lake in order to quantify the implications of future eutrophication changes for restoration and zooplankton response in lakes differing in size a series of nutrient loading scenarios were also set up fig 2 considering the presence of extremes we assumed that external loading decreased to represent lake restoration scenarios or increased to represent possible effects of land use intensification or increased run off and the associated increased nutrient loading by 30 and 75 the seemingly exaggerated span of 75 in nutrient loading was chosen based on the reality changes that many eutrophic lakes have undergone in developed countries e g sand jensen 2008 3 results 3 1 model performance the performance of the three models to predict water quality and ecological indicators was evaluated using various statistical metrics fig 3 firstly calibration allows a comparison between the observed data one set of data in april one in october and the other five during the half month interval from june to july in 2017 and the time series files generated by pclake next all of the models were validated with the mean values of four groups of observed data from spring to autumn in 2018 in terms of the nse the highest predictive power was shown in lake nl all the values except verified chl a nse 0 51 belong to the range of 0 75 nse 1 00 very good lake ss has less predictive power than lake nl with most of the modeled water quality indicators that produce reliable results but a merely satisfactory value of tn and tp 0 45 nse 0 60 for lake ns modeled values were slightly unsatisfactory especially for tn tp and do but even the lowest values nse 0 43 indicated that the observed mean is a reliable standard as a standardized form of root mean square error rmse rsr showed that the performance rating of calibration and validation values of each index in each model is consistent with that of nse in short the model simulation performance of temperature and zooplankton were very good rsr 0 50 do and chl a were also good rsr 0 65 the nutrients were merely satisfactory rsr 0 75 as for pbias positive negative values indicate a model underestimation overestimation bias overall simulation values of our indicators indicated very good pbias 10 for temperature and pbias 25 for the other water quality indicators the verified chl a in lake nl with the highest magnitude value pbias 44 indicated a satisfactory model simulation the coefficient of determination between observed data and model simulation showed that all three models have strong predictive capabilities on the whole r2 0 6 it indicated that the model has no high outliers that is there is no great difference between the mean and variance of the observed and modeled values to sum up the calibration and verification were confirmed acceptable because our modeled results for three categories of lakes generally showed good agreement with observed data for temperature do total nutrients and zooplankton figs 3 6 further the model results were confirmed as acceptable by comparing the uncertainty bands with the average of observed data for temperature do total nutrients and zooplankton figs 4 6 according to fig 4k zooplankton in lake nl decreased by 22 5 compared with the mean value of the uncertainty zone under the condition of sensitive parameters column 3 of table 1 varying within a 25 range indicating that zooplankton was underestimated similarly chl a tn and tp were overestimated by 28 4 13 4 and 6 3 fig 4c e i however a good fit between modeled and observed values improves the reliability of the model results the modeled results of lake ns have a narrower confidence interval from which it can be inferred that the uncertainty of the forecast results is low fig 5 as for lake ss fig 6 the results of the model closely matched the observed levels although they were all underestimated within the confidence interval of 25 with a deviation no more than 11 1 furthermore the following five parameters were identified as more sensitive to those water quality and water ecology indexes from the above 14 parameters according to the uncertainty analysis overall parameters related to zooplankton were identified as the most sensitive followed by those related to algae figs 4 6 for tn tp do and chl a three parameters proved sensitive to these variables that is cprefpom selection factor for particulate organic matter hfilt half saturation constant for food conc on zooplankton and cmumaxblue maximum growth rate blue greens in addition kdrespzoo maintenance respiration constant for zooplankton and fdasszoo dry weight assimilation efficiency of zooplankton also proved to be sensitive to water ecological variables especially to zooplankton 3 2 effects of future climate change on zooplankton and phytoplankton among three categories of lakes the three representative sets of modeled results that predict the dynamics of water ecological condition under warming in the three categories of lakes are shown in fig 7 biomass and growth rate of zooplankton and phytoplankton in water bodies with a large width depth ratio show more sensitivity to warming than those with a small width depth ratio in lake nl and ns fig 7d e an increase of temperature led to an increase in the maximum peak value of phytoplankton baseline to rcp 8 5 scenarios from 21 52 mg l 1 to 43 56 mg l 1 in lake nl and from 2 32 mg l 1 to 131 mg l 1 in lake ns even exceeding an increase amplitude of 100 however in lake ss fig 7f which has a much smaller width depth ratio than the previous two the variation range of the phytoplankton peak was only less than 20 baseline to rcp 8 5 scenarios from 4 84 mg l 1 to 3 92 mg l 1 moreover under the rcp 8 5 scenario the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton in lake nl and ns increased to more than twice that of the original scenario while in lake ss it decreased by 19 similarly the maximum daily reduction in zooplankton biomass between the baseline and rcp 2 6 scenarios was 22 and 93 for lake nl and ns fig 7a b while the variation did not exceed 3 between the baseline and rcp 8 5 scenarios in lake ss fig 7c the final results also showed that for lakes nl and ns fig 7g h j k m n the maximum daily changes of water quality indicators were evident under different warming conditions from baseline to rcp 8 5 scenarios tn an increase of more than 2 96 mg l 1 tp an increase of more than 0 51 mg l 1 chl a an increase of more than 260 35 mg l 1 in contrast only negligible changes occurred in lake ss fig 7i l o tn an increase of 0 84 mg l 1 tp an increase of 0 18 mg l 1 chl a an increase of 47 47 mg l 1 seasonal dynamics under several warming scenarios also show that in general community structures of zooplankton and phytoplankton were more stable in lakes with larger surface areas fig 7 the results show that in lakes ns and ss the biomass of zooplankton has multi peaks the timing of the of their peak occurrence was found to change with warming such change in seasonal concentrations was also observed on tn tp chl a and phytoplankton on the one hand the spring bloom started a week or two earlier than the baseline under the rcp 8 5 scenario while on the other hand the proportion of various compositions of algal assemblage varied with warming specifically diatoms and green algae comprised a similar percentage of the phytoplankton assemblage under the original and rcp 2 6 scenario and when a higher temperature scenario was set the green algae came to dominate the lake ns accounting for no less than 88 a similar phenomenon occurred in lake ss the proportion of diatoms decreased from 77 to 38 with warming and that of cyanobacteria increased from 8 to 54 in lake nl which exhibited an order of magnitude difference in surface area evaporation and slow running water make it easier for exogenous nutrients to accumulate excessive nitrogen and phosphorus conditioned the spring peak and the explosive growth of cyanobacteria conditioned the autumn peak as a result zooplankton biomass shows a single peak distribution with the peak occurring in summer in addition zooplankton blooms and declines occurred almost simultaneously in different scenarios and the relative abundance of various species of phytoplankton varied by less than 3 that is to say the surface area of lakes may affect the seasonal and inter annual dynamics of the community states to some extent 3 3 effects of external nutrient loads on zooplankton and phytoplankton among three categories of lakes for mean zooplankton and phytoplankton concentrations under different nutrient loading scenarios significant differences were found in lakes with varying surface areas fig 8 firstly under the baseline scenario with a decrease of lake surface area nl 7895 88 m2 ns 369 82 m2 ss 249 91 m2 modeled zooplankton biomass decreased fig 8a b c nl 1 0 mg l 1 ns 0 6 mg l 1 ss 0 3 mg l 1 the variation of phytoplankton biomass also showed a similar trend fig 8d e f nl 7 7 mg l 1 ns 1 1 mg l 1 ss 0 3 mg l 1 physical phenomena such as illumination intensity and radiating area may directly affect the growth of phytoplankton simultaneously accumulation of nutrients indirectly led to a change of zooplankton biomass as shown by the higher concentration of tn fig 8g h i nl 2 4 mg l 1 ns ss 1 5 mg l 1 and tp fig 8j k l nl 1 05 mg l 1 ns ss 0 84 mg l 1 in lake nl compared to the other two lakes the results indicated that the biomass of zooplankton and phytoplankton responded more intensely in lake nl to changes of nutrient loading in type 1 3 fig 8a d an increase of input organic nitrogen hereafter input on similarly for input in input op and input ip led to a decrease of 73 in phytoplankton baseline to 75 scenarios from 7 68 mg l 1 to 2 11 mg l 1 and an increase of 91 in zooplankton baseline to 75 scenarios from 1 00 mg l 1 to 1 92 mg l 1 the input of excess organic nitrogen promoted the growth and reproduction of zooplankton both phytoplankton and zooplankton decreased by more than 50 when the input ip in type 3 4 was reduced by 75 compared to type 1 2 fig 8a d for typical phosphorus restricted conditions in lake nl the simulation showed no obvious effect under the varying input of op concentration while limiting the release of inorganic phosphorus helped inhibit cyanobacteria growth and decreased nutrient levels it also reduced the amount of zooplankton however lakes ns and ss showed no significant differences from the baseline for all kinds of projected nutrient loading fig 8b c e f the details of percentage changes relative to the baseline of each nutrient scenario are shown in appendix s3 based on the results of the annual dynamics of tn tp phytoplankton zooplankton concentration compared with lake ss and the other two lake models the width depth ratio was considered to have little effect on zooplankton and phytoplankton for the average annual zooplankton concentration fig 8a b c when the input of on varied from 30 to 30 the amplitude of variation in lakes nl ns was about 5 times that of lake ss nl from 1 01 mg l 1 to 1 47 mg l 1 ns from 0 55 mg l 1 to 0 97 mg l 1 ss from 0 20 mg l 1 to 0 30 mg l 1 other indicators such as phytoplankton fig 8d f tn fig 8g i and tp fig 8j l showed no significant regularity among the three categories of lakes under various loading types and scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 effect of lake size on modeled zooplankton dynamics and ecosystem state changes the primary objective of this study was to predict the influence of water body size heterogeneity on zooplankton dynamics under increasing air temperature and variable nutrient concentrations the physical configuration of the hypothetical lake in pclake was designed with a morphology shaped like a truncated cone thus two indices surface area and width depth ratio were selected in this study to quantify the size effect the results show that the influence of water surface area was reflected in the large fluctuation range of the annual average zooplankton concentration with the change of nutrient loading fig 8 and on the other hand the seasonal variation of zooplankton biomass tended to be unimodal fig 7 the response of zooplankton to the width depth ratio is mainly reflected in the warming simulation that is the deeper water environment in small water bodies is more tolerant to climate warming fig 7 the trophic state of water is fundamental for the diversity abundance and even morphological variation of zooplankton especially in larger lakes barnett and beisner 2007 haberman and haldna 2014 karpowicz et al 2020 it is generally believed that lakes with a larger surface area here larger refers to lake nl with a surface area more than 0 1 ha hereafter tend to form a higher habitat complexity duggan 2001 wojtal et al 2003 in which case the biomass of zooplankton is greater fig 8a further a larger surface area prolongs the water exchange and renewal cycle gourgue et al 2007 making it easier for nutrients to accumulate fig 8g j as shown in types 1 3 of fig 8 zooplankton biomass increased significantly in larger lakes under the scenarios of excessive organic nitrogen this is likely due to the mutual transformation of organic and inorganic forms of nitrogen to promote biological absorption volkmann et al 2016 then the n p ratio was reduced to such a degree that cyanobacteria are no longer growing under optimal conditions type 1 3 fig 8d g j and zooplankton tend to enhance the top down control of the algal community on this occasion similarly due to the low homeostasis i e easily switching between a macrophyte dominated clear state and a phytoplankton dominated turbid state larger lakes appear to be more vulnerable to external disturbance and have a more rapid self recovery ability obolewski and glinska lewczuk 2020 this explains type 3 4 in fig 8 a d showing that when phosphate input decreased phytoplankton growth was mitigated in phosphorus restricted lakes which further affected zooplankton through the predator prey relationship facilitating lake restoration jeppesen et al 2005 spears et al 2007 alcaraz et al 2007 this is a key driving mechanism for controlling eutrophication and restoring the lake ecosystem the model predicts that the peak pattern of zooplankton dynamics in larger lakes is unimodal fig 7a which is correlated with the dominance of cyanobacteria species fig 7d habitats rich in cyanobacteria are not suitable for zooplankton owing to a difficulty in digestion and the competition for nutrients rohrlack et al 1999 wallace and snell 2010 gerba and pepper 2019 in larger lakes cyanobacteria tend to proliferate rapidly under favorable conditions of high temperatures and adequate illumination in summer sukenik et al 2009 due to the dominant role of cyanobacteria the growth rate of zooplankton was reduced and no more peaks of zooplankton biomass appeared after summer the dominating effect of the width depth ratio on zooplankton is closely related to warming whether the biomass of zooplankton increased or decreased with the warming shown in seasonal differences in shallow lakes with small width depth ratio fig 7c indicates that different mechanisms of warming may play a dominant role in different scenarios higher temperature may not only result in a decrease of zooplankton biomass under numerous indirect effects including enhanced stratification and reduced nutrient input from deeper waters into the upper mixed layer carey et al 2012 kirillin and shatwell 2016 but it also directly promotes the metabolism growth reproduction and survival of zooplankton ibelings et al 2011 seasonal fluctuation patterns in zooplankton biomass however seem to be relatively simple in lakes with a larger width depth ratio fig 7a b enhanced microbial activity in the sediment water interface significantly increased the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus making the aquatic ecosystem more suitable for algae and thus algophagous rotifers and daphnia petro et al 2017 this is the most likely explanation for the wider range of variation of zooplankton concentrations with warming in lakes with a larger width depth ratio this is especially true in the case of lake ns the shallowest lake with a depth of only one meter whose predictions show that the temperature rise has a threshold fig 7b e h k n when this threshold rcp 4 5 scenario is exceeded the model calculation will be terminated prematurely in summer that is the lake ecosystem collapses the response of shallow lakes to eutrophication tends to be catastrophic rather than smooth scheffer 2001 future summer heat might easily affect the self regulation ability of the ecosystem rendering it insufficient to maintain the continuous operation of the lake 4 2 model constraints based on the calibration and verification of three categories of lakes the seasonal dynamics of observed tn tp chl a and each functional group of phytoplankton could be well reproduced however pclake is a simplified ecological model that only describes simple food web dynamics in shallow lakes thus the dynamics of zooplankton community succession cannot be fully obtained rolighed et al 2016 in pclake all of the zooplankton species are generalized into a part of the simple food web group appendix s2 in fact however the feeding process of zooplankton species is complex for example large bodied daphnia species exert greater grazing pressure on phytoplankton in comparison with bosmina and ceriodaphnia in the north island lakes new zealand balvert et al 2009 large cladocerans have a circadian feeding rhythm the feeding peak occurring at night bielecka and boehnke 2014 the feeding rate of ciliates e g strombidium sulcatum is higher in summer than in winter affected by temperature dolan 2018 currently mechanistic models are unable to reveal complex trophic interactions clearly for example models have been initially calibrated according to nutrients transparency chl a and vegetation data from more than 40 lakes janse 2005 janse et al 2008 mooij et al 2009 calibrations based upon parameters which are related to the zooplankton module are supplemented here moreover given the diminutive nature of our lake models there might be some fish species and submerged macrophytes that are rare or nonexistent in this ecosystem while relative parameters were set as default values the function of the food web may exert an influence to some extent during the calculation in summary given the intra system complexity pclake may be subject to non uniqueness rolighed et al 2016 4 3 validity of future scenarios the deterioration of water quality induced by climate and nutrient changes appears to be highly related to trophic status trolle et al 2011 collins et al 2019 thus for input nutrient levels a series of control groups were set up to eliminate distractions that may interfere with the outcome three kinds of initial eutrophication conditions were set for each of the three categories of lakes under future warming scenarios respectively on this basis a total of 45 warming simulations were carried out consequently nine groups of predictions were drawn responses of tn tp chl a phytoplankton and zooplankton concentration as shown in appendix s4 it is clear from the predictions that when given different initial eutrophication conditions in one lake overall trends of annual concentrations of zooplankton phytoplankton and other water quality indicators did not change significantly the dry weight of phytoplankton in lake nl for instance showed only slight differences in the magnitude and location of peak due to variations in original nutrient status thus it was indicated that climate is a crucial factor for water ecology rather than nutrient availability moreover only one initial eutrophication scenario for each of our lakes is sufficient to illustrate the size effect of future climate changes on zooplankton in section 3 2 fig 7 similarly the same initial eutrophication levels were set for the response of zooplankton predictions in lakes of different size under nutrient loading scenarios to eliminate possible interference there is no doubt that there are many prospects ahead in addressing the problems of water ecology posed by climate change and nutrient status our modeling study predicted how climate warming would change the structure of small standing water ecosystems however warming is only a key but not the sole component of climate change different manifestations of climate changes such as greenhouse gas emissions stronger rainfall etc are expected to have an impact on zooplankton the same is true for the simulation of water nutrient state based on the current nutrient loading scenarios different input conditions of initial nutritional status can be given to achieve future predictions for instance changing the n p ratio or setting up an original simulation of lower mesotrophic ecosystems furthermore external loads climate forces and internal nutrient cycles collectively control ecosystem function and some may even appear synergistic enhancing symptoms of eutrophication wetzel 2001 watson et al 2016 rolighed et al 2016 hence more importantly future work should focus on the synergistic effect of various external pressures so that we can illustrate the probability of achieving a certain ecological state 5 conclusion we examined the performance of pclake a dynamics aquatic ecosystem model in terms of its ability to reproduce zooplankton biomass in typical small water bodies in poland and croatia the models established for the three lake groups were subsequently used to project the effects of climate warming and nutrient loading on zooplankton biomass and growth rate and thus the potential future implications for shallow lakes that differ in size we found that climate warming does lead to a decrease in zooplankton biomass especially in the two groups of water bodies located in the continental region of europe under the rcp 2 6 scenario the maximum daily reduction in zooplankton biomass is 93 in lake ns and 22 in lake nl compared to the original scenario it indicated that the zooplankton biomass in small lakes will decrease more than in large lakes with warming moreover the results of external nutrient loading scenarios suggested that the amount of variation in zooplankton biomass in lakes with surface areas 0 1 ha was more affected by changes in instream nutrient concentrations compared with that of 0 1 ha in particular the amount of zooplankton biomass changes is likely to be even greater than 50 when the input of organic nitrogen increases or inorganic phosphorus decreases these changes are caused by the decrease of n p ratio in small water bodies thus proper consideration could be given to the control of the n p ratio in lake management and restoration in addition we further combined the warming simulations with different initial eutrophication conditions overall in a typical small water body relatively speaking temperature has a far more significant impact on zooplankton biomass than eutrophication declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

24507,the experimental data were obtained from an ecological restoration project implemented at a metal contaminated site the basic idea presented in this study is that the conventionally defined chemical potential μ i can be used to evaluate the abiotic and biotic effects on a species ecological niche an ecological niche π i defines the suitability of an environment for a given species to live while μ i defines the ability of a species to live in a given environment the deviation of π i from its fundamental niche π i 0 due to changes in environment conditions will thus be reflected by the changes in μ i as a growth potential index μ i is a function of the standard chemical potential μ i 0 and the total number of plant species n like π i 0 which is an upper limit of π i μ i 0 is an upper limit of μ i at n 1 meaning that μ i 0 is also a factor independent of biotic interactions increasing n will reduce μ i and thus the same as π i μ i takes into account the biotic effect the derived expression of π i as a function of n confirms that both π i and μ i belong to the same function family both μ i 0 and π i 0 of a species are characteristic limits uniquely determined by the species genetic nature while μ i and π i of a species are variables subject to both the biotic and abiotic conditions under which the species is living either increase in species richness or deterioration in soil conditions will reduce μ i and π i the derived relation μ rt ln n m n can be applied to describe the biotic and abiotic effects on average π for species co existed in a plant community as an upper limit of ln n ln n m can be interpreted as a parameter representing the total availability of a space that can house n m species the conventionally applied biodiversity index ln n then corresponds to the part of available space inhabited by n co existed species and ln n m n stands for the remaining space availability the terms ln n m and ln n m n meet thus respectively the concepts of π 0 and π the results obtained from the present study showed that the negative effect of species richness and abundance on μ i and π i was the basic cause for the generally observed inverse relationship between population density and body size determination of the connection between μ i and π i is of high value in regulating the relationship between productivity and biodiversity

manipulated process well designed with proper measures and explicit targets baldera et al 2018 gonzález et al 2014 laughlin 2014 tongkoom et al 2018 wallace et al 2017 the nature of matter and energy exchange of an ecological process defines the general applicability of the thermodynamic functions for determining the state of an ecosystem performing a thermodynamic analysis with focuses on changes in individual population and community traits in the restoration process can provide useful information not only for assessment of the remediation effect but also for development of relevant knowledge and technology getz et al 2018 harzé et al 2018 hesse et al 2018 biomass quantity c individual number m and species number n are the three basic parameters that can be directly used as indicators for respectively productivity species abundance and species richness other parameters developed for describing a specific state of an ecosystem such as the shannon s diversity index or shannon wiener index fath et al 2019 molles 2016 tongkoom et al 2018 exergy jørgensen 2000 2010 jørgensen et al 2016 and relevant entropy based indicators laner et al 2017 ludovisi 2014 ludovisi and scharler 2017 etc are all presented as functions of either c m or n or a combination of them accounted for by their additive nature c m and n are extensive properties of an ecosystem thus as the primary state variables of an ecosystem c m and n all have fixed values at a given state and their changes can be uniquely determined by their difference between states regardless of the process history it follows that all indexes presented as functions of either c m or n are also state variables with defined meanings in both thermodynamics and ecology ecological restoration of a plant community is not a simple physical process as it involves biotic interactions the process of determining the suitable biotic and abiotic conditions for a species to live is known as ecological niche modeling ricklefs and relyea 2014 winemiller et al 2015 as a fundamental concept in ecology ecological niche has been extensively studied with main objectives to establish species distribution models for determination of environmental ranges limits and their shifts fort 2015 hijmans 2012 smeraldo et al al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 soininen et al 2011 steinmann et al 2011 zhang and kubota 2021 valdovinos 2019 and to develop relevant ecological theories harte et al 2008 2009 2015 harte and newman 2014 white et al 2012 the traditional concept of a species fundamental niche defines only the abiotic limits under which a species might live in the absence of interactions with other bio species molles 2016 since a species niche should also include its interactions with biotic factors loreau et al 2012 salinas ramos et al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 difficulties arise for determining the realized niche when various biological effects such as competition predation disease parasitism and symbiosis etc need to be taken into consideration analysis of the effect of biotic and abiotic interactions on the internal energy state of a species may present a different angle to look into the essential connection between a state function and the realized niche of a species the present study is conducted to analyze the effects of biotic and abiotic interactions on the growth potentials of plant species and their realized niches the data used for the analysis were obtained from an ecological restoration project implemented at a manganese tailing site 2 theoretical the state variables of a plant community and their basic relations have already been presented in previously published papers wu et al 2017 2018 chen et al 2021 the following discussions will be mainly focused on their natures related to biotic and abiotic effects 2 1 basic ratios the ratio of the individual number of a plant species m i to the total individual number of a plant community m is a traditional index for species abundance given as 1 p i m i m 1 m m i mn i 1 2 n where n denotes the total number of plant species in a plant community and m m n stands for the average individual number of plant species the ratio of the mass quantity of a plant species c i to the total mass quantity of a plant community c t is another meaningful index reflecting the role of the species in biomass production given as 2 x i c i c t 1 c t c i cn i 1 2 n where c c t n denotes the average mass quantity of plant species replacing m i and c i in eqs 1 and 2 respectively by m and c gives the average individual number ratio p and mass ratio x as 3 p m m m n m 1 n c c t c t n c t x which shows that both p and x are the reciprocal of n at a given site the biotic interaction will be stronger in communities possessing higher n values and the index for species richness n is thus a parameter reflecting the biotic effect of the site the essential connections among p x and n indicate that p and x can also be used as parameters for describing the biotic interactions 2 2 weighted chemical potential in accordance with the thermodynamic theories engel and reid 2006 enthalpy h is related to the gibbs free energy g entropy s and temperature t by 4 h g ts the chemical potential μ i of a plant species defined as a partial derivative of the gibbs free energy g i of the plant species with respect to its molar mass quantity c i can thus be expressed as 5 μ i g i c i h i c i t s i c i μ i 0 t rln 1 x i i 1 2 n where r denotes the gas constant and μ i 0 stands for the standard chemical potential of the ith species at a given t it is noted from eqs 2 and 5 that if n 1 c i c t x i 1 rtln 1 x i 0 and μ i μ i 0 indicating that apart from given t n 1 is also a required constraint to define μ i 0 since x i 1 and rtln 1 x i 0 μ i 0 is the upper limit of μ i at n 1 meaning that μ i 0 is independent of n or in other words μ i 0 is independent of biotic interactions from eq 5 one can write 6 h i c i μ i 0 or h i c i μ i 0 7 s i c i rln 1 x i s i c i rln 1 x i showing that h is an n independent factor since given t μ i 0 is a constant enthalpy h as the total internal energy preserved by a plant community in the process of heat transfer or solar energy transformation should be a single function of biomass quantity regardless of the species composition of the plant community it is difficult to manipulate the change in temperature t in an ecological process for eliminating the t effect eq 5 can be transformed to 8 μ i r t μ i 0 r t ln 1 x i replacing x i by x 1 n eq 8 becomes 9 μ i r t μ i 0 r t ln 1 x μ i 0 r t ln n since x 1 ln 1 x ln n 0 μ i will decrease with increaseing n showing that unlike μ i 0 μ i is an n dependent factor which decreases with increasing n in order to find a solution to determine μ i 0 rt for a plant species chen et al 2021 introduced a weight factor γ i and let μ i 0 γ i μ 0 subject to γ i n 1 using the weighted standard chemical potential term μ 0 the enthalpy of the ith species will be 10 h i c i μ i 0 c i γ i μ 0 μ 0 c i γ i μ 0 c γ i where cγ i denotes the weighted or equivalent biomass quantity of the ith species then the total equivalent biomass quantity of the system c t γ and related xγ i will be respectively 11 c t γ c i γ i c γ i 12 x γ i c γ i c γ i eqs 10 12 shows that given biomass in equivalent quantities the standard chemical potential of all species will be μ 0 disregarding the differences in their biomass composition and living environment in other words as long as c i is given in cγ i one can write for species i and j at sties i and ii 13 μ i 0 i μ j 0 i μ i 0 ii μ j 0 ii μ 0 use of the molar number of organic carbon to represent biomass quantity for an example may satisfy better the equivalent biomass quantity criterion as it can reduce the difference in biomass quality among species due to their differences in organic matter composition this argument may rationally hold since biomass production is a biological fixation process in which solar energy is used to transform inorganic canbon into organic canbon and the number of the fixed organic carbon is equal to that of the transformed inorganic carbon use of the molar number of organic carbon to represent the weighted biomass quantity should be of value for application of the presented thermodynamic model to analyze the inorganic organic carbon cycling in an ecosystem in future studies 2 3 upper limit of species number since μ i 0 rt is a constant at a given t using μ 0 to replace μ i 0 eq 9 can be expressed as 14 μ r t μ 0 r t ln n ln n m ln n o r ln n m μ r t ln n where ln n m μ 0 rt stands for a constant since μ 0 rt is the upper limit of μ rt at n 1 n m is the upper limit of n unlike n which is a variable denoting the number of species that are present at a site n m is a constant limit denoting the number of species that can survive at the site a species that has been or can be adapted to the physical environment of a site can survive at the site this infers that n m is a parameter related to regional species resource as an upper limit of n n m takes into account the number of species that could persist at a habitat with no biological interactions chen et al 2021 have shown that the condition μ rt ln n c stands for a critical point at which there is no further changes in n namely n 0 at n n c meaning that the species richness has reached a steady state at the critical point we obtain from eq 14 a solution for n m 15 ln n m μ r t ln n c 2 ln n c n m n c 2 the value of n m can thus be calculated by eq 15 using the critical n c observed at a site where the number of the inhabited species remains unchanged under natural conditions 2 4 entropy factor of a plant community the negative relationship between μ i and n is resulted from the positive relationship between entropy s i and n as a disorder index for a thermodynamic system s i is expected to increase with increasing n based on eq 7 using s i to denote s i r one can obtain an entropy factor s for a plant community s s i s r s i r c i ln 1 x i dividing s by c t gives 16 s c t 1 c t c i ln 1 x i c i c t ln 1 x i x i ln 1 x i if x i x 1 n eq 16 becomes 17 s c t x i ln 1 x i 1 n ln n ln n which means that if all x i values approach x the s c t factor approaches ln n chen et al 2021 the relationship between xi ln 1 x i and ln n can be analyzed using the observed n and x i values 3 materials and methods detailed experimental information has been presented in previous work ouyang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the experimental plots and sample analysis are briefly described below 3 1 experimental plots the experimental site was a manganese tailing wasteland located at 112 45 112 55 e and 27 53 28 03 n in xiangtan hunan china the daily temperature of the area is between 42 2 and 8 c and the annual precipitation is between 1185 5 and 1912 2 mm the site was poor in nitrogen and phosphorus but very high in manganese lead zinc copper cadmium and chromium two fast growing tree species paulownia fortunei and koelreuteria bipinnata screened from the native species distributed in the uncontaminated region nearby the tailing site were transplanted as phyto remediation species an organic manure prepared for the tailing site was amended to the rooting areas of the transplanted seedlings for providing nutrients and reducing the metal toxicity the experimental area consisted of three plots plot i 4 0 hm2 manganese tailing site amended with an organic manure as a base fertilizer before transplanting one year old seedlings of p fortunei and k bipinnata spacing 2 2 5 m 1000 plants of each species hm2 plot ii 0 2 hm2 manganese tailing site amended with chemical fertilizers before transplanting the same tree species spacing 2 2 5 m 1000 plants of each species hm2 plot iii 0 2 hm2 uncontaminated site in the vicinity of the tailing wasteland a plant community naturally developed under normal soil conditions 3 2 data collection and analysis three standard blocks approximately 667 m2 each in plots i ii and iii respectively were used as fixed sampling areas for comparison plant and soil samples were collected from three fixed standard blocks in each plots in june and october each year from 2010 to 2016 and analyzed by standard procedures gb15618 1995 gb3838 2002 gb18918 2002 people s republic of china the relative standard deviations in duplicate sample analyses ranged between 8 4 16 4 in biomass measurement and 5 1 18 3 in metal uptake determination the average values of net dry biomass quantity and metal uptake of the plant species were used for further calculation the differences between treatment plots were compared with lsd based on the measurement of the biomass quantity of the jth plant of the ith species c ij and the number of individual plants of the ith species m i the biomass quantity of the ith plant species c i was calculated by 18 c i c ij m i c i c i c i m i j 1 2 m i where c i denotes mean c ij for simplicity by ignoring the difference in biomass quality in the present study the values of p i x i and s c t were calculated respectively by eqs 1 2 and 16 the highest number of plant species 66 was obtained from plot iii in the non polluted surrounding area of the mining region changes in both c t and n of the plot in the investigated years satisfied approximately the condition c t 0 and n 0 indicating that the plant community naturally developed under uncontaminated soil conditions had reached a relatively steady state using 66 as n c in eq 15 for the mining region μ i rt and average μ rt were calculated respectively by 19 μ i r t ln n m ln 1 x i ln 66 2 ln 1 x i 8 3793 ln 1 x i 20 μ r t 8 3793 ln n 4 results 4 1 effect of species richness the ecological restoration was successful with respect to the significant enhancement of biomass production biodiversity and heavy metal removal p 0 01 table 1 detailed information concerning the restoration effect refers to previously published papers ouyang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2018 chen et al 2021 the curves in fig 1 a show clearly the negative effect of the total number of species n on mass ratio x i and individual number ratio p i of the transplanted p fortunei and k bipinnata in plot i amended with organic manure the observed negative effect of n on x i and p i is an expected result accounted for by the increase in the contribution of naturally germinated species to the total biomass quantity c t and total individual number of plants m the sum of the biomass quantity of these two fast growing tree species c i increased sharply within the investigated years while the sum of their mass ratio x i still decreased with increasing n the individual number m i of these two species remained unchanged in later years and the negative effect of n on their p i ratio was thus much stronger compared to that on x i fig 1a the negative effect of n on μ rt calculated by eq 20 was depicted in fig 1b determination of μ rt is simple as it is a single function of n the measured x iln 1 x i calculated by eq 16 was found to be linearly correlated to ln n defined by eq 17 at high level of significance in both plots i r2 0 9449 and ii r2 0 9950 the μ rt vs ln n curve in fig 1b can thus be used to describe the general trend of the effect of species richness on both the chemical potential factor μ rt and the entropy factor s c t the dotted line a 5 4161 in fig 1b calculated by ln 152 using the total number of species observed in plot ii in the year 2016 table 1 can be regarded as a hypothetic line to show that an unfavorable physical condition e g soil metal toxicity at a site may cause a significant decline in its potential species richness level the dotted line b in fig 1b is another hypothetic line to show that the presence of a symbiotic effect or a mutualism effect among co existed species may raise the μ rt level investigation of the symbiotic effect on μ rt should be an important task in future studies 4 2 effect of biotic and abiotic interactions the observed n in later years was much greater in plot i than in plot ii and a stronger n effect should thus be observed in plot i all species found in plot ii were also naturally geminated in plot i the data obtained from the year 2016 table 2 showed that their m i the number of individual plants values were all lower while their c i the average biomass quantity of an individual plant values were all higher in plot i than in plot ii the significant difference in c i and m i between plots i and ii p 0 01 can be interpreted as an integrated effect of biotic and abiotic interactions the improved soil conditions in plot i enhanced the growth rates of the individual plants while its species enrichment reduced the reproduction rates of the co existed species the stronger competition among species for available space nutrients and energy resources in particular with the two transplanted species in plot i should have restricted the spread of the native species and consequently reduced c i c i m i c i the biomass quantity of a species for a number of species see the underlined c i values in table 2 since c t and m were much greater in plot i than in plot ii table 1 the x i and p i values for all species listed in table 2 were much lower in plot i than in plot ii 4 3 difference in biomass and abundance the differences in c i and m i among species observed in plots i and iii are compared in fig 2 using their natural logarithmic values the generally trend was that the tree and shrub species possessed higher ln c i values while the herbs possessed higher ln m i values the typical case was that the two transplanted tree species p fortunei and k bipinnata had the highest ln c i values associated with extremely low ln m i values in plot i fig 2a the two species however were not the strongest competitors under natural conditions in this region among the native species observed in plot iii b papyrifera was found to be the one possessing the highest ln c i value associated with a relatively low ln m i value fig 2b the ln c i vs ln m i pattern shown in fig 2 does not give any new information to the generally observed inverse relationship between population density and body size known as the damuth s rule since in addition to biomass growth species richness species abundance and biodiversity are also important criteria for an ecological restoration the patterns in fig 2 can be used for screening of suitable species for establishing an optimal system structure that meets the designed restoration targets regarding productivity and ecological service functions 5 discussions 5 1 growth potential and ecological niche the concepts of fundamental and realized or actual niches are clear molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 the fundamental niche of a species can be determined by field investigations as it defines only the suitable physical conditions for the species to live it will be much more difficult to determine a species realized niche since it needs further to take into account the biological effect while that effect is expected to vary in ecosystems consisting of different bio species this from a logic way of thinking implies that the realized niche of a species is a variable related to both the number and nature of the co existed species in contrast to referring an ecological niche to a suitable environment for a species to live one may look at it from a different angle by connecting the niche of a species to one of its macroscopic properties that expresses its adaptability to a given environment if a plant species can be regarded as an entity unit for matter and energy exchange its realized niche can be evaluated by its ability to transform matter and energy in a given environment the basic idea is that a species will have a higher matter and energy transformation rate or a higher growth potential if its living environment gets closer to its fundamental niche the index for such ability should not be related to a single physiological character of the species on a microscopic scale such as its tolerance to either temperature draft metal toxicity or a co existed species it should be a macroscopic property and thus a state function linked to system composition showing not only the adaptability of a species to its physical and biological environment but also its role as a functional component in an ecosystem in principle this property should be an intensity factor as it reflects the potential vitality of a species to persist at a given habitat if this argument holds the chemical potential μ i defined by eq 8 meets the discussed criteria the change in the gibbs free energy g of a thermodynamic system is quantitatively related to the net work w n done by the system in response to the changes in its environmental conditions namely g w n engel and reid 2006 as a partial derivative of g i rt with respect to c i μ i rt is thus an intensity factor standing for the ability of a material component to resist environmental changes since the basic relationship between μ i rt and mass ratio x i holds in general with no constraints on systems types wu et al 2018 μ i rt can be used to describe the thermodynamic behaviors of a plant species in the investigated plant communities in accordance with the conventional concept of the chemical potential for a material component μ i rt for a plant species will stand for its biomass growth potential and the plant community will then be regarded as a biomass transformation system since for a single species system n 1 x i 1 and ln x i 0 μ i rt reaches its upper limit μ i 0 rt showing that similar to the fundamental niche the standard growth potential μ i 0 rt is a factor uniquely determined by an abiotic factor t in the absence of interactions with other species increasing n will reduce μ i rt and thus similar to the realized niche μ i rt takes into account the biotic effect the traditionally defined ecological niche for a given species is related to a group of environmental limits with more or less fixed threshold values such as a determined geographic range or a niche breadth ricklefs and relyea 2014 molles 2016 the μ i rt factor for a species however is a state variable varying within its definition range 0 μ i 0 rt subject to the changes in physical and biological conditions theoretically μ i rt may approach to either its upper limit μ i 0 rt at an ideal habitat possessing the most favorable living conditions or zero if the biotic or abiotic or both conditions of the site deviate far away from its fundamental limits as a state function the change in μ i rt can be uniquely determined by the difference between states independent of the process history the difference between μ i rt and μ j rt can thus be compared by 21 μ r t μ i μ j r t μ i 0 μ j 0 r t ln x i x j given c i and c j in equivalent quantities we have μ i 0 μ j 0 μ 0 which gives μ i 0 μ j 0 r t 0 at a given state a plant community possesses a unique c t value and thus ln x i x j ln c i c t ln c j c t ln c i ln c j ln c i c j which shows that ln c i can be used to compare the difference in μ i rt among species co existed in a community similar to x i which is a factor connecting μ i rt to system composition in terms of mass quantity p i is also an important factor connecting the species abundance to system composition in terms of individual numbers as a parameter reflecting the ability of a species to reproduce at a given site p i can be regarded as an index for reproduction potential then for a given community one can also write ln p i p j ln m i m ln m j m ln m i ln m j ln m i m j which shows that ln m i can be used to compare the difference in reproduction potentials among species in a community as a special case in the present study the species observed at the experimental sites are all native species of the region including the two transplanted species fig 2b it is then reasonable to assume that there is no essential difference in their fundamental niches which is in agreement with the condition μ i 0 μ j 0 rt 0 the ln c i vs ln m i patterns depicted in fig 2 for species living in the same physical environment thus reflected the effect of biotic interactions on their realized niches it follows that for a given species living at respectively sites i and ii the difference in its physical or biological environment or both that lead to a deviation from its fundamental niche can be compared by 22 μ r t μ i 0 μ ii 0 r t ln x i x ii ln x i x ii μ i 0 μ ii 0 0 by definition a species should possess a unique μ 0 given t disregarding its living environment and thus μ i 0 μ ii 0 0 then for a given species the difference in deviation from its fundamental niche between habitats i and ii can be directly compared by ln x i x ii it is noted that as c t may vary with sites table 1 ln x i x ii in eq 22 cannot be replaced by ln c i c ii for comparing the differences between sites the negative effect of n on x i and p i illustrated in fig 1a and the differences in c i m i x i and p i between plots i and ii shown in table 2 can be interpreted using the niche theory the reduced metal toxicity led to the enrichment of the native species in plot i such that the abiotic environment of plot i got closer to while its biotic environment went farther away from the fundamental niche of the native species as a consequence the improved physical environment promoted the biomass growth of the individual plants while the strengthened competitions among species inhibited their multiplications the observed higher c i associated with lower m i x i and p i of the species in plot i compared to those in plot ii thus reflected the integrated effect of the biotic and abiotic interactions on their realized niches since a smaller x i means a stronger biotic restriction x i can be directly used as an index to determine the effect of biological restrictions on the realized niche for either a given species at different sites or different species at a given site in contrast p i can only be used to compare the difference in biological restrictions on a given species between its habitats for an example the x i and p i values of p acinosa were both lower in plot i than in plot ii table 2 indicating that the biological restriction on this species was stronger in plot i than in plot ii the p i value of p acinosa was lower than that of c canadensis in both plots i and ii this was not an indication that p acinosa was subject to a stronger biological restriction than c canadensis in either plot i or plot ii as a matter of fact p acinosa was found to be the strongest metal tolerant species as it possessed the highest x i values in both plots among the native species listed in table 2 another example is the difference in x i and p i determined for p fortunei and k bipinnata the applied remediation method improved the site conditions for the two tree species to grow in plot i they possessed thus the highest x i values throughout the investigated years because of the their fixed seedling numbers their p i values were very low compared to those of other co existed species in plot i fig 2a reproduction also consumes energy and it should take a longer time for a species with a larger body size to multiply its individual number since more energy is required for its reproduction it is noted that eqs 21 and 22 are analogues of the differential expressions of the exergy and flow diversity of an ecosystem jørgensen 2000 fath et al 2019 showing their essential connections as integrally related ecological indicators since their basic principles hold generally with no constraints on species types the presented equations can also be used as different approaches to analyze the niche range overlap and shifts for other biological species as the work done by other scientists smeraldo et al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 zhang and kubota 2021 5 2 general expression of ecological niche an ecological niche defines the suitability of an environment for a given species to live while the growth potential μ i defines the ability of a species to live in a given environment both terms thus differ in their concepts the connection between a suitable environment for a given species and the growth potential of a species in a given environment determines that the deviations from the fundamental niche of a species due to changes in environmental conditions will be reflected by the differences in its growth potential such deviations can thus be evaluated by eqs 21 and 22 to support this argument it is necessary to formulize a general expression for a species ecological niche for convenience in comparison we may use π i 0 and π i to denote respectively the fundamental niche and realized niche of a species then the difference between π i 0 and π i will be 23 δ i π i 0 π i where δ i stands for the deviation of π i from π i caused by the deviation of environmental conditions from the suitable physical limits defined by the fundamental niche of the ith species eq 8 can be rewritten as 24 r t ln 1 x i μ i 0 μ i where rtln 1 x i stands for the deviation of μ i from μ i 0 due to decrease in mass ratio x i with increasing n it is noted that eq 23 is an analogue of eq 24 following the traditional definition of an ecological niche we shall have π i π i 0 in the absence of biotic restriction which corresponds to μ i μ i 0 at n 1 since n 1 means the absence of biotic restriction this implies that both μ i and π i are functions of n multiplying each term in eq 23 by n gives n δ i n π i 0 n π i the fundamental niche π i 0 is independent of n and thus dπ i 0 dn 0 taking the derivative of each term in the above relation with respect to n gives n d δ i d n δ i π i 0 n d π i d n π i since δ i π i 0 π i we obtain n d δ i d n n d π i d n 0 k k where k is introduecd as an n independent factor in accordance with the niche theory δ i is positively related to n thus dδ i dn 0 and dπ i dn 0 given k 0 we can write n d δ i d n k n d π i d n k or d δ i k n dn d π i k n dn by integration π i k ln n c at n 1 kln n 0 π i reaches its upper limit π i 0 and thus c π i 0 we find a general expression for π i as function of n 25 π i π i 0 δ i π i 0 k ln n comparing eq 25 with eq 9 we see that π i and μ i belong to the same function family which confirms that μ i can be used to evaluate π i 5 3 indexes of space availability the original meaning of a niche refers to a recessed place or a space in a wall where one could set or display items molles 2016 while a thermodynamic system is a niche for its matter items in general n m denotes the capacity limit of a system to hold matter components while the n m n ratio stands for its remaining space capacity or available niche area thus the principle concerning the relationships among μ n m n and π should hold in general for describing the interactions among matter components in a thermodynamic system similar to the interactions among co existed species occurring in an ecosystem the interference of a companion matter component can have a significant influence on either a physical chemical or a biological reaction taking place in a thermodynamic system brown et al 2006 engel and reid 2006 since given c i in equivalent quantity μ i 0 μ 0 holds for all species at all sites assuming that there is no difference in temperature t in plots i ii and iii we can write 26 μ 0 r t i μ 0 r t ii μ 0 r t iii ln n m meaning that μ 0 rt remains constant in the three investigated plots based on eq 10 we can obtain an enthalpy factor for a plant community 27 h r t h i r t c i μ 0 r t μ 0 r t c i μ 0 r t c t c t ln n m eqs 26 and 27 give the reason for use of the ln n m estimated for plot iii to calculate the internal energy factor h rt for plot i and ii the idea behind is that the metal contaminated soil condition will reduce the total quantity c t but not the quality μ 0 of the biomass given in weighted value it is noted that eq 26 only defines a t condition the term rt is an intensity factor possessing the same unit as μ 0 joule per molar mass quantity given rt is equivalent to given solar energy intensity for a site besides t however there are numbers of other physical factors such as moisture air soil properties etc that can affect a species living state a species for an example may not be able to survive at a site under a heavy air pollution or soil contamination condition three questions will then follow when ln n m is used as an index for the fundamental niche of a species π i 0 i how ln n m is essentially linked to the concept of π i 0 ii whether or not it is also reasonable to use the ln n m estimated for plot iii as the average π 0 line shown in fig 1b for plots i and ii and iii how to determine π i for a single species assuming a homogeneous distribution of nutrient and energy resource at a site the biotic interaction at the site could be simply considered as a process of competition among species for a living space then the intensity parameter ln n m could be regarded as an upper limit representing the total availability of a space that can house n m species while ln n would accordingly correspond to the part of available space occupied or inhabited by n co existed species the difference between ln n m and ln n would then stand for the remaining space availability a single species namely n 1 living on an area that could house n m species should have a greater space for its development than living together with other species n 1 on the area the terms ln n m and ln n m n meet thus respectively the concepts of fundamental and realized niche in fact the relation μ 0 rt ln n m derived from thermodynamic functions defines an ideal space for a species to live under a given t condition relating ln n m to the total availabity of an ideal space one may write μ 0 r t ln n m phycical factors t total space avai labi lty under ideal phys ical cond itio ns where the subscript phycical factors t means that besides t other physical factors are all kept unchanged at the most adequate levels the fundamental niche of a species π i 0 refers to a mult dimentional matrix containing a group of suitable environmental limits that are uniquely determined by the genetic nature of the species adaptability to its living enviroment the total space availabilty under ideal physical conditions thus fits the concept of π i 0 as been already mentioned a species shoud have a unique μ i 0 and if the species were not further evolved so should it have a unique π i 0 regardless of the environmental conditions under which the species is living if any of the physical conditions at a site deviated from its defined suitable level one would say that the physical condition at the site had deviated from its fundamental niche rather than say that the negative effect of the physical condition had reduced its fundamental niche level the native species p acinosa for an example was observed in plots i ii and iii and it would be inappropriate to think that this herbaceous plant had different fundamental niches in different plots the deteriorated soil conditions in plot ii fell far below the suitable limits defined by the fundamental niche for a number of native species including the transplanted k bipinnata and p fortunei such that they could not survive in this plot plot iii possessed a better soil condition among the three experimental sites it is thus more appropriate to use the ln n m estimated for plot iii to mark the average fundamental niche line for the native species as it meets better the critrion of suitable physical conditions in addition use of the ln n m estimated for plot iii for plots i and ii is based on an argument that as an important target of ecological restoration the soil condition in plot i could be fully recovered in the future unlike the fundamental niche of a species π i 0 which refers to a group of fixed physical limits the realized niche of the species π i is a variable subject to both the biotic and abiotic interactions line a in fig 1b shows thus such a negative effect of soil metal contamination on π i the heat moisture and air conditions may be treated as fixed values for plots i ii and iii besides the effect of the soil conditions another important factor that needs to be taken into consideration for determining π i is the symbiotic effect of the co existed species line b in fig 1b shows that a positive symbiotic effect may raise the π i level at a given n determination of the mechanism of symbiosis among species and its effect on π i should be of high significance for development of knowledge and technology in the field of thermodynamics of ecosystems the concept of the weighted standard chemical potential gives the answer to the third question regarding the determination of π i for a single species based on relations μ i 0 γ i μ 0 and μ 0 rt ln n m we have μ i 0 r t γ i μ 0 r t γ i ln n m π i 0 where the weighted factor γ i is a characteristic coefficient defined by the nature of the species the value of γ i can be obtained by comparing the biomass quality c i or individual number m i if c i c j among species in terms of internal energy or exergy this work however is beyond the scope of the present study 6 conclusions the observed effects of biotic and abiotic interactions indicated the presence of an essential connection between the growth potential μ i of a species and its realized niche π i the μ i factor is a function of the standard chemical potential μ i 0 mass ratio x i and the total number of plant species n similar to the fundamental niche π i 0 which is an upper limit of π i μ i 0 is an upper limit of μ i at n 1 and ln 1 x i 0 meaning that the same as π i 0 μ i 0 is independent of biotic interactions decrease in x i with increasing n will reduce μ i and thus the same as π i μ i takes into account the biotic effect the derived general expression of π i as a function of n shows that both π i and μ i belong to the same function family the standard chemical potential μ i 0 and fundamental niche π 0 of a species are both characteristic limits uniquely determined by the genetic nature of the species related to its adaptability to a living environment a species possesses unique μ i 0 and π i 0 values regardless of the changes in environmental conditions under which the species is living in contrast μ i and π i of a species are variables subject to both biotic and abiotic conditions deviation of any of the biological and physical conditions from the suitable limits defined by π i 0 due to for examples increase in species richness or deterioration in soil properties will reduce μ i and π i the relation μ rt ln n m n can be applied to describe the integrated effect of biotic and abiotic interactions on the average realized niche π for species co existed in a plant community as an upper limit of ln n ln n m can be interpreted as a parameter representing the total availability of a space that can house n m species the traditionally applied biodiversity factor ln n then corresponds to the part of available space inhabited by n co existed species and ln n m n stands for the remaining space availability the terms ln n m and ln n m n meet thus respectively the concepts of π 0 and π the ln n m value estimated for plot iii can be used to mark the average π0 line for the observed native species in plots i and ii as the soil conditions in plot iii meet better the criterion of suitable physical conditions defined by π0 credit authorship contribution

24507,the experimental data were obtained from an ecological restoration project implemented at a metal contaminated site the basic idea presented in this study is that the conventionally defined chemical potential μ i can be used to evaluate the abiotic and biotic effects on a species ecological niche an ecological niche π i defines the suitability of an environment for a given species to live while μ i defines the ability of a species to live in a given environment the deviation of π i from its fundamental niche π i 0 due to changes in environment conditions will thus be reflected by the changes in μ i as a growth potential index μ i is a function of the standard chemical potential μ i 0 and the total number of plant species n like π i 0 which is an upper limit of π i μ i 0 is an upper limit of μ i at n 1 meaning that μ i 0 is also a factor independent of biotic interactions increasing n will reduce μ i and thus the same as π i μ i takes into account the biotic effect the derived expression of π i as a function of n confirms that both π i and μ i belong to the same function family both μ i 0 and π i 0 of a species are characteristic limits uniquely determined by the species genetic nature while μ i and π i of a species are variables subject to both the biotic and abiotic conditions under which the species is living either increase in species richness or deterioration in soil conditions will reduce μ i and π i the derived relation μ rt ln n m n can be applied to describe the biotic and abiotic effects on average π for species co existed in a plant community as an upper limit of ln n ln n m can be interpreted as a parameter representing the total availability of a space that can house n m species the conventionally applied biodiversity index ln n then corresponds to the part of available space inhabited by n co existed species and ln n m n stands for the remaining space availability the terms ln n m and ln n m n meet thus respectively the concepts of π 0 and π the results obtained from the present study showed that the negative effect of species richness and abundance on μ i and π i was the basic cause for the generally observed inverse relationship between population density and body size determination of the connection between μ i and π i is of high value in regulating the relationship between productivity and biodiversity

manipulated process well designed with proper measures and explicit targets baldera et al 2018 gonzález et al 2014 laughlin 2014 tongkoom et al 2018 wallace et al 2017 the nature of matter and energy exchange of an ecological process defines the general applicability of the thermodynamic functions for determining the state of an ecosystem performing a thermodynamic analysis with focuses on changes in individual population and community traits in the restoration process can provide useful information not only for assessment of the remediation effect but also for development of relevant knowledge and technology getz et al 2018 harzé et al 2018 hesse et al 2018 biomass quantity c individual number m and species number n are the three basic parameters that can be directly used as indicators for respectively productivity species abundance and species richness other parameters developed for describing a specific state of an ecosystem such as the shannon s diversity index or shannon wiener index fath et al 2019 molles 2016 tongkoom et al 2018 exergy jørgensen 2000 2010 jørgensen et al 2016 and relevant entropy based indicators laner et al 2017 ludovisi 2014 ludovisi and scharler 2017 etc are all presented as functions of either c m or n or a combination of them accounted for by their additive nature c m and n are extensive properties of an ecosystem thus as the primary state variables of an ecosystem c m and n all have fixed values at a given state and their changes can be uniquely determined by their difference between states regardless of the process history it follows that all indexes presented as functions of either c m or n are also state variables with defined meanings in both thermodynamics and ecology ecological restoration of a plant community is not a simple physical process as it involves biotic interactions the process of determining the suitable biotic and abiotic conditions for a species to live is known as ecological niche modeling ricklefs and relyea 2014 winemiller et al 2015 as a fundamental concept in ecology ecological niche has been extensively studied with main objectives to establish species distribution models for determination of environmental ranges limits and their shifts fort 2015 hijmans 2012 smeraldo et al al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 soininen et al 2011 steinmann et al 2011 zhang and kubota 2021 valdovinos 2019 and to develop relevant ecological theories harte et al 2008 2009 2015 harte and newman 2014 white et al 2012 the traditional concept of a species fundamental niche defines only the abiotic limits under which a species might live in the absence of interactions with other bio species molles 2016 since a species niche should also include its interactions with biotic factors loreau et al 2012 salinas ramos et al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 difficulties arise for determining the realized niche when various biological effects such as competition predation disease parasitism and symbiosis etc need to be taken into consideration analysis of the effect of biotic and abiotic interactions on the internal energy state of a species may present a different angle to look into the essential connection between a state function and the realized niche of a species the present study is conducted to analyze the effects of biotic and abiotic interactions on the growth potentials of plant species and their realized niches the data used for the analysis were obtained from an ecological restoration project implemented at a manganese tailing site 2 theoretical the state variables of a plant community and their basic relations have already been presented in previously published papers wu et al 2017 2018 chen et al 2021 the following discussions will be mainly focused on their natures related to biotic and abiotic effects 2 1 basic ratios the ratio of the individual number of a plant species m i to the total individual number of a plant community m is a traditional index for species abundance given as 1 p i m i m 1 m m i mn i 1 2 n where n denotes the total number of plant species in a plant community and m m n stands for the average individual number of plant species the ratio of the mass quantity of a plant species c i to the total mass quantity of a plant community c t is another meaningful index reflecting the role of the species in biomass production given as 2 x i c i c t 1 c t c i cn i 1 2 n where c c t n denotes the average mass quantity of plant species replacing m i and c i in eqs 1 and 2 respectively by m and c gives the average individual number ratio p and mass ratio x as 3 p m m m n m 1 n c c t c t n c t x which shows that both p and x are the reciprocal of n at a given site the biotic interaction will be stronger in communities possessing higher n values and the index for species richness n is thus a parameter reflecting the biotic effect of the site the essential connections among p x and n indicate that p and x can also be used as parameters for describing the biotic interactions 2 2 weighted chemical potential in accordance with the thermodynamic theories engel and reid 2006 enthalpy h is related to the gibbs free energy g entropy s and temperature t by 4 h g ts the chemical potential μ i of a plant species defined as a partial derivative of the gibbs free energy g i of the plant species with respect to its molar mass quantity c i can thus be expressed as 5 μ i g i c i h i c i t s i c i μ i 0 t rln 1 x i i 1 2 n where r denotes the gas constant and μ i 0 stands for the standard chemical potential of the ith species at a given t it is noted from eqs 2 and 5 that if n 1 c i c t x i 1 rtln 1 x i 0 and μ i μ i 0 indicating that apart from given t n 1 is also a required constraint to define μ i 0 since x i 1 and rtln 1 x i 0 μ i 0 is the upper limit of μ i at n 1 meaning that μ i 0 is independent of n or in other words μ i 0 is independent of biotic interactions from eq 5 one can write 6 h i c i μ i 0 or h i c i μ i 0 7 s i c i rln 1 x i s i c i rln 1 x i showing that h is an n independent factor since given t μ i 0 is a constant enthalpy h as the total internal energy preserved by a plant community in the process of heat transfer or solar energy transformation should be a single function of biomass quantity regardless of the species composition of the plant community it is difficult to manipulate the change in temperature t in an ecological process for eliminating the t effect eq 5 can be transformed to 8 μ i r t μ i 0 r t ln 1 x i replacing x i by x 1 n eq 8 becomes 9 μ i r t μ i 0 r t ln 1 x μ i 0 r t ln n since x 1 ln 1 x ln n 0 μ i will decrease with increaseing n showing that unlike μ i 0 μ i is an n dependent factor which decreases with increasing n in order to find a solution to determine μ i 0 rt for a plant species chen et al 2021 introduced a weight factor γ i and let μ i 0 γ i μ 0 subject to γ i n 1 using the weighted standard chemical potential term μ 0 the enthalpy of the ith species will be 10 h i c i μ i 0 c i γ i μ 0 μ 0 c i γ i μ 0 c γ i where cγ i denotes the weighted or equivalent biomass quantity of the ith species then the total equivalent biomass quantity of the system c t γ and related xγ i will be respectively 11 c t γ c i γ i c γ i 12 x γ i c γ i c γ i eqs 10 12 shows that given biomass in equivalent quantities the standard chemical potential of all species will be μ 0 disregarding the differences in their biomass composition and living environment in other words as long as c i is given in cγ i one can write for species i and j at sties i and ii 13 μ i 0 i μ j 0 i μ i 0 ii μ j 0 ii μ 0 use of the molar number of organic carbon to represent biomass quantity for an example may satisfy better the equivalent biomass quantity criterion as it can reduce the difference in biomass quality among species due to their differences in organic matter composition this argument may rationally hold since biomass production is a biological fixation process in which solar energy is used to transform inorganic canbon into organic canbon and the number of the fixed organic carbon is equal to that of the transformed inorganic carbon use of the molar number of organic carbon to represent the weighted biomass quantity should be of value for application of the presented thermodynamic model to analyze the inorganic organic carbon cycling in an ecosystem in future studies 2 3 upper limit of species number since μ i 0 rt is a constant at a given t using μ 0 to replace μ i 0 eq 9 can be expressed as 14 μ r t μ 0 r t ln n ln n m ln n o r ln n m μ r t ln n where ln n m μ 0 rt stands for a constant since μ 0 rt is the upper limit of μ rt at n 1 n m is the upper limit of n unlike n which is a variable denoting the number of species that are present at a site n m is a constant limit denoting the number of species that can survive at the site a species that has been or can be adapted to the physical environment of a site can survive at the site this infers that n m is a parameter related to regional species resource as an upper limit of n n m takes into account the number of species that could persist at a habitat with no biological interactions chen et al 2021 have shown that the condition μ rt ln n c stands for a critical point at which there is no further changes in n namely n 0 at n n c meaning that the species richness has reached a steady state at the critical point we obtain from eq 14 a solution for n m 15 ln n m μ r t ln n c 2 ln n c n m n c 2 the value of n m can thus be calculated by eq 15 using the critical n c observed at a site where the number of the inhabited species remains unchanged under natural conditions 2 4 entropy factor of a plant community the negative relationship between μ i and n is resulted from the positive relationship between entropy s i and n as a disorder index for a thermodynamic system s i is expected to increase with increasing n based on eq 7 using s i to denote s i r one can obtain an entropy factor s for a plant community s s i s r s i r c i ln 1 x i dividing s by c t gives 16 s c t 1 c t c i ln 1 x i c i c t ln 1 x i x i ln 1 x i if x i x 1 n eq 16 becomes 17 s c t x i ln 1 x i 1 n ln n ln n which means that if all x i values approach x the s c t factor approaches ln n chen et al 2021 the relationship between xi ln 1 x i and ln n can be analyzed using the observed n and x i values 3 materials and methods detailed experimental information has been presented in previous work ouyang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the experimental plots and sample analysis are briefly described below 3 1 experimental plots the experimental site was a manganese tailing wasteland located at 112 45 112 55 e and 27 53 28 03 n in xiangtan hunan china the daily temperature of the area is between 42 2 and 8 c and the annual precipitation is between 1185 5 and 1912 2 mm the site was poor in nitrogen and phosphorus but very high in manganese lead zinc copper cadmium and chromium two fast growing tree species paulownia fortunei and koelreuteria bipinnata screened from the native species distributed in the uncontaminated region nearby the tailing site were transplanted as phyto remediation species an organic manure prepared for the tailing site was amended to the rooting areas of the transplanted seedlings for providing nutrients and reducing the metal toxicity the experimental area consisted of three plots plot i 4 0 hm2 manganese tailing site amended with an organic manure as a base fertilizer before transplanting one year old seedlings of p fortunei and k bipinnata spacing 2 2 5 m 1000 plants of each species hm2 plot ii 0 2 hm2 manganese tailing site amended with chemical fertilizers before transplanting the same tree species spacing 2 2 5 m 1000 plants of each species hm2 plot iii 0 2 hm2 uncontaminated site in the vicinity of the tailing wasteland a plant community naturally developed under normal soil conditions 3 2 data collection and analysis three standard blocks approximately 667 m2 each in plots i ii and iii respectively were used as fixed sampling areas for comparison plant and soil samples were collected from three fixed standard blocks in each plots in june and october each year from 2010 to 2016 and analyzed by standard procedures gb15618 1995 gb3838 2002 gb18918 2002 people s republic of china the relative standard deviations in duplicate sample analyses ranged between 8 4 16 4 in biomass measurement and 5 1 18 3 in metal uptake determination the average values of net dry biomass quantity and metal uptake of the plant species were used for further calculation the differences between treatment plots were compared with lsd based on the measurement of the biomass quantity of the jth plant of the ith species c ij and the number of individual plants of the ith species m i the biomass quantity of the ith plant species c i was calculated by 18 c i c ij m i c i c i c i m i j 1 2 m i where c i denotes mean c ij for simplicity by ignoring the difference in biomass quality in the present study the values of p i x i and s c t were calculated respectively by eqs 1 2 and 16 the highest number of plant species 66 was obtained from plot iii in the non polluted surrounding area of the mining region changes in both c t and n of the plot in the investigated years satisfied approximately the condition c t 0 and n 0 indicating that the plant community naturally developed under uncontaminated soil conditions had reached a relatively steady state using 66 as n c in eq 15 for the mining region μ i rt and average μ rt were calculated respectively by 19 μ i r t ln n m ln 1 x i ln 66 2 ln 1 x i 8 3793 ln 1 x i 20 μ r t 8 3793 ln n 4 results 4 1 effect of species richness the ecological restoration was successful with respect to the significant enhancement of biomass production biodiversity and heavy metal removal p 0 01 table 1 detailed information concerning the restoration effect refers to previously published papers ouyang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2018 chen et al 2021 the curves in fig 1 a show clearly the negative effect of the total number of species n on mass ratio x i and individual number ratio p i of the transplanted p fortunei and k bipinnata in plot i amended with organic manure the observed negative effect of n on x i and p i is an expected result accounted for by the increase in the contribution of naturally germinated species to the total biomass quantity c t and total individual number of plants m the sum of the biomass quantity of these two fast growing tree species c i increased sharply within the investigated years while the sum of their mass ratio x i still decreased with increasing n the individual number m i of these two species remained unchanged in later years and the negative effect of n on their p i ratio was thus much stronger compared to that on x i fig 1a the negative effect of n on μ rt calculated by eq 20 was depicted in fig 1b determination of μ rt is simple as it is a single function of n the measured x iln 1 x i calculated by eq 16 was found to be linearly correlated to ln n defined by eq 17 at high level of significance in both plots i r2 0 9449 and ii r2 0 9950 the μ rt vs ln n curve in fig 1b can thus be used to describe the general trend of the effect of species richness on both the chemical potential factor μ rt and the entropy factor s c t the dotted line a 5 4161 in fig 1b calculated by ln 152 using the total number of species observed in plot ii in the year 2016 table 1 can be regarded as a hypothetic line to show that an unfavorable physical condition e g soil metal toxicity at a site may cause a significant decline in its potential species richness level the dotted line b in fig 1b is another hypothetic line to show that the presence of a symbiotic effect or a mutualism effect among co existed species may raise the μ rt level investigation of the symbiotic effect on μ rt should be an important task in future studies 4 2 effect of biotic and abiotic interactions the observed n in later years was much greater in plot i than in plot ii and a stronger n effect should thus be observed in plot i all species found in plot ii were also naturally geminated in plot i the data obtained from the year 2016 table 2 showed that their m i the number of individual plants values were all lower while their c i the average biomass quantity of an individual plant values were all higher in plot i than in plot ii the significant difference in c i and m i between plots i and ii p 0 01 can be interpreted as an integrated effect of biotic and abiotic interactions the improved soil conditions in plot i enhanced the growth rates of the individual plants while its species enrichment reduced the reproduction rates of the co existed species the stronger competition among species for available space nutrients and energy resources in particular with the two transplanted species in plot i should have restricted the spread of the native species and consequently reduced c i c i m i c i the biomass quantity of a species for a number of species see the underlined c i values in table 2 since c t and m were much greater in plot i than in plot ii table 1 the x i and p i values for all species listed in table 2 were much lower in plot i than in plot ii 4 3 difference in biomass and abundance the differences in c i and m i among species observed in plots i and iii are compared in fig 2 using their natural logarithmic values the generally trend was that the tree and shrub species possessed higher ln c i values while the herbs possessed higher ln m i values the typical case was that the two transplanted tree species p fortunei and k bipinnata had the highest ln c i values associated with extremely low ln m i values in plot i fig 2a the two species however were not the strongest competitors under natural conditions in this region among the native species observed in plot iii b papyrifera was found to be the one possessing the highest ln c i value associated with a relatively low ln m i value fig 2b the ln c i vs ln m i pattern shown in fig 2 does not give any new information to the generally observed inverse relationship between population density and body size known as the damuth s rule since in addition to biomass growth species richness species abundance and biodiversity are also important criteria for an ecological restoration the patterns in fig 2 can be used for screening of suitable species for establishing an optimal system structure that meets the designed restoration targets regarding productivity and ecological service functions 5 discussions 5 1 growth potential and ecological niche the concepts of fundamental and realized or actual niches are clear molles 2016 ricklefs and relyea 2014 the fundamental niche of a species can be determined by field investigations as it defines only the suitable physical conditions for the species to live it will be much more difficult to determine a species realized niche since it needs further to take into account the biological effect while that effect is expected to vary in ecosystems consisting of different bio species this from a logic way of thinking implies that the realized niche of a species is a variable related to both the number and nature of the co existed species in contrast to referring an ecological niche to a suitable environment for a species to live one may look at it from a different angle by connecting the niche of a species to one of its macroscopic properties that expresses its adaptability to a given environment if a plant species can be regarded as an entity unit for matter and energy exchange its realized niche can be evaluated by its ability to transform matter and energy in a given environment the basic idea is that a species will have a higher matter and energy transformation rate or a higher growth potential if its living environment gets closer to its fundamental niche the index for such ability should not be related to a single physiological character of the species on a microscopic scale such as its tolerance to either temperature draft metal toxicity or a co existed species it should be a macroscopic property and thus a state function linked to system composition showing not only the adaptability of a species to its physical and biological environment but also its role as a functional component in an ecosystem in principle this property should be an intensity factor as it reflects the potential vitality of a species to persist at a given habitat if this argument holds the chemical potential μ i defined by eq 8 meets the discussed criteria the change in the gibbs free energy g of a thermodynamic system is quantitatively related to the net work w n done by the system in response to the changes in its environmental conditions namely g w n engel and reid 2006 as a partial derivative of g i rt with respect to c i μ i rt is thus an intensity factor standing for the ability of a material component to resist environmental changes since the basic relationship between μ i rt and mass ratio x i holds in general with no constraints on systems types wu et al 2018 μ i rt can be used to describe the thermodynamic behaviors of a plant species in the investigated plant communities in accordance with the conventional concept of the chemical potential for a material component μ i rt for a plant species will stand for its biomass growth potential and the plant community will then be regarded as a biomass transformation system since for a single species system n 1 x i 1 and ln x i 0 μ i rt reaches its upper limit μ i 0 rt showing that similar to the fundamental niche the standard growth potential μ i 0 rt is a factor uniquely determined by an abiotic factor t in the absence of interactions with other species increasing n will reduce μ i rt and thus similar to the realized niche μ i rt takes into account the biotic effect the traditionally defined ecological niche for a given species is related to a group of environmental limits with more or less fixed threshold values such as a determined geographic range or a niche breadth ricklefs and relyea 2014 molles 2016 the μ i rt factor for a species however is a state variable varying within its definition range 0 μ i 0 rt subject to the changes in physical and biological conditions theoretically μ i rt may approach to either its upper limit μ i 0 rt at an ideal habitat possessing the most favorable living conditions or zero if the biotic or abiotic or both conditions of the site deviate far away from its fundamental limits as a state function the change in μ i rt can be uniquely determined by the difference between states independent of the process history the difference between μ i rt and μ j rt can thus be compared by 21 μ r t μ i μ j r t μ i 0 μ j 0 r t ln x i x j given c i and c j in equivalent quantities we have μ i 0 μ j 0 μ 0 which gives μ i 0 μ j 0 r t 0 at a given state a plant community possesses a unique c t value and thus ln x i x j ln c i c t ln c j c t ln c i ln c j ln c i c j which shows that ln c i can be used to compare the difference in μ i rt among species co existed in a community similar to x i which is a factor connecting μ i rt to system composition in terms of mass quantity p i is also an important factor connecting the species abundance to system composition in terms of individual numbers as a parameter reflecting the ability of a species to reproduce at a given site p i can be regarded as an index for reproduction potential then for a given community one can also write ln p i p j ln m i m ln m j m ln m i ln m j ln m i m j which shows that ln m i can be used to compare the difference in reproduction potentials among species in a community as a special case in the present study the species observed at the experimental sites are all native species of the region including the two transplanted species fig 2b it is then reasonable to assume that there is no essential difference in their fundamental niches which is in agreement with the condition μ i 0 μ j 0 rt 0 the ln c i vs ln m i patterns depicted in fig 2 for species living in the same physical environment thus reflected the effect of biotic interactions on their realized niches it follows that for a given species living at respectively sites i and ii the difference in its physical or biological environment or both that lead to a deviation from its fundamental niche can be compared by 22 μ r t μ i 0 μ ii 0 r t ln x i x ii ln x i x ii μ i 0 μ ii 0 0 by definition a species should possess a unique μ 0 given t disregarding its living environment and thus μ i 0 μ ii 0 0 then for a given species the difference in deviation from its fundamental niche between habitats i and ii can be directly compared by ln x i x ii it is noted that as c t may vary with sites table 1 ln x i x ii in eq 22 cannot be replaced by ln c i c ii for comparing the differences between sites the negative effect of n on x i and p i illustrated in fig 1a and the differences in c i m i x i and p i between plots i and ii shown in table 2 can be interpreted using the niche theory the reduced metal toxicity led to the enrichment of the native species in plot i such that the abiotic environment of plot i got closer to while its biotic environment went farther away from the fundamental niche of the native species as a consequence the improved physical environment promoted the biomass growth of the individual plants while the strengthened competitions among species inhibited their multiplications the observed higher c i associated with lower m i x i and p i of the species in plot i compared to those in plot ii thus reflected the integrated effect of the biotic and abiotic interactions on their realized niches since a smaller x i means a stronger biotic restriction x i can be directly used as an index to determine the effect of biological restrictions on the realized niche for either a given species at different sites or different species at a given site in contrast p i can only be used to compare the difference in biological restrictions on a given species between its habitats for an example the x i and p i values of p acinosa were both lower in plot i than in plot ii table 2 indicating that the biological restriction on this species was stronger in plot i than in plot ii the p i value of p acinosa was lower than that of c canadensis in both plots i and ii this was not an indication that p acinosa was subject to a stronger biological restriction than c canadensis in either plot i or plot ii as a matter of fact p acinosa was found to be the strongest metal tolerant species as it possessed the highest x i values in both plots among the native species listed in table 2 another example is the difference in x i and p i determined for p fortunei and k bipinnata the applied remediation method improved the site conditions for the two tree species to grow in plot i they possessed thus the highest x i values throughout the investigated years because of the their fixed seedling numbers their p i values were very low compared to those of other co existed species in plot i fig 2a reproduction also consumes energy and it should take a longer time for a species with a larger body size to multiply its individual number since more energy is required for its reproduction it is noted that eqs 21 and 22 are analogues of the differential expressions of the exergy and flow diversity of an ecosystem jørgensen 2000 fath et al 2019 showing their essential connections as integrally related ecological indicators since their basic principles hold generally with no constraints on species types the presented equations can also be used as different approaches to analyze the niche range overlap and shifts for other biological species as the work done by other scientists smeraldo et al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 zhang and kubota 2021 5 2 general expression of ecological niche an ecological niche defines the suitability of an environment for a given species to live while the growth potential μ i defines the ability of a species to live in a given environment both terms thus differ in their concepts the connection between a suitable environment for a given species and the growth potential of a species in a given environment determines that the deviations from the fundamental niche of a species due to changes in environmental conditions will be reflected by the differences in its growth potential such deviations can thus be evaluated by eqs 21 and 22 to support this argument it is necessary to formulize a general expression for a species ecological niche for convenience in comparison we may use π i 0 and π i to denote respectively the fundamental niche and realized niche of a species then the difference between π i 0 and π i will be 23 δ i π i 0 π i where δ i stands for the deviation of π i from π i caused by the deviation of environmental conditions from the suitable physical limits defined by the fundamental niche of the ith species eq 8 can be rewritten as 24 r t ln 1 x i μ i 0 μ i where rtln 1 x i stands for the deviation of μ i from μ i 0 due to decrease in mass ratio x i with increasing n it is noted that eq 23 is an analogue of eq 24 following the traditional definition of an ecological niche we shall have π i π i 0 in the absence of biotic restriction which corresponds to μ i μ i 0 at n 1 since n 1 means the absence of biotic restriction this implies that both μ i and π i are functions of n multiplying each term in eq 23 by n gives n δ i n π i 0 n π i the fundamental niche π i 0 is independent of n and thus dπ i 0 dn 0 taking the derivative of each term in the above relation with respect to n gives n d δ i d n δ i π i 0 n d π i d n π i since δ i π i 0 π i we obtain n d δ i d n n d π i d n 0 k k where k is introduecd as an n independent factor in accordance with the niche theory δ i is positively related to n thus dδ i dn 0 and dπ i dn 0 given k 0 we can write n d δ i d n k n d π i d n k or d δ i k n dn d π i k n dn by integration π i k ln n c at n 1 kln n 0 π i reaches its upper limit π i 0 and thus c π i 0 we find a general expression for π i as function of n 25 π i π i 0 δ i π i 0 k ln n comparing eq 25 with eq 9 we see that π i and μ i belong to the same function family which confirms that μ i can be used to evaluate π i 5 3 indexes of space availability the original meaning of a niche refers to a recessed place or a space in a wall where one could set or display items molles 2016 while a thermodynamic system is a niche for its matter items in general n m denotes the capacity limit of a system to hold matter components while the n m n ratio stands for its remaining space capacity or available niche area thus the principle concerning the relationships among μ n m n and π should hold in general for describing the interactions among matter components in a thermodynamic system similar to the interactions among co existed species occurring in an ecosystem the interference of a companion matter component can have a significant influence on either a physical chemical or a biological reaction taking place in a thermodynamic system brown et al 2006 engel and reid 2006 since given c i in equivalent quantity μ i 0 μ 0 holds for all species at all sites assuming that there is no difference in temperature t in plots i ii and iii we can write 26 μ 0 r t i μ 0 r t ii μ 0 r t iii ln n m meaning that μ 0 rt remains constant in the three investigated plots based on eq 10 we can obtain an enthalpy factor for a plant community 27 h r t h i r t c i μ 0 r t μ 0 r t c i μ 0 r t c t c t ln n m eqs 26 and 27 give the reason for use of the ln n m estimated for plot iii to calculate the internal energy factor h rt for plot i and ii the idea behind is that the metal contaminated soil condition will reduce the total quantity c t but not the quality μ 0 of the biomass given in weighted value it is noted that eq 26 only defines a t condition the term rt is an intensity factor possessing the same unit as μ 0 joule per molar mass quantity given rt is equivalent to given solar energy intensity for a site besides t however there are numbers of other physical factors such as moisture air soil properties etc that can affect a species living state a species for an example may not be able to survive at a site under a heavy air pollution or soil contamination condition three questions will then follow when ln n m is used as an index for the fundamental niche of a species π i 0 i how ln n m is essentially linked to the concept of π i 0 ii whether or not it is also reasonable to use the ln n m estimated for plot iii as the average π 0 line shown in fig 1b for plots i and ii and iii how to determine π i for a single species assuming a homogeneous distribution of nutrient and energy resource at a site the biotic interaction at the site could be simply considered as a process of competition among species for a living space then the intensity parameter ln n m could be regarded as an upper limit representing the total availability of a space that can house n m species while ln n would accordingly correspond to the part of available space occupied or inhabited by n co existed species the difference between ln n m and ln n would then stand for the remaining space availability a single species namely n 1 living on an area that could house n m species should have a greater space for its development than living together with other species n 1 on the area the terms ln n m and ln n m n meet thus respectively the concepts of fundamental and realized niche in fact the relation μ 0 rt ln n m derived from thermodynamic functions defines an ideal space for a species to live under a given t condition relating ln n m to the total availabity of an ideal space one may write μ 0 r t ln n m phycical factors t total space avai labi lty under ideal phys ical cond itio ns where the subscript phycical factors t means that besides t other physical factors are all kept unchanged at the most adequate levels the fundamental niche of a species π i 0 refers to a mult dimentional matrix containing a group of suitable environmental limits that are uniquely determined by the genetic nature of the species adaptability to its living enviroment the total space availabilty under ideal physical conditions thus fits the concept of π i 0 as been already mentioned a species shoud have a unique μ i 0 and if the species were not further evolved so should it have a unique π i 0 regardless of the environmental conditions under which the species is living if any of the physical conditions at a site deviated from its defined suitable level one would say that the physical condition at the site had deviated from its fundamental niche rather than say that the negative effect of the physical condition had reduced its fundamental niche level the native species p acinosa for an example was observed in plots i ii and iii and it would be inappropriate to think that this herbaceous plant had different fundamental niches in different plots the deteriorated soil conditions in plot ii fell far below the suitable limits defined by the fundamental niche for a number of native species including the transplanted k bipinnata and p fortunei such that they could not survive in this plot plot iii possessed a better soil condition among the three experimental sites it is thus more appropriate to use the ln n m estimated for plot iii to mark the average fundamental niche line for the native species as it meets better the critrion of suitable physical conditions in addition use of the ln n m estimated for plot iii for plots i and ii is based on an argument that as an important target of ecological restoration the soil condition in plot i could be fully recovered in the future unlike the fundamental niche of a species π i 0 which refers to a group of fixed physical limits the realized niche of the species π i is a variable subject to both the biotic and abiotic interactions line a in fig 1b shows thus such a negative effect of soil metal contamination on π i the heat moisture and air conditions may be treated as fixed values for plots i ii and iii besides the effect of the soil conditions another important factor that needs to be taken into consideration for determining π i is the symbiotic effect of the co existed species line b in fig 1b shows that a positive symbiotic effect may raise the π i level at a given n determination of the mechanism of symbiosis among species and its effect on π i should be of high significance for development of knowledge and technology in the field of thermodynamics of ecosystems the concept of the weighted standard chemical potential gives the answer to the third question regarding the determination of π i for a single species based on relations μ i 0 γ i μ 0 and μ 0 rt ln n m we have μ i 0 r t γ i μ 0 r t γ i ln n m π i 0 where the weighted factor γ i is a characteristic coefficient defined by the nature of the species the value of γ i can be obtained by comparing the biomass quality c i or individual number m i if c i c j among species in terms of internal energy or exergy this work however is beyond the scope of the present study 6 conclusions the observed effects of biotic and abiotic interactions indicated the presence of an essential connection between the growth potential μ i of a species and its realized niche π i the μ i factor is a function of the standard chemical potential μ i 0 mass ratio x i and the total number of plant species n similar to the fundamental niche π i 0 which is an upper limit of π i μ i 0 is an upper limit of μ i at n 1 and ln 1 x i 0 meaning that the same as π i 0 μ i 0 is independent of biotic interactions decrease in x i with increasing n will reduce μ i and thus the same as π i μ i takes into account the biotic effect the derived general expression of π i as a function of n shows that both π i and μ i belong to the same function family the standard chemical potential μ i 0 and fundamental niche π 0 of a species are both characteristic limits uniquely determined by the genetic nature of the species related to its adaptability to a living environment a species possesses unique μ i 0 and π i 0 values regardless of the changes in environmental conditions under which the species is living in contrast μ i and π i of a species are variables subject to both biotic and abiotic conditions deviation of any of the biological and physical conditions from the suitable limits defined by π i 0 due to for examples increase in species richness or deterioration in soil properties will reduce μ i and π i the relation μ rt ln n m n can be applied to describe the integrated effect of biotic and abiotic interactions on the average realized niche π for species co existed in a plant community as an upper limit of ln n ln n m can be interpreted as a parameter representing the total availability of a space that can house n m species the traditionally applied biodiversity factor ln n then corresponds to the part of available space inhabited by n co existed species and ln n m n stands for the remaining space availability the terms ln n m and ln n m n meet thus respectively the concepts of π 0 and π the ln n m value estimated for plot iii can be used to mark the average π0 line for the observed native species in plots i and ii as the soil conditions in plot iii meet better the criterion of suitable physical conditions defined by π0 credit authorship contribution

24508,the concept of resilience can be helpful in describing the relationship between vegetation and climate especially when considering the likelihood of more extreme climate events due to global warming however the quantification and characterization of resilience is a challenge due to the inherent complexity of the concept as well as difficulty in comparing different ecosystems across the globe in order to explore ecosystem resilience to drought we estimated the resilience and related metrics from a series of land surface model lsm simulations with altered climate forcing data focusing on the responses to changing precipitation these simulations were performed in the semi arid region of caatinga biome northeastern brazil results showed that the quantification of resilience can be represented as a function between precipitation variation and gross primary productivity gpp variation we compared the resilience components estimated for different vegetation types which showed differences in the response of vegetation to precipitation variability the study shows the potential of using lsms to improve our understanding of the vegetation response to climate change allowing us to explore possible scenarios that are usually not available in field experiments keywords drought ecosystem resilience land surface model semi arid primary productivity 1 introduction understanding how ecosystems are affected by climate disturbances is key to understanding the effects caused by extreme climatic events one concept that might be used to characterize these effects is resilience which is commonly associated with other related concepts such as resistance impact recovery and stability there is a wide range of definitions on resilience lake 2013 but it is commonly considered as the capacity of a system to maintain its functions under the effect of exogenous disturbances hodgson et al 2015 holling 1973 walker et al 2004 the quantification of resilience is itself challenging especially when we consider the comparison between different systems this is due to the fact that there are many variables involved including the nature and severity of the disturbance ratajczak et al 2018 the variables used to indicate the system state the metrics used to quantify the resilience ingrisch and bahn 2018 and the state and quality of the data gathered de keersmaecker et al 2014 thus there is a need for developing systematic ways of quantifying resilience ingrisch and bahn 2018 and the use of long term and spatially extensive data along with manipulation of disturbance drivers can help improving the understanding of resilience ratajczak et al 2018 ingrisch and bahn 2018 nimmo et al 2015 resilience is commonly estimated by using one or more variables that indicate the ecosystem state in a certain period of time it is quantified by the amount of change that the ecosystem will present after a disturbance and its trajectory to a pre disturbance state stuart haëntjens et al 2018 gazol et al 2018 lloret et al 2011 gazol et al 2017 cavin and jump 2017 peltier et al 2016 isbell et al 2015 zang et al 2014 pretzsch et al 2013 in studies evaluating ecosystem resilience to droughts the change of the ecosystem state is compared to a predefined baseline which is usually the state before the drought event stuart haëntjens et al 2018 gazol et al 2017 peltier et al 2016 using a past state as the control can be problematic since there can be other events apart from the drought that can affect the ecosystem in the meantime the ideal scenario would be a comparison between sites of similar characteristics where one of them suffered a drought while the other presented precipitation values close to the historical mean however due to the nature of the drought phenomenon which is spread over large areas it is extremely difficult to match control and experiment observations such things are only achieved while having experimental sites with controlled precipitation ingrisch et al 2018 hoover et al 2014 the challenges cited above show the difficulties of exploring resilience metrics with data from experimental fields and derived from remote sensing observations a major issue is the quantification of the resilience metrics in relation to a control state when using a pre disturbance state as the control the study is subject to the interference of many possible factors such as if the condition pre disturbance really represents a normal state of the ecosystem if it is under legacy effects of previous disturbances or if other confounding variables such as fire occurrence are affecting the results a possible methodology to explore the estimation of ecosystem resilience to droughts is to use process based models that simulate the interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere the use of such models may facilitate the simulation of control scenarios overcoming some of the difficulties of resilience quantification and thus being a potential tool to test and develop new metrics the objective of this study is to explore the quantification of resilience components for different vegetation types by manipulating the precipitation regime through simulations performed by the noah multiparameterization noah mp lsm niu et al 2011 we assessed the vegetation responses to precipitation scenarios with droughts of different magnitude and duration followed by a recovery period the study area chosen is inside the caatinga an under researched region santos et al 2011 despite its importance as home to a rich diversity of species leal et al 2005 and its role in the trend and inter annual variation of the global carbon balance ahlström et al 2015 the caatinga is a sensitive biome expected to suffer large impacts with climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances small climatic variations have the potential to impact the species richness distribution in the region de oliveira and diniz filho 2010 also an emerging risk of desertification poses a major threat to this biome salazar et al 2007 vieira et al 2021 we hypothesize that the differences between vegetation types as represented in noah mp will affect how the primary productivity within each vegetation type is affected by precipitation changes thus exhibiting different resilience to drought disturbances here we use a lsm to assess how different vegetation types differ in their resilience to drought 2 material and methods 2 1 study area in order to assess the ecosystem resilience to drought we examined an area inside the caatinga biome the caatinga is an area of brazil that is expected to be highly impacted by future changes in precipitation allen et al 2017 the study area covers an extent of approximately 10000 km2 between the coordinates 9 65 s 40 8 w and 8 77 s 40 0 w fig 1 it is located in the semi arid region of northeast brazil more specifically the western portion of the pernambuco pe state and the northern region of the bahia ba state and includes the cities of petrolina pe lagoa grande pe and juazeiro ba this area is located within the meridional sertanean depression ecoregion inside the caatinga which occupies most of the central and southern regions of this biome and presents the most characteristic landscape of the northeast semi arid region velloso et al 2002 the study area is estimated to have 60 5 of its area impacted by human activities silva and barbosa 2017 the predominant and most characteristic vegetation formation of this region is the crystalline caatinga classified as seasonally dry tropical forest and woodlands sdtfw composed mostly by shrublands spiny woodlands and forests dominated by short vegetation de queiroz et al 2017 the predominant soils in the study area are deep argisoils and latossoils in the northern side of são francisco river and shallow planossoils in the southern side according to the modis land cover and land use lulc product mcd12q1 collection 5 most of the area is occupied by open shrublands savanna and woody savanna fig 2 there are also smaller patches of grasslands and closed shrublands the analyses were performed only in the four dominant vegetation types in the area which are the ones cited above deciduous broadleaf forest and closed shrublands were not analysed due to their restricted presence in the area 2 2 the noah mp land surface model the vegetative response to drought was assessed using the noah mp land surface model noah mp is an improved version of noah lsm including multiple options to parameterize the vegetation canopy surface energy balance frozen soil and snow groundwater interaction with soil surface runoff and ground water discharge and vegetation dynamics niu et al 2011 the model was configured to run with a spatial resolution of 1 km in a grid of 99 x 99 cells the scale and resolution were defined based on a balance between computational cost representativeness of the region and the ability to distinguish the different land cover types within the study area we used the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas data for meteorological forcing with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees every three hours rodell et al 2004 the gldas forcing data were interpolated to intervals of one hour and the resolution of 1 km to run noah mp we utilized a dynamic vegetation scheme that was parameterized using the maximum fractional vegetation based on a ball berry type stomatal resistance the dynamic vegetation option accounts for carbon assimilation photosynthesis allocation leaf stem wood root and soil and loss death due to drought and cold stress herbivory senescence and mechanical loss which are parameters dependent on the vegetation types niu et al 2011 the option for the control of stomatal resistance is the noah type which uses soil moisture to estimate the impact of water stress on the stomatal resistance the adopted run off and groundwater scheme were the topmodel with simple groundwater the surface exchange coefficient for heat was based on monin obukhov similarity theory and the radiation transfer was represented by a two stream scheme for the vegetated fraction more details of the option schemes are described in niu et al 2011 the land cover dataset adopted in the model is the modis mcd12q1 product collection 5 friedl et al 2010 2 3 generation of precipitation forcing scenarios a goal of this work is to assess the vegetative responses to precipitation scenarios of different magnitude and duration of drought and recovery periods therefore we designed a series of precipitation scenarios that consisted of a baseline normal period followed by a drought period of varying magnitude and duration this drought period was followed by a wet period of varying magnitude to examine the recovery period following the imposed drought to ensure that all of the forcing variables in noah mp are consistent with the altered precipitation we chose to construct scenarios based on combinations of actual years of data we first designate each year as dry normal or wet according to their annual precipitation over the 1975 2017 period available at local meteorological stations fig 1 the classification of years were based on quantiles of the observed station data compared to the gldas data divided in the three classes dry years are represented between the 0 05 and 0 40 quantiles normal years between 0 40 and 0 60 and wet years between 0 60 and 0 95 we then extracted the minimum mean and maximum values of annual precipitation from wet and dry years and the mean of the normal years in order to capture the range of precipitation variability we further defined three cases of dry most severe magnitude of drought d1 d2 and the least severe drought d3 and three cases of wet highest annual precipitation w3 w2 and slightly above normal precipitation w1 based on the quantiles of annual precipitation this results in seven 3 dry 3 wet and 1 normal years to create the precipitation scenarios once the seven years were identified table 1 we constructed the model forcing data using that sequence of years of data from gldas 2 1 that most closely matched the quantile amounts to generate the precipitation forcing scenarios fig 3 shows how the selected years from gldas are positioned in the overall precipitation distribution from the meteorological stations the obtained classes of years were named as d1 lowest annual precipitation d2 and d3 for dry years n for normal years and w3 w2 and w1 for wet years in order to create the scenarios we created 49 sequences of 13 years from each precipitation class consisting of three stages to represent a situation of disturbance and recovery each scenario begins with a sequence of five normal years n in order to account for spin up and develop an equilibrium to the normal precipitation regime the second stage represents the disturbance event which was composed of a sequence of dry years d1 d2 d3 ranging from one to four years of drought the third stage represents the recovery period in which we used a sequence of normal or wet years n w1 w2 w3 this results in a suite of 49 scenarios representing a range of drought intensity d1 d2 and d3 and magnitude period of years as well as a range of possible recovery fig 4 2 4 quantifying resilience and components in this study we followed the recommendation of hodgson et al 2015 who suggest that since resilience is assumed to have many interpretations the broadest definition should be used which we understand as the capacity of a system to maintain its functions under the effect of exogenous disturbances therefore we assumed that the definition of resilience is characterized by the quantification of its components which are the impact the inverse of resistance and recovery we have also adopted a measure of stability that would be affected by both of these components we assumed that a system is a combination of climatic and vegetative characteristics for simplicity we will focus solely on vegetation productivity and precipitation and that a disturbance is an abnormal event with negative impacts on the system e g vegetation productivity caused by a driver e g precipitation the impact would be the negative change in the system caused by the driver and the recovery would be the positive changes following the impact as the system returns to a normal state this assumes that a stable or normal state of the system exists the resilience of a system would be the characterization of how the system responds to the integrated relationship between drivers and state variables which could be characterized as a function not just a single value we based our quantification of resilience and its components on ingrisch and bahn 2018 and lloret et al 2011 these approaches follow the determination of several indices representative of the pre disturbance state s 0 the disturbance impact s i and the post disturbance state s r here we based the resilience analysis on annual sums of gross primary productivity g p p and precipitation fig 5 so all metrics are calculated for both variables we have constructed scenarios in which we have one or more years of drought thus requiring the consideration of the full impact of the reduction in productivity by including a second value of impact s i this allowed us to account for the impacts on the recovery due to fact that the response will likely change with the temporal extent of the drought next we quantified the values of all indices for each model grid cell for each scenario the extraction of s 0 is simply the value of the last normal year before the disturbance year 5 s i is the value during the year with the lowest state during the disturbance period with the condition s i s 0 s i is the value during the last year of the disturbance and s r is the value extracted from the first year when s r 0 95 s 0 we have only considered situations where impacts larger than 10 s i 0 90 s 0 were considered as a disturbance this is a subjective threshold to avoid small values of impact which would lead to extremely disproportionate recovery values in order to quantify these metrics we wanted to ensure the use simple formulations for the resilience components impact recovery and stability it is important that all metrics used are non dimensional in order to facilitate the comparison between different variables events and regions the impact and recovery metrics were based on formulas proposed by ingrisch et al 2018 and the stability metrics is based on the coefficient of variation de keersmaecker et al 2014 zang et al 2014 scheffer et al 2015 gazol et al 2017 we quantified the metrics based on the graphical representation shown in fig 5 the impact of the disturbance is based on the overall impact in the observed variable relative to the baseline condition 1 i m p a c t 1 s i s 0 the baseline normalized recovery is determined by the peak reached following the drought period and illustrates how much the system has recovered after the disturbance in relation to its pre disturbance state and is calculated as 2 r e c o v e r y b a s e s r s i s 0 the impact normalized recovery accounts for the impact of multiyear disturbances and represents how much the system recovered from the impact without taking in account its magnitude 3 r e c o v e r y i m p a c t s r s i s 0 s i the overall stability is quantified based on the variability of the system 4 s t a b i l i t y σ μ where σ and μ are the standard deviation and the mean calculated from the time series of both variables for each scenario we quantified each metric using annual values of g p p and precipitation in order to assess the vegetative response to the magnitude and duration of drought events for g p p the metrics are v r b r e c o v e r y b a s e v r i r e c o v e r y i m p a c t v i i m p a c t and v s s t a b i l i t y for precipitation the names are p r b r e c o v e r y b a s e p r i r e c o v e r y i m p a c t p i i m p a c t and p s s t a b i l i t y in order to analyse the differences between vegetation types the model grid cells corresponding to that vegetation cover were used in the calculation of the metrics to minimize potential impacts due to soil heterogeneity we only consider the dominant soil type in the area of study which is sandy clay loam to analyse the resilience components of each land cover type we implemented a sub sampling scheme in which we randomly selected 500 observations for each land cover type without replacement and repeated this process 5000 times in order to facilitate the analysis of the changes in the metrics across land cover type we calculated a ratio between g p p and precipitation metrics and extracted the median of the resultant values for each 500 points sampled we also analysed the dispersion between gpp and precipitation resilience metrics using the same sampling method described above but applying linear regressions for each iteration and calculating the 95 confidence intervals for the regression coefficients finally we analysed the relationship between the two recovery components and the impact component in order to explore how the different indices impacted the estimation of the recovery of a system this sequence of analyses was performed in order to develop an exploratory methodology to analyse differences in resilience components across different vegetation types by quantifying these metrics across a wide range of precipitation scenarios we are able to assess the full range of possible drought conditions in our study area this knowledge can inform the likelihood of drought impacts in real world processes in response to future climate change 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis a preliminary analysis showed that there were minimal impacts on all the metrics in the scenarios with two or more consecutive dry years this is probably due to the fact that the gpp reaches minimum values that are maintained even after a sequence of dry years and after the disturbance the rate of recovery is fast enough to reach the pre disturbance state without a clear effect of the multiyear drought in the recovery therefore data of the scenarios with more than two consecutive dry years were discarded so only half of the scenarios were used in the following analysis and discussion first we computed each resilience component for each vegetation type fig 6 this information consists of all precipitation scenarios and presents a relatively large range of values the v r b ranges from 0 to 3 3 in which most of the values are below 1 see the third quartile in fig 6a the differences between the mean and median of vegetation types are more subtle while higher differences can be observed in extreme values above the upper quartile 0 75 the p r b fig 6b shows a smaller range of values than v r b from 0 to 1 9 and the values below the third quartile are lower than the values found for v r b which may suggest that smaller variations of precipitation lead to higher variations of g p p for these vegetation types the differences in the quartiles between vegetation types are similar for p r b and v r b the v r i fig 6c and p r i fig 6d show a large range of values from 0 to 12 4 with values concentrated under 2 5 the v i fig 6e and p i fig 6f ranges from 0 10 to 0 93 and also shows smaller values of p i than v i which reinforces the suggestion that a smaller decrease of precipitation causes a larger decrease in g p p the v s fig 6g and p s fig 6h ranges from 0 04 and 0 82 and like the other components show higher values for components calculated from g p p 3 2 differences between median values of vegetation types the density curves of the ratio between resilience components of g p p and precipitation for each vegetation type fig 7 shows that there are differences as a function of vegetation type we observe that the results from r e c o v e r y b fig 7a and r e c o v e r y i fig 7b are different from each other although both represents a similar component of resilience we can also note that for some comparisons r e c o v e r y i and i m p a c t fig 7c shows an apparent tradeoff for example woody savannas shows a higher r e c o v e r y i and smaller i m p a c t than savannas grasslands and open shrublands the s t a b i l i t y fig 7d shows results more similar to r e c o v e r y b and r e c o v e r y i than to the i m p a c t which may be due to the scenarios structure that induced more variation of g p p and precipitation in the recovery period 3 3 relationship between precipitation and g p p the median resilience components show differences between the vegetation types however it is also possible to analyse the relationship between g p p and precipitation components with regressions which provides information about the sensitivity of the vegetation response to different precipitation values the relationship between g p p and precipitation resilience components describes how the vegetation responds to drought and its posterior recovery fig a 11 the relationship between v r b and p r b fig a 11a shows that the overall increase of g p p after disturbance is larger than the increase of precipitation in other words a smaller increase of precipitation is related to a larger increase of g p p it is possible to observe that the observations are more dispersed and a high concentration of points in a region close to v r b and p r b values of 1 showing a tendency for these points to be slightly below the 1 1 line which would indicate a decreased sensitivity of g p p to precipitation increases fig a 11a assessing the relationship between the v r i and p r i fig a 11b may be more appropriate with median estimates since there is a high concentration of paired observations within a small range of values the v i and p i fig a 11c shows a relationship where the impact over g p p is more sensitive to precipitation decreases so small decreases of precipitation is related to a larger reduction in g p p in the case of v s and p s fig a 11d there is a more linear relationship with a higher sensitivity of g p p to precipitation this implies that g p p varies more than precipitation in this system by performing a simple linear regression for each iteration of the random sampling for each vegetation type we created a range of possible regressions between g p p and precipitation components for each vegetation type fig 8 the regressions can help analyse different relationships between g p p and precipitation for each vegetation type across the precipitation regimes the intercept and slope of the linear regression represent the effect of precipitation over the system state g p p from low to high precipitation impact or recovery the regressions between v r b and p r b fig 8a show that the different vegetation types have a generally similar behaviour it is possible to observe that all of them have less g p p sensitivity to precipitation increase values under the dotted line when values are close to 0 they all exhibit increased sensitivity to precipitation increases values above the dotted line at higher values there are subtle differences between vegetation types especially in the case of savannas which present less sensitivity to higher precipitation increases grasslands show less sensitivity to lower precipitation variations and higher sensitivity to higher precipitation variations the relationship between v r i and p r i fig 8b shows a different result in comparison to the baseline normalized components fig 8a in this case the regressions point to a reduced sensitivity of g p p to precipitation increases in which the most discernible differences are shown for woody savannas with higher sensitivity to precipitation and savannas with lower sensitivity it is worth noting that the scatter plot of v r i and p r i from fig a 11b shows a high density of points and possibly are not as appropriate to be analysed by a regression in comparison to v r b and p r b fig 8a which clearly shows a linear dispersion the regression between v i and p i fig 8c shows larger differences for savannas and woody savannas in comparison to grasslands and open shrublands the first two vegetation types show reduced sensitivity of g p p to smaller precipitation decreases and higher sensitivity to larger precipitation increases in the case of v s and p s fig 8d the differences between vegetation types are very subtle for all values of p s the regressions also shows that g p p is less stable than the precipitation more variation of precipitation means even more variation in g p p this corroborates the results from the baseline normalized recovery fig 8a and impact components fig 8c that show an increasing sensitivity of g p p as precipitation has an increased variability the linear regressions were used to perform an analysis of the relationships between g p p and precipitation variations 3 4 differences between regression coefficients of vegetation types by observing the coefficients of the linear regressions we can analyse how the variation of g p p values are related to a range of precipitation changes fig 9 the intercept represents the variation of g p p when the variation of precipitation is zero which can be useful to analyse the effect of low variations of precipitation over the g p p the slope can be useful to analyse how the g p p variation changes with the precipitation a slope greater than one indicates that the vegetation shows a higher sensitivity to precipitation the coefficients of the regression between v r b and p r b fig 9a and e show differences between the intercept and slope of grasslands with the other vegetation types the grasslands show a smaller intercept and higher slope in comparison to all other vegetation types while the slope for savannas is the lower of all vegetation types this indicates that savannas present decreased sensitivity to precipitation increases after a drought and therefore have less capacity to recover from this disturbance the differences found for v r i and p r i fig 9b and f regressions coefficients are not clear the density curves shows similar values among all vegetation types larger differences were found in the coefficients of the regressions between v i and p i fig 9c and g where the intercept shows that woody savannas and savannas are more resistant suffer less impact than open shrublands and grasslands in the case of smaller precipitation decreases woody savannas presents higher slope than grasslands and open shrublands implying that they are less resistant to drought as the precipitation decrease becomes more pronounced in other words the intercept and slope suggest that woody savannas are more resistant to mild droughts and less resistant to more intense droughts the v s and p s fig 9d and h regressions show differences in the intercept between woody savannas against savannas and grasslands and open shrublands against grasslands the woody savannas and open shrublands are less stable in cases when the variation of precipitation are smaller the slope indicates that open shrublands are more stable smaller slope than grasslands in cases when the precipitation variations are higher 3 5 relationship between i m p a c t and r e c o v e r y the differences between the recovery components of the vegetation types can be represented in different ways in this study we used one index normalized by the baseline and one index normalized by the impact from the results above it is possible to observe that the different recovery components showed different results to explore the reasons for this behaviour we also analysed the relationship between the recovery components and the impact component fig a 12 fig a 12a shows that the v r b has a positive correlation with v i this indicates that the larger the impact the larger the recovery which is actually due to the fact that if there is a large reduction in g p p values then there is also the possibility that the increase of this value to be even larger assuming that there is a limit of g p p for a certain vegetation type and that there is no causation between v i and v r b the annual precipitation drives the recovery of the g p p but this increase would be limited by the state of the system at the time when the recovery begins which depends on the impact and the g p p limits of each particular vegetation type thus the recovery can be affected by the characteristics of the vegetation and also by the state of the system during the baseline and impact periods in the case of the relationship between v r i and v i fig a 12b there is a negative correlation where the recovery has a large increase of values when the impact is less than 0 25 this seems to be caused by the nature of the index since we divide the absolute values of recovery by the absolute value of impact therefore if the impact is small even if the recovery is relatively small in absolute terms it can be many times larger than the initial impact this points to a high capacity of recovery in cases of reduced impacts however it creates an asymmetry in response to events based on the size of the impact by performing a series of linear regressions for each vegetation type we can observe a difference between grasslands and other vegetation types fig 10 the grasslands show increased recovery relative to the other vegetation types which implies that for the impact caused by precipitation decreases the grasslands presented higher capacity to recover from the disturbance in the case of v r b fig 10a the increased recovery shown by grasslands can be explained by the intrinsic capacity of the vegetation to present a higher recovery even when the impact is higher this is due to the fact that there is no reason to believe that larger impacts provide better conditions for the vegetation to recover especially since it corresponds with larger v i than other vegetation types figs 9c g and 7c we can assume that even if it has suffered more impact this does not affect the capacity to recover it could also be explained by other factors such as the spatial variation of precipitation and other climatic variables or by a combination of both in the case of v r i fig 10b the grasslands had a larger recovery with smaller impact values than other vegetation types however it follows a steeper trajectory until it becomes equated with the other vegetation types for high impact values this diverges from v r b and suggests that grasslands are more negatively impacted by larger impacts than other vegetation types this can also be explained by characteristics of the vegetation or by spatial variation of precipitation and other climatic variables 4 discussion as discussed by stuart haëntjens et al 2018 the resilience components are more influenced by variance in annual precipitation than the characteristics of the ecosystem this raises awareness to the fact that the assessment of resilience should take in account the climatic variables when assessing the resilience of an ecosystem this practice of standardizing the system state indicator by the climatic variables was previously applied by de keersmaecker et al 2015 who created a model relating n d v i anomalies and climatic anomalies precipitation and temperature at a global scale they found differences in resistance and recovery they referred to this component as resilience in different regions of the planet their results showed that the caatinga region has a medium to high capacity for rapid recovery a high sensitivity to drought impact and a low susceptibility to temperature anomalies in our study we performed simple linear regressions between g p p and precipitation variations to take into account the climatic variability fig 8 it is useful to provide detailed information about the ecosystem response to a range of the climatic variable which is not always the same here it is possible to observe that there are differences in how the vegetation types responded to different amount of changes in precipitation so some vegetation types could have reduced impacts due to mild precipitation reductions and more impacts from stronger precipitation changes as the woody savannas in this study fig 9 similar responses would happen to the recovery where grasslands showed reduced responsiveness to small increases in precipitation tending to have higher increases when precipitation increases are larger fig 9 previous studies also assumed linear relationships between the system state indicator and the climatic driver variables de keersmaecker et al 2015 gazol et al 2017 however we observed that the relationship between g p p and precipitation are likely to be non linear fig 8 non linear and asymmetric relationships between primary productivity and precipitation are already known wilcox et al 2017 wu et al 2018 and it has already been discussed that different factors of the landscape and climate can have an effect on this relationship ye et al 2018 future investigations of the resilience components of vegetation should take in account the non linearity and the effect of other climate and landscape variables there are also other processes that are not taken into account in our study for example we do not consider the spatial dynamics controlling the vegetation distribution resulting in the formation of spatial patterns these processes can have long term implications in the micro climate of the area and potentially change the water and carbon fluxes of the ecosystems the formation of spatial patterns in certain ecosystems has already been observed to affect the resilience to exogenous disturbances bennett and sherratt 2019 sun et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 although the formation of self organizing patterns have not been reported in our area of study accounting for the processes controlling the dynamic vegetation distribution would likely improve the representation of resilience in the caatinga ecosystem which does face the threat of desertification salazar et al 2007 vieira et al 2021 our study has also explored the use of two different recovery metrics we observed that different recovery components show different results when comparing the median fig 7 and regressions of the vegetation types fig 8 divergent results from different recovery metrics were also reported by ingrisch and bahn 2018 it appears that the use of the v r b is more suitable to characterize the recovery of g p p as a function of precipitation increase since the interpretation of its results is in agreement with what was observed from the s t a b i l i t y results fig 8 the normalized impact recovery v r i shows a large increase when the impact of the disturbance is low fig a 12 this can be a problem when analysing the recovery of a system since it can suffer distortions depending on the disturbance magnitude the use of a normalized impact recovery metrics could be useful to represent the recovery component as a single value if it could negate the effect of the impact magnitude over recovery values but this was not the case in this study we would recommend that to address the effect of the impact magnitude over the recovery one should simply take into account the climatic drivers of the disturbance event but for that it would be necessary to have a range of possible climatic disturbance magnitudes otherwise the components could still be biased to this point the use of lsms to simulate drought scenarios in a spatial extent can be very useful to analyse a wide range of possible disturbance and post disturbance events studies have reported a negative correlation between resistance inverse of impact and recovery also named as resilience in many cases gazol et al 2017 macgillivray and grime 1995 orwin et al 2006 schwalm et al 2017 which indicates that there is a trade off between resistance and recovery as in stuart haëntjens et al 2018 our study does not support the assumption of a trade off between resistance and recovery in fig 7 woody savannas showed increased recovery and lower impact higher resistance than savannas in addition fig 8 illustrates that grasslands have lower recovery under low precipitation increases but higher recovery with high precipitation increases in this study the positive correlation between v r b and v i may simply have occurred due to the scenarios design where events of larger impacts were followed by years with enough precipitation for the system to recover and therefore there was a larger increase of g p p during the recovery stage the relationship between recovery and impact components are also sensitive to the index used to estimate them fig 10 as the correlation can change drastically we believe that the concept of a trade off between resistance and recovery as a rule can be inaccurate in many situations it is known that the caatinga biome is highly heterogeneous where plant species present diverse strategies to survive under restricted water availability conditions santos et al 2014 therefore the composition and distribution of species in different landscapes are fundamental for understanding the resilience of these ecosystems to drought events in turn this knowledge may help improve conservation strategies in priority areas a study conducted in a national park in the pernambuco state found that the above ground biomass of three plots were mainly affected by precipitation variation species richness and forest stand age souza et al 2019 therefore these are also factors that are likely to affect the resilience of a landscape to drought disturbance the interpretation of the results of this study should take a perspective that they are all generated by a lsm so they carry the flaws present in the model it is known that models are still limited in representing the impact of precipitation reductions on vegetation de kauwe et al 2015 galbraith et al 2010 powell et al 2013 the representation of vegetation classes and its attributes can be oversimplified however the use of lsms provide the possibility to analyse a large amount of data that is not available from field experiments and even remote sensing data sets where lsms can simulate biophysical processes over manipulated forcing data being a valuable tool to explore resilience components worldwide we recommend that additional studies comparing resilience components estimated by field data eg fluxnet lsms and remote sensing derived data be carried out to access the current performance of lsms to estimate resilience of vegetation to drought 5 conclusions the study performed a series of simulations conducted with the noah mp lsm to represent the effect of drought in a caatinga biome an unique semi arid region of brazil we quantified the resilience of different vegetation types to the variation of precipitation caused by the drought and the posterior recovery we found differences between vegetation types by relating g p p and precipitation variations through medians and linear regressions although relationships between the g p p and precipitation components were found to be non linear the linear regression were useful to show a range of aspects that can describe the resilience of vegetation the representation of resilience components as a function between the system state indicator and the climatic driver variable can be used to have a more detailed assessment of resilience in a wide range of possible disturbance and recovery scenarios which can be easily achieved by the use of lsm simulations credit authorship

24508,the concept of resilience can be helpful in describing the relationship between vegetation and climate especially when considering the likelihood of more extreme climate events due to global warming however the quantification and characterization of resilience is a challenge due to the inherent complexity of the concept as well as difficulty in comparing different ecosystems across the globe in order to explore ecosystem resilience to drought we estimated the resilience and related metrics from a series of land surface model lsm simulations with altered climate forcing data focusing on the responses to changing precipitation these simulations were performed in the semi arid region of caatinga biome northeastern brazil results showed that the quantification of resilience can be represented as a function between precipitation variation and gross primary productivity gpp variation we compared the resilience components estimated for different vegetation types which showed differences in the response of vegetation to precipitation variability the study shows the potential of using lsms to improve our understanding of the vegetation response to climate change allowing us to explore possible scenarios that are usually not available in field experiments keywords drought ecosystem resilience land surface model semi arid primary productivity 1 introduction understanding how ecosystems are affected by climate disturbances is key to understanding the effects caused by extreme climatic events one concept that might be used to characterize these effects is resilience which is commonly associated with other related concepts such as resistance impact recovery and stability there is a wide range of definitions on resilience lake 2013 but it is commonly considered as the capacity of a system to maintain its functions under the effect of exogenous disturbances hodgson et al 2015 holling 1973 walker et al 2004 the quantification of resilience is itself challenging especially when we consider the comparison between different systems this is due to the fact that there are many variables involved including the nature and severity of the disturbance ratajczak et al 2018 the variables used to indicate the system state the metrics used to quantify the resilience ingrisch and bahn 2018 and the state and quality of the data gathered de keersmaecker et al 2014 thus there is a need for developing systematic ways of quantifying resilience ingrisch and bahn 2018 and the use of long term and spatially extensive data along with manipulation of disturbance drivers can help improving the understanding of resilience ratajczak et al 2018 ingrisch and bahn 2018 nimmo et al 2015 resilience is commonly estimated by using one or more variables that indicate the ecosystem state in a certain period of time it is quantified by the amount of change that the ecosystem will present after a disturbance and its trajectory to a pre disturbance state stuart haëntjens et al 2018 gazol et al 2018 lloret et al 2011 gazol et al 2017 cavin and jump 2017 peltier et al 2016 isbell et al 2015 zang et al 2014 pretzsch et al 2013 in studies evaluating ecosystem resilience to droughts the change of the ecosystem state is compared to a predefined baseline which is usually the state before the drought event stuart haëntjens et al 2018 gazol et al 2017 peltier et al 2016 using a past state as the control can be problematic since there can be other events apart from the drought that can affect the ecosystem in the meantime the ideal scenario would be a comparison between sites of similar characteristics where one of them suffered a drought while the other presented precipitation values close to the historical mean however due to the nature of the drought phenomenon which is spread over large areas it is extremely difficult to match control and experiment observations such things are only achieved while having experimental sites with controlled precipitation ingrisch et al 2018 hoover et al 2014 the challenges cited above show the difficulties of exploring resilience metrics with data from experimental fields and derived from remote sensing observations a major issue is the quantification of the resilience metrics in relation to a control state when using a pre disturbance state as the control the study is subject to the interference of many possible factors such as if the condition pre disturbance really represents a normal state of the ecosystem if it is under legacy effects of previous disturbances or if other confounding variables such as fire occurrence are affecting the results a possible methodology to explore the estimation of ecosystem resilience to droughts is to use process based models that simulate the interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere the use of such models may facilitate the simulation of control scenarios overcoming some of the difficulties of resilience quantification and thus being a potential tool to test and develop new metrics the objective of this study is to explore the quantification of resilience components for different vegetation types by manipulating the precipitation regime through simulations performed by the noah multiparameterization noah mp lsm niu et al 2011 we assessed the vegetation responses to precipitation scenarios with droughts of different magnitude and duration followed by a recovery period the study area chosen is inside the caatinga an under researched region santos et al 2011 despite its importance as home to a rich diversity of species leal et al 2005 and its role in the trend and inter annual variation of the global carbon balance ahlström et al 2015 the caatinga is a sensitive biome expected to suffer large impacts with climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances small climatic variations have the potential to impact the species richness distribution in the region de oliveira and diniz filho 2010 also an emerging risk of desertification poses a major threat to this biome salazar et al 2007 vieira et al 2021 we hypothesize that the differences between vegetation types as represented in noah mp will affect how the primary productivity within each vegetation type is affected by precipitation changes thus exhibiting different resilience to drought disturbances here we use a lsm to assess how different vegetation types differ in their resilience to drought 2 material and methods 2 1 study area in order to assess the ecosystem resilience to drought we examined an area inside the caatinga biome the caatinga is an area of brazil that is expected to be highly impacted by future changes in precipitation allen et al 2017 the study area covers an extent of approximately 10000 km2 between the coordinates 9 65 s 40 8 w and 8 77 s 40 0 w fig 1 it is located in the semi arid region of northeast brazil more specifically the western portion of the pernambuco pe state and the northern region of the bahia ba state and includes the cities of petrolina pe lagoa grande pe and juazeiro ba this area is located within the meridional sertanean depression ecoregion inside the caatinga which occupies most of the central and southern regions of this biome and presents the most characteristic landscape of the northeast semi arid region velloso et al 2002 the study area is estimated to have 60 5 of its area impacted by human activities silva and barbosa 2017 the predominant and most characteristic vegetation formation of this region is the crystalline caatinga classified as seasonally dry tropical forest and woodlands sdtfw composed mostly by shrublands spiny woodlands and forests dominated by short vegetation de queiroz et al 2017 the predominant soils in the study area are deep argisoils and latossoils in the northern side of são francisco river and shallow planossoils in the southern side according to the modis land cover and land use lulc product mcd12q1 collection 5 most of the area is occupied by open shrublands savanna and woody savanna fig 2 there are also smaller patches of grasslands and closed shrublands the analyses were performed only in the four dominant vegetation types in the area which are the ones cited above deciduous broadleaf forest and closed shrublands were not analysed due to their restricted presence in the area 2 2 the noah mp land surface model the vegetative response to drought was assessed using the noah mp land surface model noah mp is an improved version of noah lsm including multiple options to parameterize the vegetation canopy surface energy balance frozen soil and snow groundwater interaction with soil surface runoff and ground water discharge and vegetation dynamics niu et al 2011 the model was configured to run with a spatial resolution of 1 km in a grid of 99 x 99 cells the scale and resolution were defined based on a balance between computational cost representativeness of the region and the ability to distinguish the different land cover types within the study area we used the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas data for meteorological forcing with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees every three hours rodell et al 2004 the gldas forcing data were interpolated to intervals of one hour and the resolution of 1 km to run noah mp we utilized a dynamic vegetation scheme that was parameterized using the maximum fractional vegetation based on a ball berry type stomatal resistance the dynamic vegetation option accounts for carbon assimilation photosynthesis allocation leaf stem wood root and soil and loss death due to drought and cold stress herbivory senescence and mechanical loss which are parameters dependent on the vegetation types niu et al 2011 the option for the control of stomatal resistance is the noah type which uses soil moisture to estimate the impact of water stress on the stomatal resistance the adopted run off and groundwater scheme were the topmodel with simple groundwater the surface exchange coefficient for heat was based on monin obukhov similarity theory and the radiation transfer was represented by a two stream scheme for the vegetated fraction more details of the option schemes are described in niu et al 2011 the land cover dataset adopted in the model is the modis mcd12q1 product collection 5 friedl et al 2010 2 3 generation of precipitation forcing scenarios a goal of this work is to assess the vegetative responses to precipitation scenarios of different magnitude and duration of drought and recovery periods therefore we designed a series of precipitation scenarios that consisted of a baseline normal period followed by a drought period of varying magnitude and duration this drought period was followed by a wet period of varying magnitude to examine the recovery period following the imposed drought to ensure that all of the forcing variables in noah mp are consistent with the altered precipitation we chose to construct scenarios based on combinations of actual years of data we first designate each year as dry normal or wet according to their annual precipitation over the 1975 2017 period available at local meteorological stations fig 1 the classification of years were based on quantiles of the observed station data compared to the gldas data divided in the three classes dry years are represented between the 0 05 and 0 40 quantiles normal years between 0 40 and 0 60 and wet years between 0 60 and 0 95 we then extracted the minimum mean and maximum values of annual precipitation from wet and dry years and the mean of the normal years in order to capture the range of precipitation variability we further defined three cases of dry most severe magnitude of drought d1 d2 and the least severe drought d3 and three cases of wet highest annual precipitation w3 w2 and slightly above normal precipitation w1 based on the quantiles of annual precipitation this results in seven 3 dry 3 wet and 1 normal years to create the precipitation scenarios once the seven years were identified table 1 we constructed the model forcing data using that sequence of years of data from gldas 2 1 that most closely matched the quantile amounts to generate the precipitation forcing scenarios fig 3 shows how the selected years from gldas are positioned in the overall precipitation distribution from the meteorological stations the obtained classes of years were named as d1 lowest annual precipitation d2 and d3 for dry years n for normal years and w3 w2 and w1 for wet years in order to create the scenarios we created 49 sequences of 13 years from each precipitation class consisting of three stages to represent a situation of disturbance and recovery each scenario begins with a sequence of five normal years n in order to account for spin up and develop an equilibrium to the normal precipitation regime the second stage represents the disturbance event which was composed of a sequence of dry years d1 d2 d3 ranging from one to four years of drought the third stage represents the recovery period in which we used a sequence of normal or wet years n w1 w2 w3 this results in a suite of 49 scenarios representing a range of drought intensity d1 d2 and d3 and magnitude period of years as well as a range of possible recovery fig 4 2 4 quantifying resilience and components in this study we followed the recommendation of hodgson et al 2015 who suggest that since resilience is assumed to have many interpretations the broadest definition should be used which we understand as the capacity of a system to maintain its functions under the effect of exogenous disturbances therefore we assumed that the definition of resilience is characterized by the quantification of its components which are the impact the inverse of resistance and recovery we have also adopted a measure of stability that would be affected by both of these components we assumed that a system is a combination of climatic and vegetative characteristics for simplicity we will focus solely on vegetation productivity and precipitation and that a disturbance is an abnormal event with negative impacts on the system e g vegetation productivity caused by a driver e g precipitation the impact would be the negative change in the system caused by the driver and the recovery would be the positive changes following the impact as the system returns to a normal state this assumes that a stable or normal state of the system exists the resilience of a system would be the characterization of how the system responds to the integrated relationship between drivers and state variables which could be characterized as a function not just a single value we based our quantification of resilience and its components on ingrisch and bahn 2018 and lloret et al 2011 these approaches follow the determination of several indices representative of the pre disturbance state s 0 the disturbance impact s i and the post disturbance state s r here we based the resilience analysis on annual sums of gross primary productivity g p p and precipitation fig 5 so all metrics are calculated for both variables we have constructed scenarios in which we have one or more years of drought thus requiring the consideration of the full impact of the reduction in productivity by including a second value of impact s i this allowed us to account for the impacts on the recovery due to fact that the response will likely change with the temporal extent of the drought next we quantified the values of all indices for each model grid cell for each scenario the extraction of s 0 is simply the value of the last normal year before the disturbance year 5 s i is the value during the year with the lowest state during the disturbance period with the condition s i s 0 s i is the value during the last year of the disturbance and s r is the value extracted from the first year when s r 0 95 s 0 we have only considered situations where impacts larger than 10 s i 0 90 s 0 were considered as a disturbance this is a subjective threshold to avoid small values of impact which would lead to extremely disproportionate recovery values in order to quantify these metrics we wanted to ensure the use simple formulations for the resilience components impact recovery and stability it is important that all metrics used are non dimensional in order to facilitate the comparison between different variables events and regions the impact and recovery metrics were based on formulas proposed by ingrisch et al 2018 and the stability metrics is based on the coefficient of variation de keersmaecker et al 2014 zang et al 2014 scheffer et al 2015 gazol et al 2017 we quantified the metrics based on the graphical representation shown in fig 5 the impact of the disturbance is based on the overall impact in the observed variable relative to the baseline condition 1 i m p a c t 1 s i s 0 the baseline normalized recovery is determined by the peak reached following the drought period and illustrates how much the system has recovered after the disturbance in relation to its pre disturbance state and is calculated as 2 r e c o v e r y b a s e s r s i s 0 the impact normalized recovery accounts for the impact of multiyear disturbances and represents how much the system recovered from the impact without taking in account its magnitude 3 r e c o v e r y i m p a c t s r s i s 0 s i the overall stability is quantified based on the variability of the system 4 s t a b i l i t y σ μ where σ and μ are the standard deviation and the mean calculated from the time series of both variables for each scenario we quantified each metric using annual values of g p p and precipitation in order to assess the vegetative response to the magnitude and duration of drought events for g p p the metrics are v r b r e c o v e r y b a s e v r i r e c o v e r y i m p a c t v i i m p a c t and v s s t a b i l i t y for precipitation the names are p r b r e c o v e r y b a s e p r i r e c o v e r y i m p a c t p i i m p a c t and p s s t a b i l i t y in order to analyse the differences between vegetation types the model grid cells corresponding to that vegetation cover were used in the calculation of the metrics to minimize potential impacts due to soil heterogeneity we only consider the dominant soil type in the area of study which is sandy clay loam to analyse the resilience components of each land cover type we implemented a sub sampling scheme in which we randomly selected 500 observations for each land cover type without replacement and repeated this process 5000 times in order to facilitate the analysis of the changes in the metrics across land cover type we calculated a ratio between g p p and precipitation metrics and extracted the median of the resultant values for each 500 points sampled we also analysed the dispersion between gpp and precipitation resilience metrics using the same sampling method described above but applying linear regressions for each iteration and calculating the 95 confidence intervals for the regression coefficients finally we analysed the relationship between the two recovery components and the impact component in order to explore how the different indices impacted the estimation of the recovery of a system this sequence of analyses was performed in order to develop an exploratory methodology to analyse differences in resilience components across different vegetation types by quantifying these metrics across a wide range of precipitation scenarios we are able to assess the full range of possible drought conditions in our study area this knowledge can inform the likelihood of drought impacts in real world processes in response to future climate change 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis a preliminary analysis showed that there were minimal impacts on all the metrics in the scenarios with two or more consecutive dry years this is probably due to the fact that the gpp reaches minimum values that are maintained even after a sequence of dry years and after the disturbance the rate of recovery is fast enough to reach the pre disturbance state without a clear effect of the multiyear drought in the recovery therefore data of the scenarios with more than two consecutive dry years were discarded so only half of the scenarios were used in the following analysis and discussion first we computed each resilience component for each vegetation type fig 6 this information consists of all precipitation scenarios and presents a relatively large range of values the v r b ranges from 0 to 3 3 in which most of the values are below 1 see the third quartile in fig 6a the differences between the mean and median of vegetation types are more subtle while higher differences can be observed in extreme values above the upper quartile 0 75 the p r b fig 6b shows a smaller range of values than v r b from 0 to 1 9 and the values below the third quartile are lower than the values found for v r b which may suggest that smaller variations of precipitation lead to higher variations of g p p for these vegetation types the differences in the quartiles between vegetation types are similar for p r b and v r b the v r i fig 6c and p r i fig 6d show a large range of values from 0 to 12 4 with values concentrated under 2 5 the v i fig 6e and p i fig 6f ranges from 0 10 to 0 93 and also shows smaller values of p i than v i which reinforces the suggestion that a smaller decrease of precipitation causes a larger decrease in g p p the v s fig 6g and p s fig 6h ranges from 0 04 and 0 82 and like the other components show higher values for components calculated from g p p 3 2 differences between median values of vegetation types the density curves of the ratio between resilience components of g p p and precipitation for each vegetation type fig 7 shows that there are differences as a function of vegetation type we observe that the results from r e c o v e r y b fig 7a and r e c o v e r y i fig 7b are different from each other although both represents a similar component of resilience we can also note that for some comparisons r e c o v e r y i and i m p a c t fig 7c shows an apparent tradeoff for example woody savannas shows a higher r e c o v e r y i and smaller i m p a c t than savannas grasslands and open shrublands the s t a b i l i t y fig 7d shows results more similar to r e c o v e r y b and r e c o v e r y i than to the i m p a c t which may be due to the scenarios structure that induced more variation of g p p and precipitation in the recovery period 3 3 relationship between precipitation and g p p the median resilience components show differences between the vegetation types however it is also possible to analyse the relationship between g p p and precipitation components with regressions which provides information about the sensitivity of the vegetation response to different precipitation values the relationship between g p p and precipitation resilience components describes how the vegetation responds to drought and its posterior recovery fig a 11 the relationship between v r b and p r b fig a 11a shows that the overall increase of g p p after disturbance is larger than the increase of precipitation in other words a smaller increase of precipitation is related to a larger increase of g p p it is possible to observe that the observations are more dispersed and a high concentration of points in a region close to v r b and p r b values of 1 showing a tendency for these points to be slightly below the 1 1 line which would indicate a decreased sensitivity of g p p to precipitation increases fig a 11a assessing the relationship between the v r i and p r i fig a 11b may be more appropriate with median estimates since there is a high concentration of paired observations within a small range of values the v i and p i fig a 11c shows a relationship where the impact over g p p is more sensitive to precipitation decreases so small decreases of precipitation is related to a larger reduction in g p p in the case of v s and p s fig a 11d there is a more linear relationship with a higher sensitivity of g p p to precipitation this implies that g p p varies more than precipitation in this system by performing a simple linear regression for each iteration of the random sampling for each vegetation type we created a range of possible regressions between g p p and precipitation components for each vegetation type fig 8 the regressions can help analyse different relationships between g p p and precipitation for each vegetation type across the precipitation regimes the intercept and slope of the linear regression represent the effect of precipitation over the system state g p p from low to high precipitation impact or recovery the regressions between v r b and p r b fig 8a show that the different vegetation types have a generally similar behaviour it is possible to observe that all of them have less g p p sensitivity to precipitation increase values under the dotted line when values are close to 0 they all exhibit increased sensitivity to precipitation increases values above the dotted line at higher values there are subtle differences between vegetation types especially in the case of savannas which present less sensitivity to higher precipitation increases grasslands show less sensitivity to lower precipitation variations and higher sensitivity to higher precipitation variations the relationship between v r i and p r i fig 8b shows a different result in comparison to the baseline normalized components fig 8a in this case the regressions point to a reduced sensitivity of g p p to precipitation increases in which the most discernible differences are shown for woody savannas with higher sensitivity to precipitation and savannas with lower sensitivity it is worth noting that the scatter plot of v r i and p r i from fig a 11b shows a high density of points and possibly are not as appropriate to be analysed by a regression in comparison to v r b and p r b fig 8a which clearly shows a linear dispersion the regression between v i and p i fig 8c shows larger differences for savannas and woody savannas in comparison to grasslands and open shrublands the first two vegetation types show reduced sensitivity of g p p to smaller precipitation decreases and higher sensitivity to larger precipitation increases in the case of v s and p s fig 8d the differences between vegetation types are very subtle for all values of p s the regressions also shows that g p p is less stable than the precipitation more variation of precipitation means even more variation in g p p this corroborates the results from the baseline normalized recovery fig 8a and impact components fig 8c that show an increasing sensitivity of g p p as precipitation has an increased variability the linear regressions were used to perform an analysis of the relationships between g p p and precipitation variations 3 4 differences between regression coefficients of vegetation types by observing the coefficients of the linear regressions we can analyse how the variation of g p p values are related to a range of precipitation changes fig 9 the intercept represents the variation of g p p when the variation of precipitation is zero which can be useful to analyse the effect of low variations of precipitation over the g p p the slope can be useful to analyse how the g p p variation changes with the precipitation a slope greater than one indicates that the vegetation shows a higher sensitivity to precipitation the coefficients of the regression between v r b and p r b fig 9a and e show differences between the intercept and slope of grasslands with the other vegetation types the grasslands show a smaller intercept and higher slope in comparison to all other vegetation types while the slope for savannas is the lower of all vegetation types this indicates that savannas present decreased sensitivity to precipitation increases after a drought and therefore have less capacity to recover from this disturbance the differences found for v r i and p r i fig 9b and f regressions coefficients are not clear the density curves shows similar values among all vegetation types larger differences were found in the coefficients of the regressions between v i and p i fig 9c and g where the intercept shows that woody savannas and savannas are more resistant suffer less impact than open shrublands and grasslands in the case of smaller precipitation decreases woody savannas presents higher slope than grasslands and open shrublands implying that they are less resistant to drought as the precipitation decrease becomes more pronounced in other words the intercept and slope suggest that woody savannas are more resistant to mild droughts and less resistant to more intense droughts the v s and p s fig 9d and h regressions show differences in the intercept between woody savannas against savannas and grasslands and open shrublands against grasslands the woody savannas and open shrublands are less stable in cases when the variation of precipitation are smaller the slope indicates that open shrublands are more stable smaller slope than grasslands in cases when the precipitation variations are higher 3 5 relationship between i m p a c t and r e c o v e r y the differences between the recovery components of the vegetation types can be represented in different ways in this study we used one index normalized by the baseline and one index normalized by the impact from the results above it is possible to observe that the different recovery components showed different results to explore the reasons for this behaviour we also analysed the relationship between the recovery components and the impact component fig a 12 fig a 12a shows that the v r b has a positive correlation with v i this indicates that the larger the impact the larger the recovery which is actually due to the fact that if there is a large reduction in g p p values then there is also the possibility that the increase of this value to be even larger assuming that there is a limit of g p p for a certain vegetation type and that there is no causation between v i and v r b the annual precipitation drives the recovery of the g p p but this increase would be limited by the state of the system at the time when the recovery begins which depends on the impact and the g p p limits of each particular vegetation type thus the recovery can be affected by the characteristics of the vegetation and also by the state of the system during the baseline and impact periods in the case of the relationship between v r i and v i fig a 12b there is a negative correlation where the recovery has a large increase of values when the impact is less than 0 25 this seems to be caused by the nature of the index since we divide the absolute values of recovery by the absolute value of impact therefore if the impact is small even if the recovery is relatively small in absolute terms it can be many times larger than the initial impact this points to a high capacity of recovery in cases of reduced impacts however it creates an asymmetry in response to events based on the size of the impact by performing a series of linear regressions for each vegetation type we can observe a difference between grasslands and other vegetation types fig 10 the grasslands show increased recovery relative to the other vegetation types which implies that for the impact caused by precipitation decreases the grasslands presented higher capacity to recover from the disturbance in the case of v r b fig 10a the increased recovery shown by grasslands can be explained by the intrinsic capacity of the vegetation to present a higher recovery even when the impact is higher this is due to the fact that there is no reason to believe that larger impacts provide better conditions for the vegetation to recover especially since it corresponds with larger v i than other vegetation types figs 9c g and 7c we can assume that even if it has suffered more impact this does not affect the capacity to recover it could also be explained by other factors such as the spatial variation of precipitation and other climatic variables or by a combination of both in the case of v r i fig 10b the grasslands had a larger recovery with smaller impact values than other vegetation types however it follows a steeper trajectory until it becomes equated with the other vegetation types for high impact values this diverges from v r b and suggests that grasslands are more negatively impacted by larger impacts than other vegetation types this can also be explained by characteristics of the vegetation or by spatial variation of precipitation and other climatic variables 4 discussion as discussed by stuart haëntjens et al 2018 the resilience components are more influenced by variance in annual precipitation than the characteristics of the ecosystem this raises awareness to the fact that the assessment of resilience should take in account the climatic variables when assessing the resilience of an ecosystem this practice of standardizing the system state indicator by the climatic variables was previously applied by de keersmaecker et al 2015 who created a model relating n d v i anomalies and climatic anomalies precipitation and temperature at a global scale they found differences in resistance and recovery they referred to this component as resilience in different regions of the planet their results showed that the caatinga region has a medium to high capacity for rapid recovery a high sensitivity to drought impact and a low susceptibility to temperature anomalies in our study we performed simple linear regressions between g p p and precipitation variations to take into account the climatic variability fig 8 it is useful to provide detailed information about the ecosystem response to a range of the climatic variable which is not always the same here it is possible to observe that there are differences in how the vegetation types responded to different amount of changes in precipitation so some vegetation types could have reduced impacts due to mild precipitation reductions and more impacts from stronger precipitation changes as the woody savannas in this study fig 9 similar responses would happen to the recovery where grasslands showed reduced responsiveness to small increases in precipitation tending to have higher increases when precipitation increases are larger fig 9 previous studies also assumed linear relationships between the system state indicator and the climatic driver variables de keersmaecker et al 2015 gazol et al 2017 however we observed that the relationship between g p p and precipitation are likely to be non linear fig 8 non linear and asymmetric relationships between primary productivity and precipitation are already known wilcox et al 2017 wu et al 2018 and it has already been discussed that different factors of the landscape and climate can have an effect on this relationship ye et al 2018 future investigations of the resilience components of vegetation should take in account the non linearity and the effect of other climate and landscape variables there are also other processes that are not taken into account in our study for example we do not consider the spatial dynamics controlling the vegetation distribution resulting in the formation of spatial patterns these processes can have long term implications in the micro climate of the area and potentially change the water and carbon fluxes of the ecosystems the formation of spatial patterns in certain ecosystems has already been observed to affect the resilience to exogenous disturbances bennett and sherratt 2019 sun et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 although the formation of self organizing patterns have not been reported in our area of study accounting for the processes controlling the dynamic vegetation distribution would likely improve the representation of resilience in the caatinga ecosystem which does face the threat of desertification salazar et al 2007 vieira et al 2021 our study has also explored the use of two different recovery metrics we observed that different recovery components show different results when comparing the median fig 7 and regressions of the vegetation types fig 8 divergent results from different recovery metrics were also reported by ingrisch and bahn 2018 it appears that the use of the v r b is more suitable to characterize the recovery of g p p as a function of precipitation increase since the interpretation of its results is in agreement with what was observed from the s t a b i l i t y results fig 8 the normalized impact recovery v r i shows a large increase when the impact of the disturbance is low fig a 12 this can be a problem when analysing the recovery of a system since it can suffer distortions depending on the disturbance magnitude the use of a normalized impact recovery metrics could be useful to represent the recovery component as a single value if it could negate the effect of the impact magnitude over recovery values but this was not the case in this study we would recommend that to address the effect of the impact magnitude over the recovery one should simply take into account the climatic drivers of the disturbance event but for that it would be necessary to have a range of possible climatic disturbance magnitudes otherwise the components could still be biased to this point the use of lsms to simulate drought scenarios in a spatial extent can be very useful to analyse a wide range of possible disturbance and post disturbance events studies have reported a negative correlation between resistance inverse of impact and recovery also named as resilience in many cases gazol et al 2017 macgillivray and grime 1995 orwin et al 2006 schwalm et al 2017 which indicates that there is a trade off between resistance and recovery as in stuart haëntjens et al 2018 our study does not support the assumption of a trade off between resistance and recovery in fig 7 woody savannas showed increased recovery and lower impact higher resistance than savannas in addition fig 8 illustrates that grasslands have lower recovery under low precipitation increases but higher recovery with high precipitation increases in this study the positive correlation between v r b and v i may simply have occurred due to the scenarios design where events of larger impacts were followed by years with enough precipitation for the system to recover and therefore there was a larger increase of g p p during the recovery stage the relationship between recovery and impact components are also sensitive to the index used to estimate them fig 10 as the correlation can change drastically we believe that the concept of a trade off between resistance and recovery as a rule can be inaccurate in many situations it is known that the caatinga biome is highly heterogeneous where plant species present diverse strategies to survive under restricted water availability conditions santos et al 2014 therefore the composition and distribution of species in different landscapes are fundamental for understanding the resilience of these ecosystems to drought events in turn this knowledge may help improve conservation strategies in priority areas a study conducted in a national park in the pernambuco state found that the above ground biomass of three plots were mainly affected by precipitation variation species richness and forest stand age souza et al 2019 therefore these are also factors that are likely to affect the resilience of a landscape to drought disturbance the interpretation of the results of this study should take a perspective that they are all generated by a lsm so they carry the flaws present in the model it is known that models are still limited in representing the impact of precipitation reductions on vegetation de kauwe et al 2015 galbraith et al 2010 powell et al 2013 the representation of vegetation classes and its attributes can be oversimplified however the use of lsms provide the possibility to analyse a large amount of data that is not available from field experiments and even remote sensing data sets where lsms can simulate biophysical processes over manipulated forcing data being a valuable tool to explore resilience components worldwide we recommend that additional studies comparing resilience components estimated by field data eg fluxnet lsms and remote sensing derived data be carried out to access the current performance of lsms to estimate resilience of vegetation to drought 5 conclusions the study performed a series of simulations conducted with the noah mp lsm to represent the effect of drought in a caatinga biome an unique semi arid region of brazil we quantified the resilience of different vegetation types to the variation of precipitation caused by the drought and the posterior recovery we found differences between vegetation types by relating g p p and precipitation variations through medians and linear regressions although relationships between the g p p and precipitation components were found to be non linear the linear regression were useful to show a range of aspects that can describe the resilience of vegetation the representation of resilience components as a function between the system state indicator and the climatic driver variable can be used to have a more detailed assessment of resilience in a wide range of possible disturbance and recovery scenarios which can be easily achieved by the use of lsm simulations credit authorship

24509,in many ecosystems especially aquatic ecosystems size plays a critical role in the factors that determine an individual s ability to survive and reproduce in aquatic ecotoxicology size informs both realized and potential acute and chronic effects of chemical exposure this paper demonstrates how chemical and nonchemical effects on growth survival and reproduction can be linked to population level dynamics using size structured integral projection models ipm the modeling approach was developed with the goals and constraints of ecological risk assessors in mind who are tasked with estimating the effects of chemical exposures to wildlife populations in a data limited environment the included case study is a collection of daily time step ipms parameterized for the life history and annual cycle of fathead minnows pimephales promelas which motivated the development of modeling techniques for seasonal iteroparous reproduction density dependent growth effects and size dependent over winter survival the effects of a time variable annual chemical exposure were interpreted using a toxicokinetic toxicodynamic model for acute survival and sub lethal growth effects model for chronic effects and incorporated into the ipms this paper presents a first application of integral projection models to ecotoxicology our research demonstrates that size structured ipms provide a promising flexible framework for synthesizing ecotoxicologically relevant data and theory to explore the effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors and the resulting impacts on exposed populations keywords integral projection model ipm aquatic ecotoxicology ecological risk assessment fathead minnow pimephales promelas size structured population model toxicity translation 1 introduction 1 1 motivation and background wildlife populations are challenged by a diverse suite of natural and anthropogenic stressors contaminant exposure is a part of the human impact felt in every ecosystem on the planet kang et al 2012 daly and wania 2005 wania and mackay 1993 ecotoxicologists and ecological risk assessors work to understand these impacts and to estimate effects of chemical exposure a major challenge in ecological risk assessment is one of extrapolation including lab to field individual to population cross species and cross chemical empirical observations to support ecological risk assessment can be limited by both practical and ethical constraints therefore ecological risk assessors may supplement laboratory derived observation with models to estimate the effects of chemical exposures on populations etterson et al 2017 these include chemical exposure models based on the fate and transport of chemicals and chemical effect models that range from simple exposure response curves to detailed multi compartment toxicokinetic toxicodynamic models ongoing efforts like the current research into using dynamic energy budget models seek to find integrating concepts such as internal energy flows that can be modified by exposure to stressors and linked to ecotoxicological knowledge at the sub organismal level murphy et al 2018 modeling approaches for ecological risk assessment must also link individual responses to population and community levels models utilized in this regard sometimes referred to as toxicity translators that estimate the impacts of chemical exposure at the higher levels of biological organization are most often aligned with regulatory goals for wildlife protection kramer et al 2011 bennett and etterson 2007 structured population models link population dynamics to one or more traits of individuals such as size age sex or life stage the structuring variable chosen depends on modeling objectives and available data and each choice of structuring variable s has an associated set of advantages and drawbacks collie et al 2016 structured population models are frequently used for estimating fish populations based on age or size common modeling formalisms for structured population models are matrix projection models ordinary and partial differential equation models agent based models and more recently integral projection models botsford et al 2019 ellner et al 2016 tuljapurkar and caswell 2012 akҫakaya 2000 size structured ipms have been applied in a wide variety of systems however relatively few applications of ipms for modeling fish populations are currently available in the literature e g liao et al 2020 erickson et al 2017 white et al 2016 the availability of empirical size observations to support model parameterization served to motivate this exploration of size structured ipms for ecotoxicological applications empirical size measurements from laboratory and field studies for fish are often more readily observed and measured than other structuring variables such as age for example age structured fish population models are common with otolith ring counting as an established way to measure fish age yet this method requires extensive training and destructive sampling in contrast fish weight and length measurements such as those used in size structured ipms are collected more easily and do not entail destructive sampling in addition to data availability size driven dynamics are important in ecotoxicological applications and specifically for fish populations exposed to chemical stressors for fish gape limited predation size dependent survival and duration of time spent in vulnerable size ranges are well known mechanisms linking size to individual survival reproductive maturity and fecundity are also a function of size and growth is a measure of change in size all of which can be modified by external stressors barneche et al 2018 urban 2007 divino and tonn 2007 danylchuk and tonn 2001 rose et al 2001 sogard 1997 endpoints from toxicological studies are also often organized as acute and chronic effects on growth reproduction and survival therefore in addition to straightforward modification of growth reproduction and survival functions to fit basic life history considerations correspondence of kernel functions to size dependent chemical effect endpoints make size structured ipm an intriguing formalism to pursue for ecotoxicological applications 1 2 ecological risk assessment context the utility of population models for assessing the risks to wildlife from contaminant exposure has been recognized for at least a half century young 1968 however the adoption of population models for ecological risk assessment by regulatory agencies has been slow in part because available models may not be commensurate with available toxicological data forbes et al 2016 raimondo et al 2018 recently the united states environmental protection agency usepa office of pesticide programs has begun to adopt models that evaluate risk from a population perspective as part of their tiered ecological risk assessment era process etterson et al 2017 the problem formulation analysis and risk characterization of the assessment may be repeated in iterative tiers along a continuum of increasing realism halting if a lower tier assessment suggests little or no ecological risk models are used in each tier and like the risk assessment move from general tier 1 to realistic tier 3 as greater precision and understanding of risk is required for fish the first tier starts with an environmental exposure models such as the pesticide in water calculator pwc 2016 which provides a 30 year hourly time series of estimated chemical concentrations in a hypothetical agricultural pond tier i assessments for fish summarize pwc output by calculating annual summary statistics on a daily acute and 60d chronic basis as the 90th percentile of these annual values thursby et al 2018 toxicity effect for fish may be derived from two toxicity tests a 96 hour fish acute toxicity test usepa 1996 and 30 day fish early life stage els test usepa 2016 the acute test provides an estimate of the aqueous concentration lethal to 50 of tested fish i e the lc50 the els test provides estimates of aqueous concentrations that impair growth and development of young fish and can provide dose response functions for these endpoints during standard acute and els fish toxicity tests cohorts of laboratory reared fish are exposed under controlled conditions to constant concentrations of a single chemical however fish populations in natural waters are exposed to highly time variable concentrations of pesticides depending on field application rates and timing relative to precipitation events effects of pulsed exposures may not be accurately predicted by effects of constant exposures given natural mechanisms that cause delayed consequences and either increased or decreased sensitivity to subsequent pulses thursby et al 2018 kadlec et al 2021 existing environmental exposure models as well as pulsed toxic effects models can be used to estimate ecological risk on their own however when these models are linked with mechanistic population models such as the ipms presented refined population level inferences can be made the ipms developed in this paper use output from established models of chemical exposure and effect we used usepa s pwc pwc 2016 as the example exposure model the general unified threshold model of survival guts albert et al 2016 jager et al 2011 a simplified toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td model was chosen to predict daily acute effects on fish survival under variable duration and concentration exposure scenarios guts has recently been endorsed for use within risk assessment by the european food safety authority ockleford et al 2018 the guts tk td model tracks body burden in fluctuating exposure therefore both the current concentrations of chemical and the exposure history of the individual influence the estimates of daily acute mortality chronic chemical effects on growth were estimated using experimental data and linked to survival and reproduction through well established relationships of fish size with survival and fecundity raimondo 2012 flynn et al 2021 concurrent research at usepa demonstrates the experimental work required to efficiently parameterize and evaluate pulsed exposure models for fathead minnow and specific chemicals kadlec et al 2021 using established models for exposure and effect and readily available experimental data and methods that fit into the current workflow of ecological risk assessors was an important guiding factor in our model development 1 3 the fathead minnow pimephales promelas as a study species our ipms were parameterized for fathead minnow life history the fathead minnow has been well studied in both the field and laboratory and is an important test species in toxicology extensive exposure studies for a variety of chemicals have been undertaken using fathead minnows ankley and villeneuve 2006 provide a review of the fathead minnow s use and significance in toxicology the fathead minnow is a small relatively short lived species maximum age 5 years danylchuk and tonn 2006 native to a large part of north america that inhabits freshwater creeks ponds and lakes page and burr 2011 it is an iteroparous batch fractional spawner such that females spawn multiple times throughout the spawning season with varying numbers of spawning attempts and various inter spawn intervals jensen et al 2001 divino and tonn 2007 explored the impact of hatch time on survival and recruitment by collecting size measurements for both pre and post winter individuals the availability of data on fathead minnow life history its response to various chemical stressors well established toxicity test protocols and the capacity to conduct experiments directly designed to support this modeling effort made the fathead minnow a fitting species for our case study 1 4 laboratory observations supporting fathead minnow growth model the growth model for fathead minnow used for the ipm was developed from a large dataset of growth measurements including wet weight dry weight and length collected from fish reared in clean water for 288 days swintek et al 2019 for the first 36 days post hatch dph growth measurements were collected approximately every two days from 36 dph to 78 dph growth measurements were collected weekly and from 78 dph to 155 dph growth measurements were collected every two weeks from 155 dph to 246 dph a reproductive assessment was conducted and no growth measurements were collected from 246 dph to 288 dph growth measurements were collected every 10 days this data was used to statistically estimate the optimal parameters of growth transitions appendix a specifically von bertalanffy and weibull growth curves were explored for fit within a size dependent growth transition function appendix a includes a discussion on why the vonbertalanffy growth model was found to be a better choice for the model based on fit of the empirical observations and simplicity of functional form growth parameters were determined for both sexes separately because the fathead minnow is sexually dimorphic with males growing larger in size than females appendix a 1 5 size dependent survival in fish the relationship of fish size and survival probability is well established and documented in field populations for many species sogard 1997 urban 2007 houde 1997 as smaller fish are more vulnerable than larger fish to both predation pressure and environmental stressors reduced growth rate increases the duration of time an individual fish spends in vulnerable size ranges and reduces survival probability within discretized size classes raimondo 2012 it has long been known that for species with size dependent mortality sublethal chemical impacts that alter growth rate and other developmental endpoints are important drivers of population growth and can result in reductions of natural populations logan 1986 chemically reduced growth rates can result in fish remaining at a higher probability of mortality associated with the smaller size range for longer periods of time through this mechanism stressor reduced growth rate is readily translated into reduced survival probability within the size structured ipm 1 6 winter effect as a nonchemical stressor the stressors associated with the winter season have a size dependent effect on fathead minnow recruitment in its northern range winter conditions induce a variety of changes associated with lower temperatures decreased oxygen and shorter photoperiod studies have pointed to winter conditions as an important factor in aquatic ecotoxicological applications driedger et al 2010 danylchuk and tonn 2006 lemly 1996 in a study of early versus late hatching fathead minnows it was found that fish that hatched earlier in the spawning season were more likely to survive winter compared with those produced later in the season divino and tonn 2007 they also found that no fish shorter than 16 mm survived winter finally they found that reproductive timing and size dependent winter survival resulted in a shift of the population size distribution over winter with the early hatching cohort contributing greater biomass to the following year s population than their later hatching counterparts the observations of divino and tonn 2007 on over winter survival together with the observations that winter creates a no growth scenario for fathead minnow markus 1934 underly the assumptions for the winter transition kernel of the ipm 2 model and methods 2 1 transition kernel structure ipms project size distributions of populations n z t in discrete times steps n z t n z t 1 by integrating the product of the population distribution and a transition kernel k z z here we use standard ipm notation where n z t represents the distribution of sizes z of the population at time t and in n z t 1 z is used to denote sizes associated with time t 1 l and u create the lower and upper limits of integration and can represent either biological or computational bounds for sizes detailed descriptions of ipms can be found in ellner et al 2016 and merow et al 2014 in brief a standard form for an ipm is as follows 1 n z t 1 u l k z z n z t dz the size distribution n evolves through time and integrating the size distribution across the range of sizes gives the total population n t at time t l u n z t d z n t the transition kernel is usually written as the sum of two components the growth survival component p z z and the reproduction component r z z eqs 2 and 3 show how the kernel is broken down into its components 2 n z t 1 l u k z z n z t d z l u p z z r z z n z t d z 3 u l g z z s z r s p b z b z g 0 z s z 0 n z t dz brief descriptions of transition kernel functions from eq 3 are as follows g z z is the adult growth transition function s z is the survival probability r s is sex ratio p b z is the probability of spawning b z is the number of hatchlings per spawn g 0 z is hatchling growth transition function and s z 0 is the survival probability for size at hatch z 0 we assume that hatchlings are all the same size z 0 before their first day of growth only females are tracked in this model and with a baseline assumption of a 1 1 male to female ratio r s 1 2 the model uses a post reproductive census structure for daily transitions during the reproductive season fig 1 the daily time step was chosen to match the temporal resolution of much of the toxicity and exposure data available for the model most standard toxicity tests for fish like the 96 hr acute test usepa 1996 the fathead minnow short term reproductive assay usepa 2011 and the early life stage toxicity test usepa 2016 are conducted over short time frames and may include daily observations of survival and reproduction further a daily time step allows the direct linking with high resolution chemical exposure and tk td models that predict impacted survival during chemical exposures that fluctuate daily 2 2 definition of kernel functions to construct a model that incorporates the effect of chemical and overwintering stressors we begin by defining a set of demographic functions these functions define a preliminary transition kernel and modifications of these functions are made to explore different scenarios and capture specific life history traits

allometry and density dependent growth response when it was necessary to transform from mass to length measures or vice versa we used an allometric power law relationship specifically we used the function l m l a m l b where l m is length mm and m is mass g fathead minnow female specific values for parameters l a and l b were available from danylchuk and tonn 2006 via fishbase org and are given in table 2 table 2 also includes all additional parameters for each of the non baseline stressor mechanisms used the effect of density dependence on growth is driven by competition over food resources and can occur in all life stages rose et al 2001 density dependence in ipms has been explored previously with efforts focused on introducing density dependent mechanisms for fecundity and survival ellner and rees 2006 ghosh et al 2012 however we were unable to find any examples of specific mechanisms for density dependent growth effects used in ipms lorenzen and enberg 2002 discuss density dependent growth effects in fish and explore modifications to standard vonbertalanffy growth parameters specifically they demonstrate that density dependent growth effects should modify the asymptotic length parameter l and not the growth rate parameter κ walters and post 1993 lorenzen 1996 shin and rochet 1998 via lorenzen and enberg 2002 they provide a mechanism for introducing changes to l specifically they make l a linearly decreasing function of population biomass β l β l g β and seek to find values of g for particular populations and scenarios the linear form of l b utilized by lorenzen and enberg 2002 has limitations in our modeling application owing in part to our size specific formulation of vonbertalanffy growth and also structurally since for example as β l β seeking to derive a more flexible and appropriate form for our ipm growth transition application eq 5 we introduced a few simple bound constraints for our density dependent asymptotic length function the function was designed to minimize the introduction of new parameters to the model avoid reductions to individual size and to have the density dependent effect diminish as biomass approached 0 specifically as β z i n f β z and as β 0 z i n f β z i n f such that z z i n f β z i n f for all b 0 with these constraints in mind we derived the following form for z i n f β 13 z i n f β z i n f e g β β z 1 e g β β where g β is a rate parameter controlling the strength of the density dependent growth response that can be tuned to the scenario inspection of eq 13 shows that this functional form satisfies our constraints a visualization of this function is provided in supplemental figure 1 z i n f is a parameter in both the mean and variance terms for g z z when z i n f β is used instead of z i n f we denote the growth function as g β z z 2 3 2 incorporating iteroparity and post spawning mortality species that exhibit batch spawning do so multiple times throughout the reproductive season with some proportion of the reproductively capable females depositing eggs each day of the season this behavior has been observed and measured for fathead minnow in the field and the laboratory markus 1934 jensen et al 2001 we incorporate batch spawning into the model by reparameterization of the daily transition kernels assumptions underlying our batch spawning module include 1 a defined spawning season outside of which no reproduction occurs 2 each day within the spawning season has a different probability of reproduction based on the inter spawn interval and the number of spawns per season 3 spawning probability is uniform above reproductively mature size but hatchlings per spawn increases as size increases eq 9 and 4 the introduction of hatchlings into the population is immediate ignoring the time for embryo development approximately 4 days jensen et al 2001 in the absence of information on population wide distributions on timing of spawning initiation and resolved data on distributions of numbers of spawns per individual uniform distributions were assumed the set of assumptions that informed the batch spawning algorithm is based on observations on the inter spawn interval number of spawns per season and spawning season length as reported in gale and buynak 1982 jensen et al 2001 and markus 1934 the algorithm pseudo code and parameters used in deriving the daily spawning probabilities are given in supplemental table 1 an example of the output of the batch spawning algorithm that is used in the simulations is provided in supplemental figure 2 post spawning mortality can have significant impacts on population dynamics for fathead minnow observations of post spawning mortality are varied with some studies observing high levels payer and scalet 1978 and other studies observing none jensen et al 2001 gale and buynak 1982 due to significance of post spawning mortality we adapted the standard transition kernel eq 3 to allow for parameterizable post spawning mortality 14 n z t 1 l u g z z s z 1 m p s p b z r s p b z b z g 0 z s z 0 n z t d z the additional factor of 1 m p s p b z in the growth and survival kernel component links survival probability to spawning probability and a post spawning mortality parameter m p s given our use of jensen et al 2001 and gayle and buynak 1982 to derive reproductive parameters we assumed that m p s 0 for our baseline simulations however this assumption could be relaxed and the inclusion of the post spawning mortality mechanism in the model allows for adapting the iteroparous life history to a semelparous strategy through a simple reparameterization of the transition kernel eq 14 and the batch spawning algorithm supplemental table 1 2 3 3 winter transition kernels to incorporate the effect of winter we derived winter day transition kernels based on the following assumptions there is no growth or reproduction during the winter season r z z 0 and survival is size dependent such that there is a minimum size z w i n t e r below which cumulative probability of survival over the winter season is negligible divino and tonn 2007 markus 1934 these assumptions lead to the following transition kernel k w z z g w z z s w z where winter growth g w is defined as 15 g w z z 1 z z 0 e l s e and where winter survival s w takes the form 16 s w z s z z z w i n t e r s w i n t e r e l s e here s w i n t e r is calculated using the duration of the simulated winter season and assumption that the cumulative probability of surviving winter is 0 001 for individuals less than 16 mm specifically we assume a winter season from dec 21st to march 18th totaling 88 days in length so that s w i n t e r 0 001 1 88 resulting in the cumulative daily survival probabilities shown in supplemental figure 3 2 3 4 incorporating effects of chemical exposure a time variable annual exposure generated by the pwc for a simulated agricultural application of diazinon was used for simulation fig 2 pwc 2016 this exposure scenario was interpreted for acute effects on survival using guts and for chronic growth effects using a chemical impact on growth model cigm guts is an ordinary differential equation ode based tk td model that uses experimental data on the time course of survival due to exposure to provides predictions of daily changes in survival probability the r package morse r core team 2017 rstudio team 2016 baudrot et al 2019 was used to fit guts models with empirical time course of survival data on the acute effects of diazinon exposure on juvenile fathead minnow kadlec et al 2021 the acute effects from chemical exposure on survival were incorporated to the transition kernel with a modification to the survival function s e t z eq 17 the fitted guts models were used to predict daily changes in survival by estimating a daily survival decrement s d t which is a decrease in background survival due to chemical exposure the survival predictions generated with guts were size independent leading to the survival function eq 7 being modified as follows 17 s e t z s m i n s m a x s m i n 1 e s b s a z s d t an example of the pwc exposure scenario used in our simulations and the corresponding survival decrements are shown in fig 3 the pwc exposure scenario was also interpreted for sublethal chronic growth effects by estimating daily reductions κ p t in the vonbertalanffy growth parameter κ g due to chemical exposure the relationship between chemical concentration and reduction in κ g was determined using experimental data from a fathead minnow diazinon els test epa 2016 surprenant 1988 specifically fish lengths were measured for six exposure concentrations at the end of the 30 day exposure period which were used to calculate values of κ g for each concentration using eq 11 and assuming the values of z 0 and z i n f listed in table 1 from concentration specific values of κ g a dose response curve was developed with the response as a percent reduction of κ g determined for each concentration relative to the control group see appendix c and supplemental figure 4 the dose response curve was used to estimate daily chemical growth effects based on the exposure concentrations from the pwc exposure profile the κ p t reductions were introduced to the mean adult growth function μ g z z eq 5 as follows 18 μ g e z z i n f z i n f z e κ g κ p t the values of κ p t for the example pwc exposure scenario are shown in fig 4 in the scenarios where we use μ g e within the growth function we denote it as g e z z 2 4 numerical kernel discretization as is common practice the ipm transition kernels were solved numerically to provide a discretized daily transition kernel frequently the mid point rule is sufficient for numerical integration of the transition kernel merow et al 2014 however in this application changes in size due to growth are very small over a single day and have a correspondingly small variance and are thus nearly deterministic a similar phenomenon occurs when considering any species with a small growth increment compared to the time step e g large tree growth over a year due to this behavior a non standard numerical integration approach was needed we chose an approach presented in ellner et al 2016 which used a gaussian quadrature rule of order 3 and the cumulative distribution functions of the kernel component functions instead of the probability distribution functions pdfs that are used a standard ipm mid point implementation see ellner et al 2016 chapter 6 8 another challenge to the small daily growth increment manifested in the modeled transitions of larger sized individuals according to vonbertalanffy growth as individuals get larger their size specific growth rate decreases coupling decreasing growth rate with variance that is tied to the growth increment eq 6 meant that for the population s larger individuals size class trapping occurred this led to a numerically maximum achievable size that differed from z i n f to address this floor values of 1 0e 5 and 0 05 were applied to the variance and growth increment functions respectively the application of floor values successfully addressed the size trapping however with the floors implemented a small amount of eviction presented itself in the model eviction is a phenomenon in ipms where growth transitions take individuals outside of the size range limits of integration u and l eq 1 williams et al 2012 suggest methods to address eviction in ipms one such method is to use a growth pdf truncated to the size range z 0 z i n f for mean growth transitions we implemented this method by changing the growth distribution from normal to truncated normal which successfully addressed eviction unlike size structured matrix projection models where number of sizes classes is determined a priori integral projection models allow for the number of size classes to be a tuning parameter with this added flexibility comes the need to explore the effect of choosing different discretizations for the model we explored the effect of using 10 50 100 200 300 400 500 size classes by running the baseline life history model to look for differences in model outputs based on dominant eigenvalues for the annual transition kernels it was determined that discretizing the size range into n 300 size classes struck a balance between numerical accuracy and computation time and so was used for all simulations supplemental figure 5 2 5 simulated scenarios baseline chemical and nonchemical stressors simulated scenarios were chosen to demonstrate the flexibility of the modeling approach and to explore different methods to incorporate effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors each scenario is composed of 365 daily transition kernels with components modified for the daily context two different chemical effects models guts for acute survival effects and cigm for sub lethal chronic growth effects were used to interpret a fluctuating daily exposure time series output from the pwc fig 2 nonchemical stressor scenarios were developed including over winter survival and density dependence on growth fig 5 provides a schematic for how the stressor mechanisms can directly and indirectly influence baseline kernel components of growth reproduction and survival table 3 provides a summary of simulated scenarios and their features table 4 provides the composition of the transition kernels components used for different days in the scenarios modeled with equations referenced all parameters used for simulation are provided in tables 1 and 2 to simulate population trajectories each year began on january 1st with a population of 100 individuals uniformly distributed in size between the lower z 0 and upper z i n f size ranges 2 6 modeled endpoints and analyses multiple population level endpoints were calculated daily and an annual discretized transition kernel was computed for each scenario and analyzed as well for daily measures we tracked number of individuals n population biomass β average size and minimum and maximum discretized transition kernel column sums which we denoted as α and ω respectively hereafter we refer to α and ω values as minimum and maximum growth potentials because they provide bounds to population growth n t 1 n t stott et al 2011 on an annual basis we calculated minimum and maximum growth potentials for the discretized annual transition kernel as well as the dominant eigenvalue for insight into asymptotic system behavior in addition to absolute measures all simulated scenarios were compared to the baseline scenario to explore how stressors cause shifts from a standard set of dynamics and endpoints 2 7 elasticity of λ with respect to kernel functions the asymptotic finite rate of growth of the population λ is used as a summary endpoint to determine long term growth potential in the model therefore we wanted to understand which if any model components had disproportionate roles in determining values of λ and so we carried out sensitivity and elasticity analyses specifically for each discretized daily transition kernel within the baseline scenario we calculated the sensitivity and elasticity of λ with respect to changes in the adult survival adult growth spawning and fecundity kernel functions our analyses for sensitivity and elasticity accounted for the full spectrum of sizes z sensitivity was calculated as 19 λ f λ k z z k z z f d z d z for f equal to each of s z g z z p b z and b z the standard formula for elasticities log λ log f was used and implemented using the approach of ellner et al 2016 for interpretability we focused on the elasticity values and denoted them as e l a s f 3 results annual results by scenario table 3 are provided in table 5 below visualizations of daily results for total population total biomass and average size are given in figs 6 7 and 8 respectively annual measures of scenario results are provided in table 5 visualizations for annual discretized transition kernels and for daily growth potentials are provided in supplemental figures 6 and 7 3 1 baseline scenario results daily census of the baseline scenario population demonstrated biologically anticipated dynamics with the most significant changes to dynamics occurring during the reproductive season prior to the reproductive season the number of individuals declined as did total biomass however growth and size selective survival pressure increased the mean size of individuals with the onset of reproduction the number of individuals and population biomass increased while the average size of individuals decreased owing to the influx of newly hatched individuals once the reproductive season was completed the non reproductive dynamics continued again with number of individuals and total biomass declining while the average size of individuals began to increase again see fig 6 through fig 8 the minimum and maximum daily population growth potentials were 0 95 and 6 904 respectively corresponding to the minimum survival for the smallest individuals on a non reproductive day and the maximum reproductive day in the simulation for the most fecund individuals over the course of the year the total population showed a net decrease from 100 to 98 98 318 individuals however the mean individual size increased from 39 8 mm to 61 52 mm and the total population biomass increased from 124 8 g to 258 588 g although the total number of individuals decreased slightly the annual maximum growth potential was ω 1 693 and the dominant eigenvalue of the discretized annual transition kernel was above 1 λ 1 622 indicating an asymptotically growing population 3 2 acute chemical effects on survival scenario results the effects of a fluctuating chemical exposure were introduced to the baseline scenario by using the guts tk td model to predict daily decreases in background survival fig 3 dynamics in this scenario were similar to baseline except that during and following days of high chemical exposure there were corresponding declines in the population this is seen most easily in the plot of total biomass where the scenario follows closely to the baseline until the chemical exposure peaks and causes significant decreases in survival fig 7 the chemical effect on survival scenario predicted decreases in final population 53 19 and total biomass 139 83 g each were around 54 of the baseline the final mean size was similar to the baseline the annual maximum growth potential was ω 0 898 and the annual dominant eigenvalue was λ 0 86 with each being 53 of baseline these results indicate that if this chemical exposure were to happen annually the acute effect would be enough to push the population to collapse 3 3 chronic chemical effects on growth scenario results the third scenario explored the chemical impacts of growth on population dynamics while ignoring the direct acute effects of chemical exposure on survival using the same chemical exposure profile growth effects were estimated daily and shown in fig 4 the final population 86 86 and total biomass 224 46 were less than the baseline 88 and 87 respectively the plot of total biomass shows most clearly where this simulation deviates from the baseline fig 7 corresponding with the increasing concentrations in the chemical exposure fig 2 the final mean size was very slightly less 99 than the baseline with an average individual length of 61 16 mm at the end of the simulation the dominant eigenvalue and annual maximum growth potential were λ 1 07 and ω 1 14 corresponding to 66 and 67 of baseline respectively 3 4 combined chemical effects on growth and survival scenario results the combined result of chemical effects on growth and survival led to the scenario with the largest deviations from baseline in terms of population and total biomass the final population 46 96 and total biomass 121 32 g were less than the baseline 48 and 47 respectively the final mean size was just slightly less than the growth effect only scenario and around 99 of baseline the dominant eigenvalue and annual maximum growth potential were also the lowest of any scenario with values of λ 0 57 and ω 0 60 respectively and each at 35 of the baseline 3 5 density dependent growth effect scenario results of the three different scenarios that included growth effects the inclusion of a density dependent feedback on growth led to the greatest deviation in terms of final mean size from the baseline with a length of 59 14 mm and 96 of baseline prior to reproduction this scenario was nearly identical to baseline however after the onset of reproduction as the hatchling cohort began to grow the effect of the density dependence growth mechanism became apparent especially in the daily biomass measures fig 7 the final population 67 50 and final total biomass 160 28 g were 69 and 62 of baseline respectively the annual dominant eigenvalue was λ 1 28 and 79 of baseline and the annual maximum growth potential was ω 1 39 and 82 of baseline although total population biomass and final mean size were all lower than the baseline the population in this scenario will persist based on the asymptotic analysis 3 6 overwinter growth and survival scenario results the overwinter scenario incorporated size selective mortality and a no growth scenario during the winter season that took place from dec 21st to mar 1st as such the simulation began during the winter season and there was an immediate deviation from baseline in both daily mean size and population biomass fig 7 and fig 8 the final population 69 22 total biomass 174 18 g and mean size 60 38 mm at the end of the simulation were 70 67 and 98 of baseline respectively the annual maximum growth potential was 94 of baseline at a value of ω 1 59 the annual dominant eigenvalue λ 1 26 was 78 of baseline and indicated an asymptotically growing population 3 7 elasticity analysis results elasticity values were calculated for each daily transition kernel for the baseline given the daily time step this led to calculating 365 different elasticity values for survival s adult growth g probability of reproducing p b and fecundity b functions for scope we keep considered these elasticity values relative to each other our analysis showed that the ordering of elasticities for the kernel functions was related to the reproductive season specifically outside of the reproductive season e l a s p b and e l a s b were 0 and e l a s s e l a s g so that λ was the most elastic with respect to survival however during the reproductive season elas g elas s elas p b elas b meaning that growth became the function for which λ was the most elastic fig 9 shows these values for each of the functions over the course of the annual scenario 4 discussion the scenarios presented were chosen to demonstrate the effects of different ecotoxicologically relevant model mechanisms including stressor induced impacts on growth survival and reproduction model dynamics and population measures for the baseline scenario were biologically consistent and reasonable the stressor induced dynamics demonstrated the different routes in which the various mechanisms could impact population measures both directly or indirectly fig 10 provides a cross scenario comparison for each scenario to help visualize relative differences in the annual metrics the dynamically changing daily size distributions gave important biological insight not possible with the nonsize structured endpoints such as number of individuals for example within the baseline scenario where the population declined slightly in number of individuals over the course of the year 100 98 yet the dominant eigenvalue remained well above 1 λ 1 62 to explain this we can look to the initial and final size distributions specifically the initial size distribution was uniform mean size 39 8 m m however the final size structure in all scenarios was skewed towards larger size individuals mean size 61 5 m m as such the baseline model indicates that once the population moves towards the stable size distribution the population will increase in the longer term although we advocate for evaluating relative changes of exposed populations compared to the baseline as opposed to using the models to project exact population size if total population is a desired endpoint size structure of the initial distribution will be important to calibrate or gather from field estimates to ensure appropriate estimates 4 1 stressor baseline comparisons simulations results showed the influence an example diazinon exposure can have on population dynamics both directly when acute survival effects are included and indirectly when non acute chronic growth effects are included our scenarios explored each of these effects individually as well as their combined impact see fig 5 the acute survival effects of our exposure scenario were pronounced enough to shift population size growth rates from long term population growth to population decline λ 0 86 there was a minimal effect on final mean size compared to baseline from the acute exposure effect this is due in part to the survival effect being implemented in a size independent manner eq 17 the effect of the diazinon exposure was even more pronounced when growth effects were included as well and λ decreased further to 0 53 when considered individually the non acute chronic growth effects influenced the overall population growth rate but not enough to cause a population decline λ 1 07 another interesting difference between the growth and survival effect scenarios comes when considering relative changes from baseline for each of the annual results the acute survival effect scenario was between 53 and 54 of baseline in terms of final population final biomass dominant eigenvalue and annual maximum growth potential whereas the growth effect scenario was 87 88 of baseline in terms of final population and final biomass and 66 67 of baseline in terms of dominant eigenvalue and annual maximum growth potential therefore the growth effect scenario demonstrates a non uniform response in the annual size structured metrics these relative impacts through different chemical effect mechanisms are important to understand when prioritizing data collection and deciding on which mechanisms to include when characterizing potential risks from chemical exposure both of the nonchemical stressor scenarios showed decreases from baseline across each of the annual metrics table 5 fig 10 however even with these shifts from baseline the dominant eigenvalues and annual maximum growth potentials were above 1 for each scenario plots of the daily dynamics show that the over winter scenario immediately caused large deviations from the baseline and other scenarios in terms of mean size and total biomass figs 7 8 for mean size this deviation shows that the no growth assumption effect is stronger than the size dependent mortality effect since the mortality effect is differentially removing small individuals which would shift the population to a larger average size while the no growth effect is keeping individuals from growing larger the strength of these different influences is important to understand especially in the context of chemical stress response and the exposure timing relative to the modeled winter dynamics the strength of the density dependent growth mechanism is strongest when biomass is greatest so its most noticeable deviation from baseline appears towards the end of the reproductive season fig 7 the over winter and density dependent growth effect scenarios created the largest deviations from baseline for the final mean size metric with the density dependent growth effect scenario demonstrating the largest deviations at 96 percent of baseline figs 10 8 the simulation results provided insights that are both biologically and toxicologically relevant the overall effect of stressors is captured most easily through annual endpoints however the daily tracked measures of number of individuals size distributions and biomass provide the detail necessary to interpret changes these daily measures are especially important to consider when using chemical exposures profiles that fluctuate daily 4 2 the effect of simulation start date and cyclic reordering of daily transition kernels the inclusion of winter and other seasonal effects such as seasonal reproduction provides motivation to discuss the impact of the date a simulated year begins for example in the winter scenario if the simulation begins on jan 1st as it does in the examples presented the stable size distribution for the year will be different than if the annual cycle begins on the first day of spring or the first day of reproduction however as we show below the dominant eigenvalue for different simulation start dates will be identical in any of the density independent scenarios thus far we have mostly discussed the annual transition kernel which in all the density independent scenarios is the matrix product of the discretized daily transition kernels let k i be the discretized transition kernel for the i t h ordinal day of the year and let λ and v be the dominant eigenvalue eigenvector pair for the annual transition kernel starting on jan 1st then k 1 k 2 k 365 v λ v if the starting date is reordered such that the simulation begins on dec 31st then k 365 k 1 k 2 k 364 k 365 v λ k 365 v and now the k 365 v is the new eigenvector for the same eigenvalue λ with the year starting on dec 31st this process can be generalized by left multiplying by the product j i 365 k j for any i 1 365 to begin the year on the i t h ordinal day and the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue λ is then j i 365 k j v this demonstrates that a cyclic reordering of daily transition matrices such as what takes place when alternate starting dates are chosen does not change the dominant eigenvalue greene 2014 however as shown it does change the eigenvector and thus the stable size distribution associated with it as we have seen in the simulations this change in asymptotic size structure is environmentally relevant as different size selective pressures are encountered by populations thus an understanding of the effect of simulation timing on results is important for appropriate interpretation of modeled outputs 4 3 ecotoxicological data availability and future model development 4 3 1 baseline growth reproduction and survival relationships the life history parameters used for the fathead minnow were gathered from a combination of available literature and laboratory experiments this model development proceeded in parallel with experimental support for parameterization for growth and chemical effects appendix a and kadlec et al in review due to this synergistic effort many model parameters were able to be directly measured and validated one result of this was high confidence in the growth transition kernel components however the vonbertalanffy growth function used for mean size transitions is common for fish growth modeling and can be parameterized similar to other ipm approaches white et al 2016 erickson et al 2017 using available literature and through online databases such as fishbase org froese and pauly 2019 the size dependent reproductive function was derived from laboratory data but could alternatively be constructed using mean fecundity estimates and reproductive size thresholds such as juvenile to adult transition size estimates size dependent survival of fathead minnow represented by the logistic function eq 7 was parameterized based on average lifespan size at juvenile to adult transition and the field estimated probability to survive from hatch to adult size specific laboratory or field individual level data to validate the parameterization of our size dependent survival functions was not available given the role that the survival function plays in dynamics experimentation or field observations of survival across a spectrum of sizes would be desirable to further refine this aspect of the model 4 3 2 data to support density dependent mechanisms density dependence can be a significant factor influencing how a population responds to a toxicant resulting in potentially additive compensatory or synergist interactions with chemical stressors raimondo 2013 we developed density dependent growth mechanisms and included them in this ipm model eq 13 techniques to include density dependent survival effects in the transition kernel have been established for ipms eager et al 2014 and inclusion of density dependence survival feedback is anticipated as development of the model continues an ongoing challenge for refinement of density dependent effects is lack of empirical population level observations from which to base parameters estimates however given the large population growth potential of many aquatic species including density dependent mechanisms in the transition kernel will be especially important if the application calls for estimation of the population over longer time periods 4 3 3 timing of chemical exposure and size dependent acute effects the timing of chemical exposure can also play an important role in determining the magnitude of impacts of chemical exposures on fish populations for example when considering only survival effects if newly hatched offspring are more sensitive to chemical exposure than adult fish one would expect chemical exposure during and directly following the reproductive season to have a larger impact than exposure just prior to reproduction the ability of our model to differentiate between timed exposure events is tied to the model s inclusion of size dependent survival the acute survival effects incorporated as daily survival decrements eq 17 are size independent these could be refined to include size dependence through either a re parameterization of the kernel functions during exposure or more simply by the survival decrements themselves through biologically appropriate transformation as a simple example some toxicity studies report information about juvenile vs adult sensitivity in terms of multiplication factors mayes et al 1983 these could be used directly with a juvenile adult size threshold transformation of the survival decrements refining the size dependent nature of the acute effects of chemical exposure should not only improve mortality predictions in general but also the ability of the model to discriminate between scenarios with differently timed exposures 4 3 4 incorporating chemical exposure and effect models of the toxicity data used in our model development the time course of survival data that was used to parameterize guts model is likely to be the least available however van den berg et al 2020 note that collection of these values is obligatory under some standard toxicity testing protocols and while not always included in published sources may become more available as public accessibility of underlying data become standardized in the case where these types of data sets are not available such as for emerging chemicals or for untested species users of this model may look to cross species and cross chemical extrapolation techniques gini and zanoli 2020 gergs et al 2019 escher and hermens 2002 the data to parameterize the chemical growth effect model is available as a component of fish early life stage tests usepa 2016 the pwc and other exposure models have their own data parameterization needs but benefit from current use in ecological risk assessment workflows thus the type of exposure model outputs used here should be accessible although there may be some challenges to collecting the ecotoxicological data needed to parameterize these models the mechanisms included have been chosen to help keep data needs feasible for ecological risk assessors without novel experimentation 4 3 5 model validation in ecotoxicological modeling observations of population level chemical exposures are exceedingly rare since we often do not have access or the motivation to conduct field level experiments that include exposures to wildlife populations especially when risk assessment studies focus on threatened or endangered species therefore validation often consists of checks on internal consistency and individual model components and not necessarily on their emergent results when possible our modeled mechanisms were compared against available lab and or field measures and produced feasible values for reproductive output survival estimates and growth trajectories 4 3 6 data and theory driven model construction ipm developers have established data driven techniques for kernel function construction using various statistical approaches to determine relationships e g merow et al 2014 however when appropriate theoretically motivated continuous functions to model growth reproduction or survival as a function of size are included seamlessly in an ipm framework e g

24509,in many ecosystems especially aquatic ecosystems size plays a critical role in the factors that determine an individual s ability to survive and reproduce in aquatic ecotoxicology size informs both realized and potential acute and chronic effects of chemical exposure this paper demonstrates how chemical and nonchemical effects on growth survival and reproduction can be linked to population level dynamics using size structured integral projection models ipm the modeling approach was developed with the goals and constraints of ecological risk assessors in mind who are tasked with estimating the effects of chemical exposures to wildlife populations in a data limited environment the included case study is a collection of daily time step ipms parameterized for the life history and annual cycle of fathead minnows pimephales promelas which motivated the development of modeling techniques for seasonal iteroparous reproduction density dependent growth effects and size dependent over winter survival the effects of a time variable annual chemical exposure were interpreted using a toxicokinetic toxicodynamic model for acute survival and sub lethal growth effects model for chronic effects and incorporated into the ipms this paper presents a first application of integral projection models to ecotoxicology our research demonstrates that size structured ipms provide a promising flexible framework for synthesizing ecotoxicologically relevant data and theory to explore the effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors and the resulting impacts on exposed populations keywords integral projection model ipm aquatic ecotoxicology ecological risk assessment fathead minnow pimephales promelas size structured population model toxicity translation 1 introduction 1 1 motivation and background wildlife populations are challenged by a diverse suite of natural and anthropogenic stressors contaminant exposure is a part of the human impact felt in every ecosystem on the planet kang et al 2012 daly and wania 2005 wania and mackay 1993 ecotoxicologists and ecological risk assessors work to understand these impacts and to estimate effects of chemical exposure a major challenge in ecological risk assessment is one of extrapolation including lab to field individual to population cross species and cross chemical empirical observations to support ecological risk assessment can be limited by both practical and ethical constraints therefore ecological risk assessors may supplement laboratory derived observation with models to estimate the effects of chemical exposures on populations etterson et al 2017 these include chemical exposure models based on the fate and transport of chemicals and chemical effect models that range from simple exposure response curves to detailed multi compartment toxicokinetic toxicodynamic models ongoing efforts like the current research into using dynamic energy budget models seek to find integrating concepts such as internal energy flows that can be modified by exposure to stressors and linked to ecotoxicological knowledge at the sub organismal level murphy et al 2018 modeling approaches for ecological risk assessment must also link individual responses to population and community levels models utilized in this regard sometimes referred to as toxicity translators that estimate the impacts of chemical exposure at the higher levels of biological organization are most often aligned with regulatory goals for wildlife protection kramer et al 2011 bennett and etterson 2007 structured population models link population dynamics to one or more traits of individuals such as size age sex or life stage the structuring variable chosen depends on modeling objectives and available data and each choice of structuring variable s has an associated set of advantages and drawbacks collie et al 2016 structured population models are frequently used for estimating fish populations based on age or size common modeling formalisms for structured population models are matrix projection models ordinary and partial differential equation models agent based models and more recently integral projection models botsford et al 2019 ellner et al 2016 tuljapurkar and caswell 2012 akҫakaya 2000 size structured ipms have been applied in a wide variety of systems however relatively few applications of ipms for modeling fish populations are currently available in the literature e g liao et al 2020 erickson et al 2017 white et al 2016 the availability of empirical size observations to support model parameterization served to motivate this exploration of size structured ipms for ecotoxicological applications empirical size measurements from laboratory and field studies for fish are often more readily observed and measured than other structuring variables such as age for example age structured fish population models are common with otolith ring counting as an established way to measure fish age yet this method requires extensive training and destructive sampling in contrast fish weight and length measurements such as those used in size structured ipms are collected more easily and do not entail destructive sampling in addition to data availability size driven dynamics are important in ecotoxicological applications and specifically for fish populations exposed to chemical stressors for fish gape limited predation size dependent survival and duration of time spent in vulnerable size ranges are well known mechanisms linking size to individual survival reproductive maturity and fecundity are also a function of size and growth is a measure of change in size all of which can be modified by external stressors barneche et al 2018 urban 2007 divino and tonn 2007 danylchuk and tonn 2001 rose et al 2001 sogard 1997 endpoints from toxicological studies are also often organized as acute and chronic effects on growth reproduction and survival therefore in addition to straightforward modification of growth reproduction and survival functions to fit basic life history considerations correspondence of kernel functions to size dependent chemical effect endpoints make size structured ipm an intriguing formalism to pursue for ecotoxicological applications 1 2 ecological risk assessment context the utility of population models for assessing the risks to wildlife from contaminant exposure has been recognized for at least a half century young 1968 however the adoption of population models for ecological risk assessment by regulatory agencies has been slow in part because available models may not be commensurate with available toxicological data forbes et al 2016 raimondo et al 2018 recently the united states environmental protection agency usepa office of pesticide programs has begun to adopt models that evaluate risk from a population perspective as part of their tiered ecological risk assessment era process etterson et al 2017 the problem formulation analysis and risk characterization of the assessment may be repeated in iterative tiers along a continuum of increasing realism halting if a lower tier assessment suggests little or no ecological risk models are used in each tier and like the risk assessment move from general tier 1 to realistic tier 3 as greater precision and understanding of risk is required for fish the first tier starts with an environmental exposure models such as the pesticide in water calculator pwc 2016 which provides a 30 year hourly time series of estimated chemical concentrations in a hypothetical agricultural pond tier i assessments for fish summarize pwc output by calculating annual summary statistics on a daily acute and 60d chronic basis as the 90th percentile of these annual values thursby et al 2018 toxicity effect for fish may be derived from two toxicity tests a 96 hour fish acute toxicity test usepa 1996 and 30 day fish early life stage els test usepa 2016 the acute test provides an estimate of the aqueous concentration lethal to 50 of tested fish i e the lc50 the els test provides estimates of aqueous concentrations that impair growth and development of young fish and can provide dose response functions for these endpoints during standard acute and els fish toxicity tests cohorts of laboratory reared fish are exposed under controlled conditions to constant concentrations of a single chemical however fish populations in natural waters are exposed to highly time variable concentrations of pesticides depending on field application rates and timing relative to precipitation events effects of pulsed exposures may not be accurately predicted by effects of constant exposures given natural mechanisms that cause delayed consequences and either increased or decreased sensitivity to subsequent pulses thursby et al 2018 kadlec et al 2021 existing environmental exposure models as well as pulsed toxic effects models can be used to estimate ecological risk on their own however when these models are linked with mechanistic population models such as the ipms presented refined population level inferences can be made the ipms developed in this paper use output from established models of chemical exposure and effect we used usepa s pwc pwc 2016 as the example exposure model the general unified threshold model of survival guts albert et al 2016 jager et al 2011 a simplified toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td model was chosen to predict daily acute effects on fish survival under variable duration and concentration exposure scenarios guts has recently been endorsed for use within risk assessment by the european food safety authority ockleford et al 2018 the guts tk td model tracks body burden in fluctuating exposure therefore both the current concentrations of chemical and the exposure history of the individual influence the estimates of daily acute mortality chronic chemical effects on growth were estimated using experimental data and linked to survival and reproduction through well established relationships of fish size with survival and fecundity raimondo 2012 flynn et al 2021 concurrent research at usepa demonstrates the experimental work required to efficiently parameterize and evaluate pulsed exposure models for fathead minnow and specific chemicals kadlec et al 2021 using established models for exposure and effect and readily available experimental data and methods that fit into the current workflow of ecological risk assessors was an important guiding factor in our model development 1 3 the fathead minnow pimephales promelas as a study species our ipms were parameterized for fathead minnow life history the fathead minnow has been well studied in both the field and laboratory and is an important test species in toxicology extensive exposure studies for a variety of chemicals have been undertaken using fathead minnows ankley and villeneuve 2006 provide a review of the fathead minnow s use and significance in toxicology the fathead minnow is a small relatively short lived species maximum age 5 years danylchuk and tonn 2006 native to a large part of north america that inhabits freshwater creeks ponds and lakes page and burr 2011 it is an iteroparous batch fractional spawner such that females spawn multiple times throughout the spawning season with varying numbers of spawning attempts and various inter spawn intervals jensen et al 2001 divino and tonn 2007 explored the impact of hatch time on survival and recruitment by collecting size measurements for both pre and post winter individuals the availability of data on fathead minnow life history its response to various chemical stressors well established toxicity test protocols and the capacity to conduct experiments directly designed to support this modeling effort made the fathead minnow a fitting species for our case study 1 4 laboratory observations supporting fathead minnow growth model the growth model for fathead minnow used for the ipm was developed from a large dataset of growth measurements including wet weight dry weight and length collected from fish reared in clean water for 288 days swintek et al 2019 for the first 36 days post hatch dph growth measurements were collected approximately every two days from 36 dph to 78 dph growth measurements were collected weekly and from 78 dph to 155 dph growth measurements were collected every two weeks from 155 dph to 246 dph a reproductive assessment was conducted and no growth measurements were collected from 246 dph to 288 dph growth measurements were collected every 10 days this data was used to statistically estimate the optimal parameters of growth transitions appendix a specifically von bertalanffy and weibull growth curves were explored for fit within a size dependent growth transition function appendix a includes a discussion on why the vonbertalanffy growth model was found to be a better choice for the model based on fit of the empirical observations and simplicity of functional form growth parameters were determined for both sexes separately because the fathead minnow is sexually dimorphic with males growing larger in size than females appendix a 1 5 size dependent survival in fish the relationship of fish size and survival probability is well established and documented in field populations for many species sogard 1997 urban 2007 houde 1997 as smaller fish are more vulnerable than larger fish to both predation pressure and environmental stressors reduced growth rate increases the duration of time an individual fish spends in vulnerable size ranges and reduces survival probability within discretized size classes raimondo 2012 it has long been known that for species with size dependent mortality sublethal chemical impacts that alter growth rate and other developmental endpoints are important drivers of population growth and can result in reductions of natural populations logan 1986 chemically reduced growth rates can result in fish remaining at a higher probability of mortality associated with the smaller size range for longer periods of time through this mechanism stressor reduced growth rate is readily translated into reduced survival probability within the size structured ipm 1 6 winter effect as a nonchemical stressor the stressors associated with the winter season have a size dependent effect on fathead minnow recruitment in its northern range winter conditions induce a variety of changes associated with lower temperatures decreased oxygen and shorter photoperiod studies have pointed to winter conditions as an important factor in aquatic ecotoxicological applications driedger et al 2010 danylchuk and tonn 2006 lemly 1996 in a study of early versus late hatching fathead minnows it was found that fish that hatched earlier in the spawning season were more likely to survive winter compared with those produced later in the season divino and tonn 2007 they also found that no fish shorter than 16 mm survived winter finally they found that reproductive timing and size dependent winter survival resulted in a shift of the population size distribution over winter with the early hatching cohort contributing greater biomass to the following year s population than their later hatching counterparts the observations of divino and tonn 2007 on over winter survival together with the observations that winter creates a no growth scenario for fathead minnow markus 1934 underly the assumptions for the winter transition kernel of the ipm 2 model and methods 2 1 transition kernel structure ipms project size distributions of populations n z t in discrete times steps n z t n z t 1 by integrating the product of the population distribution and a transition kernel k z z here we use standard ipm notation where n z t represents the distribution of sizes z of the population at time t and in n z t 1 z is used to denote sizes associated with time t 1 l and u create the lower and upper limits of integration and can represent either biological or computational bounds for sizes detailed descriptions of ipms can be found in ellner et al 2016 and merow et al 2014 in brief a standard form for an ipm is as follows 1 n z t 1 u l k z z n z t dz the size distribution n evolves through time and integrating the size distribution across the range of sizes gives the total population n t at time t l u n z t d z n t the transition kernel is usually written as the sum of two components the growth survival component p z z and the reproduction component r z z eqs 2 and 3 show how the kernel is broken down into its components 2 n z t 1 l u k z z n z t d z l u p z z r z z n z t d z 3 u l g z z s z r s p b z b z g 0 z s z 0 n z t dz brief descriptions of transition kernel functions from eq 3 are as follows g z z is the adult growth transition function s z is the survival probability r s is sex ratio p b z is the probability of spawning b z is the number of hatchlings per spawn g 0 z is hatchling growth transition function and s z 0 is the survival probability for size at hatch z 0 we assume that hatchlings are all the same size z 0 before their first day of growth only females are tracked in this model and with a baseline assumption of a 1 1 male to female ratio r s 1 2 the model uses a post reproductive census structure for daily transitions during the reproductive season fig 1 the daily time step was chosen to match the temporal resolution of much of the toxicity and exposure data available for the model most standard toxicity tests for fish like the 96 hr acute test usepa 1996 the fathead minnow short term reproductive assay usepa 2011 and the early life stage toxicity test usepa 2016 are conducted over short time frames and may include daily observations of survival and reproduction further a daily time step allows the direct linking with high resolution chemical exposure and tk td models that predict impacted survival during chemical exposures that fluctuate daily 2 2 definition of kernel functions to construct a model that incorporates the effect of chemical and overwintering stressors we begin by defining a set of demographic functions these functions define a preliminary transition kernel and modifications of these functions are made to explore different scenarios and capture specific life history traits table 1 provides symbols descriptions values and references for the parameters used in the transition kernels the initial transition kernel functions have the following definitions adult growth

regression techniques were used to estimate parameters for the vonbertalanffy growth functions the delta method was used to calculate the variance around the estimates of size oehlert 1992 and analytical results were verified by simulation see fig 1 in appendix a further description including a comparison of vonbertalanffy and weibull functions and the associated set of best fit parameters are available in appendix a growth model parameters used in this model are provided in table 1 survival probability s z is assumed to be of logistic form erickson et al 2017 7 s z s m i n s m a x s m

species life history for fathead minnow a batch spawning algorithm supplemental table 1 was used to estimate daily spawning probabilities within the spawning season the daily reproductive output is controlled by a combination of spawning probability and fecundity in many fish fecundity is a function of body size where larger females are observed to produce a higher number of eggs per spawn we assume that the size fecundity relationship follows a power law c z c a z c b which has been observed in other cyprinidae abedi et al 2011 hossain et al 2012 the parameters c a and c b were determined from a limited set of lab observations see appendix b and led to a range of estimated fecundity that corresponded well to observed rates epa 2006 markus 1934 to transform to hatchlings spawn from fecundity eggs spawn we used a hatch rate parameter h r calculated from observations found in divino and tonn 2007 which led to the following form for b z 9 b z 0 z z r e p r o h r c a z c b z z r e p

allometry and density dependent growth response when it was necessary to transform from mass to length measures or vice versa we used an allometric power law relationship specifically we used the function l m l a m l b where l m is length mm and m is mass g fathead minnow female specific values for parameters l a and l b were available from danylchuk and tonn 2006 via fishbase org and are given in table 2 table 2 also includes all additional parameters for each of the non baseline stressor mechanisms used the effect of density dependence on growth is driven by competition over food resources and can occur in all life stages rose et al 2001 density dependence in ipms has been explored previously with efforts focused on introducing density dependent mechanisms for fecundity and survival ellner and rees 2006 ghosh et al 2012 however we were unable to find any examples of specific mechanisms for density dependent growth effects used in ipms lorenzen and enberg 2002 discuss density dependent growth effects in fish and explore modifications to standard vonbertalanffy growth parameters specifically they demonstrate that density dependent growth effects should modify the asymptotic length parameter l and not the growth rate parameter κ walters and post 1993 lorenzen 1996 shin and rochet 1998 via lorenzen and enberg 2002 they provide a mechanism for introducing changes to l specifically they make l a linearly decreasing function of population biomass β l β l g β and seek to find values of g for particular populations and scenarios the linear form of l b utilized by lorenzen and enberg 2002 has limitations in our modeling application owing in part to our size specific formulation of vonbertalanffy growth and also structurally since for example as β l β seeking to derive a more flexible and appropriate form for our ipm growth transition application eq 5 we introduced a few simple bound constraints for our density dependent asymptotic length function the function was designed to minimize the introduction of new parameters to the model avoid reductions to individual size and to have the density dependent effect diminish as biomass approached 0 specifically as β z i n f β z and as β 0 z i n f β z i n f such that z z i n f β z i n f for all b 0 with these constraints in mind we derived the following form for z i n f β 13 z i n f β z i n f e g β β z 1 e g β β where g β is a rate parameter controlling the strength of the density dependent growth response that can be tuned to the scenario inspection of eq 13 shows that this functional form satisfies our constraints a visualization of this function is provided in supplemental figure 1 z i n f is a parameter in both the mean and variance terms for g z z when z i n f β is used instead of z i n f we denote the growth function as g β z z 2 3 2 incorporating iteroparity and post spawning mortality species that exhibit batch spawning do so multiple times throughout the reproductive season with some proportion of the reproductively capable females depositing eggs each day of the season this behavior has been observed and measured for fathead minnow in the field and the laboratory markus 1934 jensen et al 2001 we incorporate batch spawning into the model by reparameterization of the daily transition kernels assumptions underlying our batch spawning module include 1 a defined spawning season outside of which no reproduction occurs 2 each day within the spawning season has a different probability of reproduction based on the inter spawn interval and the number of spawns per season 3 spawning probability is uniform above reproductively mature size but hatchlings per spawn increases as size increases eq 9 and 4 the introduction of hatchlings into the population is immediate ignoring the time for embryo development approximately 4 days jensen et al 2001 in the absence of information on population wide distributions on timing of spawning initiation and resolved data on distributions of numbers of spawns per individual uniform distributions were assumed the set of assumptions that informed the batch spawning algorithm is based on observations on the inter spawn interval number of spawns per season and spawning season length as reported in gale and buynak 1982 jensen et al 2001 and markus 1934 the algorithm pseudo code and parameters used in deriving the daily spawning probabilities are given in supplemental table 1 an example of the output of the batch spawning algorithm that is used in the simulations is provided in supplemental figure 2 post spawning mortality can have significant impacts on population dynamics for fathead minnow observations of post spawning mortality are varied with some studies observing high levels payer and scalet 1978 and other studies observing none jensen et al 2001 gale and buynak 1982 due to significance of post spawning mortality we adapted the standard transition kernel eq 3 to allow for parameterizable post spawning mortality 14 n z t 1 l u g z z s z 1 m p s p b z r s p b z b z g 0 z s z 0 n z t d z the additional factor of 1 m p s p b z in the growth and survival kernel component links survival probability to spawning probability and a post spawning mortality parameter m p s given our use of jensen et al 2001 and gayle and buynak 1982 to derive reproductive parameters we assumed that m p s 0 for our baseline simulations however this assumption could be relaxed and the inclusion of the post spawning mortality mechanism in the model allows for adapting the iteroparous life history to a semelparous strategy through a simple reparameterization of the transition kernel eq 14 and the batch spawning algorithm supplemental table 1 2 3 3 winter transition kernels to incorporate the effect of winter we derived winter day transition kernels based on the following assumptions there is no growth or reproduction during the winter season r z z 0 and survival is size dependent such that there is a minimum size z w i n t e r below which cumulative probability of survival over the winter season is negligible divino and tonn 2007 markus 1934 these assumptions lead to the following transition kernel k w z z g w z z s w z where winter growth g w is defined as 15 g w z z 1 z z 0 e l s e and where winter survival s w takes the form 16 s w z s z z z w i n t e r s w i n t e r e l s e here s w i n t e r is calculated using the duration of the simulated winter season and assumption that the cumulative probability of surviving winter is 0 001 for individuals less than 16 mm specifically we assume a winter season from dec 21st to march 18th totaling 88 days in length so that s w i n t e r 0 001 1 88 resulting in the cumulative daily survival probabilities shown in supplemental figure 3 2 3 4 incorporating effects of chemical exposure a time variable annual exposure generated by the pwc for a simulated agricultural application of diazinon was used for simulation fig 2 pwc 2016 this exposure scenario was interpreted for acute effects on survival using guts and for chronic growth effects using a chemical impact on growth model cigm guts is an ordinary differential equation ode based tk td model that uses experimental data on the time course of survival due to exposure to provides predictions of daily changes in survival probability the r package morse r core team 2017 rstudio team 2016 baudrot et al 2019 was used to fit guts models with empirical time course of survival data on the acute effects of diazinon exposure on juvenile fathead minnow kadlec et al 2021 the acute effects from chemical exposure on survival were incorporated to the transition kernel with a modification to the survival function s e t z eq 17 the fitted guts models were used to predict daily changes in survival by estimating a daily survival decrement s d t which is a decrease in background survival due to chemical exposure the survival predictions generated with guts were size independent leading to the survival function eq 7 being modified as follows 17 s e t z s m i n s m a x s m i n 1 e s b s a z s d t an example of the pwc exposure scenario used in our simulations and the corresponding survival decrements are shown in fig 3 the pwc exposure scenario was also interpreted for sublethal chronic growth effects by estimating daily reductions κ p t in the vonbertalanffy growth parameter κ g due to chemical exposure the relationship between chemical concentration and reduction in κ g was determined using experimental data from a fathead minnow diazinon els test epa 2016 surprenant 1988 specifically fish lengths were measured for six exposure concentrations at the end of the 30 day exposure period which were used to calculate values of κ g for each concentration using eq 11 and assuming the values of z 0 and z i n f listed in table 1 from concentration specific values of κ g a dose response curve was developed with the response as a percent reduction of κ g determined for each concentration relative to the control group see appendix c and supplemental figure 4 the dose response curve was used to estimate daily chemical growth effects based on the exposure concentrations from the pwc exposure profile the κ p t reductions were introduced to the mean adult growth function μ g z z eq 5 as follows 18 μ g e z z i n f z i n f z e κ g κ p t the values of κ p t for the example pwc exposure scenario are shown in fig 4 in the scenarios where we use μ g e within the growth function we denote it as g e z z 2 4 numerical kernel discretization as is common practice the ipm transition kernels were solved numerically to provide a discretized daily transition kernel frequently the mid point rule is sufficient for numerical integration of the transition kernel merow et al 2014 however in this application changes in size due to growth are very small over a single day and have a correspondingly small variance and are thus nearly deterministic a similar phenomenon occurs when considering any species with a small growth increment compared to the time step e g large tree growth over a year due to this behavior a non standard numerical integration approach was needed we chose an approach presented in ellner et al 2016 which used a gaussian quadrature rule of order 3 and the cumulative distribution functions of the kernel component functions instead of the probability distribution functions pdfs that are used a standard ipm mid point implementation see ellner et al 2016 chapter 6 8 another challenge to the small daily growth increment manifested in the modeled transitions of larger sized individuals according to vonbertalanffy growth as individuals get larger their size specific growth rate decreases coupling decreasing growth rate with variance that is tied to the growth increment eq 6 meant that for the population s larger individuals size class trapping occurred this led to a numerically maximum achievable size that differed from z i n f to address this floor values of 1 0e 5 and 0 05 were applied to the variance and growth increment functions respectively the application of floor values successfully addressed the size trapping however with the floors implemented a small amount of eviction presented itself in the model eviction is a phenomenon in ipms where growth transitions take individuals outside of the size range limits of integration u and l eq 1 williams et al 2012 suggest methods to address eviction in ipms one such method is to use a growth pdf truncated to the size range z 0 z i n f for mean growth transitions we implemented this method by changing the growth distribution from normal to truncated normal which successfully addressed eviction unlike size structured matrix projection models where number of sizes classes is determined a priori integral projection models allow for the number of size classes to be a tuning parameter with this added flexibility comes the need to explore the effect of choosing different discretizations for the model we explored the effect of using 10 50 100 200 300 400 500 size classes by running the baseline life history model to look for differences in model outputs based on dominant eigenvalues for the annual transition kernels it was determined that discretizing the size range into n 300 size classes struck a balance between numerical accuracy and computation time and so was used for all simulations supplemental figure 5 2 5 simulated scenarios baseline chemical and nonchemical stressors simulated scenarios were chosen to demonstrate the flexibility of the modeling approach and to explore different methods to incorporate effects of chemical and nonchemical stressors each scenario is composed of 365 daily transition kernels with components modified for the daily context two different chemical effects models guts for acute survival effects and cigm for sub lethal chronic growth effects were used to interpret a fluctuating daily exposure time series output from the pwc fig 2 nonchemical stressor scenarios were developed including over winter survival and density dependence on growth fig 5 provides a schematic for how the stressor mechanisms can directly and indirectly influence baseline kernel components of growth reproduction and survival table 3 provides a summary of simulated scenarios and their features table 4 provides the composition of the transition kernels components used for different days in the scenarios modeled with equations referenced all parameters used for simulation are provided in tables 1 and 2 to simulate population trajectories each year began on january 1st with a population of 100 individuals uniformly distributed in size between the lower z 0 and upper z i n f size ranges 2 6 modeled endpoints and analyses multiple population level endpoints were calculated daily and an annual discretized transition kernel was computed for each scenario and analyzed as well for daily measures we tracked number of individuals n population biomass β average size and minimum and maximum discretized transition kernel column sums which we denoted as α and ω respectively hereafter we refer to α and ω values as minimum and maximum growth potentials because they provide bounds to population growth n t 1 n t stott et al 2011 on an annual basis we calculated minimum and maximum growth potentials for the discretized annual transition kernel as well as the dominant eigenvalue for insight into asymptotic system behavior in addition to absolute measures all simulated scenarios were compared to the baseline scenario to explore how stressors cause shifts from a standard set of dynamics and endpoints 2 7 elasticity of λ with respect to kernel functions the asymptotic finite rate of growth of the population λ is used as a summary endpoint to determine long term growth potential in the model therefore we wanted to understand which if any model components had disproportionate roles in determining values of λ and so we carried out sensitivity and elasticity analyses specifically for each discretized daily transition kernel within the baseline scenario we calculated the sensitivity and elasticity of λ with respect to changes in the adult survival adult growth spawning and fecundity kernel functions our analyses for sensitivity and elasticity accounted for the full spectrum of sizes z sensitivity was calculated as 19 λ f λ k z z k z z f d z d z for f equal to each of s z g z z p b z and b z the standard formula for elasticities log λ log f was used and implemented using the approach of ellner et al 2016 for interpretability we focused on the elasticity values and denoted them as e l a s f 3 results annual results by scenario table 3 are provided in table 5 below visualizations of daily results for total population total biomass and average size are given in figs 6 7 and 8 respectively annual measures of scenario results are provided in table 5 visualizations for annual discretized transition kernels and for daily growth potentials are provided in supplemental figures 6 and 7 3 1 baseline scenario results daily census of the baseline scenario population demonstrated biologically anticipated dynamics with the most significant changes to dynamics occurring during the reproductive season prior to the reproductive season the number of individuals declined as did total biomass however growth and size selective survival pressure increased the mean size of individuals with the onset of reproduction the number of individuals and population biomass increased while the average size of individuals decreased owing to the influx of newly hatched individuals once the reproductive season was completed the non reproductive dynamics continued again with number of individuals and total biomass declining while the average size of individuals began to increase again see fig 6 through fig 8 the minimum and maximum daily population growth potentials were 0 95 and 6 904 respectively corresponding to the minimum survival for the smallest individuals on a non reproductive day and the maximum reproductive day in the simulation for the most fecund individuals over the course of the year the total population showed a net decrease from 100 to 98 98 318 individuals however the mean individual size increased from 39 8 mm to 61 52 mm and the total population biomass increased from 124 8 g to 258 588 g although the total number of individuals decreased slightly the annual maximum growth potential was ω 1 693 and the dominant eigenvalue of the discretized annual transition kernel was above 1 λ 1 622 indicating an asymptotically growing population 3 2 acute chemical effects on survival scenario results the effects of a fluctuating chemical exposure were introduced to the baseline scenario by using the guts tk td model to predict daily decreases in background survival fig 3 dynamics in this scenario were similar to baseline except that during and following days of high chemical exposure there were corresponding declines in the population this is seen most easily in the plot of total biomass where the scenario follows closely to the baseline until the chemical exposure peaks and causes significant decreases in survival fig 7 the chemical effect on survival scenario predicted decreases in final population 53 19 and total biomass 139 83 g each were around 54 of the baseline the final mean size was similar to the baseline the annual maximum growth potential was ω 0 898 and the annual dominant eigenvalue was λ 0 86 with each being 53 of baseline these results indicate that if this chemical exposure were to happen annually the acute effect would be enough to push the population to collapse 3 3 chronic chemical effects on growth scenario results the third scenario explored the chemical impacts of growth on population dynamics while ignoring the direct acute effects of chemical exposure on survival using the same chemical exposure profile growth effects were estimated daily and shown in fig 4 the final population 86 86 and total biomass 224 46 were less than the baseline 88 and 87 respectively the plot of total biomass shows most clearly where this simulation deviates from the baseline fig 7 corresponding with the increasing concentrations in the chemical exposure fig 2 the final mean size was very slightly less 99 than the baseline with an average individual length of 61 16 mm at the end of the simulation the dominant eigenvalue and annual maximum growth potential were λ 1 07 and ω 1 14 corresponding to 66 and 67 of baseline respectively 3 4 combined chemical effects on growth and survival scenario results the combined result of chemical effects on growth and survival led to the scenario with the largest deviations from baseline in terms of population and total biomass the final population 46 96 and total biomass 121 32 g were less than the baseline 48 and 47 respectively the final mean size was just slightly less than the growth effect only scenario and around 99 of baseline the dominant eigenvalue and annual maximum growth potential were also the lowest of any scenario with values of λ 0 57 and ω 0 60 respectively and each at 35 of the baseline 3 5 density dependent growth effect scenario results of the three different scenarios that included growth effects the inclusion of a density dependent feedback on growth led to the greatest deviation in terms of final mean size from the baseline with a length of 59 14 mm and 96 of baseline prior to reproduction this scenario was nearly identical to baseline however after the onset of reproduction as the hatchling cohort began to grow the effect of the density dependence growth mechanism became apparent especially in the daily biomass measures fig 7 the final population 67 50 and final total biomass 160 28 g were 69 and 62 of baseline respectively the annual dominant eigenvalue was λ 1 28 and 79 of baseline and the annual maximum growth potential was ω 1 39 and 82 of baseline although total population biomass and final mean size were all lower than the baseline the population in this scenario will persist based on the asymptotic analysis 3 6 overwinter growth and survival scenario results the overwinter scenario incorporated size selective mortality and a no growth scenario during the winter season that took place from dec 21st to mar 1st as such the simulation began during the winter season and there was an immediate deviation from baseline in both daily mean size and population biomass fig 7 and fig 8 the final population 69 22 total biomass 174 18 g and mean size 60 38 mm at the end of the simulation were 70 67 and 98 of baseline respectively the annual maximum growth potential was 94 of baseline at a value of ω 1 59 the annual dominant eigenvalue λ 1 26 was 78 of baseline and indicated an asymptotically growing population 3 7 elasticity analysis results elasticity values were calculated for each daily transition kernel for the baseline given the daily time step this led to calculating 365 different elasticity values for survival s adult growth g probability of reproducing p b and fecundity b functions for scope we keep considered these elasticity values relative to each other our analysis showed that the ordering of elasticities for the kernel functions was related to the reproductive season specifically outside of the reproductive season e l a s p b and e l a s b were 0 and e l a s s e l a s g so that λ was the most elastic with respect to survival however during the reproductive season elas g elas s elas p b elas b meaning that growth became the function for which λ was the most elastic fig 9 shows these values for each of the functions over the course of the annual scenario 4 discussion the scenarios presented were chosen to demonstrate the effects of different ecotoxicologically relevant model mechanisms including stressor induced impacts on growth survival and reproduction model dynamics and population measures for the baseline scenario were biologically consistent and reasonable the stressor induced dynamics demonstrated the different routes in which the various mechanisms could impact population measures both directly or indirectly fig 10 provides a cross scenario comparison for each scenario to help visualize relative differences in the annual metrics the dynamically changing daily size distributions gave important biological insight not possible with the nonsize structured endpoints such as number of individuals for example within the baseline scenario where the population declined slightly in number of individuals over the course of the year 100 98 yet the dominant eigenvalue remained well above 1 λ 1 62 to explain this we can look to the initial and final size distributions specifically the initial size distribution was uniform mean size 39 8 m m however the final size structure in all scenarios was skewed towards larger size individuals mean size 61 5 m m as such the baseline model indicates that once the population moves towards the stable size distribution the population will increase in the longer term although we advocate for evaluating relative changes of exposed populations compared to the baseline as opposed to using the models to project exact population size if total population is a desired endpoint size structure of the initial distribution will be important to calibrate or gather from field estimates to ensure appropriate estimates 4 1 stressor baseline comparisons simulations results showed the influence an example diazinon exposure can have on population dynamics both directly when acute survival effects are included and indirectly when non acute chronic growth effects are included our scenarios explored each of these effects individually as well as their combined impact see fig 5 the acute survival effects of our exposure scenario were pronounced enough to shift population size growth rates from long term population growth to population decline λ 0 86 there was a minimal effect on final mean size compared to baseline from the acute exposure effect this is due in part to the survival effect being implemented in a size independent manner eq 17 the effect of the diazinon exposure was even more pronounced when growth effects were included as well and λ decreased further to 0 53 when considered individually the non acute chronic growth effects influenced the overall population growth rate but not enough to cause a population decline λ 1 07 another interesting difference between the growth and survival effect scenarios comes when considering relative changes from baseline for each of the annual results the acute survival effect scenario was between 53 and 54 of baseline in terms of final population final biomass dominant eigenvalue and annual maximum growth potential whereas the growth effect scenario was 87 88 of baseline in terms of final population and final biomass and 66 67 of baseline in terms of dominant eigenvalue and annual maximum growth potential therefore the growth effect scenario demonstrates a non uniform response in the annual size structured metrics these relative impacts through different chemical effect mechanisms are important to understand when prioritizing data collection and deciding on which mechanisms to include when characterizing potential risks from chemical exposure both of the nonchemical stressor scenarios showed decreases from baseline across each of the annual metrics table 5 fig 10 however even with these shifts from baseline the dominant eigenvalues and annual maximum growth potentials were above 1 for each scenario plots of the daily dynamics show that the over winter scenario immediately caused large deviations from the baseline and other scenarios in terms of mean size and total biomass figs 7 8 for mean size this deviation shows that the no growth assumption effect is stronger than the size dependent mortality effect since the mortality effect is differentially removing small individuals which would shift the population to a larger average size while the no growth effect is keeping individuals from growing larger the strength of these different influences is important to understand especially in the context of chemical stress response and the exposure timing relative to the modeled winter dynamics the strength of the density dependent growth mechanism is strongest when biomass is greatest so its most noticeable deviation from baseline appears towards the end of the reproductive season fig 7 the over winter and density dependent growth effect scenarios created the largest deviations from baseline for the final mean size metric with the density dependent growth effect scenario demonstrating the largest deviations at 96 percent of baseline figs 10 8 the simulation results provided insights that are both biologically and toxicologically relevant the overall effect of stressors is captured most easily through annual endpoints however the daily tracked measures of number of individuals size distributions and biomass provide the detail necessary to interpret changes these daily measures are especially important to consider when using chemical exposures profiles that fluctuate daily 4 2 the effect of simulation start date and cyclic reordering of daily transition kernels the inclusion of winter and other seasonal effects such as seasonal reproduction provides motivation to discuss the impact of the date a simulated year begins for example in the winter scenario if the simulation begins on jan 1st as it does in the examples presented the stable size distribution for the year will be different than if the annual cycle begins on the first day of spring or the first day of reproduction however as we show below the dominant eigenvalue for different simulation start dates will be identical in any of the density independent scenarios thus far we have mostly discussed the annual transition kernel which in all the density independent scenarios is the matrix product of the discretized daily transition kernels let k i be the discretized transition kernel for the i t h ordinal day of the year and let λ and v be the dominant eigenvalue eigenvector pair for the annual transition kernel starting on jan 1st then k 1 k 2 k 365 v λ v if the starting date is reordered such that the simulation begins on dec 31st then k 365 k 1 k 2 k 364 k 365 v λ k 365 v and now the k 365 v is the new eigenvector for the same eigenvalue λ with the year starting on dec 31st this process can be generalized by left multiplying by the product j i 365 k j for any i 1 365 to begin the year on the i t h ordinal day and the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue λ is then j i 365 k j v this demonstrates that a cyclic reordering of daily transition matrices such as what takes place when alternate starting dates are chosen does not change the dominant eigenvalue greene 2014 however as shown it does change the eigenvector and thus the stable size distribution associated with it as we have seen in the simulations this change in asymptotic size structure is environmentally relevant as different size selective pressures are encountered by populations thus an understanding of the effect of simulation timing on results is important for appropriate interpretation of modeled outputs 4 3 ecotoxicological data availability and future model development 4 3 1 baseline growth reproduction and survival relationships the life history parameters used for the fathead minnow were gathered from a combination of available literature and laboratory experiments this model development proceeded in parallel with experimental support for parameterization for growth and chemical effects appendix a and kadlec et al in review due to this synergistic effort many model parameters were able to be directly measured and validated one result of this was high confidence in the growth transition kernel components however the vonbertalanffy growth function used for mean size transitions is common for fish growth modeling and can be parameterized similar to other ipm approaches white et al 2016 erickson et al 2017 using available literature and through online databases such as fishbase org froese and pauly 2019 the size dependent reproductive function was derived from laboratory data but could alternatively be constructed using mean fecundity estimates and reproductive size thresholds such as juvenile to adult transition size estimates size dependent survival of fathead minnow represented by the logistic function eq 7 was parameterized based on average lifespan size at juvenile to adult transition and the field estimated probability to survive from hatch to adult size specific laboratory or field individual level data to validate the parameterization of our size dependent survival functions was not available given the role that the survival function plays in dynamics experimentation or field observations of survival across a spectrum of sizes would be desirable to further refine this aspect of the model 4 3 2 data to support density dependent mechanisms density dependence can be a significant factor influencing how a population responds to a toxicant resulting in potentially additive compensatory or synergist interactions with chemical stressors raimondo 2013 we developed density dependent growth mechanisms and included them in this ipm model eq 13 techniques to include density dependent survival effects in the transition kernel have been established for ipms eager et al 2014 and inclusion of density dependence survival feedback is anticipated as development of the model continues an ongoing challenge for refinement of density dependent effects is lack of empirical population level observations from which to base parameters estimates however given the large population growth potential of many aquatic species including density dependent mechanisms in the transition kernel will be especially important if the application calls for estimation of the population over longer time periods 4 3 3 timing of chemical exposure and size dependent acute effects the timing of chemical exposure can also play an important role in determining the magnitude of impacts of chemical exposures on fish populations for example when considering only survival effects if newly hatched offspring are more sensitive to chemical exposure than adult fish one would expect chemical exposure during and directly following the reproductive season to have a larger impact than exposure just prior to reproduction the ability of our model to differentiate between timed exposure events is tied to the model s inclusion of size dependent survival the acute survival effects incorporated as daily survival decrements eq 17 are size independent these could be refined to include size dependence through either a re parameterization of the kernel functions during exposure or more simply by the survival decrements themselves through biologically appropriate transformation as a simple example some toxicity studies report information about juvenile vs adult sensitivity in terms of multiplication factors mayes et al 1983 these could be used directly with a juvenile adult size threshold transformation of the survival decrements refining the size dependent nature of the acute effects of chemical exposure should not only improve mortality predictions in general but also the ability of the model to discriminate between scenarios with differently timed exposures 4 3 4 incorporating chemical exposure and effect models of the toxicity data used in our model development the time course of survival data that was used to parameterize guts model is likely to be the least available however van den berg et al 2020 note that collection of these values is obligatory under some standard toxicity testing protocols and while not always included in published sources may become more available as public accessibility of underlying data become standardized in the case where these types of data sets are not available such as for emerging chemicals or for untested species users of this model may look to cross species and cross chemical extrapolation techniques gini and zanoli 2020 gergs et al 2019 escher and hermens 2002 the data to parameterize the chemical growth effect model is available as a component of fish early life stage tests usepa 2016 the pwc and other exposure models have their own data parameterization needs but benefit from current use in ecological risk assessment workflows thus the type of exposure model outputs used here should be accessible although there may be some challenges to collecting the ecotoxicological data needed to parameterize these models the mechanisms included have been chosen to help keep data needs feasible for ecological risk assessors without novel experimentation 4 3 5 model validation in ecotoxicological modeling observations of population level chemical exposures are exceedingly rare since we often do not have access or the motivation to conduct field level experiments that include exposures to wildlife populations especially when risk assessment studies focus on threatened or endangered species therefore validation often consists of checks on internal consistency and individual model components and not necessarily on their emergent results when possible our modeled mechanisms were compared against available lab and or field measures and produced feasible values for reproductive output survival estimates and growth trajectories 4 3 6 data and theory driven model construction ipm developers have established data driven techniques for kernel function construction using various statistical approaches to determine relationships e g merow et al 2014 however when appropriate theoretically motivated continuous functions to model growth reproduction or survival as a function of size are included seamlessly in an ipm framework e g vonbertalanffy growth in this model eq 5 however when data is not available to parameterize continuous responses simpler threshold and step functions can be included just as easily e g onset of reproductive maturation eq 8 eq 9 in both cases inclusion of these functions occurs without the need for a priori discretization such as would be required in matrix projection modeling while others discuss the advantages to ipm development over other structured modeling formalisms such as matrix projection models ellner et al 2016 rees and ellner 2009 easterling et al 2000 the flexibility to use either top down theoretical kernel function derivation bottom up data driven regression based specification or a combination of both demonstrates another promising aspect of the flexibility of the ipm approach for ecotoxicological applications where data availability can vary greatly by the system being studied and mechanisms target for included 5 conclusion the importance of size in the ecotoxicological context the concordance of the size structured ipm approach with available ecotoxicological data for chemical exposure and effect and ability of model outputs to inform relevant ecological risk assessment endpoints shows promise for the future development of ipms for ecotoxicological applications the mechanisms and methods introduced in this paper serve to expand the set of modeling approaches considered for use in ecotoxicology and this new set of structured modeling tools can be used to advance population level ecological risk assessment for the protection of wildlife
